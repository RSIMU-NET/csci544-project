to ensure that children of racial and ethnic minority groups are included in clinical studies for new drugs , the best pharmaceuticals for children act of 2002 ( bpca ) expanded the pediatric exclusivity provision to require , among other things , that fda “take into account adequate representation” of children from racial and ethnic minority groups when negotiating written protocols with the study sponsors of pediatric drugs . as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we addressed the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent are children of racial and ethnic minority groups represented in clinical studies for drugs granted exclusive marketing rights , ( 2 ) are drugs that are used to treat diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups being studied for safety and effectiveness in children under the pediatric exclusivity provision , and ( 3 ) does fda have appropriate management systems to monitor the representation of children of racial and ethnic groups in studies submitted for additional exclusive marketing rights ? . to evaluate fda's monitoring of data on demographic traits , such as race , in drug studies , we reviewed relevant documents and interviewed fda officials . if fda officials believe that studying a drug may produce health benefits for children , fda issues a formal written request to the drug sponsor that includes , among other things , the type of studies to be conducted , the study design and goals , and the formulations and age groups to be studied . however , for hypertension drugs where differences in racial response have been documented in adult drug studies , fda required , and drug sponsors included , larger numbers of children from specific racial and ethnic groups . compared with their proportions in the u.s. population , smaller proportions of african american , hispanic , and asian children were included in clinical studies for the drugs that were granted 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights by fda from january 4 , 2002 , through march 6 , 2003 . in 11 of the 22 requests , fda directed drug sponsors to report the representation of pediatric patients of ethnic and racial minority groups when submitting final study results , but did not request that sponsors include a particular proportion of minority children or analyze the effects of race and ethnicity . fda does not have a system in place to serve as a single source of data to allow the agency to efficiently determine the extent of minority enrollment in drug studies under the pediatric exclusivity provision . further , we found that some study reports submitted to fda from drug sponsors did not specify the race and ethnicity of study participants . eighty - six percent of study participants were identified by race or ethnicity . to help the agency more efficiently monitor the participation of children of racial and ethnic groups in studies for additional exclusive marketing rights , we recommend that the commissioner of fda specify in written requests that study sponsors must use the racial and ethnic categories described in fda's january 2003 draft guidance to identify study participants in their reports to the agency . further , fda has previously used the methodology we employed in its analyses of adult study participants . second , fda was concerned about what it regards as the implications of our finding that the proportions of minority children in pediatric studies requested by fda before the passage of bpca were less than their proportions in the general population . to determine whether drugs used to treat conditions or diseases disproportionately affecting minorities are being studied under the pediatric exclusivity provision , we obtained data on the prevalence of selected diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect minorities and examined the list of drugs for which fda has either granted exclusive marketing rights or issued study requests from january 4 , 2002 , through march 6 , 2003 , to determine if any of these drugs may be used to treat these diseases or conditions .
