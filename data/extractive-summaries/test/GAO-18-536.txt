the fast act included provisions for us to assess , among other things , the extent to which the streamlining provisions in the three most recent transportation reauthorization acts have improved and accelerated the environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . we reviewed agency policies and procedures on ensuring accurate and reliable data and compared them with federal standards for internal controls . in addition , the clean water act and the endangered species act are two key substantive federal environmental protection laws that may be triggered by a proposed transportation project and that may require the federal resource agencies to issue permit decisions or perform consultations before a project can proceed . we identified 18 statutory provisions from these acts that could potentially affect time frames for the environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . further , limitations in fws and nmfs data , such as missing or incorrect data and inconsistent data entry , could impair the agencies' ability to determine whether the agencies are meeting statutory and regulatory requirements , such as the extent to which the agencies complete formal consultations and provide biological opinions within 135 days . fws and nmfs have limited controls that would help ensure the completeness and accuracy of their data . we found that 23 of those state dots reported that it had sped up project delivery within their states . although selected federal resource agency and state dot officials were able to identify actions called for by the provisions that they believe have helped streamline the consulting and permitting processes , officials from all three resource agencies said that their agencies had not analyzed the impact of the streamlining provisions on permit review or consultation time frames and did not have plans to do so in future . second , the resource agencies could not provide enough reliable data for us to analyze changes in consultation and permit review durations over time . fws and nmfs will also have to ensure that their data systems can provide reliable data to comply with an executive order requiring federal agencies to track major infrastructure projects , including the time required to complete the processing of environmental reviews . officials at 19 of the 23 federal resource agency field offices and state dots we spoke with generally mentioned two additional actions , beyond the 18 provisions we identified , for streamlining the consultation and permitting process: field office assistance to lead federal agencies and project sponsors , including state dots , to improve applications for permits and consultations ; and electronic systems for environmental screening and document submission . the federal government has enacted a number of statutory provisions aimed at streamlining the environmental review process for highway and transit projects . however , while corps , fws , and nmfs officials believe that these provisions have helped streamline their permit reviews and consultations , the lack of data hinders quantification of any trends in the duration of those reviews .  ( recommendation 1 ) we are making the following recommendation to the national marine fisheries service: the assistant administrator for fisheries should direct the national marine fisheries service to develop plans and time frames for improving its new consultation tracking system and develop appropriate internal controls , such as electronic safeguards and other data - entry procedures , to ensure accurate data on the time taken for consultations . we provided a draft of the report to the departments of transportation , defense , commerce , and interior and the council on environmental quality . our work focused on federal - aid highway and transit projects and the provisions included in the past three surface - transportation reauthorizations that are intended to streamline the environmental consulting and permitting processes performed by the three federal resource agencies: fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) , and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) . to examine the actions used by resource agencies to streamline consulting and permitting reviews , we interviewed officials in seven fws field offices , seven corps district offices , two nmfs regional offices , three transit agencies , and seven state departments of transportation ( state dots ) to discuss leading practices and additional opportunities for streamlining the consulting and permitting processes , as well as the use of the respective agency data systems . ยง 139 ( e ) ( 5 ) ) alternatives analysis: requires the lead agency to determine the range of alternatives for consideration in any document that the lead agency is responsible for preparing for a project , and requires that those alternatives should be used to the extent possible in all reviews and permit processes required for the project , unless the alternatives must be modified to address significant new information or circumstances or for the lead agency or a participating agency to fulfill the agency's responsibilities under nepa in a timely manner .
