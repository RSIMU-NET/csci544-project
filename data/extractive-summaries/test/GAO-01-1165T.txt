a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation . billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system . although it is not fully known at this time what actually occurred or which of the weaknesses in the nation's aviation security apparatus contributed to the horrendous events of last week , it is clear that serious weaknesses exist in our aviation security system and that their impact can be far more devastating than previously imagined . our testimony is based on our prior work and a review that we have underway for this subcommittee and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) airport access controls , ( 2 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , and ( 3 ) alternatives to current screening practices , including practices in selected other countries . controls for limiting access to secure areas , including aircraft , have not always worked as intended . as we reported in may 2000 , our special agents used counterfeit law enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas at two airports , bypassing security checkpoints and walking unescorted to aircraft departure gates . as we reported in june 2000 , testing of screeners shows that significant , long - standing weaknesses — measured by the screeners' abilities to detect threat objects located on passengers or contained in their carry - on luggage — continue to exist . more recent results have shown that as testing gets more realistic — that is , as tests more closely approximate how a terrorist might attempt to penetrate a checkpoint — screeners' performance declines significantly . in assessing alternatives , respondents identified 5 important criteria: improving screening performance , establishing accountability , ensuring cooperation among stakeholders , moving people efficiently , and minimizing legal and liability issues . we identified four principal alternative approaches to screening .
