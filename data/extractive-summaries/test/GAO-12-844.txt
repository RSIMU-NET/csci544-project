farmers and other agricultural producers are exposed to natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes , and tornadoes . however , after past natural disasters , some stakeholders , including certain industry groups and others , raised concerns that some small agricultural producers , including aquaculture and nursery producers , have been found ineligible for both agencies' disaster assistance programs . in this report , our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine fsa and sba disaster assistance programs and the coverage they provide small producers ; ( 2 ) identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers' participation in disaster assistance programs from fsa and sba ; and ( 3 ) examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers . to address these objectives , we reviewed the 10 fsa and sba disaster assistance programs we identified for agricultural producers and businesses that support agriculture that become available following a natural disaster and that provide direct financial assistance in cash payments , reimbursements , or loans to agricultural producers and businesses that support agriculture that have experienced natural disasters . third , some producers applied but did not qualify because they did not meet certain program requirements . as a result , aquaculture and nursery producers may not be aware they could be eligible for sba disaster assistance . these documents can clarify which agencies will be responsible for particular activities and how they will organize their joint and individual efforts . as we reported in october 2005 , agencies that have complementary programs can enhance the value of these programs through interagency collaboration . fsa's and sba's 10 disaster assistance programs serve largely different populations but can provide an important safety net to help small agricultural producers recover from disasters . without a more formal collaborative approach between the agencies such as through a memorandum of understanding and further education of staff about the other agency's disaster assistance programs , applicants for disaster assistance may not be consistently referred by one agency to the other , leading to fewer opportunities for these small producers to get assistance for which they otherwise might qualify . to help ensure that small aquaculture and nursery producers are aware of the disaster assistance programs available to them , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture and the administrator of the small business administration direct fsa and sba officials to take the following two actions: conduct targeted outreach to small aquaculture and nursery producers , for example , by building on existing agency outreach programs . our objectives for this engagement were to ( 1 ) examine selected u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) and small business administration ( sba ) disaster assistance programs and the types of small agricultural producers that they cover ; ( 2 ) identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers' participation in disaster assistance from fsa and sba ; and ( 3 ) examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers .
