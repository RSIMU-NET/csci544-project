the department of defense ( dod ) relies on professional military education ( pme ) and joint professional military education ( jpme ) to prepare its military personnel , throughout their careers , for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service . however , according to dod's summary of the 2018 national defense strategy , pme “has stagnated , focused more on the accomplishment of mandatory credit at the expense of lethality and ingenuity.” the conference report accompanying the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 included a provision for us to evaluate dod pme and jpme programs . in this report , we assess the extent to which ( 1 ) the military services' pme programs have met civilian and jpme accreditation requirements , ( 2 ) the office of the secretary of defense has assessed the effectiveness of the military services' pme programs , and ( 3 ) the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) has monitored the military services' pme program budgets . officials from all of the military service pme programs told us that students interacting with students from other military departments is critical for joint acculturation . other than joint staff officials requesting that the navy meet the opmep's jpme seminar student mix requirement , no other actions have been taken by the chairman , osd , or the navy to resolve the issue concerning navy participation in the air force's and army's intermediate - level pme programs . dod's financial management regulation states that performance measurement is a means of evaluating efficiency , effectiveness , and results , and that a balanced performance measurement scorecard includes nonfinancial and financial measures focusing on quality , cycle time , and cost . while all the military services' intermediate - and senior - level pme programs have met or partially met the accreditation requirements established by civilian accreditation bodies and the chairman to award master's degrees and jpme credit , respectively , not all service programs have met the seminar student mix requirement . however , ousd ( p&r ) 's ability to assess the effectiveness of the military services' pme programs is limited by the absence of a department - wide mission statement that explains the purpose and goals of pme that aligns with the proposed performance measures in the draft instruction ; the absence of a requirement for the military services to track program costs as a performance measure ; and the absence of a requirement for the military services to report data on their pme and jpme programs — such as their annual reviews of pme programs . although the military services are required to submit separate budget request data exhibits for most pme institutions , the financial management regulation does not require the marine corps to submit an annual budget request data exhibit for its senior - level pme program . requiring the marine corps to report budget request data on its senior - level pme program annually , and specifying how to account for costs in the exhibits would enhance the usd ( comptroller ) 's ability to monitor the military services' pme programs and also enhance congress's ability to identify trends among these programs .
