this report presents the results of our survey of the background and training of key financial management personnel at 34 of the largest private corporations and 19 of the largest state governments in the united states . we asked surveyed organizations for information on the education , work experience , training , and professional certifications of their key financial management personnel — chief financial officers ( cfo ) , controllers , and managers and supervisors — working in financial reporting , financial analysis , and accounting operations positions . the survey instrument was also pretested at one fortune 100 company and two state governments . responses were received from 34 fortune 100 companies and from 19 of the 25 largest state governments . in the fortune 100 companies , more than 90 percent of financial management personnel held undergraduate degrees , with about 75 percent holding either accounting or other business degrees . in the fortune 100 companies , the majority of advanced degrees held were mbas . in addition , cfos , controllers , and managers and supervisors of financial analysis were more likely to hold advanced degrees other than mbas or master's degrees in accounting . on average , less than 3 percent of state government respondents required advanced degrees — either mbas or other master's degrees — for these positions . financial management personnel in the fortune 100 companies responding to the survey had , on average , about 14 years of total experience in corporate accounting , public accounting , internal auditing , or accounting systems design and maintenance . the state governments' cfos and controllers averaged 20 and 21 years of work experience , respectively , in these areas . this total experience included an average of 4 years combined experience in public accounting , internal auditing , or systems design and maintenance , fields which often provide exposure to a broad base of accounting issues throughout an organization . about 70 percent of fortune 100 respondents set aside between 1 and 2 percent of their budget for financial management salaries and benefits for training financial management personnel . state government financial management personnel completed , on average , about 31 hours of training in 1996 . few state government respondents had any financial management training requirements . among fortune 100 respondents , the cpa was the most commonly held professional certification . two types of certifications were common among state government financial managers — cpa and certified government financial manager ( cgfm ) . consequently , the experiences of the nonfederal organizations in our review may provide important lessons learned for future federal efforts to improve the qualifications and professionalism of its financial management workforce in response to the challenge of moving from a strict accounting role to that of a “business partner.” these lessons learned include upgrading requirements for hiring personnel and ensuring that personnel on board acquire the appropriate training needed to effectively carry out their evolving responsibilities .
