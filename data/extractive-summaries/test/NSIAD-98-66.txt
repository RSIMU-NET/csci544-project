as requested , we reviewed the contents of the final report , evaluated the impact on readiness of u.s. forces based on okinawa after implementation of the report recommendations , estimated the u.s. cost of implementing the recommendations , and determined the benefit or necessity of having u.s. marine corps forces on okinawa . u.s. forces - japan ( usfj ) has interpreted this latter provision to mean that the united states is not required to conduct environmental cleanup on bases it closes in japan . u.s. forces on okinawa support u.s. national security and national military strategies to promote peace and maintain stability in the region . these forces can also deter aggression and can deploy throughout the region if needed . furthermore , relocating u.s. forces outside of japan could adversely affect military operations by increasing transit times to areas where crises are occurring . japan agreed to implement one status of force agreement procedure change . the current estimated cost to the united states to implement the recommendations related to the return of land is about $193.5 million over about 10 years . this arrangement could reduce u.s. costs below the current estimate of $193.5 million . the united states has already implemented all three changes in training and operational procedures called for in the saco final report ( see table 3.2 ) . we recommend that the secretary of defense decide on the means to monitor the design , engineering , and construction of the sea - based facility ; work with japan to include a risk - reduction phase in the acquisition schedule to establish that the designed sea - based facility will be affordable and operationally suitable ; take steps to ensure that all u.s. concerns , especially the costs of operations and maintenance on the sea - based facility and operational concerns , have been satisfactorily addressed before japan begins to build the sea - based facility ; and request the japanese government to allocate funds for those projects at futenma that were cancelled by japan due to the planned closure of futenma and are deemed essential to continued operations of the station and the 1st marine air wing until completion of the replacement facility . if the united states agrees to this request , land return under the saco process could be affected . if a survey is conducted and contamination is found , a decision would be needed as to whether the united states or japan would pay the cost .
