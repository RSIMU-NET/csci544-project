american based companies reported earning $938 billion in profits overseas in 2008 ( most recent data ) . first , american companies can use tax deferral and other techniques to avoid or delay taxes by moving profits out of high - tax countries ( or out of the u.s. ) and into low - tax countries with little corresponding change in business operations , a practice known as "profit shifting. . this report focuses on the profit shifting aspect of international business behavior in response to taxation . data on the activities of american based companies with overseas operations is analyzed to understand the degree to which , if any , profit shifting may be occurring . the analysis appears to show that american companies report earning profits in tax haven or tax preferred countries that , when compared to more traditional economies , appear to be disproportionate to hiring and capital investment in those countries . by all indicators examined in this report , profit shifting has generally trended upward overtime . the findings of this report are in agreement with a large body of economic research that has found evidence that american companies are shifting profits in an attempt to reduce their tax liabilities and that u.s. tax revenues suffer as a result . policymakers here at home have taken notice of possible profit shifting . for example , the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations held a hearing in september 2012 on the methods companies use to shift profits and possible options for curbing such behavior . profit shifting has also been the specific target of several bills that were introduced in the 112 th congress ( h.r . the first group consists of the five countries commonly identified as being "tax preferred" or "tax haven" countries , and includes bermuda , ireland , luxembourg , the netherlands , and switzerland . the second group , which provides a baseline for comparison , consists of the five more traditional economies . this group includes australia , canada , germany , mexico , and the united kingdom . the profits reported by foreign affiliates of u.s. mncs in the two country groups are presented and analyzed . the profits reported by american based companies in the two country groups are then compared with their real economic ( business ) presence in the country groups . two measures of the real economic presence of mncs are considered . to measure the size of the economies analyzed , the gross domestic product ( gdp ) for each country was obtained from the economist intelligence unit . majority - owned foreign affiliates accounted for 94% of affiliates in 2008 . in turn , domestic companies competing in foreign markets would face the same ( foreign ) tax rates as their competitors , possibly enhancing the competitiveness of u.s. firms in foreign markets relative to the current system . by reducing this discrepancy , the incentive to shift profits would be reduced as well . for example , if a u.s. company had 60% of its employees located domestically and 40% in canada , and earned $100 million between the two countries , the u.s. would have the right to tax $60 million of that income , and canada would have the right to tax $40 million .
