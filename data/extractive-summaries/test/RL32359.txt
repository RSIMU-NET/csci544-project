within a decade , however , ctr took on the goal of reducing the threat of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) . now , however , many analysts support expanding cooperative threat reduction programs beyond russia to other geographic areas . in the fy2004 national defense authorization act ( p.l . 108-136 , sec . 1308 ) , congress authorized the bush administration to spend $50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union . as of september 2006 , the administration had spent $38.5 million in albania for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles . the report of the 9 / 11 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups . it describes potential recipients of such funding ( those states with wmd programs and terrorism problems ) ; the kinds of assistance that may be possible ; potential legal , political , and technical constraints on assistance ; and potential costs and benefits to the united states of providing such assistance . the report begins with a brief review of why ctr programs might be considered applicable to the threat of wmd terrorism and then takes a more detailed look at the threat of wmd terrorism . first , the nonproliferation regime has always focused on controlling ingredients at the source as the most effective first line of defense . an issue that could arise in the context of expanding ctr's scope is whether states with stocks of chemical weapons that are bound to destroy them by 2007 under the cwc ( india and one anonymous state ) will see this as an opportunity to have their obligations paid for by the united states . there may be political , technical , and legal constraints on u.s. assistance to some of the states mentioned above . in 1991 , the legislation that created the nunn - lugar program stipulated that u.s. assistance in destroying nuclear and other weapons may not be provided to the soviet union , any of its republics , or successor entities unless the president certifies to the congress that the proposed recipient is committed to: making a substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weapons ; forgo any military modernization that exceeds legitimate defense requirements or is designed to replace destroyed wmd ; forgo the use of fissile materials and other components from destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons ; facilitate u.s. verification of weapons destruction that uses u.s. money ; comply with all relevant arms control agreements ; and observe internationally recognized human rights , including the protection of minorities . in addition , pakistan has been subject to such restrictions .
