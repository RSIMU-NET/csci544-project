in a frequently cited report , the institute of medicine ( iom ) estimated in 1999 that preventable medical errors cause as many as 98,000 deaths a year among hospital patients in the united states . partially in response to the iom report , congress passed the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 ( the patient safety act ) to encourage health care providers to voluntarily report information on patient safety events and to facilitate the development and adoption of interventions and solutions to improve patient safety . these actions by ahrq are important to complete before the law's effectiveness can be evaluated . while officials of 13 of the 17 psos we interviewed indicated they provided some patient safety services prior to being listed , all 17 psos stated that the services they planned to make available included the collection and analysis of patient safety data , the de - identification of patient safety data for submission to the npsd , feedback , and patient safety training . furthermore , according to pso officials , only 3 of these psos had begun to receive patient safety data or provide feedback to providers . officials from some psos we interviewed indicated they needed the common formats to be finalized by ahrq before beginning to work with providers . ahrq is in the process of implementing the npsd and developing its associated components that are necessary before the npsd can receive patient safety data â€” ( 1 ) the common formats psos and providers will be required to use if submitting patient safety data to the npsd and ( 2 ) a method for making these data non - identifiable . ahrq officials could not provide a time frame for when they expect the npsd to be able to receive patient safety data from other providers . ahrq also has preliminary plans for how to allow the npsd to serve as an interactive resource for providers and psos and for how ahrq will analyze npsd data to help meet its reporting requirements under the patient safety act . if each of these components is completed on schedule , ahrq officials expect that the npsd could begin to receive patient safety data from hospitals by february 2011 . to help psos and providers meet this requirement , ahrq contracted with the iowa foundation for medical care ( ifmc ) to operate a pso privacy protection center ( ppc ) that will develop a method for making patient safety data non - identifiable and assist psos and providers by removing any identifiable patient or provider information from the data before submission to the npsd . however , ahrq has yet to develop plans for more detailed analyses of npsd data that could be useful for identifying strategies to reduce medical errors . because the agency for healthcare research and quality's ( ahrq ) efforts to list patient safety organizations and implement the network of patient safety databases are relatively new but some other patient safety reporting systems are already established , we identified examples of how selected established patient safety reporting systems encourage reporting of patient safety event information by providers and facilitate the development of improvements in patient safety .
