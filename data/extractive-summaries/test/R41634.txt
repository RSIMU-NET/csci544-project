as currently provided in house rule xxi , the house bars legislative provisions from being reported in general appropriations bills ; amendments to general appropriations bills containing language that would add to or alter existing law are also prohibited . limitations within appropriations measures are provisions that negatively restrict the amount , purpose , or availability of funds without changing existing law . the effect of these provisions is to limit the actions for which funds may be used through the capping or outright denial of funds for specific purposes . proper limitations are distinct from legislative provisions because they do not have the effect of either making new law or changing existing law . the distinction between legislative provisions and funding limitations has been developed and refined over time based on various rulings that establish what types of provisions are allowable . although these rules generally encourage the separation between policy and money decisions in the area of appropriations , the procedural approach of each chamber differs in three significant ways with respect to the consideration of limitations and the exclusion of legislative provisions . the first form places a total ban on the use of funds for a certain purpose by stipulating that none of the funds in the account or bill can be used for such purpose . this type of limitation has been allowed under house and senate rules , even when the funds have been authorized by law for that particular activity . the second form , sometimes referred to as a "not to exceed" limitation , provides that the use of funds is not to exceed a specific amount or percentage of total funds . although the rules of the house and senate encourage money and policy decisions to remain separate , proper limitations in appropriations measures can affect policy by stipulating for what purposes federal funds cannot be used or by placing a maximum limit on spending in certain areas . limitations have been previously allowed that prohibit funding for specific activities , a class of recipients , and earmarks . "not to exceed" limitations that establish funding ceilings for certain activities or total funding amounts have also previously been determined by the presiding officer to be in order , as have limitations that restrict the availability of funds for transfer . the precedents of the house and senate distinguish between the limitations and legislative provisions based upon both structure and substance . in addition , whether or not the recipient of the funds can be considered "federal" and , in the house , if the subject matter of the limitation involves taxes or tariffs , are also factors that can have an impact on its admissibility . when a point of order is raised against a limitation provision contained within an appropriations bill or amendment , the burden of proof is on its proponent to demonstrate that it is a valid limitation that does not effectively change agency discretion or impose new duties in order for it to be allowed . in the face of a point of order , the proponent of a limitation may also be called upon to provide evidence that the provision does not interfere with discretion guaranteed under existing law to the official or agency .
