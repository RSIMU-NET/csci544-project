some tax proposals have focused on broadening the tax base and lowering the rates of both individual and corporate income taxes . in other instances , they have proposed revenue increases . an example of a broad - based revenue - neutral income tax reform is h.r . 1 introduced in the 113 th congress by then ways and means chairma n dave camp . the bill proposed lowering both individual and corporate rates , while increasing the tax base through revising both business - related tax benefits ( such as accelerated depreciation ) and individual benefits ( such as itemized deductions ) . given the challenges of adopting a broad income tax reform , some proposals have focused on business - only tax reform . the obama administration has proposed such a reform , which would be revenue neutral and include cutting the corporate rate , reducing business - related tax expenditures , reducing taxes on manufacturing , simplifying taxes for small business , and reforming the international tax system . unlike income in regular corporations , which is subject to the corporate income tax rate , income in pass - through businesses passes through to the individual owners and is taxed at the individual income tax rate . the effects on pass - throughs of broadening the tax base most likely could not be offset by generally lowering individual tax rates because the vast majority of those individual rates apply to labor or passive income . the cost of lowering the individual rates on this labor or passive income would probably be prohibitive . as a result , a revenue - neutral tax reform composed solely of corporate rate reductions and base - broadening provisions would likely increase the tax burden on pass - through businesses in the absence of other revisions . the other business forms are called pass - throughs , because the income passes through to the individual owners and is taxed under the individual income tax ( although in the case of partnerships , c corporations can be partners and are subject to corporate tax ) . broadening the tax base could be achieved by eliminating various tax expenditures , such as exemptions , credits , or deductions . noncorporate business investors may also have passive assets in corporate stock that could benefit from a business tax reform . in sum , there are efficiency and administrative arguments to be made for allowing a business - only tax reform that does not reduce individual tax rates but uses base - broadening provisions associated with unincorporated businesses to finance corporate rate cuts . another approach is to target base - broadening provisions that are primarily corporate . other provisions might exhibit similar or more pronounced effects . a reform , however , could also implement corporate - only changes for provisions that affect pass - through businesses . the administration has proposed to expand some of the limits and requirements for eligibility for cash accounting for small business and this approach may be considered to compensate for the loss of tax benefits in a business - only tax reform . this deferral of tax on foreign source income is the single largest corporate tax expenditure . a reform confined to international changes would have negligible effects on pass - through businesses because almost all multinational business income is in the corporate sector . this estimate is based on the production activities deduction compared to business income reported in individual tax return .
