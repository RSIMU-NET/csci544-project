comprehensive refugee reform legislation , the refugee protection act of 2011 ( s. 1202 / h.r . 2185 ) , would make significant revisions to asylum policy . 2185 , the bill would eliminate the time limits on seeking asylum in cases of changed circumstances ; proscribe conditions under which an asylum seeker who was a victim of terrorist coercion would not be excluded as a terrorist ; provide alternatives to detention of asylum seekers ; modify certain elements necessary for the asylum seeker to meet the conditions for the granting of asylum ; and , allow aliens interdicted at sea the opportunity to have an asylum interview . for many years , most foreign nationals who sought asylum in the united states were from the western hemisphere , notably central america and the caribbean . from october 1981 through march 1991 , for example , salvadoran and nicaraguan asylum applicants totaled over 252,000 and made up half of all foreign nationals who applied for asylum with the ins . in fy1999 , the people's republic of china ( prc ) moved to the top of the source countries for affirmative asylum claims , with 4,209 new cases . simultaneously , the number of asylum seekers from the prc began rising and reached 10,522 affirmative cases in fy2002 . in the group identity instance , if the asylum seeker establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her home country of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion ; and establishes his or her own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons ; then the fear of persecution is deemed reasonable . some cite the seemingly inexplicable disparities in asylum approvals rates and urge broad - based administrative reforms . others argue that given the religious , ethnic , and political violence in various countries around the world , it has become more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors . some express concern that u.s. sympathies for the asylum seekers caught up in the current political uprisings in the middle east , northern africa , and south asia could inadvertently facilitate the entry of terrorists . others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people fleeing human rights violations or gender - based abuses that occur around the world . some assert that asylum has become an alternative pathway for immigration rather than humanitarian protection provided in extraordinary cases . at the crux of the issue is the extent to which an asylum policy forged during the cold war is adapting to the competing priorities and turbulence of the 21 st century . unlike other facets of u.s. immigration policy , asylum issues are less about the number of foreign nationals involved and more about the qualities of the policies and the efficacy of the procedures .
