federal tax policy has served to reduce this cost gap by providing various tax incentives for renewable energy . in february of 2009 , congress passed new legislation that provides renewable energy projects with an alternative option for realizing the value of federal tax benefits: a grant in lieu of tax credits ( section 1603 of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 ) ) . the section 1603 grant program was initially enacted on a temporary basis , and was scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 . understanding how different renewable energy markets have responded to the grant option may provide some insight regarding the potential implications for the renewable energy market of letting the section 1603 grant program expire as scheduled at the end of 2011 . the section 1603 grant program was established in response to weak tax - equity markets . since weak tax - equity markets were a motivating factor in adopting the section 1603 grant program in 2009 , understanding trends in tax - equity markets may help congress evaluate whether the policy motivations that led to the adoption of the section 1603 grant program under arra remain relevant . compared to direct tax incentives , however , the section 1603 grant program may be an improvement in terms of economic efficiency . as noted above , absent congressional action , the section 1603 grant program is scheduled to expire at the end of 2011 . arra modified the incentives available for renewable energy investments in two ways: ( 1 ) ptc - eligible property was given the option to claim the itc at the itc rate , and ( 2 ) all eligible energy properties were allowed to elect to receive a one - time cash grant in lieu of tax credits . the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . as of october 24 , 2011 , grant awards had been made to 3,801 recipients with a total grant award value of $9.2 billion . recipients that installed solar electricity projects have received the largest number of grant awards , while wind projects have captured most of the grant dollars ( see figure 1 ) . u.s. department of the treasury guidance for the section 1603 program states that "the section 1603 program will temporarily fill the gap created by the diminished investor demand for tax credits. . in order to better understand the mechanics and function of tax equity investors , the following is a brief overview and analysis of the tax equity marketplace to include an assessment of available tax equity to support development of renewable energy projects . 111-312 ) provided a one - year extension , allowing projects placed in service during 2011 as well as those under construction by the end of the year to qualify for the grant option . second , congress may want to consider the policy rationale going forward . alternatively , congress may choose to extend the grants . finally , there have been a number of benefits associated with the section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits that could be achieved through modifications to the existing ptc and itc . this report highlighted the benefit to the renewable energy sector of the section 1603 grant program , specifically the additional subsidy provided by the grant relative to previously available tax incentives . as also noted in this report , however , the added subsidy has added budgetary costs .
