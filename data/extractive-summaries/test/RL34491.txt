for this reason , the senate routinely chooses to set aside its standing rules by unanimous consent . under recent practice , these uc agreements sometimes include a provision imposing a 60-vote requirement for approval of amendments or legislation , instead of the simple majority vote ordinarily required in the senate . these amendments or measures are sometimes of a controversial nature with potential to be subjected to extended consideration or even a filibuster . by incorporating a 60-vote threshold , such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements associated with senate rule xxii , both for invoking cloture and for consideration under cloture . such uc agreements ensure that a measure will not be successful without the same level of super - majority support that would be required for cloture by stipulating that if the 60-vote threshold is not reached , the matter will be disposed of . unanimous consent agreements that impose a 60-vote threshold may be agreed to at any time , either in advance , or during consideration .
