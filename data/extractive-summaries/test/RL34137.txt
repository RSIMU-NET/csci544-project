this oil flow is now more directly under the control of the venezuelan government which may or may not allow the flow of crude oil to follow economic market forces . rankings of companies can be accomplished using a number of different criteria . if exploration and development expenditures are reduced because of problems encountered by some firms in accessing international capital markets , the relative scarcity of oil might increase , leading to higher future prices , as well as potentially restricted supply . on the surface , these rankings appear to show a decline in the importance of state - owned firms in the world oil market . table 2 shows the leading firms in terms of world - wide petroleum liquids reserves . these values suggest that the 10 largest reserve holding companies , largely state owned , will be major forces in the world oil market about seven times as long as the five major international oil companies . if there is opposition to u.s. foreign policy objectives , or if there is a more general negative reaction to the spread of global markets and private industry , nationalization of oil resources and transference to the national oil company is likely one of the most direct ways to make a political statement . a company's ability to produce crude oil depends on access to oil deposits , but it also depends on access to modern technology . gaining access to the best technology for exploration , development , and production is one of the key motivations oil producing nations have for entering production - sharing agreements with the private international oil companies . one final factor in the power of the national oil companies should be noted . however , it is likely that the objectives for many national oil companies , as well as the characteristics of their operations , differ from companies in the private sector of the oil industry . if the national oil companies hold the title to ever greater portions of actual and potential oil reserves , production , and exploration and development activities , and if they are relatively less capable of utilizing those resources , oil supplies are likely to be relatively constrained in the future . the private international oil companies are unlikely to be able to counter national oil companies to preserve their own profit - seeking interests as well as those of the u.s. market , which requires adequate physical supply at moderate prices . various policy directions are available to counter the effects of national oil companies , but the recognition that a potential problem exists , as well as a long - term commitment to any chosen policy direction , will likely be needed to minimize the threat to u.s. oil market stability and energy security . adnoc is the state - owned company of the united arab emigrates cnooc is a 71% state - owned company of china inoc is the state - owned company of iraq kpc is the state - owned company of kuwait libya noc is the state - owned company of libya nioc is the state - owned company of iran nnpc is the state - owned company of nigeria ongc is the 71.4% state - owned company of india pdvsa is the state - owned company of venezuela pemex is the state - owned company of mexico pertamina is the state - owned company of indonesia petrochina is the 90% state - owned company of china petronas is the state - owned company of malaysia qp is the state - owned company of qatar rosneft is the 75.16% state - owned company of russia saudi aramco is the state - owned company of saudi arabia sonatrach is the state - owned company of algeria statoil is the 70.9% state oil company of norwa .
