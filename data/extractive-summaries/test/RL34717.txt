the united states and the 27-member european union ( eu ) share a huge , dynamic , and mutually beneficial economic partnership . while the transatlantic market is today highly integrated due in large part to a massive amount of foreign direct investment by both u.s. and european companies in each other's markets , differences in regulatory approaches , standards , and philosophies militate against the development of an even tighter and more integrated marketplace . to deal with this situation , a variety of government - to - government efforts and transatlantic dialogues have been created to increase understanding between policymakers and regulators on both sides of the atlantic , to minimize existing regulatory barriers , and to prevent the emergence of new regulatory barriers . six tec meetings have been held since it was established in 2007 , the most recent in november 2011 in washington , dc . this report is intended to serve as an introduction and primer on a complicated , broad , and often highly technical set of issues . it is presented in seven parts: the first section describes the nature and scope of u.s. - eu regulatory barriers ; the second section explains the rationale for regulatory cooperation ; the third section highlights the differences in u.s. - eu regulatory approaches ; the fourth section examines the various forms of regulatory cooperation ; the fifth section evaluates the results of past initiatives at regulatory cooperation ; the sixth section analyzes the creation and operation of the transatlantic economic council ; and the last section highlights the role of congress in transatlantic regulatory cooperation . since the mid - 1990s , both u.s. and european multinational companies ( mncs ) have viewed divergent ways of regulating markets for both goods and services as the most serious barriers to transatlantic commerce . the case for non - cooperation or at least caution is also based on concerns that domestic health and safety standards may be compromised by a process that is driven substantially by business interests and stakeholders and could be affected by a "race to the bottom" regarding u.s. and eu standards . key differences bear on political cycles affecting regulation , public preferences and tolerance for risk , attitudes towards transparency , and institutional capacities to undertake regulatory reforms . until the regulatory structures themselves become more convergent or aligned , the major divergences in regulatory policies are unlikely to disappear . at one end of the spectrum , these activities may include simple discussions and sharing of information between regulators â€” most often on prospective regulations . at the other end of the spectrum , these activities may involve attempts at harmonizing regulatory approaches through acceptance of common principles and standards . in between are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusion into the autonomy of regulators . in short , the tec and the framework are designed to deal with some of the suggested shortcomings ( described above ) of previous transatlantic regulatory initiatives: lack of high level political leadership and not enough involvement of legislators and other stakeholders in the regulatory process . given that the two tec leaders are cabinet - level appointees , the tec was expected to have the kind of high - level political support that previous efforts at economic integration may have lacked . among the highlights of this tec meeting , the two sides agreed to develop a process to implement compatible approaches for the regulation of new and innovative sectors , with the hope of avoiding trade disputes due to different regulations . finally , the tec meeting launched an innovation action plan designed to strengthen joint efforts to promote innovation and the commercialization of emerging technologies . these examples highlight a larger and more pivotal role congress could play in regulatory cooperation if it chose to become more involved . as shown in appendix b , many different authorizing committees have primary jurisdiction over some of the main regulatory agencies involved in trc activities .
