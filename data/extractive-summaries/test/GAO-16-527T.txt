in recent years , the size , sophistication , and cost of dod's uas portfolio has grown considerably , as has the demand for trained uas pilots . in april 2014 and may 2015 , we reported on these other issues and made ten recommendations to dod to improve the air force's management of uas pilots , address army uas pilot training challenges , and enhance dod coordination of uas pilot training . i will focus my remarks today on dod's progress in ( 1 ) taking actions to strengthen the management of air force uas pilots , ( 2 ) addressing challenges the army faces to ensure that its uas pilots complete their required training and receive high - quality training , and ( 3 ) coordinating the training of uas pilots within dod . for those reports , we reviewed service guidance on training uas pilots and other relevant documents , examined nongeneralizeable training records of air force uas units , conducted nongeneralizeable focus groups at 6 installations with active duty uas pilots from a range of ranks , and interviewed dod and military services officials . the air force has made efforts to manage its uas pilots but has not fully addressed issues related to: identifying personnel requirements , recruiting and retention difficulties , the potential use of dod civilians as pilots , pilots completing their required training , moving pilots through the training pipeline , and analyzing pilot promotion rates . the air force has taken some actions in response to our recommendation , but air force officials told us that as of march 2016 , the air force has not updated its uas unit crew ratio . as a result , the air force risked personnel shortages and continued reliance on manned - aircraft pilots to fill its personnel requirements . in april 2014 , we found that the air force had not evaluated whether using alternative personnel populations such as enlisted or civilian personnel as uas pilots is a viable option to help it meet and sustain required uas pilot staffing levels . headquarters air force officials had stated that they had , at times , considered the use of enlisted or civilian personnel but had not initiated formal efforts to evaluate the potential use of alternative personnel populations as uas pilots . however , in may 2015 , we found that the air force had staffed its uas training squadrons at holloman air force base at 63 percent of their planned staffing levels due to shortages of uas pilots across the air force , which air force officials stated in turn impacted the air force's ability to produce new pilots . we recommended that the air force include the career field effect of being a uas pilot into its analysis to determine whether and how being a uas pilot is related to promotions and determine whether the factors identified in the analysis of line of the air force officers are also related to uas pilot promotions . as of january 2016 , the air force had not taken any steps to implement our recommendation and when we sought additional information in march 2016 , the air force did not respond in time for this statement . without including the career field effect in its analysis , the air force may not be targeting actions it is taking to raise uas pilots promotion rates at the appropriate factors , and information it has reported to congress may not be accurate . finally , the army did not respond to our request to provide updated information on these topics for this statement . to provide greater visibility over the extent to which army uas units have completed required training to leaders responsible for deployment decisions , we recommended that the army require unit status reports to include information on the readiness levels of uas pilots in uas units and the army concurred . while the steps that army has taken to date should address our recommendation , its efforts are ongoing and thus it is too early to know their impact . in order to increase the number of its instructors in response to an increase in the number of uas units , the army waived course prerequisites for about 40 percent of the uas pilots attending the course to become instructor pilots from the beginning of fiscal year 2013 through february 2015.these prerequisites — such as a minimum number of flight hours — are important because they help ensure that uas pilots volunteering to become instructors to help ensure that instructors are fully trained and ready to instruct uas pilots . to help ensure that army uas pilots receive the highest caliber of training , we recommended , in may 2015 , that the army take additional steps to mitigate potential risks posed by waiving course prerequisites for less experienced uas pilots attending the course to become instructors and the army concurred . in may 2015 , we found that dod actions were partially consistent with this principle .
