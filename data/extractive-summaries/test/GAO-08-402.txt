in this context you asked us to report on ( 1 ) the extent to which selected research and regulatory agencies conducted research in fiscal year 2006 that primarily was focused on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; ( 2 ) the reasonableness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to identify and prioritize federal research on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to coordinate their research . we compared the nni's identified priorities with those identified by the agencies to determine whether they were consistent . furthermore , we compared the nni's efforts to facilitate interagency collaboration with established practices that have been found to enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies . the nstc is an organization through which the president coordinates science and technology policies across the federal government . although the nni reported that federal agencies in fiscal year 2006 devoted $37.7 million — or about 3 percent of the total of all nanotechnology research funding — to research that primarily focused on studying the ehs risks of nanotechnology , we found that about 18 percent of the ehs research reported by the nni cannot actually be attributed to this purpose . in fiscal year 2008 , funding for both ehs - related research and nanoscale research in general is projected to grow . we found that the miscategorization of these 22 projects resulted largely from a reporting structure for nanotechnology research that does not easily allow agencies to recognize projects that use nanotechnology to improve the environment or enhance the detection of environmental contaminants , and from the limited guidance available to the agencies on how to consistently report ehs research . in addition to research reported to the nni as being primarily focused on the ehs risks of nanotechnology , some agencies conduct research that is not reflected in the ehs totals provided by the nni either because they are not considered federal research agencies or because the primary purpose of the research was not to study ehs risks . this type of information is needed to understand and measure nanomaterials to ensure safe handling and protection against potential health or environmental hazards . ongoing agency and nehi working group efforts to identify and prioritize needed research related to the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology appear reasonable but have not as yet resulted in a comprehensive research strategy to guide ehs research across agencies . we found that the ehs risk research undertaken in fiscal year 2006 addressed a range of ehs topics , was generally consistent with both agency - and nehi - identified research priorities , and focused on the priority needs within each category to varying degrees . in addition to the efforts of individual agencies , the nset subcommittee has engaged in an iterative prioritization process through its nehi working group , although this process is not yet complete . according to agency and nni officials , once this gap analysis is complete , nehi will formulate a long - term , overarching ehs research strategy . for example , 8 of the 11 projects in the instrumentation , metrology , and analytic methods category focused on the highest - priority need to “develop methods to detect nanomaterials in biological matrices , the environment , and the workplace.” in contrast , of the 25 projects related to nanomaterials and the environment , 3 addressed the highest - priority need in the category — ”understand the effects of engineered nanomaterials in individuals of a species and the applicability of testing schemes to measure effects” — and 11 addressed the fourth - ranked priority — ”determine factors affecting the environmental transport of nanomaterials.” moreover , although the nehi working group considered the five specific research priorities related to human health equally important , 19 of the 43 projects focused on a single priority — ”research to determine the mechanisms of interaction between nanomaterials and the body at the molecular , cellular , and tissular levels.” see table 3 for a summary of projects by agency and specific nehi research priority . however , such a strategy may not be consistent with historical approaches used to set federal research priorities and would be difficult to implement given how federal research currently is funded . finally , all agency officials we spoke with expressed satisfaction with their agency's participation in the nehi working group , specifically , the coordination and collaboration on ehs risk research and other activities that have occurred as a result of their participation .
