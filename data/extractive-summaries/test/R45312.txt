electricity generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the united states . the electric power grid in the united states comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems which bring power to end - use customers . the u.s. electric grid has historically operated with a high level of reliability ; however , the various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural , operational , or manmade events . ics networks control industrial processes in a number of energy and manufacturing operations . the potential for a similar attack on the u.s. grid was seen as a possibility . some recent reports about foreign hackers targeting the u.s. electric power system and other critical infrastructure are summarized below . while these intrusions have not been reported as having resulted in significant disruptions , concerns have increased over the potential for these intrusions to result in damaging cyber attacks in the future . congress gave the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk - power system under the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ; epact05 ) . ferc can approve or remand back reliability standards proposed by the electric reliability organization ( ero ) , which bulk - power system owners and operators must follow to help ensure the reliable operation of the grid . currently , the north american electric reliability corporation ( nerc ) serves as the ero . cyber attacks are unlikely to cause extended outages , but if well coordinated they could magnify the damage of a physical attack . the bulk power system faces new and evolving cybersecurity threats on a daily basis . cyber risks can come from direct attacks aimed at the electric grid or other critical infrastructure which could impact the operations or security of the grid . arguably , the greatest cyber threats to the grid have been attacks focused on manipulating industrial control systems which are increasingly connected to the internet to manage the production and regional flows of electricity . cybersecurity threats can arise from a number of sources , including deliberate cyber attacks by professional hackers , and acts of malice from discontented current or former employees . the bulk electric system is subject to mandatory and enforceable critical infrastructure protection rules for cyber and physical security under the ferc's reliability mandate . given that the grid relies on several of the other sectors ( for example , for water and fuel transportation ) , the question of whether these other sectors should also have similar , mandatory standards focused on support of the electric power sector may be an issue for congress to consider . the electric power system in the united states is evolving , but not consistently across sectors and regions of the country . while some may say such inconsistencies may add a level of complexity that may make a nationwide cyber event more unlikely , the consistent development of a modern electric power system would likely add to the prospects of u.s. economic health and competitiveness . policy options designed to ensure that the developing electric power system is as secure as possible will likely be a major consideration for congress . the bill would require the secretary of energy to carry out a program ( in concert the energy reliability organization , industry stakeholders , and other federal agencies ) to , among other activities , develop voluntary implementation of maturity models , self - assessments , and auditing methods to assess the physical and cybersecurity of electric utilities ; provide training for electric utilities to address and mitigate supply chain risks ; increase opportunities for sharing best practices ; assist with cybersecurity training for electric utilities ; and advance the cybersecurity of third - party vendors that work in partnerships with electric utilities .
