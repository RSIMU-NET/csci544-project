to describe what is known about factors affecting prices and selected stakeholders' views on actions the federal government could take to address pricing , we selected and interviewed 26 stakeholders , including representatives from: 8 air ambulance providers ( 3 large independent providers and 5 hospital - affiliated providers ) chosen to represent a range of business model types ( independent and hospital - affiliated ) , sizes , and known perspectives in the industry ; 2 associations representing air ambulance providers ; 6 groups familiar with air ambulance business and billing , such as industry analysts and consultants ; 4 states active in assessing air ambulance costs and prices charged ; 2 associations of state officials ; 2 associations representing health insurers ; and 2 groups involved with consumer policy or research . in 2014 , a transport priced at the same amount — about $30,000 — was the median , or 50th percentile , of all prices charged according to these data , while a transport of approximately $50,000 was at the 95th percentile . for example , according to medicare data , median payments per transport increased only slightly between 2010 and 2014 — from $6,267 in 2010 to $6,502 in 2014 . according to provider representatives , medicaid and self - pay payments are often lower than medicare payments . due to a lack of such information , it is unclear to what extent patients with private health insurance are billed by providers for the difference between the air ambulance price charged and the insurer's payment ( balance billing ) . representatives from six of the eight providers we spoke to said that they adjust prices charged to receive sufficient revenue from private health insurance to account for lower - reimbursed transports . for example , one large independent provider reported a 13 percent shift in transport mix from private insurance to medicare over a 10 year period , while a hospital - affiliated provider reported that since 2013 , the percentage of its transports covered by medicare has increased from 30 to 35 percent , while the percentage of privately insured patients has decreased from 39 to 33 percent . the nature of competition in the air ambulance industry may also be affected by the proportion of air ambulance helicopters operated by the three large independent providers , which is growing and may indicate increasing market concentration . stakeholders expressed mixed views on two of these actions — modifying the ada and raising medicare rates . none disagreed with the third action of increased data collection for the purposes of investigations — such as unfair or deceptive practices — or increased transparency regarding prices . an official from dot's enforcement office noted that dot has not exercised its discretionary authority to investigate air ambulance providers . in particular , dot officials questioned the value of consumer disclosure requirements for the air ambulance industry given that patients have little to no choice or ability to “shop.” however , a representative from a group involved with consumer policy or research noted that it is important that the public understands the price variation that exists among air ambulance providers , along with any potential limits of their insurance coverage . despite media reports of balance billing , dot officials note they have received very few air ambulance complaints since 2006 , possibly because consumers do not think of dot as a place to file such complaints . furthermore , dot lacks data needed to assess several key aspects of the industry , ranging from basic aspects — such as the composition of the industry by provider type , prices charged by provider , or number of overall air ambulance transports — to the more complex , such as the extent of contracting between providers and insurers or extent of balance billing to patients . likewise , without information on the industry and pricing , stakeholders such as hospital staff have limited ability to make air ambulance decisions , such as selecting a provider that best serves the patient's financial interests without compromising the medical benefits air ambulance transports provide . to increase transparency and obtain information to better inform decisions on whether to investigate potentially unfair or deceptive practices in the air ambulance industry , we recommend the secretary of transportation take the following four actions: communicate a method to receive air ambulance - related complaints , including those regarding balance billing , such as through a dedicated web page that contains instructions on how to submit air ambulance complaints and includes information on how dot uses the complaints . cms and dot provided technical comments which we incorporated as appropriate . as we note in the report , the federal standards for internal control state that management should identify information needed to achieve objectives and address risks . although collecting consumer complaints will help dot identify areas for further investigation , further information will help put complaints into the context of the larger industry . we also excluded any claims for transports with multiple patients or where an ambulance was dispatched but the patient died before being transported ; these types of transports are paid at reduced rates .
