since our last high - risk update in 2013 , solid , steady progress has been made in the vast majority of areas that remain on the list . since 1990 , more than one - third of the areas previously designated as high risk have been removed from the high risk list because sufficient progress was made in addressing the problems identified . this year , due to significant progress made , we narrowed the high - risk designation for two areas — protecting public health through enhanced oversight of medical products and dod contract management . we also designated two new high - risk areas this year — managing risks and improving va health care and improving the management of it acquisitions and operations . lasting solutions to these and the other 30 high - risk areas offer the potential to save billions of dollars , dramatically improve service to the american public , and strengthen public confidence and trust in the performance and accountability of our national government . our high risk update report and website provide details for each of these issues , describing the nature of the risks , what actions have been taken to address them , and what remains to be done to make further progress.the details in our report , along with successful implementation by agencies and continued oversight by congress , can form a solid foundation for progress to address risks and improve programs and operations . we have categorized our concerns about va's ability to ensure the timeliness , cost - effectiveness , quality , and safety of the health care the department provides into five broad areas: ( 1 ) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes , ( 2 ) inadequate oversight and accountability , ( 3 ) information technology challenges , ( 4 ) inadequate training for va staff , and ( 5 ) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . the recently enacted veterans access , choice , and accountability act included a number of provisions intended to help va address systemic weaknesses . it is critical for va leaders to act on the findings of this independent contractor and congressional commission , as well as on those of va's office of the inspector general , gao , and others , and to fully commit themselves to developing long - term solutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness , cost - effectiveness , quality , and safety of the va health care system . although the executive branch has undertaken numerous initiatives to better manage the more than $80 billion that is annually invested in information technology ( it ) , federal it investments too frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes . we have previously testified that the federal government has spent billions of dollars on failed it investments . as of january 2015 , about 23 percent of the 737 recommendations had been fully implemented . given current and emerging risks , we are expanding the enforcement of tax laws area to include irs's efforts to address tax refund fraud due to identity theft ( idt ) , which occurs when an identity thief files a fraudulent tax return using a legitimate taxpayer's identifying information and claims a refund . however , advances in technology which have dramatically enhanced the ability of both government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of personally identifiable information ( pii ) pose challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information . the number of reported security incidents involving pii at federal agencies has increased dramatically in recent years . capacity . action plan . demonstrated progress . partially met . not met . progress has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of congress and the leadership and staff in agencies and omb . of the 11 areas that have been on the high risk list since the 1990s , 7 have at least met or partially met all of the criteria for removal and 1 area — dod contract management — is 1 of the 2 areas that has made enough progress to remove subcategories of the high - risk area . we added this high - risk area in 1997 and expanded it this year to include protection of pii . until the white house and executive branch agencies implement the hundreds of recommendations that we and agency inspectors general have made to address cyber challenges , resolve identified deficiencies , and fully implement effective security programs and privacy practices , a broad array of federal assets and operations may remain at risk of fraud , misuse , and disruption , and the nation's most critical federal and private sector infrastructure systems will remain at increased risk of attack from adversaries . cms should require a surety bond for certain types of at - risk providers and suppliers ; publish a proposed rule for increased disclosures of prior actions taken against providers and suppliers enrolling or revalidating enrollment in medicare , such as whether the provider or supplier has been subject to a payment suspension from a federal health care program ; establish core elements of compliance programs for providers and improve automated edits that identify services billed in medically unlikely amounts ; develop performance measures for the zone program integrity contractors who explicitly link their work to the agency's medicare ffs program integrity performance measures and improper payment reduction goals ; reduce differences between contractor postpayment review requirements , when possible ; monitor the database used to track recovery auditors' activities to ensure that all postpayment review contractors are submitting required data and that the data the database contains are accurate and complete ; require medicare administrative contractors to share information about the underlying policies and savings related to their most effective edits ; and efficiently and cost - effectively identify , design , develop , and implement an information technology solution that addresses the removal of social security numbers from medicare beneficiaries' health insurance cards .
