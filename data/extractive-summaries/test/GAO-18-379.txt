these provisions required that the department of homeland security ( dhs ) provide assistance to support the rapid establishment of interoperable emergency communications in urban areas and other areas deemed to be consistently at a high level of risk from disasters ; and the establishment of regional emergency communications coordination working groups ( reccwg ) in each of the 10 federal emergency management agency ( fema ) regions . you asked us to evaluate how the implementation of the post - katrina act's provisions has affected disaster preparedness , response , and recovery in general . in this report , we examined: the challenges selected stakeholders have experienced related to emergency communications ; the emergency communications assistance — technical assistance and funding — provided by dhs and selected stakeholders' views on these efforts ; and the reccwgs established by the post - katrina act and their effect on emergency communications capabilities . we analyzed fema data on preparedness grant funding from fiscal years 2011 to 2016 . for each case study we reviewed documents about emergency communications in that urban area , such as reports about emergency events or articles identified in our literature search , and interviewed multiple stakeholders , including the relevant statewide interoperability coordinator and fema regional emergency communications coordinator , a city or county emergency manager , at least one first responder with knowledge of emergency communications , and other selected public safety officials . the long - term vision of the plan — which oec views as the nation's current strategic plan for emergency communications — is to enable the nation's emergency response community to communicate and share information across levels of government , jurisdictions , disciplines , and organizations for all threats and hazards , as needed and when authorized . the post - katrina act established the reccwgs and requires each group: to assess local emergency communications systems to meet goals of the national emergency communications plan , to ensure a coordination process for multijurisdictional and multi - agency emergency communications networks through the expanded use of mutual aid agreements for emergency - management and public - safety communications , and to coordinate support services and networks designed to address immediate needs in responding to disasters , acts of terrorism and other manmade disasters . these challenges included achieving the interoperability of communication systems , obtaining funding , ensuring ongoing training , and increasing the emphasis on communications during emergency response exercises . interoperability challenges can exist due to technical issues such as equipment's incompatibility . stakeholders in two of our case study locations , los angeles and boston , told us that first responders continue to need training after investments are made in new interoperable communications equipment , posing an ongoing need for training . five stakeholders we interviewed for our houston case study praised this training and said it was critical in preparing communications personnel to respond to hurricane harvey . dhs administers several grant programs to help address emergency communications challenges . some state and local stakeholders told us that dhs grants ( outlined in table 1 above ) have allowed them to build and enhance communications capabilities that their jurisdictions would otherwise lack funding to address . further , collaboration across these groups is limited . according to fema officials , they use this information to develop regional plans that help fema assist the regions more effectively during a disaster . for example , a member of the region i group , which includes new england , told us that prior to his group's formation , emergency communications stakeholders from different levels of government in that region did not meet . reccwgs have addressed or are working to address several policy concerns based on joint positions developed within their groups , according to the groups' annual reports , interviews with reccwg leaders , and fema officials . in this work , we identified key considerations for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms , such as ensuring that all relevant participants have been included . fema has taken some steps to encourage collaboration among reccwg leaders , but broader collaboration across regions remains limited . without ways for all members of the reccwgs , not just the groups' leaders , to collaborate across regions , members may be missing opportunities to share best practices and leverage the knowledge and experience of their counterparts throughout the nation . the reccwgs established by the post - katrina act have enhanced emergency communications within their regions . a concerted effort focusing on these groups' collaboration needs , while also considering fema's resource constraints , could help fema and regional stakeholders determine an appropriate mechanism for collaboration moving forward . the administrator of fema should work with reccwg members to reach consensus on and implement an ongoing mechanism to encourage nationwide collaboration across these groups , considering the costs of one or more suitable methods , such as a national - level working group that uses virtual or other means of coordination , as appropriate .
