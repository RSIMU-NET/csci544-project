to determine funding amounts , grant formulas have historically relied at least in part on data from the decennial census and related data â€” that is , data from surveys with designs that depend on the decennial census , or statistics derived from these data sources . in june 2009 , the census bureau reported that in fiscal year 2007 the federal government obligated over $446 billion through funding formulas that rely at least in part on census and related data . funding for federal assistance programs continues to increase . this report responds to your request that we determine ( 1 ) how much the federal government obligates to the largest federal assistance programs based on the decennial census and related data , and how the recovery act changed that amount ; and ( 2 ) what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas . per capita income is used to calculate medicaid's fmap . our analysis showed that each of the 10 largest federal assistance programs in fiscal year 2008 and 2009 relied at least in part on decennial census and related data to determine funding . for fiscal year 2008 , this totaled about $334.9 billion , representing about 73 percent of total federal assistance . for fiscal year 2009 , the estimated obligations of the 10 largest federal assistance programs totaled about $478.3 billion , representing about 84 percent of total federal assistance . this amount included about $122.7 billion funded by the recovery act and about $355.6 billion funded by other means . we found that factors related to the formula equation ( s ) and those that modify the amount that a state or local entity would otherwise receive under the formula could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas . all of the programs in our review included one or more grants with formulas containing variables other than total population . obviously , absent other factors , funding based on these formulas will be affected less by changes in population than those that rely solely on total population . the factors include the following: ( 1 ) hold harmless provisions and caps ; ( 2 ) small state minimums ; and ( 3 ) funding floors and ceilings . to answer our objectives , we identified 11 federal assistance programs representing the 10 largest programs in each of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 based on the dollar amounts obligated reported in the president's budget , issued in may 2009 , office of management and budget ( omb ) , analytical perspectives , budget of the united states government , fiscal year 2010 ( fiscal year 2010 budget ) , table 8-4 , summary of programs by agency , bureau , and program . to determine what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas , from our prior work related to formula grants ( see the list of related gao products at the end of this report ) and other research on formula grants , we first identified factors that illustrate the different ways that such factors could affect the amount of grant funding .
