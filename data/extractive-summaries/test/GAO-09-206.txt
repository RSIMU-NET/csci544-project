our report builds on our earlier testimony before your committee and addresses the following: ( 1 ) the age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which federal agencies are hiring and retaining older workers ; ( 2 ) the workforce challenges that federal agencies face , and the strategies they use to recruit and retain older workers to help meet these challenges ; and ( 3 ) the actions that the office of personnel management ( opm ) is taking to help agencies hire and retain an experienced skilled workforce in its role as the federal government's human capital manager . in 2007 , federal agencies hired almost 14,000 new workers aged 55 and older . however , the proportion of older workers varies widely across federal agencies . for example , although the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has a low proportion — 20 percent — of workers eligible to retire by 2012 , the proportion of workers eligible to retire now or by 2012 in its federal emergency management agency is currently about 33 percent , and agency projections indicate that about 58 percent of the senior executives in this agency will be eligible to retire by 2012 . although no data are available on the effects of specific retention strategies , most federal workers do not retire immediately upon being eligible , according to opm's data , and many stay in the federal workforce more than 5 years past their initial retirement eligibility da the more than 31,000 workers who became eligible to retire in 1997 , only about 20 percent retired within the first year and over 40 percent were stil in the federal workforce after 5 years . like other federal agencies , hud , ssa , and usaid have large proportions of employees nearing retirement . also , according to agency officials , all three agencies have relatively few staff at midlevel positions to help pass down institutional knowledge and skills to less experienced employees due to past budget cuts and hiring freezes . finally , they are all challenged in their efforts to attract qualified staff with specialized skills . to address their workforce challenges , hud , ssa , and usaid rely on older workers in different ways , sometimes through the use of selected governmentwide flexibilities that are attractive to all workers , including older workers . while all three agencies rely on older workers to pass down institutional knowledge and critical skills to less experienced staff , hud officials told us this is the primary way they actively involve older workers . agency officials told us that usaid tends to bring back its retirees as contractors to fill short - term job assignments and to help train and develop the agency's growing number of newly hired staff . state has developed two databases to match interested foreign service and civil service retirees with short - term or intermittent job assignments that require their skill sets or experiences . although opm has taken steps to address areas of concern , it could do more to disseminate information across the federal government on agency - developed promising practices to recruit and retain older workers to meet workforce needs . and , while opm has other methods available — such as its human capital and electronic government practices web sites — that could be used to efficiently package and broadly disseminate this information to a much larger and diversified audience , it currently has no plans to do so . our objectives were to describe the ( 1 ) age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which agencies hire and retain older workers ; ( 2 ) workforce challenges that federal agencies face and the strategies they use to recruit and retain older workers to help meet these challenges ; and ( 3 ) actions the office of personnel management ( opm ) , as the federal government's human capital manager , has taken to help agencies hire and retain an experienced , skilled workforce . to report on how agencies make use of governmentwide flexibilities , we conducted in - depth reviews of three agencies — the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the social security administration ( ssa ) , and the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) . through this work , we identified several agencies that have developed their own innovative approaches and met with officials from these agencies . karen a .
