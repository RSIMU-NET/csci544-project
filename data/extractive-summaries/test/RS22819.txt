this largest u.s. meat recall ever came after usda's food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) found that the facility did not always notify it about cattle that had become nonambulatory after they had been inspected , but before slaughter for food . usda promised to address the allegations . after a cow imported from canada was found to have bse in late 2003 , fsis issued a number of rules aimed at keeping bse - infected beef from entering the food supply , including a prohibition on the slaughter of any nonambulatory cattle , regardless of the reason , or of when they became disabled . the final rule was published in final form on march 18 , 2009 ( 74 federal register , pp . the rule , effective april 17 , 2009 , now specifically requires establishments to notify fsis inspectors when cattle become nonambulatory disabled after passing ante - mortem inspection ; all such cattle must be condemned and properly disposed of . the provision ( section 104 ) in the senate - passed version of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( h.r . 1 ) would have permanently prohibited the use of federal funds to pass through usda inspection any nonambulatory disabled cattle for use as human food , regardless of the reason or time the animal became nonambulatory . because cattle must pass usda inspection before they can be processed into human food , such a provision would remove the economic incentive to slaughter downers . another bill , s. 2770 , would have banned the slaughter of nonambulatory livestock for human food ; establish gradually increasing penalties for plants that do so or that fail to comply with the hmsa ; and require usda to publish , in final form , rules it proposed in 2006 to disclose the names of all retailers that received recalled meat or poultry .
