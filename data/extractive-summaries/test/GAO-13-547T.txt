since beginning operations in 2003 , dhs has become the third - largest federal department , with more than 224,000 employees and an annual budget of about $60 billion . over the past 10 years , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential . since 2003 , we have made approximately 1,800 recommendations to dhs across more than 1,300 reports and congressional testimonies designed to strengthen program management , performance - measurement efforts , and management processes , and enhance coordination and information sharing , among other things . dhs has implemented more than 60 percent of these recommendations and has actions under way to address others . since 2011 , we have identified 162 areas across the federal government where congress or executive branch agencies , including dhs , could take action to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication or achieve cost savings to address the rapidly building fiscal pressures facing our nation.we reported that fragmentation among government programs or activities can be a harbinger of potential overlap or duplication . reducing or eliminating fragmentation , overlap , or duplication could potentially save billions of tax dollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and effective services . we first designated this area as high - risk in 2003 because dhs had to consolidate 22 agencies — several with major management challenges — into one department . further , failure to effectively address dhs's management and mission risks could have serious consequences for u.s. national and economic security . my statement today is based on these reports and addresses ( 1 ) opportunities for dhs to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; save tax dollars ; and enhance revenue , and ( 2 ) opportunities for dhs to strengthen its management functions . first , we found that dhs does not have a department - wide policy defining research and development ( r&d ) or guidance directing how components are to report r&d activities . as a result , the department does not know its total annual investment in r&d , a fact that limits dhs's ability to oversee components' r&d efforts and align them with agency - wide r&d goals and priorities . however , we identified at least 6 components with r&d activities and an additional $255 million in r&d obligations in fiscal year 2011 by other dhs components that were not reported to omb in the budget process . concurrent with the release of our 2013 annual report , we updated our assessments of the progress that dhs has made in addressing the actions we suggested in our 2011 and 2012 annual reports.outlines the 2011-2012 dhs - related areas in which we identified table 1 fragmentation , overlap , or potential duplication , and highlights dhs's and congress's progress in addressing them . for example , to address the potential for overlap among three information - sharing mechanisms that dhs funds and uses to communicate security - related information with public transit agencies , in march 2011 , we suggested that dhs could identify and implement ways to more efficiently share security - related information by assessing the various mechanisms available to public transit agencies.we assessed this action as partially addressed because tsa has taken steps to streamline information sharing with public transit agencies , but the agency continues to maintain various mechanisms to share such information . of the 21 related actions we suggested that dhs or congress take in our march 2011 and february 2012 reports to either reduce the cost of government operations or enhance revenue collection , as of march 2013 , 3 ( about 14 percent ) have been addressed , 11 ( about 52 percent ) have been partially addressed , and 7 ( about 33 percent ) have not been addressed . the department has made considerable progress in transforming its original component agencies into a single cabinet - level department and positioning itself to achieve its full potential ; however , challenges remain for dhs to address across its range of missions . as a result , in february 2013 , we narrowed the scope of the high - risk area and changed the focus and name from implementing and transforming the department of homeland security to strengthening the department of homeland security management functions . of the 31 actions and outcomes gao identified as important to addressing this area , dhs has fully or mostly addressed 8 , partially addressed 16 , and initiated 7 . moving forward , dhs needs to , for example , validate required acquisition documents in a timely manner , and demonstrate measurable progress in meeting cost , schedule , and performance metrics for its major acquisition programs . however , the governance structure covers less than 20 percent ( about 16 of 80 ) of dhs's major it investments and 3 of its 13 portfolios , and the department has not yet finalized the policies and procedures associated with this structure . it also includes our assessment of the overall progress made in each of the areas and the progress made on each action that we identified in our 2011 and 2012 annual reports in which congress and dhs could take actions to reduce or eliminate fragmentation , overlap , and potential duplication or achieve other potential financial benefits .
