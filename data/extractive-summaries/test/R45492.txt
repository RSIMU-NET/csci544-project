the 116 th congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorizations and appropriations legislation related to water resource development , management , and protection . development pressures , droughts and floods , and concerns about changing hydrology fro m land - use change and climate change engender nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects . there is interest in new water resource infrastructure ( e.g. , storm surge gates , water storage ) and new kinds of projects ( e.g. , groundwater recharge projects , nature - based flood risk reduction ) . historically , reclamation constructed projects in the 17 arid states west of the mississippi river ; these projects were designed principally to provide reliable supplies of water for irrigation and some municipal and industrial uses . usace constructs projects nationwide that primarily seek to improve navigation , reduce flood damages , and restore aquatic ecosystems . in addition , congress authorizes and funds selected water resource science and monitoring activities at multiple federal agencies . this report first discusses some broad categories of water resource topics relevant to the 116 th congress â€” projects and activities of usace , western water and reclamation , indian water rights settlements , international waters shared with canada and mexico , and water resource science at usgs . the report next covers the following crosscutting topics: funding and financing aging and new water resource projects , changing from federal infrastructure projects to federal partnerships , protecting and restoring the environment , flood resilience and natural and nature - based infrastructure , and recharging groundwater . at times , congress uses supplemental appropriations bills to fund usace emergency activities . some usace - related issues that the 116 th congress may address include the following: funding and financing issues , such as the use of the harbor maintenance trust fund , investments in projects to deepen coastal harbors , usace budgeting priorities , and oversight of usace efforts to implement public - private partnerships and to develop alternative financing opportunities . given the scale of federal and nonfederal investments that would be needed to construct these usace projects and other projects in the current construction backlog , policymakers and project sponsors are exploring options for construction financing and contracting and for sharing costs and responsibilities among project sponsors and beneficiaries . over time , reclamation's historical focus on building new projects has shifted to new mission areas . alterations to operations , project deliveries , and allocations often have been controversial because of potential impacts on water rights , contractual obligations , and local economies . such issues may include , for example , the status of new and proposed water storage projects ; dam safety issues at existing federal reclamation projects ; and efforts to address the agency's aging infrastructure and transition projects to nonfederal ownership . in addition , congress may address drought mitigation assistance , planning , and preparedness through oversight hearings and legislation ( e.g. , energy and water development appropriations ) , especially if dry conditions persist or intensify in the colorado river basin and in other western states . other river basins generating regular congressional interest include the colorado river , columbia river , klamath river ( california and oregon ) , and rio grande river basins . some settlements also are controversial for their potential to affect existing water rights and allocations . the 116 th congress also may choose to engage in other environmental topics related to water resources , such as habitat restoration and aquatic species conservation in the sacramento and san joaquin rivers' delta , the reduction of harmful algal blooms associated with federal water resource projects , and opportunities for public - private partnerships for conservation and restoration of estuaries and rivers . numerous issues pertaining to these ecosystems have emerged . congress may look at the funding and performance of existing restoration efforts . the 116 th congress may consider responses to flood disasters , including improving flood resilience , which is the ability to adapt to , withstand , and rapidly recover from floods . approaches that mimic nature and are "nature - based" are used as part of flood management and risk reduction . interest in the nation's infrastructure and changes in environmental conditions ( e.g. , hydrologic conditions associated with a changing climate ) may prompt the 116 th congress to examine the implementation and funding of nature - based infrastructure , and protection of natural features that reduce flood risk . in the water resource area , legislative activity often is specific to the federal water resource management agencies or to water use by particular sectors , including energy , agriculture , navigation , recreation , and municipal and industrial use . most of the large dams and water diversion structures in the united states were built by , or with the assistance of , the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) or the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) . usace operates nationwide , and its activities are diverse .
