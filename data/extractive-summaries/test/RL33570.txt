because a current account deficit is a reflection of a concurrent net inflow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world , the accumulation of debt from a long succession of large annual deficits has caused the united states to move from being a small net creditor to the rest of the world to being a large net debtor . despite the huge increase in u.s. external debt , the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus . the size of this surplus has varied , hitting a low of $4 billion in 1998 and a high of $37 billion in 2003 , but over the past 25 years , the surplus has remained between $15 billion and $30 billion . the significance of this enduring surplus of investment income is that the united states , although a large net debtor , has been borrowing free of any economically meaningful debt service cost . the investment income balance is a tally of u.s. earnings on its foreign investments net of foreigners' earnings on their investments in the united states . a surplus in the investment income balance ( the u.s. earns more than it pays ) means that the united states , despite being a large net debtor on an accounting basis ( value of foreign liabilities exceeds value of foreign assets ) , is on an economic basis a net creditor . this would also suggest that the large trade deficits generating that debt could be much less onerous than typically portrayed . the tremendous size of prospective current account deficits will mean that if the united states is not now a net external debtor it soon will be . even ignoring the likely bias associated with the reporting of retained earnings to compute the investment income balance , the likely pace of debt accumulation by the united states in conjunction with a likely future of higher world interest rates , suggests that the current investment income surplus will soon turn to deficit . this would put the united states in the position of having to then incur net economic debt service costs on its large borrowings from abroad .
