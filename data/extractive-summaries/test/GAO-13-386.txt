the federal employees' compensation act ( feca ) program provides workers' compensation coverage to approximately 2.8 million federal and postal employees for work - related injuries and illnesses . in fiscal year 2012 , the feca program made more than $2.1 billion in wage - loss compensation payments to claimants . this report addresses the following question: what examples , if any , of improper payments , potential fraud , or overlapping benefits can be found in the feca program , what factors may contribute to these issues , and how , if at all , could labor address these factors ? . we identified 530 individuals who had received concurrent feca wage - loss compensation payments and wage payments of at least $5,000 for the 1-year period ( i.e. , july 2009 to june 2010 ) we then randomly selected up to seven claimants from each of the five states for an in - depth review , for a total of 32 cases . in addition , we conducted investigations of 3 of the 51 ( 19 ui and 32 qw ) individual cases . labor can use this form to adjust the amount of feca compensation . to help verify income levels , labor requests that feca claimants provide it with their consent to access their social security administration ( ssa ) earnings file ; however , claimants are not required to provide labor with their consent , and authorization to obtain such information is not required to receive compensation . we found examples of improper payments , overlapping benefits , and potential fraud in the feca program , which could be attributed , in part , to factors such as oversight and data - access issues . in addition , owcp does not have a process to access data needed to identify the extent that claimants are receiving overlapping feca and ui benefits and does not report feca claimant information to states , which increases the risk that feca claimants are receiving overlapping benefits improperly . performance measures . as part of this reform , owcp sought authority to match ssa wage data directly with feca files . of the 32 cases we reviewed , we found five instances where an individual's wec was not adjusted even though the individual earned substantially more ( at least 25 percent ) than what was originally calculated as their wec . while this situation is allowable under feca program requirements , it could be an indicator of potential waste in the feca program . earnings received from dissimilar private employment at the time of injury may not be used by labor when determining an injured employee's pay rate for compensation purposes , and earnings from that same employment cannot be considered in determining the employee's wec . four claimants who resided in states that require ui payments to be offset received more income from the combined ui and feca benefits than they would have received from their federal salary alone . as previously discussed , limited access to necessary information is a potential vulnerability . however , labor and the states must continually monitor these claimants to ensure that they continue to be entitled to these benefits and that the benefits are adjusted to account for changes in claimants' wage earnings and for overlapping state ui payments . while in certain circumstances receiving concurrent ui and feca benefits may be allowable , the cases we identified where claimants received concurrent ui and feca benefits without labor's knowledge could be an indicator of improper payments . congress should consider granting labor the additional authority it is seeking to access wage data to help verify claimants' reported income and help ensure the proper payment of benefits . labor agreed with the recommendation to assess the feasibility of developing a cost - effective mechanism to share feca compensation information with the states , such as reporting information to ndnh , to help identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping ui and feca payments . in addition , labor stated that one of our examples cited in our report — example 5 — should not be classified as an improper payment because feca program procedures allow a claimant to receive wages from two different employers and not have those wages affect the claimant's wec or ability to receive feca benefits .
