however , a number of recent high - profile police shootings and other law enforcement - related deaths have reignited the debate about how much force police should wield in a democratic society that values both law and order and the personal liberty of each of its citizens under law . these deaths , and others , have prompted a call for legal accountability against the officers involved in these killings , but also , more broadly , for systemic police reform on both the federal and state level . "black lives matter," a movement that sprung up in response to the treyvon martin shooting and other police - related deaths , has recently released an initiative called "campaign zero," which contains a set of policy proposals to limit police use of excessive force , including a call for a national standard governing the use of deadly force and better reporting requirements on instances of excessive force by law enforcement officers . proponents of reform have countered that federal intervention is warranted as state and local governments and police departments have not adequately held their officers legally accountable for the improper use of force . on the civil side is 42 u.s.c . section 242 , which makes it a federal crime to willfully deprive someone of his constitutional rights . section 14141 , which permits the department of justice ( doj ) to sue local police departments that engage in a "pattern or practice" of constitutional violations , including the use of excessive force . to provide legal context for this debate , this report will address three overarching questions: ( 1 ) Â what are the constitutional rules governing an officer's use of force ; ( 2 ) what role has congress played in providing a remedy for a violation of these rules ; and ( 3 ) what are the potential reforms to these rules and remedies ? . to provide legal remedies for the unconstitutional use of force by law enforcement officers , congress has primarily relied on three federal statutes: ( 1 ) a criminal offense for violations of constitutional rights , including excessive force ; ( 2 ) a civil cause of action for deprivation of such rights ; and ( 3 ) a statute authorizing the attorney general to bring civil suits for injunctive relief against police departments engaged in a "pattern or practice" of such unconstitutional use of force . in each of these statutes , congress relied on its power under the fourteenth amendment to "enforce , by appropriate legislation" certain constitutional safeguards including the right to be free from unreasonable seizures . the excessive use of force prevention act of 2015 ( h.r . 2052 ) would amend 18 u.s.c . 1101 ) would create a new federal crime for certain homicides committed by law enforcement officers . h.r . 1102 would provide that any state or local officer in a public agency that receives funding under the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant ( jag ) program who engages in conduct in the line of duty that would constitute murder or manslaughter if it were to occur in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states would be punished as provided for that offense under federal law . the national statistics on deadly force transparency act of 2015 would reduce a state or local government's jag funding by 10% if it fails to submit data concerning police use of excessive force , including data concerning the following: identifying characteristics of the person who was the target of the use of deadly force and the officer who used deadly forced ; time , date , and location of the use of deadly force ; alleged criminal activity of the person who was the target of deadly force ; nature of the deadly force used , including the use of a firearm ; explanation , if any , from the relevant law enforcement agency on why deadly force was used ; copy of deadly force guidelines in effect at the time deadly force was used ; and description of any non - lethal efforts employed to apprehend or subdue the person who was the target of the use of deadly force before deadly force was used . in addition to introduced legislation , academics , civil rights advocates , and others have suggested other reform proposals: lower the mens rea standard in 18 u.s.c . section 242 ; create a standalone excessive force statute ; alter the "deliberate indifference" standard for failure to train claims under section 1983 ; and a mend 42 u.s.c .
