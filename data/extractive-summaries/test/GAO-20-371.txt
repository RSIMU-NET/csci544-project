in this report , we refer to restructure or realignment collectively as “restructure.” in february 2020 , dod submitted the section 703 ( d ) implementation plan to congress , which included actions to restructure 50 mtfs by decreasing capabilities at 43 them , closing another five facilities , and increasing capabilities at two sites . regarding dod's assessments of mtf cost - effectiveness , we reviewed dod's workpapers and interviewed officials about the calculations and source data they used . we discuss these concerns later in the report . dod concurred but had not implemented them as of may 2020 . the dod 703 work group's methodology for determining mtf restructuring actions was thoroughly documented and prioritized cross - cutting statutory elements , including support for military readiness , adequate nearby civilian health care , and cost - effectiveness . the 703 work group based its mtf evaluation determinations on , by order of priority , the ( 1 ) support each mtf provides to servicemembers' medical readiness and the readiness of military medical providers , ( 2 ) adequacy of civilian health care facilities and providers to support the health care needs of servicemembers and other beneficiaries through purchased care near where each mtf is located , and ( 3 ) the cost - effectiveness of direct care services at the mtf relative to purchased care in the area . adequacy of nearby civilian health care . a secondary criterion the 703 work group applied in its methodology for evaluating mtfs for restructuring was its determination of whether civilian health care facilities and providers in proximity to a given mtf ( i.e. , tricare network providers as well as non - network providers ) were adequate to absorb an increased demand for certain health care services from the mtf — that is , whether dod could use purchased care from civilian providers to replace care divested from a restructured mtf . in this case , the mtf's unit cost in fiscal year 2017 was more than two times the cost of purchased care . specifically , the work group ( 1 ) conducted limited assessments of mtfs' readiness support to military primary care and nonphysician medical providers , and did not include , as part of its methodology , ( 2 ) complete and accurate data about the quality of and access to purchased care from civilian providers , or ( 3 ) alternative assumptions that could affect the perceived cost - effectiveness of mtf - provided direct care . as a result , dod's assessments may have included providers of lower quality health care and those who do not meet dod's access - to - care standards . the independent contractor's assessments did not include any information about the quality of available providers it identified . instead , dod generally assumed that all identified providers were of sufficient quality . for 11 selected mtfs , we found that about 56 percent of primary care providers and 42 percent of specialty care providers that an independent contractor identified in its assessment exceeded dod's drive - time standards for tricare prime patients by varying degrees , as shown in figure 1 . on the basis of our analysis of the assumptions and related data elements , and interviews with dod officials , we found that the assumptions do not account for uncertainties that could affect conclusions about an mtf's cost - effectiveness . mtf - specific actions for transition planning . furthermore , mtf officials stated that active - duty medical personnel reductions that occurred in fiscal year 2019 have also created shortfalls in staffing that could pose challenges for them in executing the mtfs' transitions . until dod takes action to address these gaps by using more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness , dod leaders may not fully understand risks to the achievement of their objectives in restructuring future mtfs . however , by establishing clear roles and responsibilities for executing and monitoring the transitions , dod can be better positioned to overcome the difficulties in navigating organizational boundaries between the dha and the military departments , and make timely adjustments to their transition plans , as needed . we are making the following six recommendations to dod: the secretary of defense should ensure that the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , in coordination with the surgeons general of the military departments and the director of the dha , consistently collect complete and accurate information about the quality of available civilian health care in proximity to its mtfs ( such as ratings from the centers for medicare and medicaid services and perceptions from mtf officials who regularly coordinate with civilian providers , among other means ) and assess that information to inform recommendations for future mtf restructuring decisions .  ( recommendation 2 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs , in coordination with the surgeons general of the military departments and the director of the dha , consistently collect complete and accurate information about the extent to which non - network civilian health care providers that could be incorporated into the tricare network meet access - to - care standards in terms of drive time , and assess that information to inform recommendations on future mtf restructuring decisions . dod concurred with our recommendations to establish roles and responsibilities for executing and monitoring mtf restructuring transitions ( recommendation 5 ) , and to define measurable objectives with thresholds and goals and apply them to evaluate progress and challenges for the transitions ( recommendation 6 ) . the 11 mtfs we selected are listed in table 4 .
