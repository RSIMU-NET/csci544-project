at your request , we are responding to a series of questions about federal and nonfederal retirement programs . as agreed with your office , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the number of federal retirees , if any , whose pensions have come to exceed the final salaries that they earned while working ; ( 2 ) explain why these retirees' pensions came to exceed their final salaries ; and ( 3 ) determine the difference , if any , in these retirees' pension amounts if current cost - of - living - adjustment ( cola ) policy — that is , the cola policy enacted in 1984 , which established the formula and schedule used today by the office of personnel management ( opm ) — had been in effect without interruption since 1962 , and also determine any difference in the number of retirees whose pensions would have exceeded their final salaries . we found that these changes in personal circumstances could cause an individual retiree's pension to fluctuate ( e.g. , increase and / or decrease ) during his or her retirement depending on whether survivor's benefits were being deducted . as a general rule , using constant — rather than nominal — dollars is more meaningful for examining dollar values across time , because constant dollars correct for the effects of inflation or deflation . three factors help to explain why some retirees' pensions came to exceed their final salaries when their salaries were not adjusted for the effects of inflation — the number and size of colas that retirees received , the number of years that they had been retired , and their number of years of federal service . our simulations suggest that other factors being equal , the majority of those who retired before 1970 would have received smaller pensions , while about 90 percent of those who retired after 1970 would have received larger ones . our analysis showed that by 1995 the retiree's pension would have been 6.3 percent smaller than it was under the actual cola policy . the increases in the pensions of some sample retirees , if current policy had been in effect the entire time , would have been enough to cause an increase of 3.0 percentage points in the number of retirees whose pensions exceeded their unadjusted final salaries . our analysis of the effects that cola policies have had on retiree pensions shows that the policies have played an important role in maintaining the purchasing power of retiree pensions since automatic colas began . and , although current cola policy would have tracked the cpi more closely had it been applied over the period we reviewed compared with some past cola policies , the numerous changes that have been made in cola policies over the past 35 years did not cause any retiree's pension to exceed his or her final salary when the salaries were adjusted for inflation . our analysis also shows that the effects that cola policies actually have on retiree pension amounts cannot be summarized easily .
