today , our testimony will focus on the actions dod has taken to implement previous gao recommendations regarding implementation of dts and related travel policies , phase out legacy travel systems and their associated costs , and implement electronic travel voucher processing . additionally , we obtained and analyzed listings of legacy travel systems from dtmo and the military services and reviewed fiscal year 2009 budget data to identify the legacy travel systems used by each service , and the cost associated with operating and maintaining these systems . regarding the feasibility of making dts mandatory for all dod travel transactions , the study concluded that while the institute found that legacy systems are being used even when dts could be used , there were situations — such as certain travel types ( e.g. , permanent change of station ) that dts cannot accommodate and sites where dts has not yet been fielded — that must be addressed before the use of dts can be made mandatory dod - wide . however , based upon our work to date to validate dod's actions , we consider 7 of the 14 recommendations as closed and the remaining 7 open . the 7 closed recommendations pertained to premium - class travel , unused airline tickets , use of restricted airfare , proper testing of system interfaces , and streamlining of certain travel processes , such as the process for approving travel voucher expenses . of the 7 open recommendations , 3 related to the adequacy of dts's requirements management and system testing , 3 related to dts underutilization , and 1 related to developing an approach that will permit the use of automated methods to reduce the need for hard copy receipts to substantiate travel expenses . the department's actions are responsive to the intent of our recommendation . requirements management and system testing . the problems were generally related to missing documentation , the limited scope of requirements testing performed , or both . based on our analysis , this requirement was not adequately tested . the department has provided additional documentation and we are in the process of analyzing the documentation to determine the extent to which the revised requirement management and testing processes have improved . the defense travel enterprise quarterly metrics report states that the number of tdy vouchers processed in legacy systems is an estimate because of limitations in dtmo's ability to collect these data from the legacy systems of the military services and defense agencies . information provided by dtmo indicates that the military services are still using 23 legacy travel systems . however , information provided by the military services identified only 12 legacy travel systems — 10 of which were included on the dtmo list . without a valid inventory of legacy travel systems , it is unlikely that dod management or the congress — in particular , this subcommittee — will receive reliable reports regarding when these systems are likely to be eliminated and the continuing annual cost to operate and maintain them . this functionality is not in dts and the department does not currently have a time frame for including this functionality . continued operation of legacy travel systems , particularly where dts has been deployed , diminishes savings available through electronic processing of travel vouchers and related travel information . in closing , we also would like to reiterate that following this testimony , we plan to issue a report on the status of dod's actions on gao's previous recommendations , which will include any further recommendations needed to improve the department's implementation of dts and ensure its success in the future . to determine the status of our 14 recommendations to improve the department of defense's ( dod ) travel processes and defense travel system ( dts ) implementation , we met with representatives of the defense travel management office ( dtmo ) and the program management office - defense travel system ( pmo - dts ) to obtain an understanding of actions taken , under way , or planned by the department in response to our recommendations . more specifically , we ( 1 ) obtained and analyzed documentation supporting the methodology used by the dfas to compute the cost estimates for electronically and manually processing a travel voucher and ( 2 ) used our cost assessment guide as a reference to determine whether the dfas considered all appropriate and reasonable cost elements in developing its computation of costs for processing manual and electronic travel vouchers .
