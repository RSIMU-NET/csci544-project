we reviewed the air force's and the navy's policies and procedures for determining requirements and budgets for aviation spare parts . the air force and the navy budget and spend billions annually to procure and repair aviation spare parts . these inaccuracies were due to the use , in requirement computations , of unsupported or incorrect ( 1 ) maintenance replacement rates , ( 2 ) demand rates , ( 3 ) planned program requirements , ( 4 ) due - out quantities , ( 5 ) lead times , ( 6 ) repair costs , and ( 7 ) asset quantities on hand and on order . the inaccuracies caused the fiscal year 1995 budget requirements to be understated by about $2 million on some items and overstated by about $10 million on others . we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to revise buy and budget requirement computation policies and procedures to require that on - hand assets reserved for depot maintenance needs be considered in periodic requirement and annual budget computations and strengthen management oversight procedures and internal controls to ensure that key elements ( such as on - hand and due - out quantities and lead times ) of requirement and budget computations are accurate . dod did not agree that current air force and navy procedures related to reserving on - hand assets for depot maintenance resulted in overstated requirements . this reflects a reduction in the navy's assets from at least $154 million to at least $60 million .
