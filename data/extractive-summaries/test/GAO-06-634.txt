as the expected follow - on to the tremendously successful hubble space telescope , the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is being designed to explore the early universe and allow scientists to shed light on the origins and nature of the universe by allowing them to look deeper into space — and thus farther back in time — than ever before . the agency restructured the program and is now anticipating a launch no sooner than june 2013 . because of the restructuring and past cost and schedule problems , we reviewed the program to determine the extent to which the jwst program's acquisition strategy follows nasa acquisition policy and government accountability office ( gao ) best practices for ensuring that adequate product knowledge is used to make informed investments . in addition , the program's schedule slipped nearly 2 years . the jwst program recently revised its acquisition strategy to conform to nasa's acquisition policies ; however , the program still faces considerable challenges . gao best practices work has found that using a knowledge - based approach is a key factor in program success . when we initiated our work and before the program's recently revised acquisition strategy , program officials intended to have nasa commit to the program and start implementation with immature technologies , according to best practices , and without a preliminary design . during our review , we discussed these shortfalls with nasa officials , and they revised their acquisition strategy to align their decision milestones in accordance with nasa acquisition policy . furthermore , the strategy does not fully incorporate a knowledge - based approach that could address the program's risks by ensuring — through the use of exit criteria — that resources match requirements in terms of knowledge , time , and money before program start . in our past review of development programs , we have found that if this level of maturity is not demonstrated before a product development effort is launched , a program increases the likelihood of cost growth and schedule delays as it tries to close the knowledge gap between the technologies' maturity level and the product's design requirements . these priorities , along with nasa's other missions , will be competing within nasa for funding . to increase the jwst program's chances of successful product development , we recommend that the nasa administrator take the following actions: direct the jwst program to fully apply a knowledge - based acquisition approach — to include incremental markers — that will not only ensure that adequate knowledge is attained at key decision points , but also hold the program accountable . invention begins . should be approaching appropriate scale .
