specifically , we discuss ( 1 ) current trends in medicare beneficiary enrollment in hmos , ( 2 ) flaws in medicare's rate - setting method preventing medicare from realizing potential savings from hmos , ( 3 ) strategies to enable medicare to realize hmo savings , and ( 4 ) the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) efforts to test hmo payment reforms . hmo enrollment is further concentrated in urban areas . hcfa's capitation payment to hmos is currently risk adjusted for only four demographic factors: beneficiary age , sex , medicaid status , and institutional status . nonetheless , our review suggests that favorable selection persists despite hmo enrollment expansion . in our view , hcfa could generate the most medicare savings if it would pursue strategies in all three categories concurrently . competitive bidding , rate negotiation , and beneficiary incentive approaches have been used successfully in other public health insurance programs . with new legislative authority , hcfa could require steeper discounts from hmos than the present 5-percent discount off the estimated local fee - for - service cost . a sensible approach would be to pursue three promising strategies concurrently â€” foster price competition among hmos , improve risk adjusters' accuracy , and allow for adjustments in the current formula to reflect market competition and hmos' local health care costs . first , it solicited proposals from private contractors to plan a demonstration project on competitive bidding . in light of the increasingly urgent need to realize savings from the medicare hmo program and to develop viable new methods of paying hmos , congress may wish to consider giving the secretary of the department of health and human services authority to selectively reduce medicare hmo payment rates ( the aapcc rate ) in areas where market data indicate that the medicare rates are too high and expand hcfa's authority to mandate hmo participation in demonstration projects in order to conduct more meaningful studies of alternative payment methods . medicare: health maintenance organization rate setting issues ( gao / hrd - 89-46 , jan. 31 , 1989 ) .
