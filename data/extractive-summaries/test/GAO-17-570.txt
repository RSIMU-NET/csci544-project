over the past 22 months , the white house announced more than $240 million in federal investments for research and technology to support making communities “smarter.” and on january 12 , 2017 , the former administration issued for public comment a draft federal strategic plan for smart cities and communities that provides a high - level framework to guide and coordinate federal efforts supporting iot in communities . you asked us to examine federal support for iot and the impact of iot on communities . to identify the kinds of efforts that selected federal agencies have undertaken to support iot in communities , we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 11 selected federal agencies that we identified as having a key role in providing such support , including those that support research or community iot efforts , oversee privacy or security protections and threats , or have direct authority over iot issues . the efforts discussed in this report are not an exhaustive list of such federal efforts . we selected these four communities to include a range of city sizes and locations and communities with projects that used federal support and involved multiple community sectors ( e.g. , energy , transportation , public safety ) , as well as experience in successfully and unsuccessfully seeking federal funds . instead , iot is generally described as a concept referring to how connected devices interact and process information . in this report , we focus on the application of iot within a community setting — often referred to as a “smart city” or “smart community” — with the aim to generally improve the livability , management , or service delivery of that community . as communities increasingly deploy iot devices , they are more dependent on the underlying communications systems — both wired and wireless network systems — that enable those devices to communicate with each other and with other systems . in addition to broad research and oversight of iot issues , we identified three federal agencies ( commerce , dot , and epa ) that are more directly supporting communities through expanded funding for community iot projects . two other federal agencies also recently announced funding for deployment of community iot projects . to promote government - wide collaboration in supporting deployment of iot in communities , the white house created an interagency smart cities and communities task force in july 2016 — co - chaired by representatives from dot , nist , and nsf — that is coordinated through the networking and information technology research and development ( nitrd ) program . the draft plan highlighted five goals motivating the strategy , including accelerating innovation and infrastructure improvement and facilitating cross - sector collaboration and bridging existing silos . for example , according to an official from the portland bureau of planning and sustainability , a meeting at a metrolabs event resulted in a partnership between portland and a stakeholder leading chicago's array of things project to share information and leverage resources in testing sensors and a sensor platform for an air quality project . in planning and deploying iot projects , all of the communities we reviewed are using federal funds with other direct funding and in - kind support . commerce , doe , ftc , nsf , and ostp provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
