crs has published a report , recently updated , on continuing appropriations that discusses at length and tracks the seven bills that have thus far funded federal government operations through fy2011 . the most substantial adjustment to military construction accounts was the reduction of the brac 2005 account from the $8.0 billion needed near the height of brac construction in fy2010 to $2.4 billion .  ( a ) no appropriation or funds made available or authority granted pursuant to section 101 for the department of defense shall be used for ( 1 ) the new production of items not funded for production in fiscal year 2010 or prior years ; ( 2 ) the increase in production rates above those sustained with fiscal year 2010 funds ; or ( 3 ) the initiation , resumption , or continuation of any project , activity , operation , or organization ( defined as any project , subproject , activity , budget activity , program element , and subprogram within a program element , and for any investment items defined as a p - 1 line item in a budget activity within an appropriation account and an r - 1 line item that includes a program element and subprogram element within an appropriation account ) for which appropriations , funds , or other authority were not available during fiscal year 2010 . none of the subsequent enacted appropriations altered this language , and dod has reported that no new fy2011 construction has yet been undertaken . with the exception of new construction projects , dod may be assumed to be obligating funds in each account at a rate commensurate with its fy2010 appropriation . the president submitted his fy2012 appropriation request for military construction and family housing to congress on february 14 , 2011 . the president's fy2012 request is less than one - quarter of the amount needed during the last year of brac construction and movement . much of the rest of the reduction ( $1.6 billion ) can be found in the reduced request for active component military construction , primarily drawn from the navy and marine corps account ( $1.4 billion ) . the president also requested no funds for the overseas contingency operations construction account . even though the base budget request includes $80 million in construction for afghanistan , this would mark a substantial reduction in construction activity in the area of the most intense u.s. military operations . as members of congress and the defense committees consider additional continuing appropriations for fy2011 and the president's request for fy2012 , a number of questions may suggest themselves: to what extent does the delay in a fiscal year appropriation disrupt executive branch planning and commitment of construction funds ? . how , and to what extent , will limits on government debt impact both the timing and the number of military construction projects that can be undertaken ? .
