the legal services corporation's ( lsc ) mission is to make federal funding available to support the provision of legal assistance in civil matters to low - income people throughout the united states on everyday legal problems . we also observed lsc site visits at two grantees . we also found that communication and coordination of grantee site visits between oce and opp need improvement in order to achieve effective oversight and avoid gaps and duplication in oversight . in 1988 congress subjected lsc to the inspector general act of 1978 , as amended ( ig act ) .the ig act provides that each designated federal entity , in this case lsc , shall transfer to the oig “the offices , units , or other components , and the functions , powers , or duties thereof , that such head determines are properly related to the functions of the office of inspector general.” for example , the ig act transferred to the inspector general responsibility for providing policy direction for , and conducting , supervising , and coordinating audits of entity programs , such as lsc's legal assistance grants program . however , as discussed in a later section of this report , lsc's grantee site visit reports were not being completed in a timely manner , and , therefore , were not available to the respective teams or to lsc management for use in communications and coordination of grantee oversight activities . lsc's control activities for monitoring grantee internal control systems do not reasonably assure that grant funds are being used properly and that grantees are in compliance with laws and regulations . oce's fiscal oversight was limited in scope , and feedback was not provided to the grantees . at both of our observation visits , we noted that staff did not follow - up on questionable transactions and relied too heavily on information obtained through interviews without corroborating the information . as of september 17 , 2007 , lsc had not yet issued to grantee management almost 19 percent ( 10 out of 53 ) of the 2006 lsc reports for which grantee site visits had been completed . based on our limited reviews , we identified internal control weaknesses at 9 of the 14 grantees we visited that lsc could have identified with a more effective oversight review regimen . while control deficiencies at the grantees were the immediate cause of improper and potentially improper expenditures , weaknesses in lsc's oversight controls discussed above negatively affected the effectiveness of its monitoring of grantees' controls and compliance . among the control weaknesses we found were grantee use of lsc grant funds for expenditures with insufficient supporting documentation , and for unusual contractor arrangements , alcohol purchases , employee interest - free loans , lobbying fees , late fees , and earnest money . effective internal controls over grants and grantee oversight are critical to lsc as its very mission and operations rely extensively on grantees to provide legal services to people who otherwise could not afford to pay for adequate legal counsel . procedures to improve the effectiveness of the current lsc fiscal compliance reviews by revising lsc's current guidelines to provide a direct link to the results of opp reviews and oig and ipa audit guidance for performing follow - up on responses from grantee examples of fiscal and internal control review procedures that may be appropriate based on individual risk factors and circumstances at grantees . while these audits serve as an accountability mechanism , they are performed after the fact , and do not include all the grantee oversight objectives and procedures that would be expected of lsc management as part of its responsibilities to manage the affairs of the corporation , such as its grants program and to monitor its grantees to ensure compliance with all applicable laws , regulations , and grant terms . at all of these locations , we analyzed key records and interviewed entity officials to obtain an understanding of lsc's internal control framework , including the oversight of grantees , and assessed compliance of expenditures . systemic failure to pay bills on time is an indication of weak internal controls .
