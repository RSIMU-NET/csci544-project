we also previously reported that one of the wtc health programs , hhs's wtc federal responder screening program , which was established to provide onetime screening examinations for responders who were federal employees when they responded to the wtc attack , has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of services . we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , the component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who resided outside the nyc metropolitan area . my testimony today is based primarily on testimony we issued in september 2007 , which in turn was based on a report we issued in july 2007 . we also interviewed officials of organizations that worked with niosh to provide or facilitate services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , including the mount sinai school of medicine in nyc and the association of occupational and environmental clinics ( aoec ) â€” a network of university - affiliated and other private occupational health clinics across the united states and in canada . we conducted our earlier work from november 2006 through july 2007 , updated selected information in august and september 2007 , and conducted work for this statement in january 2008 . in brief , as we testified in september 2007 , niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , although it has taken steps toward expanding the availability of these services . as a result of our assessment of the wtc health programs , we recommended in our july 2007 report that the secretary of hhs expeditiously take action to ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for all responders , including federal responders and nonfederal responders residing outside of the nyc metropolitan area . as of january 2008 , the department has not responded to this recommendation . aoec experienced challenges in providing these screening services . mount sinai's subcontract with aoec ended in july 2004 , and from august 2004 until june 2005 niosh did not fund any organization to provide services to nonfederal responders outside the nyc metropolitan area . in june 2007 , niosh awarded $800,600 to dcc for coordinating the provision of screening and monitoring examinations , and qtc was to receive a portion of this award from dcc to provide about 1,000 screening and monitoring examinations through may 2008 . screening and monitoring the health of the people who responded to the september 11 , 2001 , attack on the world trade center are critical for identifying health effects already experienced by responders or those that may emerge in the future . september 11: improvements needed in availability of health screening and monitoring services for responders . gao - 07-1229t . gao - 07-892 .
