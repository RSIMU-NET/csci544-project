the primary long - standing federal postdisaster grant program for helping states respond to short - term crisis counseling needs following disasters is the crisis counseling assistance and training program ( ccp ) , which is administered by dhs's federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and its federal partner , samhsa . federal grants have helped states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic and other disasters , and samhsa has conducted an assessment of disaster plans from many state mental health and substance abuse agencies . cdc , hrsa , and dhs have also provided preparedness funding that states may use for mental health or substance abuse preparedness , but the agencies' data - reporting requirements do not produce information on the extent to which states used funds for this purpose . samhsa found that these plans showed improvements over those that had been submitted by states as part of their application for the preparedness grant . samhsa awarded $6.8 million over fiscal years 2003 and 2004 specifically to help state mental health and substance abuse agencies prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic and other disasters . in 2007 , the agency completed a review of the disaster plans of 34 of the 35 states that received a samhsa preparedness grant to , among other things , give samhsa aggregated information about states' disaster planning and technical assistance needs . areas samhsa identified as showing improvement included stronger partnership for planning and response among state mental health and substance abuse services agencies ; an increased number of unified plans that encompass both mental health and substance abuse services issues ; stronger partnerships with key stakeholders such as emergency management , public health agencies , and voluntary organizations that are active in disasters ; and clearer identification and articulation of the disaster response role of state mental health and substance abuse agencies . states also experienced lengthy application reviews , and fema and samhsa officials said they had taken steps to improve the submission and review process . in addition , state officials told us they experienced problems implementing their ccps , such as difficulties resulting from fema's policy of not reimbursing state ccps for indirect program costs . officials in the six states in our review told us they encountered difficulties as they prepared their ccp applications following the catastrophic disasters included in our review , including difficulties in collecting the information required for their isp applications within established deadlines . state officials said they faced difficulties in implementing their ccps following catastrophic disasters . according to new york , louisiana , and mississippi officials , some ccp clients who did not display symptoms suggesting they needed a referral for mental health or substance abuse treatment nevertheless could have benefited from more intensive crisis counseling than was provided in the ccp model . these officials did not know when the review would be completed . other fema disaster response grant programs allow reimbursement for such costs . although fema had been examining this issue for over a year , an agency official did not know when the agency would reach a decision on whether to revise ccp policy to allow coverage of indirect costs . to address gaps identified by federal and state officials in the federal government's ability to help states respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the administrator of fema , in consultation with the administrator of samhsa , to expeditiously take the following two actions: determine what types of expanded crisis counseling services should be formally incorporated into ccp and make any necessary revisions to program policy , and revise ccp policy to allow states and service providers that receive ccp funds to use them for indirect costs . to do our work , we obtained program documents and interviewed officials from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , including the administration for children and families , centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , national institutes of health , office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response , and substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) ; the department of education ; the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , including the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) ; the department of justice ; and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , including the national center for posttraumatic stress disorder ( ncptsd ) .
