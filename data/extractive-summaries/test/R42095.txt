the death penalty has long been a sentencing option in this country . now federal capital offenses are confined to espionage , treason , certain drug kingpin offenses ( that do not involve murder ) , and murder under various jurisdictional circumstances . the death penalty may be imposed under its provisions only after ( 1 ) the defendant is convicted of a capital offense ; ( 2 ) in the case of murder , the defendant has been found to have acted with one of the required levels of intent ; ( 3 ) the prosecution proves the existence of one or more of the statutory aggravating factors ; and ( 4 ) the imbalance between the established aggravating factors and any mitigating factors justifies imposition of the death penalty . "an indictment for any offense punishable by death may be found at any time without limitation. . the constitution provides that "the trial of all crimes ... shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any state , the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed," and that "in all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law. . there is some uncertainty over whether they are to be appointed immediately following indictment for a capital offense or whether they need only be appointed "promptly" sometime prior to trial ; and whether the right expires with the decision of the government not to seek the death penalty . more defendants are sentenced to death for murder than for all of the other federal capital offenses . murder is a capital offense under more than 50 federal statutes . a defendant convicted of a capital offense may be executed , however , only if it is shown beyond doubt at a subsequent sentencing hearing that one of the statutory aggravating circumstances exists , and that he either ( a ) killed the victim intentionally ; ( b ) intentionally inflicted serious injuries that resulted in the victim's death ; ( c ) intentionally participated in an act , aware that it would expose a victim to life - threatening force , and the victim died as a consequence ; or ( d ) intentionally engaged in an act of violence with reckless disregard of its life - threatening nature and the victim died as a consequence . multiple killings or attempted killings . justice department approval forms once identified five possible non - statutory aggravating factors . these gave way to more generic instructions , also no longer available . equally culpable , disparate punished defendants . childhood hardships , remorse , and impact of the execution on the defendant's family are among the more common . obstruction of justice . on other hand , most of those crimes are not capital offenses . the federal death penalty act establishes the same capital sentencing hearing procedures for all capital offenses â€” murder , treason , espionage , or murder - less drug kingpin offenses . if they recommend the death penalty , the court must impose it . video and audio recording are forbidden .
