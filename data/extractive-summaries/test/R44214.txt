if all 12 regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the time that the first cr for a fiscal year expires , further extensions of that cr might be enacted until all regular appropriations bills have been completed or the fiscal year ends . none of the fy2016 regular appropriations bills was enacted by the start of the fiscal year ( october 1 , 2015 ) . h.r . 719 , a cr for fy2016 , was passed by the house and senate and signed into law by the president on september 30 , 2015 ( p.l . 114-53 ) . the purpose of this report is to provide an analysis of the continuing appropriations in h.r . 719 . for general information on the content of crs and historical data on crs enacted between fy1977 and fy2015 , see crs report r42647 , continuing resolutions: overview of components and recent practices , by [author name scrubbed] . for information on the fy2016 appropriations process , see crs report r44062 , congressional action on fy2016 appropriations measures , by [author name scrubbed] . this section of the report discusses the three components of a cr that generally establish the purpose , duration , and amount of funds provided by the act: a cr's "coverage" relates to the purposes for which funds are provided . when a cr refers to one of those appropriations acts and provides funds for the projects and activities included in such an act , the cr is often referred to as "covering" that act . the funding rate for a project or activity is based on the total amount of budget authority that would be available annually for that project or activity under the referenced appropriations acts , and is pro - rated based on the fraction of a year for which the cr is in effect . in addition to the general provisions that establish the coverage , duration , and rate , crs usually include provisions that are specific to certain agencies , accounts , or programs . second , certain provisions may have the effect of creating new law or changing existing law . these anomalies and provisions that change law may be included at the request of the president . in some cases they include additional information , such as whether a provision was requested by the president or included in prior year crs . for the duration of the cr , section 119 would end the required transfer of $1.1 billion of unobligated balances from the aff to the fpd account , and it would also suspend a limitation on the transfer of unobligated balances from the aff to the fpd account that are in excess of the required $1.1 billion transfer . this provision is similar to section 122 of the continuing appropriations resolution , 2015 ( p.l . as previously mentioned , the cr's general rate for operations would fund most va programs through a formula using the fy2015 level of appropriations minus an across - the - board rescission of 0.2108% . section 149 would extend the authorization through december 11 , 2015 .
