congress uses data from the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) , the national incident - based reporting system ( nibrs ) , and the national crime victimization survey ( ncvs ) to inform policy decisions and develop appropriate responses to crime . such crime data have been used to shape policy in a variety of ways . because of the importance of crime data in both shaping policy and allocating federal funding , it is important to understand how each program collects data and the limitations of the data . this report reviews ( 1 ) the history of the ucr , the nibrs , and the ncvs ; ( 2 ) the methods each program uses to collect crime data ; and ( 3 ) the limitations of the data collected by each program . the report then compares the similarities and differences of ucr and ncvs data . it concludes by reviewing issues related to the nibrs and the ncvs . it was originally conceived as a way to measure the effectiveness of local law enforcement to provide law enforcement with data that could be used to help fight crime . ucr data are now used extensively by academics and government officials for research , policy , and planning purposes , and the data are widely cited in the media . the ucr also provides some of the most commonly cited crime statistics in the united states . the national crime victimization survey ( ncvs ) is the primary source for information on the characteristics of criminal victimization and on the number and types of crime not reported to law enforcement . the ncvs has four major objectives: ( 1 ) developing detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime , ( 2 ) estimating the number and types of crimes not reported to police , ( 3 ) providing uniform measures of selected types of crimes , and ( 4 ) permitting comparisons over time and population types ( e.g. , urban , suburban , and rural ) . the ucr measures offenses known to the police , and the ncvs collects data on crimes that people have experienced , whether they were reported to the police or not . as discussed above , implementing the nibrs system nationwide has been a slow process . provide funding to an organization such as the justice research and statistics association to allow them to provide training and continued support to local law enforcement agencies that implement nibrs systems . status of ucr and nibrs reporting , by state appendix b. ucr part i and part ii offenses the fbi collects data on both the number of offenses known to police and the number of arrests made for all part i offenses . victim connected to ucr offense code ( s ) 25 . relationship ( s ) of victim to offender ( s ) offender segment [1 . ucr arrest offense code 46 . arrestee was armed with 47 . assault offenses aggravated assault simple assault intimidation 3 . robbery 19 . liquor law violations 8 . motor vehicle theft the theft of a motor vehicle .
