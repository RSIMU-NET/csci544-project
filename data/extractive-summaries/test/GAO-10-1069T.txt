thank you for the opportunity to appear today before the subcommittees to provide our perspective on the role of the u.s. export - import bank ( ex - im ) in promoting exports and achieving other u.s. policy goals . as congress considers policies to achieve more robust growth in the u.s. economy , it must consider the full range of tools available to further growth and create new jobs for u.s. workers . some of these tools are related to promoting exports , which can have broad benefits to the u.s. economy . as the official export credit agency of the united states , ex - im has a key role in helping many u.s. firms achieve sales in foreign markets . in addition to establishing ex - im's broad mandate of supporting u.s. employment through exports , congress has laid out specific , targeted goals for the bank in areas such as increasing financing for environmentally beneficial exports and expanding services to small and minority - owned businesses . today , i will provide some broad observations regarding ex - im's contribution to the export promotion goals announced in the president's national export initiative . i will also describe progress ex - im has made in achieving the specific targets set by congress , as well as some challenges the bank faces in meeting those targets . in my statement , i will also provide some background information concerning the ways in which exports can enhance u.s. economic output , and i would be happy to provide insights from our recent work on other key agencies' export promotion efforts . the president created the national export initiative on march 11 , 2010 , with an ambitious goal of doubling exports in the next 5 years to support job creation . the report identifies several actions for ex - im . we reported that while ex - im has taken steps to increase financing for environmentally beneficial exports , it could benefit from more consistently following strategic planning practices such as involving stakeholders and realigning resources . gao has reported on several aspects of ex - im's financing for small business exports . gao made several recommendations to ex - im for improving its performance standards for small business . i appreciate the opportunity to discuss these issues with you today .
