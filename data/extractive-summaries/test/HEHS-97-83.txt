before the pdp , mhss psychologists were not allowed to prescribe medication . none of the services needs additional mental health providers capable of prescribing medication to meet either current or upcoming medical readiness requirements , according to our review of dod's health care needs . given this surplus , spending resources to provide psychologists with additional skill does not seem justified . dod had difficulty recruiting pdp participants throughout the project . courses such as neuroscience and psychopharmacology were added , while others were dropped . even if the mhss had a need for additional mental health care providers to prescribe medication , the cost of meeting this need by training clinical psychologists to prescribe drugs is substantial . the total cost of the pdp will be about $6.1 million through the completion of the proctored year for those currently in the program — or about $610,000 per psychologist who completes the program ( see table 4 ) . vri's analysis concluded that the pdp would prove cost - effective under certain circumstances . concerning the pdp's implementation , dod has demonstrated that it can train clinical psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medication , and these psychologists have shown that they can provide this service in the mhss . in the future , should prescribing psychologists be needed to meet dod's medical readiness requirements , the congress should require dod to ( 1 ) clearly demonstrate that the use of those mhss psychologists who have been trained to prescribe has resulted in savings , ( 2 ) clearly define a prescribing psychologist's role and scope of practice in the mhss compared with other psychologists and psychiatrists , ( 3 ) design a curriculum appropriate to this role and scope of practice , and ( 4 ) determine the need for and the level of supervision that prescribing psychologists require . it calculated these costs on the basis of three scenarios: the “base” case scenario , which is the status quo , a combination of psychologists and psychiatrists , with no prescribing psychologists in the mhss ; the “start - up” case scenario for prescribing psychologists , which had all the same elements of the base scenario but accounted for the introduction of prescribing psychologists into the mhss ; and the “optimal” case scenario for prescribing psychologists , which represented a modification of the start - up scenario . the objectives of our evaluation were to assess the need for prescribing psychologists in the military health services system ( mhss ) , provide information on the implementation of the pdp , and provide information on the pdp's cost and benefits .
