several issues call attention to the retirement security of this sizeable first , the decades - long shift in the private sector away from defined benefit ( db ) plans ( which typically pay lifetime annuity benefits in retirement ) to defined contribution ( dc ) plans ( which require workers to accumulate savings over their careers and manage withdrawals in retirement ) means that many workers and retirees need more savings to provide a secure retirement . in light of these developments , you asked us to review the financial status of workers approaching retirement and current retirees . and 2 ) what evidence do studies and surveys provide about retirement security for workers and retirees ? . to describe the financial resources of current and future retirees , we examined financial information from the 2013 survey of consumer finances ( scf ) . savings held outside of retirement accounts are included in to analyze other evidence of retirement security , we reviewed several studies of retirement adequacy and compared and contrasted their methodologies and findings . the surveys included the university of michigan's health and retirement study ( hrs ) , the federal reserve's survey of household economics and decisionmaking , the employee benefit research institute's retirement confidence survey , and other surveys . based on this , we found the data to be reliable for the purposes used in this report . however , db plans carry the risk that a plan sponsor may freeze or terminate the plan . according to our analysis of data from the 2013 scf , 52 percent of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings in a dc plan or ira , and social security provides most of the retirement income for about half of households age 65 and older . 1 ) . among households age 55-64 , the 41 percent with no retirement savings have few other financial resources but they are less likely to have debt than those with retirement savings.have less than $25,000 in total financial assets , such as in savings accounts or non - retirement investments . for the 48 percent of households age 65-74 that have some retirement savings , we estimate that the median amount is $148,000 , comparable to an insured , inflation - protected annuity of $649 per month for a 70-year - old at current rates . income from work and pension - based annuities , such as db plans , contribute about a fifth of household income each , on average . some of these studies attempt to judge the retirement readiness of workers by using data on consumption , income , and wealth for working - age households and projecting a replacement rate at retirement ; they then compare this projection to a target replacement rate that they estimate to be enough to maintain a standard of living in retirement . moreover , poverty rates are higher for people approaching retirement and people who are 75 and older . the department of labor provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . we also reviewed survey questions of retirees and workers approaching retirement age to infer information about their experiences of saving for and living in retirement . the survey was administered by gfk , an online consumer research company .
