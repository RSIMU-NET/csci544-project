federal agencies and aviation industry stakeholders gather and analyze aviation data for a variety of purposes . industry stakeholders also maintain historical data on equipment and maintenance issues . in addition , several experts we spoke with said that proactively identifying risks is necessary to maintain the current level of safety and possibly achieve an even higher level of safety in the future . the new technologies and procedures that faa will implement for nextgen , which are intended to increase the safety , efficiency , and capacity of the national airspace system , could also lead to consequences that have unintended effects on system safety . faa's goal is for the office of aviation safety to have initial operating capabilities in place for sms by the end of fiscal year 2010 . because sms relies on data to identify emerging risks , faa has an effort under way to enhance its access to industry data and improve its analysis capability . while faa has issued agencywide guidance on implementing sms and has some efforts such as asias under way , it does not have a way to measure or specific times to indicate full implementation . according to a senior faa official , this automated analysis process is unique and pathbreaking and will allow for more efficient safety analyses . asrs is accessible to the public , and nasa performs special analyses of asrs data for faa at its request . however , faa lacks carrier - specific information on why air carriers are not participating in voluntary reporting programs . faa's ability to monitor and manage risk for certain industry sectors , such as general aviation , air ambulance operators , and air cargo carriers , is limited by incomplete data . without information on the number of general aviation flights , faa cannot compare the safety performance among industry sectors or assess trends . for example , agencies should have managers review data , have procedures in place to verify that data are complete and accurate , and correct erroneous data . to help improve and expand faa's capability to use data for aviation safety oversight , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to take the following four actions: develop and implement a comprehensive plan that addresses how data fit into faa's implementation of a proactive approach to safety oversight and ensure that this plan fully describes the relevant data challenges ( such as ensuring data quality and continued access to voluntarily reported safety data ) , analytical approaches , and staffing requirements and integrates efforts to address them ; given the importance of high - quality data , extend standard quality controls , as appropriate , to the databases that support aviation safety oversight to ensure that the data are as reliable and valid as possible ; proceed with all deliberate speed to develop the capability to model the impact of nextgen changes on the national airspace system and manage any risks emerging from these changes ; and systematically identify the reasons that carriers are not participating in voluntary reporting programs , such as through a survey , and identify and implement further steps to encourage greater program participation , especially by smaller carriers . we then identified 13 databases available to faa that contained data on these safety events and reviewed these databases . in addition , to address all three research questions , we individually interviewed 10 aviation safety experts and asked them to identify challenges to using data for overseeing aviation safety , the reasonableness of faa's current and planned efforts to use aviation safety data , and ways that faa could enhance its data collection and analysis processes to improve its oversight capabilities .
