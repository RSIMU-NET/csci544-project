congress enacted the honest services statute , 18 u.s.c . section 1346 , in 1988 to incorporate within the ambit of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes schemes infringing on a victim's right to an official's or employee's "honest services" ( i.e. , an employee's honest work on behalf of a company or an official's honest public service ) . in the private sector , a notable case involves the conviction of jeffrey skilling , a former enron executive . the honest services statute , 18 u.s.c . six members of the court joined in justice ginsburg's majority opinion which limited honest services mail and wire fraud to those cases that involve either bribery or kickbacks ; the other three members of the court would have found the honest services definition unconstitutionally vague . in his petition for certiorari , skilling argued that the supreme court should adopt the "private gain" test to limit the scope of the statute , and that without such a construction , the statute is unconstitutionally vague . in 1987 , however , the court "stopped the development of the intangible - rights doctrine in its tracks" with mcnally v. united states . concerned about the "ambiguous" nature of the doctrine and its implications for federal - state relations , the court in mcnally confined the mail and wire fraud statutes to the prosecution of schemes designed to deprive victims of money or other property , not merely honest services . "congress responded swiftly" with the honest services statute which provides that , "for purposes of th[e] chapter [of the united state code that prohibits , inter alia , mail fraud , ยง1341 , and wire fraud ยง1343] , the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. . [if congress were to take up the enterprise of criminalizing undisclosed self - dealing by a public official or private employee , it would have to employ standards of sufficient definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns . it left for the lower courts the question of whether this tainted his conviction on other grounds . the court's skilling construction of the honest services statute doomed the jury instructions in black's honest services case as well . the court left for the lower courts the determination of whether the error was harmless or warranted overturning the convictions of the black defendants and ordering a new trial . weyhrauch presented only an honest services issue , and consequently the court simply returned it to the lower court with instructions to dispose of the case in manner consistent with the court's opinion in skilling . it also emphasized that congress has sufficient constitutional authority to regulate and punish the use of mail and interstate wire communications when they are used for fraudulent purposes and that the circuit had "never limited the reach of the federal fraud statutes only to conduct that violates state law. .
