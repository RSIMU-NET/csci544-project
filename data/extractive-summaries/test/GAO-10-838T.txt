as you are aware , federal agencies are increasingly using electronic means to create , exchange , and store information , and in doing so , they frequently create federal records . according to the federal records act , federal records are information in whatever form that documents government functions , activities , decisions , and other important transactions , and such records must be managed and preserved in accordance with the act . as requested , after providing some context about records management in the federal government and the roles of federal agencies and the national archives and records administration ( nara ) , my statement will focus on describing the challenges of electronic records management and potential means of addressing these challenges . under the federal records act , each federal agency is required to make and preserve records that ( 1 ) document the organization , functions , policies , decisions , procedures , and essential transactions of the agency and ( 2 ) provide the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and of persons directly affected by the agency's activities . if these records are not effectively managed , individuals might lose access to benefits for which they are entitled , the government could be exposed to legal liabilities , and historical records of vital interest could be lost forever . for records management , nara is responsible for issuing guidance ; working with agencies to implement effective controls over the creation , maintenance , and use of records in the conduct of agency business ; providing oversight of agencies' records management programs ; approving the disposition ( destruction or preservation ) of records ; and providing storage facilities for agency records . in 2008 , we reported on weaknesses in federal e - mail management at four agencies . nara's survey also indicated , among other things , that a large proportion of agencies have not scheduled existing systems that contain electronic records . as we have previously reported , electronic records pose major management challenges: their volume , their complexity , and the increasingly decentralized environment in which they are created . electronic information is increasingly being created in volumes that pose a significant technical challenge to our ability to organize it and make it accessible . in the centralized environment of a mainframe computer , it is comparatively simple to identify , assess , and manage electronic records . nor will automation solve the problem of lack of priority , which , as our previous work has shown , is of long standing . however , several developments could lead to increased senior - level attention to records management: nara's use of public ratings as a spur to agency management , growing recognition of risks entailed in poor information and records management , the requirements and emphasis of the recent open government directive , and the influence of congressional oversight . senior management commitment , if followed through with effective implementation , could improve the governmentwide management of electronic and other records . a recent gartner study concluded that user - driven classification of records , especially e - mail , has failed and will continue to fail ; a study by the association for information and image management ( aiim ) stated “it is simply not plausible to expect all creators of records to perform accurate , manual declaration and classification.” according to gartner , “what enterprises really need ( and want ) is a mechanism that automatically classifies messages by records management type … without user intervention.” at the time of writing ( august 2007 ) , gartner described such technology as “in its infancy,” but expected it to mature rapidly because of high demand . further , records management can also be time - and resource - consuming and technically difficult to implement . another factor that could help raise awareness of the value of records management is the growing recognition of the risks of weak electronic records and information management , as a result of fear of potentially large costs to organizations that have to produce electronically stored information to respond to litigation , as well as well - publicized incidents of lost records , including e - mail . in summary , federal records management has been given low priority for many years . the published product may be reproduced and distributed in its entirety without further permission from gao .
