however , because some problems still exist , state's management of overseas real property still needs to be closely monitored . our december 1992 report on overseas real property identified the chronic and long - standing management weaknesses that had affected overseas real property programs , including insufficient maintenance , lax oversight of overseas operations , inadequate information systems , and poor planning . progress cited by the inspector general included a new group of skilled maintenance professionals in the state department responsible for overseeing post maintenance and repair operations , a systematic global facility review program to assess the condition of u.s. - owned and long - term leased facilities , a 5-year plan for major rehabilitations , a comprehensive maintenance plan for newly constructed buildings , and additional funding for maintenance programs . these problems include the questionable and / or inappropriate use of routine maintenance funds by overseas posts and the failure of some posts to either conduct or complete annual surveys documenting the condition of government - owned and long - term leased facilities . as part of its overall management responsibilities , fbo provides funds to each overseas post to pay for routine maintenance and repair of its real property . overall , fbo estimates that its financial audit program has resulted in nearly $4 million in uncommitted post funds being returned to fbo for use in other projects and programs . for example , we found that state has kept undeveloped properties in nassau without adequate justification or plans for their use . its current value is not identified in the real estate management system . fbo has also developed an information resource management system , which consists of several integrated applications , including project management and budget planning and allocation . although these systems have helped to strengthen fbo and post capabilities to report on and manage real property , some weaknesses continue .
