to determine what experts and the available research indicate about the types of reentry programs and substance abuse programs that are effective or cost beneficial for juvenile offenders , we reviewed relevant literature , studies , and federal resources for juvenile justice programs , and interviewed federal officials and 26 juvenile justice experts . we specifically identified researchers who focus on juvenile reentry issues or substance abuse issues and practitioners who operate programs that address these issues . we selected two of ojjdp's efforts through which it disseminates information about effective programs — the model programs guide and the national training and technical assistance center ( nttac ) , which provides training and support to the juvenile justice field in identifying and implementing effective programs — because they provide information about effective programs across the range of issue areas in which ojjdp is involved , including reentry and substance abuse programs . we also reviewed relevant doj and ojjdp documentation , such as annual reports and strategic plans that contain information on ojjdp's research and evaluation goals and plans . similarly , of the five substance abuse program types we reviewed , juvenile substance abuse experts reported that there is evidence from available research that cognitive behavioral therapy along with family therapy are effective at reducing recidivism and show successful results at reducing substance abuse . furthermore , both reentry and substance abuse experts cited studies indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy and family therapy programs are cost beneficial ; however , the experts cited limited evidence for determining the costs and benefits of the other programs we reviewed . in addition , seven experts also commented on reentry and substance abuse programs that were not included in the cited studies . in accordance with this authority and its mission to support states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective juvenile justice programs , ojjdp disseminates information related to these programs through a range of efforts , from those designed to meet the needs of the juvenile justice field as a whole to those that focus on effective programs in a specific issue area , such as gang prevention or girls' delinquency . further , while the annual e - mail survey can help ojjdp confirm that the program information featured in the model programs guide is accurate , it does not provide information about whether the guide is useful to the field as a whole since ojjdp sends the survey's request for comments about the model programs guide to a portion of the juvenile justice field whose programs are already published in the guide , which means that the comments it receives about the model programs guide do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the juvenile justice field as a whole . ojjdp aims to publish the final version once public comments are incorporated , in accordance with the jjdpa's requirements . additionally , the office of management and budget's ( omb ) fiscal year 2006 program assessment rating tool found that juvenile justice programs would benefit from evaluations of their effectiveness but noted that such evaluations are difficult and expensive to do . however , from 2006 to 2009 , ojjdp had not developed such a plan , primarily because of resource constraints . the importance of ojjdp's goal to research and evaluate programs to improve juvenile delinquency underscores the need for a comprehensive plan to evaluate juvenile justice programs , one that identifies resources to be committed to its research and evaluation efforts and outlines the details of how ojjdp will accomplish its research and evaluation goals . to help ensure that ojjdp's model programs guide is regularly meeting user needs and providing the most helpful information on effective programs , consistent with federal guidelines , we recommend the administrator of ojjdp develop a cost - effective mechanism for regularly soliciting and incorporating feedback from the juvenile justice field on the usefulness of the information provided in its model programs guide . the basic elements that constitute a wraparound program include , among other things , ( 1 ) a collaborative , community - based interagency team responsible for designing , implementing , and overseeing the intervention program in a given jurisdiction ; ( 2 ) care coordinators who are responsible for helping juveniles create customized treatment programs , among other things ; ( 3 ) juvenile and family teams consisting of family members and community members who work together to ensure the juvenile's needs are met at home , at school , and in the community ; and ( 4 ) a plan of care developed and updated by all members of the juvenile and family teams that identifies the juvenile's strengths and weaknesses , targets specific goals such as improved performance in school , and outlines how to achieve them . these intervention programs focus on changing individual behavior thereby preventing further delinquency . juvenile offenders assigned to drug courts are identified by a juvenile court as having problems with alcohol or drugs .
