signed into law in december 2016 , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ( ndaa ) required the departments of defense ( dod ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and agriculture ( usda ) to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy and associated implementation plan . in september 2018 , the white house issued the national biodefense strategy ( strategy ) and characterized it as a new direction to protect the nation against biological threats , stating that its implementation would promote a more efficient , coordinated , and accountable biodefense enterprise . at the same time , the president issued the presidential memorandum on the support for national biodefense / national security presidential memorandum - 14 ( nspm - 14 ) , which details a governance structure and implementation process to achieve the strategy's goals . our testimony today highlights key findings from our february 2020 report , which analyzed the extent to which the strategy and related implementation efforts are designed to allow an enterprise - wide approach . hhs concurred with our recommendations . however , challenges with planning to manage change ; limited guidance and methods for analyzing capabilities ; and lack of clarity about decision - making processes , roles , and responsibilities while adapting to a new enterprise - wide approach could limit the success of the strategy's implementation . the strategy also outlines high - level goals and objectives to help define priorities . nspm - 14 lays out , in broad strokes , a process to identify biodefense efforts and assess how current resources support the strategy , how existing programs and resources could better align with the strategy , and how additional resources , if available , could be applied to support the goals of the strategy . in our analyses and interviews , we found that parts of the process in the first year were underdeveloped , raising questions about ( 1 ) the plans to support change management practices and ensure that early - implementation limitations do not become institutionalized in future years' efforts ; ( 2 ) guidance and methods for meaningfully analyzing the data ; and ( 3 ) the clarity of decision - making processes , roles , and responsibilities . we have previously reported that agencies need to identify how interagency groups will be funded and staffed . to address these issues , we recommended the secretary of hhs direct the biodefense coordination team to ( 1 ) clearly document guidance and methods for analyzing the data collected from the agencies , including ensuring that nonfederal resources and capabilities are accounted for in the analysis , and ( 2 ) establish a resource plan to staff , support , and sustain its ongoing efforts . this raises questions about how these bodies will move from an effort to catalog all existing activities to decision - making that accounts for enterprise - wide needs and opportunities . additionally , we found that presidential memorandums guiding the process did not detail specific decision - making principles or steps for reaching consensus or even for raising decision points about how to best leverage or direct resources across the enterprise in response to any gaps or inefficiencies . as a result , some officials remain skeptical of the effectiveness of any decisions made . to address this issue , we recommended that the secretary of hhs direct the biodefense coordination team to clearly document agreed upon processes , roles , and responsibilities for making and enforcing enterprise - wide decisions .
