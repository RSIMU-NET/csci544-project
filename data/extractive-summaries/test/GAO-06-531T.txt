we are pleased to be here today to discuss our work on how the departments of energy ( doe ) and defense ( dod ) use the designations official use only ( ouo ) and for official use only ( fouo ) , respectively , to manage information that is unclassified but sensitive . this report ( 1 ) identified and assessed the policies , procedures , and criteria that doe and dod employ to manage ouo and fouo information ; and ( 2 ) determined the extent to which doe's and dod's training and oversight programs assure that information is identified and marked according to established criteria . in summary , both doe and dod base their programs on the premise that information designated as ouo or fouo must ( 1 ) have the potential to cause foreseeable harm to governmental , commercial , or private interests if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information to perform their jobs ; and ( 2 ) fall under at least one of eight freedom of information act ( foia ) exemptions . both agencies have policies in place to implement their programs . however , our analysis of these policies showed a lack of clarity in key areas that could allow inconsistencies and errors to occur . in addition , while both doe and dod offer training on their ouo and fouo policies , neither doe nor dod has an agencywide requirement that employees be trained before they designate documents as ouo or fouo . this lack of training requirements and oversight leaves doe and dod officials unable to assure that ouo and fouo documents are marked and handled in a manner consistent with agency policies and may result in inconsistencies and errors in the application of the programs . with regard to training and management oversight , we recommended that both doe and dod require personnel to be trained before they can designate information as ouo or fouo , and that they develop a system to conduct periodic oversight of ouo or fouo designations to assure that their policies are being followed . doe policy clearly identifies the office responsible for the ouo program and establishes a mechanism to mark the foia exemption used as the basis for the ouo designation on a document . however , our analysis of dod's fouo policies shows that it is unclear which dod office is responsible for the fouo program , and whether personnel designating a document as fouo should note the foia exemption used as the basis for the designation on the document . also , both doe's and dod's policies are unclear regarding at what point a document should be marked as ouo or fouo , and what would be an inappropriate use of the ouo or fouo designation . in our view , this lack of clarity exists in both doe and dod because the agencies have put greater emphasis on managing classified information , which is more sensitive than ouo or fouo information . having clear policies and procedures in place can mitigate the risk of program mismanagement and can help doe and dod management assure that ouo or fouo information is appropriately marked and handled .
