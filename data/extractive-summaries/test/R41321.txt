most federal employees ( 59.1% ) are paid on the general schedule ( gs ) , a pay scale that consists of 15 pay grades in which an employee's pay increases are to be based on job performance and length of service . some members of congress , citizens , and public administration scholars have argued that federal employee pay advancement should be more closely linked to job performance . with explicit congressional authorization , the department of defense ( dod ) developed the national security personnel system ( nsps ) as a unique personnel and pay system attempting to more closely link employee pay to job performance . nsps was beset by criticisms since it went into effect in 2006 . the system faced legal and political challenges from unions and employees who claimed it was inconsistently applied and caused undeserved pay inequities , among other concerns . on october 7 , 2009 , house and senate conferees reported a version of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2010 that included language to terminate nsps . on october 8 , 2009 , the house agreed to the conference report . the senate agreed to the conference report on october 22 , 2009 . 111-84 ) . the return to the gs or other pay system must be completed by january 1 , 2012 , pursuant to the law . nsps was initially intended to cover all dod employees , but had a final total enrollment of roughly 227,000 dod employees or 31.7% of the department's 717,000-person workforce . in october 2010 , dod sent a report to congress that said 76% ( 171,985 ) of employees formerly in the nsps pay system had been converted to the gs . of those employees who moved into the gs , 72% ( 124,200 ) received a pay raise when they were placed in the proper gs grade and step . p.l . 111-84 included language preventing any employee from suffering a loss or decrease in pay as a result of the elimination of nsps . ยง 5363 ) , 35,117 transitioning employees have been placed on "retained pay," which allows them to maintain their nsps rate of pay , but requires that they receive half of the annual pay adjustment distributed to employees at the step 10 level of their position's assigned gs pay grade . some gs employees may argue that the nsps employees who were in nsps and who collect a retained pay rate receive a higher pay rate for similar work than does an employee who remained in the gs . some nsps employees , however , may argue that the cap on their annual pay increase amounts to a loss in pay . the 112 th congress may choose to continue its congressional oversight of nsps employees' transition to other pay systems . this report focuses on the transition of employees from nsps to non - nsps pay scales . it does not address the operation of nsps or other pay schedules . the report discusses how the transition is scheduled to occur and analyzes congressional options for oversight or legislative action . 111-84 required dod to begin transitioning nsps employees to non - nsps pay scales six months after enactment of the law , which occurred on october 28 , 2009 . if an employee was previously enrolled in a system that no longer exists , if his or her job and description did not exist prior to enrollment in nsps , or if a new pay system is to be created for an employee to enter into , dod is required by statute to determine the employee's pay system and transition him or her into that pay system by the january 1 , 2012 deadline . pursuant to p.l . the length of time it may take for the gs rate to be greater than the nsps rate would depend on a number of variables , including the level of pay increases enacted by congress in future years as well as the employee's pay level in relation to the step 10 pay rate of the gs grade to which his or her position is classified .
