what challenges does i&a face in maintaining a skilled analytic workforce and what steps has it taken to address these challenges ? . additionally , i&a's deployed personnel are to assist fusion centers in obtaining needed information and analysis to aid in supporting their own customer bases . on the other hand , intelligence officials from i&a and all five components in our review reported that efforts to implement these mechanisms , particularly the analytic planning process , have allowed them to coordinate component activities and avoid unnecessary overlap or duplication of efforts . however , neither mechanism is working as intended . specifically , we identified two gaps in the implementation of these mechanisms that limit dhs's assurance that component analytic activities support strategic departmental intelligence priorities: the framework does not establish strategic departmental priorities: the framework does not establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities that can be used to inform annual intelligence planning decisions — such as what analytic activities to pursue and what level of investment to make , as called for in dhs guidance . according to i&a officials , it can be challenging for components to focus on both overall strategic departmental intelligence priorities and their more tactical intelligence priorities that support their specific operations and component customers . our discussions with representatives of i&a's five customer groups indicate that customers in two groups — dhs leadership and state and local officials at fusion centers — found i&a's products to be useful , while customers in the other three groups — dhs components , the intelligence community , and private critical infrastructure sectors — generally did not . this bias exists because the results reflect the views of i&a customers who chose to respond to the feedback form and do not reflect the views of those who did not respond , a fact that prevents i&a from drawing statistically significant conclusions about the usefulness of its products since the results are not representative of all customers . to support this assessment , and in response to our september 2012 report , i&a initiated a survey in march 2014 to gain a better understanding of its customers' satisfaction with and use of i&a intelligence products and services.survey covers the types of i&a products the customers read in 2013 , including finished intelligence and current intelligence ( e.g. , alerts and among other things , the warnings ) ; the extent to which the products were useful in informing actions and decisions , such as in making resource investments ; and satisfaction with i&a services , such as threat briefings and tradecraft assistance . specifically , according to i&a's recruitment strategy , i&a's hiring authority under competitive service put it at a disadvantage compared with other organizations that were able to process hiring actions more quickly and for offer career advantages associated with excepted service status . i&a has also faced challenges in providing professional development opportunities for its workforce , and experienced low morale scores and high rates of attrition , particularly among its lower - level analysts . according to officials , this gap assessment will also to serve as an opportunity for i&a to determine whether its current practice of recruiting and hiring individuals that have strong analytical skills as opposed to subject matter expertise , and then training them to specialize in areas that according to support dhs's unique operational missions , is appropriate.officials , the gap assessment will include a survey of the knowledge , skills , and capabilities of intelligence analysts across the enterprise . according to i&a officials , these mechanisms are not in place because i&a leadership was focused on other priorities . consistent with this guidance , establishing mechanisms to monitor and evaluate workforce efforts , such as changes to i&a's hiring authority and grade levels restructuring , could help the office of analysis determine if the efforts are achieving their intended results . in addition , using the results from these evaluations to determine any need for changes will help ensure that i&a is making sound workforce decisions . to help ensure that the intelligence analysis activities and resources throughout the enterprise align to an integrated set of strategic departmental intelligence priorities , we recommend that the under secretary for intelligence and analysis , homeland security take the following two actions: establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities in the homeland security intelligence priorities framework that can be used to guide annual enterprise planning efforts , including intelligence analysis and resource management and ensure that once strategic departmental intelligence priorities are established , the framework is used to inform the planned analytic activities of the dhs intelligence enterprise , as articulated in the program of analysis . with regard to the third recommendation , that i&a establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate workforce initiatives and use results to determine any needed changes , dhs concurred and stated that i&a is developing specific performance indicators to monitor and evaluate workforce initiatives and plans to develop a complete set of measures by the end of fiscal year 2014 . specifically , we reviewed the department of homeland security strategic plan , fiscal years 2012-2016 , the 2006 and 2008 versions of dhs intelligence enterprise strategic plan ; office of intelligence and analysis strategic plan fiscal year 2011 – fiscal year 2018 ; delegation to the under secretary for intelligence and analysis / chief intelligence officer , august 10 , 2012 ; dhs management directive 8110 , intelligence integration and management , january 30 , 2006 ; department of homeland security directive 264-01 , intelligence integration and management , june 12 , 2013 ; dhs instruction number: 264-01-001 dhs intelligence enterprise june 28 , 2013 ; the 2005 and 2009 versions of the homeland security intelligence council charter ; i&a memos including the fiscal year 2013 and the fiscal year 2014 dhs enterprise programmatic guidance ; dhs intelligence enterprise programs of analysis ( poa ) for fiscal years 2011 through 2014 ; and the homeland security intelligence priorities framework for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to determine the roles and responsibilities of dhs in managing its enterprise and the analytic efforts of the enterprise , and how dhs was carrying out these responsibilities .
