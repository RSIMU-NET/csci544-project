an evaluation may provide information at any stage of the policy process about how a federal government policy , program , activity , or agency is working . one aspect of choosing how to carry out an evaluation involves deciding when some kind of "independence" would be a desirable attribute . in the context of evaluation , independence may apply to an evaluation or to an evaluator . on one hand , for example , the term may relate to independence of an evaluation from the policy preferences of an individual or group ( "independent evaluation" ) , perhaps by prohibiting political appointees from revising an evaluation . there is some diversity of opinion regarding how to define independence and what makes an evaluator ( or evaluation ) independent . for example , an evaluator's "external" status , outside the organization that is implementing a program , does not necessarily equate with independence . nor would an evaluator's "internal" status , inside the implementing organization , necessarily equate with a lack of independence for an evaluation ( e.g. , if an expert panel reviewed the internally produced evaluation for bias ) . there is also varying opinion concerning when independence is necessary , or possibly counterproductive , and what value it may bring . nonetheless , instances of independent evaluators appear to be growing in number and variety . this report focuses on the characteristics of independent evaluators ( ies ) — examples of which are described in the appendix — when an evaluation is to be conducted by an entity outside the immediate organization that is responsible for policy implementation , and the ie is also intended to have one or more dimensions of independence . ies and similar constructs that conduct independent evaluations , however , vary across a number of attributes: structure , jurisdiction , authority , resources , length of tenure , and specific duties and responsibilities . these differences , in turn , could affect their capabilities , effectiveness , and assistance to others , including their contributions to the oversight of a program or project by the executive or legislature . after an overview of such entities — which include newly and specially created units as well as existing ones , such as the government accountability office ( gao ) and offices of inspector general ( oigs ) — this report suggests possible broad characteristics and criteria of independent evaluators or similar units . the final section describes a number of such offices , along with citations to relevant materials for each example ( public laws , legislative proposals , executive branch documents , and secondary analyses ) . 3 ) requires that the administrator of the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , "in consultation with other federal and state agencies , shall develop an adaptive management plan for the chesapeake bay program and restoration activities that includes," among other matters: a definition of specific and measurable objectives to improve water quality , habitat , and fisheries ; a process for stakeholder participation ; monitoring , modeling , experimentation , and other research and evaluation practices ; a process for modifying restoration priorities that have not attained or will not attain the aforementioned specific and measureable objectives ; and a process for prioritizing restoration activities and programs to which adaptive management is to be applied . the website , which is to be "user - friendly" and "public - facing," is to provide links to related websites as well as materials and information regarding the act itself ; accountability matters , including findings of the board's and igs' audits ; data on contracts and grants relating to covered funds ; the use and allocation of covered funds by each federal agency ; data on relevant economic , financial , grant , and contract information to enhance public awareness of the use of the covered funds ; and to the extent practical , job opportunities afforded by the program and how to access these on appropriate federal , state , and local websites and locations .
