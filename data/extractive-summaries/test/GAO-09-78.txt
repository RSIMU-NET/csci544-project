nmfs officials said that funding constraints limit their ability to gather sufficient data , although the agency has taken steps to identify its data needs . for example , a stock definition would not be accurate if nmfs defined two distinct populations of a marine mammal species incorrectly as one stock . nmfs has not established teams for the 14 other marine mammals that have met the mmpa's requirements for establishing a team for several reasons: ( 1 ) the agency lacked sufficient funds to establish a team , ( 2 ) information about the stock's population size or mortality is outdated or incomplete and the agency lacks funds to obtain better information , ( 3 ) commercial fisheries account for little or no incidental take , or ( 4 ) the population size is increasing ; therefore establishing a team for the stock is a lower priority . false killer whales found in the waters off the hawaiian islands have met the mmpa's requirements for establishing a team since 2004 because the stock has been strategic and interacts with a category i longline fishery . outdated or incomplete data . furthermore , according to stock assessment reports , the available mortality estimates are incomplete because they are based on anecdotal information . in addition , while nmfs has taken steps to identify the impact of proposed take reduction regulations prior to their implementation , the agency has limited information about the fishing industry's compliance with the regulations once they have been implemented . as a result , when incidental takes occur in fisheries covered by take reduction regulations , it is difficult for nmfs to determine whether the regulations were not effective in meeting the mmpa's goals or whether the fisheries were not complying with the regulations . to facilitate the oversight of nmfs's progress and capacity to meet the statutory requirements for take reduction teams , congress may wish to consider taking the following three actions: direct the assistant administrator of nmfs to report on major data , resource , or other limitations that make it difficult for nmfs to accurately determine which marine mammals meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams ; establish teams for stocks that meet these requirements ; and meet the statutory deadlines for take reduction teams ; amend the statutory requirements for establishing a take reduction team to stipulate that not only must a marine mammal stock be strategic and interacting with a category i or ii fishery , but that the fishery with which the marine mammal stock interacts causes at least occasional incidental mortality or serious injury of that particular marine mammal stock ; and amend the mmpa to ensure that its deadlines give nmfs adequate time to publish proposed and final take reduction plans and implementing regulations while meeting all the requirements of the federal rulemaking process . the objectives of this review were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) available data allow the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to accurately identify the marine mammal stocks that meet the marine mammal protection act's ( mmpa ) requirements for establishing take reduction teams , ( 2 ) nmfs has established take reduction teams for those marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory requirements , ( 3 ) nmfs has met the statutory deadlines established in the mmpa for the take reduction teams subject to the deadlines and the reasons for any delays , and ( 4 ) nmfs has developed a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take reduction plans that have been implemented . to determine the extent to which nmfs has met the mmpa's deadlines for the five take reduction teams subject to the deadlines and the reasons for any delays , we identified five key deadlines listed in the mmpa for nmfs and take reduction teams and interviewed officials from noaa's office of general counsel to confirm the deadlines ; obtained and reviewed documentation , such as take reduction plans , federal register notices announcing the establishment of teams , and nmfs's proposed and final take reduction plans and implementing regulations published in the federal register ; analyzed the dates published in the federal register documents to determine whether each of the five take reduction teams had met their statutory deadlines ; and , met with nmfs officials to confirm the accuracy of our analysis of information published in federal register notices .
