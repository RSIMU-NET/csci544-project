the united states and many of its trading partners use trade remedy laws to lessen the adverse impact of various trade practices on domestic industries , producers , and workers . these laws are deemed consistent with u.s. international obligations provided they conform to the trade remedy provisions agreed to as part of the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations ( 1986-1994 ) and other trade agreements to which the united states is a party . this report will , first , discuss congressional interest in these laws , and give an overview of recent legislation to amend the laws in congress . finally , an appendix provides a chart outlining briefly all u.s. trade remedy statutes , major actors , and remedies presented . "safeguard" or "escape clause" trade laws are designed to provide domestic industries with relief from injurious import surges resulting from fairly competitive trade . in order to obtain relief , the usitc must determine that a domestic industry is substantially injured by import surges . although individual u.s. safeguard actions ( in particular , the 2002 action on steel ) have been the subject of intense debate , on the whole , many economists find safeguard measures less objectionable than ad or cvd actions . others believe that trade remedy actions ( the vast majority of which are ad or cvd investigations and orders ) in and of themselves introduce inefficiencies in both domestic and international economies that result in decreased economic welfare .
