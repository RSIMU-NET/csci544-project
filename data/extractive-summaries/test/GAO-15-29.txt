the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) — a semiautonomous agency within the department of energy ( doe ) — is responsible for managing the nation's nuclear security missions . this report examines: ( 1 ) the extent to which doe and nnsa cost estimating requirements and guidance for its projects and programs reflect best practices for developing and reviewing cost estimates , and ( 2 ) the extent to which nnsa project and program reviews identified weaknesses in cost estimates , and the extent to which any weaknesses can be attributed to not following cost estimating best practices . to examine the extent to which doe and nnsa cost estimating requirements and guidance for its projects and programs reflect best practices for developing and reviewing cost estimates , we reviewed doe and nnsa requirements and guidance related to cost estimating for projects and programs and compared them with the best practices identified in our 2009 cost estimating and assessment guide . to determine the extent to which recent nnsa project and program reviews identified any weaknesses associated with the cost estimates for projects and programs and whether any of these weaknesses can be attributed to not following cost estimating best practices , we obtained project and program reviews completed from february 2009 through february 28 , 2014 . for example , the order does not require any of the other 11 best practice steps such as conducting a risk and uncertainty analysis , identifying ground rules and assumptions , documenting the estimate , developing a point estimate , or determining the estimating structure . however , because neither doe nor nnsa requires the use of most cost estimating best practices for its projects , it is unlikely that nnsa and its contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates . however , because the cost guide was issued in 2011 , a year after doe's latest version of the order was issued , the order contains no reference to this guide that a preparer of a cost estimate could use in developing an estimate , or that a reviewer could use in reviewing one , and users of the order may not be aware of the guide's availability and may not benefit from its usefulness . doe and nnsa programs are not required to meet any cost estimating best practices . plutonium disposition program . in february 2014 , we found that nnsa's life - cycle cost estimate for the plutonium disposition program did not follow all key steps for developing high - quality cost estimates in part because it did not have a requirement to develop a life - cycle cost estimate . doe and nnsa require reviews of projects , including reviews of cost estimates at various cd points and at the discretion of project managers ; however , because doe and nnsa do not require reviews of program cost estimates , the extent of weaknesses in program cost estimates is largely unknown . of the 50 nnsa project reviews conducted from february 2009 through february 2014 , 39 identified a total of 113 cost estimating weaknesses . we determined that 71 of the 113 weaknesses — or about 63 percent — can be attributed to not following 4 of the 12 best practice steps . while program reviews are not required , we identified and analyzed three lep program reviews from the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through february 2014 , two of which were reviews of the b61 lep . however , we also found that nnsa did not follow other key steps such as conducting an independent cost estimate and , as a result , the estimate was not reliable . nnsa agreed with this recommendation . finally , without a requirement for conducting reviews of programs with project - like characteristics , including the life - cycle cost estimates of these programs , neither doe nor nnsa have appropriate internal controls to assess the quality of program performance over time . in regard to the report's fourth recommendation — revise doe directives that apply to programs to require that doe and nnsa and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 cost estimating best practices , including developing lifecycle cost estimates for programs — doe stated in its written comments that it is in the process of substantially revising the existing 1995 doe order 130.1 , budget formulation , and that as part of this effort , doe will assess the requirement for program cost estimates and will revise the order to provide more specificity on the cost estimating requirements .
