of these 52 programs , 30 programs distributed across the four agencies can support entrepreneurs through financial assistance in the form of grants and loans . these inefficiencies could compromise the government's ability to effectively provide the needed services and meet the shared goals of the programs . in january 2011 , congress updated the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) with the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) . specifically , this testimony discusses ( 1 ) the extent of overlap , fragmentation , and duplication among these programs and the extent to which programs collaborate and ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies collect information necessary to track program activities and whether these programs , have met their performance goals and have been evaluated . for our august 2012 report , we reviewed statutory and regulatory authority on the activities and services the agencies can conduct to administer each of the programs , and we found significant overlap and fragmentation among programs that provide financial assistance . for example , a small business in a rural , economically distressed area , such as bourbon county , kansas , could in terms of authority , receive financial assistance in the form of guaranteed or direct loans for a broad range of uses through multiple programs at the four agencies , including commerce's economic adjustment assistance ; hud's community development block grant ( cdbg ) / states sba's 7 ( a ) loan program and small business investment companies usda's business and industry loans and rural business enterprise grants . in our 2012 report , we examined entrepreneurs' experiences with the four agencies' technical assistance programs — which provide services such as helping with development of business plans or a loan package to obtain financing — and found that some struggle to navigate the fragmented programs . for example , some entrepreneurs and various technical assistance providers with whom we spoke — including agency field offices , intermediaries , and other local service providers — told us that the system can be confusing and that some entrepreneurs do not know what services are available or where to go for assistance . in addition , programs' internet resources can also be difficult to navigate . in addition , gprama's crosscutting framework requires that agencies collaborate in order to address issues , such as economic development , that transcend more than one agency , and gprama directs agencies to describe how they are working with each other to achieve their program goals . however , the agencies have not implemented other good collaborative practices , such as establishing compatible policies and procedures to better support rural businesses . while the four agencies collect at least some information on program activities in either an electronic records system or through paper files , most were unable to summarize the information in a way that could be used to help administer the programs . similarly , the agencies typically do not track detailed information on the characteristics of entrepreneurs that they serve , such as whether they are located in rural or economically distressed areas or the entrepreneurs' type of industry . usda maintains this information in an electronic database , and officials stated that they can provide this type of detailed information upon request . gprama requires agencies to develop annual performance plans that include performance goals for an agency's program activities and accompanying performance measures . further , from 2000 through 2012 , the agencies had conducted program evaluations of 13 of the 30 financial assistance programs that support entrepreneurs we reviewed . based on our review , we found that sba has conducted program evaluation studies on 5 of its 10 programs . to address the issues identified in our august 2012 report and to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal efforts to support entrepreneurs , we made the following recommendations: the director of the office and management and budget ; the secretaries of the departments of agriculture , commerce , and housing and urban development ; and the administrator of the small business administration should work together to identify opportunities to enhance collaboration among programs , both within and across agencies .
