from the ear liest days of commercial radio , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and its predecessor , the federal radio commission , have encouraged diversity in broadcasting . the fcc's policies seek to encourage four distinct types of diversity in local broadcast media: diversity of viewpoints , as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives ; diversity of programming , as indicated by a variety of formats and content , including programming aimed at various minority and ethnic groups ; outlet diversity , to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market ; and minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets . in addition to promoting diversity , the fcc aims , with its broadcast media ownership rules , to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a geographic market and , in the case of broadcast television stations , nationwide . the debate over media ownership rules is occurring against the background of sweeping changes in news consumption patterns . based on surveys conducted by pew research center , the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65% in 1996 to 37% in 2017 . as broadcast stations face competition for viewers' attention from other media outlets , and thereby financial pressures , some have sought to strengthen their bargaining relative to program suppliers ( i.e. , broadcast networks ) , advertisers , and / or programming distributors ( i.e. , cable and satellite operators ) by consolidating . the extent to which such media consolidation can occur is directly related to the fcc media ownership and attribution rules in place at the time . the fcc has five distinct sets of rules governing ownership of multiple media outlets in a single market: ( 1 ) local television ownership rules ( known as the television duopoly rules ) ; ( 2 ) local radio ownership rules ; ( 3 ) radio / television cross - ownership rules ; ( 4 ) newspaper / broadcast cross - ownership rules ; and ( 5 ) the dual network rule . examples of the fcc's attempts are described within several of its past media ownership reviews , including the adoption of the failed station solicitation rule and the establishment of a class of "eligible entities" that could qualify for relaxed ownership rules , attribution rules , and more flexible licensing policies than their counterparts . in accordance with a third circuit directive , the agency submitted the rules to the court . interested parties have appealed the 2016 diversity order to the third circuit . as part of its reconsideration of the quadrennial media ownership order in 2017 , the fcc established a new incubator that provides a broadcast radio ownership rule waiver to a broadcaster that establishes a program to help facilitate station ownership for a certain class of owners . in addition , the fcc launched a new rulemaking proceeding seeking comment on how to implement the program . the fcc issued rules governing the incubator program in august 2018 . in the order , the fcc did not foreclose the possibility of eliminating or further relaxing its local radio ownership rule in the 2018 quadrennial review . furthermore , the fcc stated that following the completion of the 2018 quadrennial review , it might consider expanding the incubator program to apply to television stations .
