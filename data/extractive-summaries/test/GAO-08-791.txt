during the transition period , the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the secretaries of the interior , labor , and state , and the attorney general , has the responsibility to establish , administer , and enforce a transition program to regulate immigration in the cnmi . federal agency decisions will include , among others , the department of homeland security's determination of the numbers of cnmi - only work permits to issue annually and of the countries to include in a joint cnmi - guam visa waiver program for visitors and the secretary of labor's determination of whether and when to extend the cnmi - only work permit program for up to 5 years at a time past 2014 . this report is based on our march 2008 review of the then pending legislation , which was signed into law on may 8 , 2008 . foreign workers . tourists . new foreign investors can apply for u.s. nonimmigrant treaty investor status . at the same time , continuing declines in the garment industry , challenges to the tourism industry , and the scheduled increases in the minimum wage may reduce demand for foreign workers , lessening any potential adverse impact of the legislation on the economy . number of permits . permit fee . however , the agencies have not yet identified a process for coordinating these decisions . any further declines in these sectors would likely result in reduced demand for foreign workers , allowing for some future reductions in access to foreign workers without adverse effect from the legislation . although it is too early to assess the cnmi's efforts to replace foreign workers with cnmi residents , several factors may impede these efforts' effectiveness . for countries that may not be part of the joint visa waiver program because they currently are not included in the guam visa waiver program , possibly including china and russia , applying for a visa from u.s. embassies or consulates will likely be more costly and more time - consuming than obtaining a visitor entry permit under cnmi immigration law . the application of federal immigration law may affect a small portion of the cnmi's tourism market . however , lack of data , such as data on overall foreign investment in the cnmi , makes it difficult to assess the likely impact of these decisions and may hamper dhs's ability to make informed decisions . moreover , any impact on foreign investment in the cnmi will likely affect the labor market and tourism sector , and any impact on the labor market and tourism sector may also affect foreign investment . in particular , dhs will determine whether the grandfathered status applies only to investors holding the cnmi perpetual foreign investor entry permit or also to investors holding the cnmi long - term business entry permit . dhs's decision about the foreign investor entry permit holders to be grandfathered will partly determine the extent of the legislation's impact on foreign investment in the cnmi . however , while the legislation states that it intends to minimize potential adverse economic and fiscal effects on the cnmi and to maximize its potential for future economic growth , the actual impact of the legislation on the cnmi's labor market , tourism , and foreign investment will depend on decisions made by federal agencies in implementing the legislation . because current data gaps limit federal agencies' ability to make key implementation decisions to best meet the goals of the legislation , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of labor take the following two actions: develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on the cnmi labor market that are not currently available on an ongoing basis , such as data on the wages , occupations , and employment status of cnmi residents and foreign workers ; and develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on cnmi foreign investment , such as overall levels of foreign investment and the investment amounts associated with various types of foreign investor entry permits . third , the cnmi government inaccurately stated that the report predicts a substantial decline in the cnmi economy as a result of the legislation , misstating our message that the impact of the legislation on the cnmi economy will depend on various federal decisions . this report examines the factors that will affect the impact of recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) on the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi's ( 1 ) labor market , including foreign workers ; ( 2 ) tourism sector ; and ( 3 ) foreign investment . tourism . gao - 08-466 .
