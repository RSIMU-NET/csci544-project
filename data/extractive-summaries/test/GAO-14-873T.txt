as you know , the 2007-2009 financial crisis focused attention on weaknesses in the u.s. regulatory structure , including the lack of an agency or mechanism responsible for monitoring and addressing risks across the financial system and a shortage of timely information to facilitate that oversight . the dodd - frank act also created the office of financial research ( ofr ) , in part , to support fsoc by providing financial research and data . congress gave fsoc a number of significant authorities to help it execute its broad mission , including designating nonbank financial companies for heightened supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) . my remarks are based on our september 2012 report on fsoc and ofr and updates conducted from june through september 2014 . specifically , in our 2012 report we reviewed fsoc's challenges in achieving its mission , efforts to establish management mechanisms , activities for supporting collaboration among their members and external stakeholders , and its processes for issuing reports and rules and made nine recommendations to fsoc for improving its ability to identify systemic risk and emerging threats , its transparency and accountability , and collaboration and coordination across members and member agencies.in my comments today , i will discuss fsoc's progress in addressing these recommendations . fsoc has 10 voting and 5 nonvoting members ( fig . the 10 voting members include 9 federal regulators and an independent insurance expert . we reported that fsoc had taken steps to meet its statutory responsibilities related to identifying risks and potential emerging threats to u.s. financial stability , including by setting up a systemic risk committee — one of the seven standing fsoc committees — that is responsible for systemic risk monitoring and plays a key role in reviewing sources of systemic risk . as we noted in 2012 this approach may facilitate analysis of risks that could benefit from interagency discussions and responses , but may not help to identify new risks or threats that fsoc member agencies have not already identified on their own . however , the markets monitor does not appear to be focused on risks to the financial system , and the financial stability monitor remains in a prototype phase — and neither yet reflect the systematic sharing of key financial risk indicators to assist in identifying potential threats to financial stability . instead , fsoc continues to rely on member agency staff to suggest various threats . although fsoc had adopted communication methods to provide information on their activities to the public and taken steps to be transparent and accountable , we reported in 2012 that some of these efforts could be strengthened and made four recommendations . fsoc should develop a communication strategy to improve communications with the public ; keep detailed records of closed door sessions of principals meetings and to the extent possible make them publicly available after an amount of time has passed ; make recommendations in its annual report more specific by identifying which member agency or agencies , as appropriate , are recommended to monitor or implement such actions within specified time frames ; and establish a collaborative and comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of decisions for designating financial market utilities ( fmu ) and nonbank financial companies on those entities and the wider economy . fsoc has said it will provide more information in its minutes but has also argued that some of the information discussed is protected . fsoc staff indicated that the council had been trying to include more detail in its minutes since october 2013 . but without a comprehensive assessment , decision makers may not have the information they need to determine whether designating new entities for enhanced supervision and other requirements and restrictions is addressing a perceived gap in the regulatory system and improving the financial system's stability or whether policy changes should be considered . fsoc staff said that they had not begun planning for a study and did not know when planning for it would begin . we noted in our 2012 report that such an evaluation would require collaboration among several members of fsoc and emphasized the importance of advance planning for retrospective studies so that needed data are collected . in our september 2012 report , we also made three recommendations to improve fsoc's collaboration and coordination . we recommended that it establish formal collaboration and coordination policies that clarify issues such as when collaboration or coordination should occur and fsoc's role in facilitating that coordination . gao - 12-151 . fsoc staff told us that the statute did not give fsoc the authority to direct actions of individual members including requiring members to coordinate rulemakings . the dodd - frank act defines certain responsibilities for fsoc and ofr , but the lack of clear responsibility for implementation can lead to duplication , confusion , and gaps in their efforts . our past work has shown that the lack of clear roles and coordination can lead to duplication , confusion , and regulatory gaps .
