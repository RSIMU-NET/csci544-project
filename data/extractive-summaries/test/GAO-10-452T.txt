group quarters consist of college dormitories , prisons , nursing homes , and other facilities typically owned or managed by an entity providing housing , services , or both for the residents . during the 2000 census , for a variety of reasons , group quarters were sometimes counted more than once , missed , or included in the wrong location . as requested , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which the bureau has strengthened its procedures for counting group quarters compared to the 2000 census and ( 2 ) particular challenges and opportunities for an accurate group quarters count in brooklyn . my testimony today is based on our completed and ongoing reviews of the bureau's efforts to build an accurate address list , including address canvassing , where temporary census employees go door - to - door verifying addresses , and an initial group quarters operation called group quarters validation , where the bureau determines whether an address is either a group quarters or conventional housing unit . further , the bureau needs to implement its group quarters quality assurance procedures as planned , closely monitor key performance metrics to ensure that the group quarters count proceeds on track and quickly address any glitches , as well as ensure that census workers have knowledge of neighborhood culture and living arrangements , and possess the language skills to reach out to residents with limited english proficiency . for example , the bureau moved from manual to gps - generated map spots , which should reduce the chance of human error and of group quarters populations being counted in the wrong jurisdiction ; moved from a telephone interview to a field verification approach , which should increase accuracy ; and combined the housing unit and group quarters address lists into a single address list , which should reduce the chance of double counting . in addition , following a test of certain census - taking procedures in 2004 that was conducted in queens , new york , among other locations , we recommended that the bureau revisit group quarters procedures to ensure that this population was properly located and counted . the bureau's three - pronged approach had temporary census workers visit each group quarters and interview its manager or administrator using a short questionnaire during group quarters validation . if the dwelling was in fact a group quarters , it was then determined what category it fit under ( e.g. , boarding school , correctional facility , health care facility , military quarters , residence hall or dormitory , etc . during the advance visit , census workers verify the location of the group quarters and identify contact officials , schedule the date and time of the actual enumeration , and collect other information to help conduct the actual enumeration . the actual count of group quarters residents is conducted during group quarter enumeration . the effort includes an operation known as service - based enumeration , during which people commonly referred to as homeless are counted . similar quality assurance procedures are planned for the actual enumeration of group quarters . nationally , the enumeration of group quarters is a difficult task for the bureau , and brooklyn presents its own challenges as well as opportunities . for example , a planning database the bureau developed to help it target its resources placed brooklyn third on a list of top 50 u.s. counties with the highest number of people living in hard - to - count areas , based on data from the 2000 census . demographic factors that contribute to the hard - to - count designations include poverty levels , low educational attainment , unemployment , and complex household arrangements , as well as housing indicators such as a high percentage of renters and vacant units , multi - unit buildings , and crowded housing . the test was designed , among other things , to address the difficulties the bureau had in trying to identify and count this population during the 2000 census , and to refine its definitions of the various types of group quarters to make it easier to accurately categorize them . in light of these demographic and housing challenges , a successful group quarters count will , at a minimum , depend on how well the bureau executes the following activities: complete remaining group quarters activities on schedule .
