he makes periodic public reports . instead , the government has multifarious forms of ombudsmen - like offices . these across - the - board plans , however , have remained on the drawing board . in the 1970s , france , portugal , and austria established such offices . this overview is not a comprehensive study of various complaint - handling , ombudsman , or advocacy offices . instead , it examines and provides examples of ombudsman - like offices , recognizing their variations . differences among these instrumentalities include those noted below . although there is no authoritative , comprehensive , detailed survey of current federal complaint - handling offices , earlier studies ( even if dated and limited ) , along with the coverage here , provide useful information with which to describe , examine , and compare them . as noted throughout this report , federal complaint - handling offices exhibit different forms , capacities , and designations . the variations among the offices reflect their piecemeal establishment — at different times , for different reasons , and for different purposes , duties , and functions . recent constructs demonstrate this . efforts to establish a government - wide ombudsman , create complaint - handling offices throughout the executive branch , and / or standardize such entities have existed since the mid - 1960s . even in the few cases where a single statute has called for similar offices in a number of agencies — such as freedom of information act ( foia ) pubic liaisons , construction metrication ombudsmen , and banking agency ombudsmen — these entities have been highly specialized , responding to a select clientele in a distinct policy or subject area . this assignment results in the esgr being a combination of an internal ombudsman ( for active duty military personnel ) as well as an external ombudsman ( for discharged personnel reentering the private sector ) . the officer reports to both the medicare administrator and the director of the office of external affairs , and is also required to submit an annual report to congress . according to its statutory authority , the ocrcl is to review and assess information concerning abuses of civil rights , civil liberties , and profiling on the basis of race , ethnicity , or religion , by employees and officials of dhs ; make public through the internet , radio , television , or newspaper advertisements information on the responsibilities and functions of , and how to contact , the ocrcl ; help the dhs secretary , directorates , and offices of dhs to develop , implement , and periodically review dhs policies and procedures to ensure that the protection of civil rights and civil liberties is appropriately incorporated into dhs programs and activities ; oversee compliance with constitutional , statutory , regulatory , policy , and other requirements relating to the civil rights and civil liberties of individuals affected by the programs and activities of dhs ; coordinate with the privacy officer to ensure that programs , policies , and procedures involving civil rights , civil liberties , and privacy considerations are addressed in an integrated and comprehensive manner ; and that congress receives appropriate reports regarding such programs , policies , and procedures ; and investigate complaints and information indicating possible abuses of civil rights or civil liberties , unless the inspector general of the department determines that any such complaint or information should be investigated by the inspector general . like similar ombudsman positions , the bva ombudsman does not have the ability to require other va centers or offices to take specific action . later , epa extended the position past its 1988 legislative authorization and expanded its jurisdiction to include superfund sites . the office began operations in september 2009 . the cmo , as with counterparts in other agencies , stems from a statutory requirement that the head of each executive agency that awards construction contracts within the united states and its territories shall designate a senior agency official to serve as a construction metrication ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing and responding to complaints from prospective bidders , subcontractors , suppliers , or their designated representatives related to — ( a ) guidance or regulations issued by the agency on the use of the metric system of measurement in contracts for the construction of federal buildings ; and ( b ) the use of the metric system of measurement for services and materials required for incorporation in individual projects to construct federal buildings . at the national level , the postal service established a consumer advocate of the postal service as another way to improve customer service . the advocate also independently measures customer satisfaction and customer perspectives , relying on nearly 900,000 survey results annually .
