this report focuses on ( 1 ) best management practices used in the commercial airline industry to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service , ( 2 ) air force reengineering efforts to improve the responsiveness of its logistics system and reduce costs , and ( 3 ) barriers that may stop the air force from achieving the full benefits of its reengineering efforts . time also has a significant impact on cost . in recognition of increasing budgetary pressures , the changing global threat , and the need for radical improvements to its logistics system , the air force has begun a reengineering program aimed at redesigning its logistics operations . the air force has developed both a three - level and a two - level maintenance concept to repair component parts . this kind of resistance must be overcome if the air force is to expand its radical new concepts of operations . the current air force logistics system is inefficient and costly compared with leading - edge business practices . the air force , however , could build on its reengineering effort by including additional practices pursued and successfully adopted by the private sector . without these logistics system improvements , the air force will continue to operate a logistics system that results in billions of dollars of wasted resources . to build on the existing air force reengineering efforts and achieve major logistics system improvements , we recommend that the secretary of defense commit and engage top - level dod managers to support and lead air force reengineering efforts to ensure its success . specific concepts that have been proven to be successful and should be considered , but have not been incorporated in the current air force program include installing information systems that are commercially available to track inventory amounts , location , condition , and requirements ; counting existing inventory once new systems are in place to ensure accuracy of the data ; establishing closer relationships with suppliers ; encouraging suppliers to establish local distribution centers near major repair depots for quick shipment of parts ; using integrated supplier programs to shift to suppliers the responsibility for managing certain types of inventory ; using third - party logistics services to manage the storage and distribution of reparable parts and minimize dod information technology requirements ; reorganizing workshops , using the cellular concept where appropriate , to reduce the time it takes to repair parts ; and integrating successful reengineered processes and flexible , team - oriented employees in new facilities ( like the green field sites ) to maximize productivity improvements , as new facilities are warranted to meet changes in the types and quantities of aircraft .
