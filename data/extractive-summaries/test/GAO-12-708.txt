recommendations made in both reports .  ( 2 ) to what extent has ice adhered to best practices to acquire secure communities – related technology ? . the information obtained from these visits is not generalizable to other ice field offices , but it provided valuable insights into secure communities implementation . we reviewed ice alien removal data from october 2008 through march 2012 , and analyzed arrest charges for aliens removed from the united states during fiscal year 2011 , when ice began collecting arrest charge data , and the first half of fiscal year 2012 . to determine the extent to which dhs has safeguards in place to protect against potential civil rights abuses , we reviewed ice documents , such as the detainer form — the form that ice sends to state and local law enforcement agencies to request that they maintain custody of a removable alien — met with community groups at each of our site visits regarding secure communities , interviewed ice officials responsible for managing the secure communities program , and officials in dhs's office for civil rights and civil liberties ( crcl ) responsible for addressing complaints and conducting monitoring activities related to secure communities . ice data show that from october 2008 through march 2012 , secure communities led to the removal of about 183,000 aliens , of which approximately 74 percent had a criminal conviction and 26 percent did not have a criminal conviction known to ice . from october 2008 through march 2012 , ice removed 182,896 aliens identified by secure communities , as indicated by ice's data . ice issued guidance in august 2010 in advance of this requirement , and began offering training to its agents in the field on the agency's process for entering criminal arrest charge information into ice's database . of the data ice did collect , about 37 percent of aliens identified by secure communities and removed during fiscal year 2011 and the first half of fiscal year 2012 were arrested for traffic offenses ( of whom over half were charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol ) , about 12 percent were arrested for drug offenses ( of whom almost one - third were charged with marijuana offenses ) , about 10 percent were arrested for assault ( of whom over half were arrested for unspecified assaults ) , and the remaining 40 percent were arrested for other offenses . ice could mitigate the risk of further delays and cost overruns by better defining the acrime program's requirements and developing an integrated master schedule . the schedule delays and cost increases can be attributed in part to weaknesses in ice's planning , including ice ( 1 ) not fully defining requirements before awarding contracts and ( 2 ) not developing an integrated master schedule . consequently , ice spent $14.3 million for the sds contract to develop services that ice found to be unusable . while planning efforts can be subject to uncertainty about future funding , developing a workforce plan prior to full program and system deployment could help position ice so it is ready to effectively align staff among components responding to law enforcement agency queries when the modernized acrime system is deployed . these safeguards include providing detainees a revised detainer form with telephone numbers to call when they believe their civil rights have been violated or they are u.s. citizens or crime victims , developing training materials for state and local law enforcement and ice officials on how to protect aliens' civil rights , initiating a process to statistically monitor arrests under secure communities to identify and investigate potential patterns of civil rights abuses , and using dhs's existing complaint process to investigate complaints about possible civil rights abuses related to secure communities . to help ensure that ice acquires effective technology to support the secure communities program and effectively uses its workforce , we recommend that the director of ice take the following three actions to follow sound management practices: establish well - defined requirements prior to awarding additional develop an integrated master schedule that identifies all tasks to be performed by the government and current and future contractors , and links activities being performed by different contractors ; and develop a workforce plan to support the analysis of immigration status determinations under secure communities .
