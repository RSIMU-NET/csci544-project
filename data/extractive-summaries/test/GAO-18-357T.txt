the united states belongs to several inter - american organizations that , among other things , promote democracy , security , health care , agricultural development , and scientific exchange in the western hemisphere . these organizations include the organization of american states ( oas ) , the pan american health organization ( paho ) , the inter - american institute for cooperation on agriculture ( iica ) , and the pan - american institute of geography and history ( paigh ) . state , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) also provide project - specific voluntary contributions to the oas , paho , and iica through assistance agreements , which include grants and cooperative agreements . this testimony addresses , for calendar years 2014 through 2016 , ( 1 ) the amounts and percentages of u.s. assessed contributions to the four organizations , ( 2 ) the extent to which u.s. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of u.s. agencies . we also interviewed officials from the four organizations , as well as officials from state , hhs , usaid , and usda , which provide contributions to these four organizations . to assess u.s. agencies' oversight of assistance agreements , we identified 60 active assistance agreements that these agencies awarded to oas , paho , and iica during calendar years 2014 through 2016 and selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 agreements , three each from hhs , state , usaid , and usda . the reform act directed the secretary of state to , among other things , submit “a multiyear strategy that…identifies a path toward the adoption of necessary reforms that would lead to an assessed fee structure in which no member state would pay more than 50 percent of the oas's assessed yearly fees.” according to the reform act , it is the sense of congress that , among other things , it is in the interest of the united states , oas member states , and a modernized oas that the oas move toward an assessed quota structure that ( 1 ) assures the financial sustainability of the organization and ( 2 ) establishes , by october 2018 , that no member state pays more than 50 percent of the organization's assessed fees . thus , any change in the oas's assessed quota structure should be reflected at paho , iica , and paigh , according to their respective processes regarding the determination of assessed contributions . the u.s. share of assessed contributions may be reduced in the future . subsequent to our june 2017 report , at the oas general assembly in june 2017 , oas member states voted to draft a proposal to modify the quota structure to potentially reduce the maximum assessed quota to below 50 percent . state , hhs , usaid , and usda fund activities at oas , paho , and iica in the form of assistance agreements . in our december 2017 report , we reviewed 12 such agreements across the four agencies and found that state and usda did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance . state has taken corrective action since the grants were awarded . we also found that all four agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements we reviewed . for example , usda did not have full documentation , such as financial reports , of any of its 10 required monitoring activities , and usaid did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required monitoring activities ( financial and performance reports ) . in our december 2017 report , we found that the strategic goals of the four inter - american organizations are predominantly aligned with the high - level strategic goals for the western hemisphere documented by state , usaid , hhs , and usda , as shown in table 5 . in addition , agencies may not have all the information they need to make budgetary and programmatic decisions . in our december 2017 report , we recommended that ( 1 ) usda ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and ( 2 ) usaid and usda ensure full documentation of monitoring activities .
