fighter aircraft are important to achieving and maintaining air dominance during combat operations as well as protecting the homeland . considering that further slips in the f - 35 program may occur and could increase the scope and cost of the services' plans for upgrading and extending the service life of current aircraft , you asked us to ( 1 ) describe the air force and navy plans to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft , and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which cost estimates for these programs exhibit characteristics of a high - quality cost estimate . the gao cost guide reported that a high - quality cost estimate has four characteristics including comprehensive when it accounts for all life - cycle costs , is sufficiently detailed to ensure that costs are neither omitted nor double - counted , and identifies ground rules and assumptions ; well - documented when supporting documentation explains the process , sources , and methods used to create the estimate ; accurate when it is based on the assessment of the costs most likely to be incurred and adjusted for inflation ; and credible when the level of confidence has been identified through a risk and uncertainty analysis , and a sensitivity analysis has been conducted that identified the effects on the estimate of changing key assumptions . the capability upgrades , air force officials explained , are needed to maintain mission effectiveness and will include , for example , an improved radar and data - link enhancements . the air force's and navy's cost estimates to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft exhibit many cost - estimating characteristics and best practices of a high - quality cost estimate , but do not reflect all the potential total costs that may occur . as a result , decision - makers do not have visibility of how much the total costs will be and how they may increase if program quantities increase or additional work is required on some aircraft , which could hinder their ability to assess budgets and affordability . however , the estimates were not fully credible because the air force's analysis did not clearly show the potential range of total costs that would occur if more aircraft are included in the programs and the estimates were not compared to an independently developed estimate . since the navy will assess on an aircraft - by - aircraft basis whether to do this additional work , the costs would be in addition to the $2.19 billion for the service - life extension and most of these costs are not included in the navy's spending plans through fiscal year 2017 . the navy estimated that this work could average $5.64 million per aircraft . in many respects , the air force and navy cost estimates we evaluated were developed in accordance with some best practices . to improve future updates of air force and navy cost estimates for upgrading and extending the service life of selected f - 16s and f / a - 18s and to improve the ability of decision - makers to assess the potential total costs , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following four actions: direct the secretary of the air force to update its cost estimates , and in doing so: include in its sensitivity analysis an assessment of the range of possible costs if the capability - upgrade and service - life extension programs are expanded to more than 300 aircraft including up to the maximum of 650 aircraft , and obtain an independent review of the updated cost estimates .
