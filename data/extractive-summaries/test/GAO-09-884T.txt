historically , the vast majority of va patients have been men , but that is changing . according to va data , in fiscal year 2008 , over 281,000 women veterans received health care services from va â€” an increase of about 12 percent since 2006 . in my testimony today , i will discuss our preliminary findings , based on visits to selected va facilities , regarding ( 1 ) the on - site availability of health care services at va facilities for women veterans , ( 2 ) the extent to which va facilities are following va policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans , and ( 3 ) some key challenges that va facilities are experiencing in providing health care services for women veterans . the va facilities we visited provided basic gender - specific and outpatient mental health services to women veterans on site , and some facilities also provided specialized gender - specific or mental health services specifically designed for women on site . among cbocs , other than the two largest facilities we visited , most offered limited specialized gender - specific care on site . women needing obstetric care were always referred to non - va providers . basic gender - specific care services were available on site at all nine of the vamcs and 8 of the 10 cbocs that we visited . these cbocs that provided limited basic gender - specific services referred patients to other va facilities for this care , but had plans underway to offer these services on site once providers received needed training . in general , women veterans had access to female providers for their gender - specific care: of the 19 medical facilities we visited , all but 4 had one or more female providers available to deliver basic gender - specific care . the provision of specialized gender - specific services for women , including treatment after abnormal cervical cancer screenings and breast cancer treatment , varied by service and by facility . some of the vamcs we visited offered a broad array of other specialized gender - specific services on site , but all contracted or fee - based at least some services . vet centers generally offered some counseling services in the evenings . officials at some va facilities reported that they were unclear about the specific steps they would need to take to meet va's definition of comprehensive primary care for women veterans . all facilities were fully compliant with at least some of va's privacy requirements ; however , we documented observations in many clinical settings where facilities were not following one or more requirements . none of the vamcs or cbocs we visited ensured adequate visual and auditory privacy at check - in in all clinical settings that are accessed by women veterans . restrooms adjacent to exam rooms . va facility officials also told us they have struggled with space constraints as they work to comply with va's new policy on comprehensive primary care for women and the requirements in the september 2008 uniform mental health services in va medical centers and clinics , as well as the increasing numbers of women veterans requesting these services . the new policy requires that this primary care provider fulfill a broad array of health care services including , but not limited to detection and management of acute and chronic illness , such as osteoporosis , thyroid disease , and cancer of the breast , cervix , and lung ; gender - specific primary care such as sexuality , pharmacologic issues related to pregnancy and lactation , and vaginal infections ; preventive care , such as cancer screening and weight management ; mental health services such as screening and referrals for mst , as well as evaluation and treatment of uncomplicated mental health disorders and substance use disorders ; and coordination of specialty care . similarly , at one cboc , officials reported that it takes them about 8 to 9 months to hire interested primary care physicians . for each of the factors listed below , we examined available facility - or market - level data to identify facilities of interest: total number of unique women veteran patients using the vamc ; total number of unique oef / oif women veteran patients using the vamc ; proportion of unique women veterans using the vamc who are oef / oif proportion of unique oef / oif women veterans using the vamc who were discharged from the national guard or reserves ; within the va - defined market area for the vamc , the proportion of women veterans who use va health care and live in rural or highly rural areas ; and availability of on - site programs specific to women veterans , such as inpatient or residential treatment programs that offer specialized treatment for women veterans with ptsd or who have experienced mst , including programs that are for women only or have an admission cycle that includes only women ; and outpatient treatment teams with a specialized focus on mst .
