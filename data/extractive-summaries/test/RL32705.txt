improving border and transportation security ( bts ) are essential strategies for improving andmaintaining homeland security . border security entails regulating the flow of traffic across thenation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods and people are detected and denied entry . this requires a sophisticated border management system that balances the need for securing thenation's borders with facilitating the essential free flow of legitimate commerce , citizens , andauthorized visitors . transportation security involves securing the flow of people and goods alongthe nation's highways , railways , airways , and waterways .  ( 1 ) while in the immediate aftermath of 9 / 11 efforts primarilyconcentrated on an expanded federal role in aviation security ( in particular on the heightenedscreening of passengers and baggage ) , increasingly attention is being turned towards other modesof transportation . it provides a brief description ofselected agencies and their border and transportation security responsibilities . dhs is the primary agency responsible for the security of the borders .  ( 4 ) the border and transportation security responsibilities of dhs areprimarily located within the bts directorate . the coast guard is a stand alone agency within dhs,but has significant border security responsibilities . within the bts directorate , customs and border protection ( cbp ) has responsibility forsecurity at and between ports - of - entry along the border . accordingly , the coast guard exists as its own agency within dhs and is notpart of dhs's border and transportation security directorate .  ( 6 ) dos's bureau of consular affairs is responsible for issuing visas . dhs's citizenship andimmigration services bureau ( uscis ) is charged with approving immigrant petitions . in addition,doj's executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) plays a significant policy role through itsadjudicatory decisions on specific immigration cases . with this as background , the report now turns to a discussion of selected concepts thatfrequently appear in bts debates . these recommendations include ( but are not limited to the following ) : the united states should combine terrorist travel intelligence , operations , andlaw enforcement in a strategy to intercept terrorists , find terrorist travel facilitators and constrainterrorist mobility ; the u.s. border security system should be integrated into a larger network ofscreening points that include our transportation system and access to vital facilities , such as nuclearreactors ; the president should direct the department of homeland security to lead theeffort to design a comprehensive screening system , addressing common problems and settingcommon standards with systematic goals in mind ( see the summary of hspd - 11below ) ; the department of homeland security , properly supported by congress , shouldcomplete , as quickly as possible , a biometric entry - exit system , including a single system forspeeding qualified travelers , [i]t should be integrated with the system that provides benefits toforeigners seeking to stay in the united states ; the u.s. government ... should do more to exchange terrorist information withtrusted allies , and raise u.s. and global border security standards for travel and border crossing overthe medium and long term through extensive international cooperation ; the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birthcertificates and sources of identification , such as drivers licenses ; the u.s. government should identify and evaluate the transportation assets thatneed to be protected , set risk - based priorities for defending them , select the most practical andcost - effective ways of doing so , and then develop a plan , budget , and funding to implement theeffort , [t]he plan should assign roles and missions to relevant authorities ( federal , state , regional , andlocal ) and to private stakeholders ; improved use of "no - fly" and "automatic selectee" lists should not be delayedwhile the argument about a successor to capps continues , [t]his screening function should beperformed by tsa , and it should utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federalgovernment , [a]ir carriers should be required to supply the information needed to test and implementthis new system ; the tsa and the congress must give priority attention to improving the abilityof screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers , ... each individual selected for specialscreening should be screened for explosives ; and the tsa should conduct a human factor study ... to understand problems inscreener performance and set attainable objectives for individual screeners and for the checkpointswhere screening takes place . subtitle a authorizes pilot programs on the northern and southern borders which would testadvanced technologies to increase border security between ports of entry .
