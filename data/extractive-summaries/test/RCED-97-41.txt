because of this concern , the former chairman and ranking minority member requested in april 1996 that we review the efforts of the department's farm service agency ( fsa ) to conduct farm programs in an equitable manner . specifically , they asked us to ( 1 ) identify fsa's efforts to treat minority farmers in the same way as nonminority farmers in delivering program services ; ( 2 ) examine the representation of minorities in county office staffing and on county committees in the counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers ; and ( 3 ) examine data on the disposition of minority and nonminority farmers' applications for participation in the agricultural conservation program ( acp ) and the direct loan program at the national level and in five county and five district loan offices . in the other two cases , the staff found that fsa employees had discriminated on the basis of race in one case and national origin in the other . none of the evaluations concluded that minority farmers were being treated unfairly . about half of the fsa employees have been trained , according to the staff , and all are scheduled to complete this training by the end of 1997 . thirty - two percent of the fsa employees serving the 101 counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers were members of a minority group . in these 101 counties , minority farmers make up about 17 percent of the farmer population . according to fsa's data , applications for the acp for fiscal year 1995 and for the direct loan program from october 1994 through march 1996 were disapproved at a higher rate nationwide for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers . our review of the direct loan program files in these locations showed that fsa's decisions to approve and disapprove applications appeared to follow usda's established criteria . these criteria were applied to the applications of minority and nonminority farmers in a similar fashion and were supported by materials in the files . from the civil rights and small business development staff , we obtained information on the cases of alleged discrimination closed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996 and obtained copies of and analyzed the staff's management evaluations for the same period . finally , we obtained information on the equal employment opportunity and civil rights training the staff has provided to the farm service agency's ( fsa ) employees . to examine the treatment of minority farmers at the local level , we visited county offices and district loan offices that either had higher disapproval rates for minority than nonminority farmers for the agricultural conservation program ( acp ) in fiscal year 1995 and for the direct loan program from october 1994 to march 1996 or had high numbers of minority farmers .
