as competition for these federal funds grows more intense , transit project sponsors are increasingly looking for alternative mechanisms to finance and deliver new , large - scale transit projects . in response to your request , this report addresses ( 1 ) the role of the private sector in the delivering and financing of u.s. transit projects compared to other countries ; ( 2 ) the benefits and limitations of and the barriers , if any , to greater private sector involvement in transit projects and how these barriers are addressed in the department of transportation's ( dot ) public - private partnership pilot program ; and ( 3 ) how project sponsors and dot can protect the public interest in transit projects that use alternative approaches . in 2005 , congress authorized fta to establish the public - private partnership pilot program to demonstrate ( 1 ) the advantages and disadvantages of transit projects that use alternative approaches for new fixed - guideway capital projects and ( 2 ) how fta's new starts program can be modified or streamlined for these alternative approaches . among the benefits from using alternative approaches , project sponsors told us that they may better meet cost and schedule targets as well as achieve cost and time savings by transferring risks to the private sector . a greater private sector role in transit projects can also potentially offer certain advantages to the public sector , including increased financial flexibility and more predictable operations and maintenance funding . while we have previously identified fta's new starts grant program — which funds new , large - scale transit projects — as a model for other federal transportation programs because of its use of a rigorous and systematic evaluation process to distinguish among proposed investments , the new starts project approval process is not entirely compatible with transit projects that use alternative approaches in that the process is sequential and phased with approvals granted separately and at certain decision points . while it may be too early for fta to grant major streamlining modifications with the other two pilot projects , fta still has the ability as part of its pilot program to further experiment with the use of existing tools that could encourage a greater private sector role while continuing to balance the need to protect the public interest . in addition to not yet granting project sponsors any major streamlining modifications to the new starts process , fta does not have an evaluation plan to accurately and reliably assess the pilot program's results , including the effect of its efforts to streamline the new starts projects for pilot project sponsors . project sponsors we interviewed have also sought to use performance standards to protect the public interest . government officials stated that including both quantitative and qualitative factors in financial assessments such as value for money analysis provides a more comprehensive project assessment . without the services provided by these quasi - governmental entities , project sponsors that plan to or use alternative approaches for a transit project will develop them on a case - by - case basis because they lack institutional knowledge and a centralized resource for assistance . quasi - governmental entities established by foreign governments have better equipped project sponsors to implement alternative approaches , including public - private partnerships , by creating a uniform method to considering the implications of alternative approaches , reducing transaction costs , ensuring consistency in contracts , and serving as a repository of institutional knowledge . in particular , we focused on ( 1 ) the role of the private sector in the delivering and financing of u.s. transit projects compared with other countries ; ( 2 ) the benefits and limitations of and the barriers , if any , to greater private sector involvement in transit projects and how these barriers are addressed in the department of transportation's ( dot ) public - private partnership pilot program ; and ( 3 ) how project sponsors and dot can protect the public interest in transit projects that use alternative approaches .
