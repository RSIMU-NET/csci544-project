events such as the recent shootings by armed intruders in schools across the nation , natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 , the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and potential pandemics have heightened awareness of the need for school districts to be prepared to address a range of emergencies within and outside of school buildings . my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the role of the federal and state governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to school districts for emergency management planning , ( 2 ) what school districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies , and , briefly , ( 3 ) the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for emergencies and communicating and coordinating with first responders , parents , and students . in summary , federal and state governments support emergency management in school districts with a range of resources and most school districts have developed emergency management plans despite facing challenges ; however not all of these plans incorporate recommended practices . however , funding guidance for some federal grant programs does not clearly identify school districts as entities to which state and local governments may disburse these grant funds . therefore , some states receiving this funding may be uncertain as to whether such funding can be allocated to school districts or schools ; and as a result , school districts may not have the opportunity to benefit from this funding . for example , many school districts do not include procedures for special needs students in their plans and many districts have not employed any procedures in their plans for continuing student education in the event of an extended school closure , such as might occur during a pandemic . finally , many school district officials said that they experience challenges in planning for emergencies due to a lack of equipment , training for staff , and expertise and some school districts face difficulties in communicating and coordinating with first responders and parents , but most said that they do not experience challenges in communicating emergency procedures to students . while the no child left behind act of 2001 provides that local education agencies ( leas or school districts ) applying for subgrants under the safe and drug free schools and communities program include in their grant applications an assurance that either they or their schools have “a plan for keeping schools safe and drug - free that includes...a crisis management plan for responding to violent or traumatic incidents on school grounds” , education has not issued any regulations imposing such a requirement on all school districts . however , 32 of the states responding to our survey of state administering agencies and state education agencies reported having laws or other policies requiring school districts or schools to have a written emergency management plan ( see fig . dhs provides funding to states and local jurisdictions for emergency management planning , some of which can be provided to school districts or schools for emergency management planning . although the number of special needs students in the schools is growing , our survey finds that an estimated 28 percent of school districts with emergency management plans do not have specific provisions for them in their emergency management plans . develop multi - purpose manuals . based on our survey , we estimate that 27 percent of all school districts with emergency management plans have never trained with any first responders on how to implement the plans , in accordance with federally recommended practices . train with community partners .
