the other plan addresses quality of life issues affecting service members and their families . for this report , our specific objectives were to review the extent that these two plans , in addressing active duty military benefits , promote ( 1 ) the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and ( 2 ) the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions — the two critical success factors identified in our model . we also reviewed dod's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans . an overarching strategic vision is needed that identifies the kind of capabilities that dod will need in the future , the best way to provide those capabilities , and the changes in human resources planning and programs that will be required.” in view of these studies , the office of the secretary of defense published the military personnel human resource strategic plan ( referred to in this report as the military personnel strategic plan ) in april 2002 to establish military personnel priorities for the next several years . in this regard , the two plans constitute a positive step forward in dod's strategic management of the military workforce . while progress has been made , dod's human capital plans do not yet satisfy the two factors we identified in our model as critical to the success of strategic human capital planning ( one of the four cornerstones of sound strategic human capital management ) . it is also unclear how the initiatives , many of which are studies , will work in conjunction with one another to meet dod's goals . for example , one of the initiatives is to study alternatives to the military retirement system . the plan does not explain how retirement reform may be integrated and aligned with other initiatives such as dod's study of variable career lengths for officers . the military personnel strategic plan provides measures of effectiveness for each initiative ; however , these measures are not adequate to assess the success of dod's human capital approaches because they ( 1 ) do not describe the significance of outcomes in terms of programmatic goals and results , ( 2 ) are not always specific or stated as measurements , and ( 3 ) are activity - based rather than outcome - oriented . in addition , dod's plans do not discuss , at a strategic level , military workforce needs or gaps . moreover , dod lacks a process for enabling senior dod officials to oversee the progress and implementation of its human capital plans from a strategic vantage point . dod , in developing its human capital plans addressing military personnel and quality of life , has made progress in adopting a more strategic approach to human capital management . such a process could assist in the integration and alignment of benefits and other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and in promoting a fact - based , performance - oriented approach to human capital management . to improve dod's strategic human capital management , we recommend that you direct the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to establish an oversight process by which senior dod officials may integrate and align benefits and other human capital approaches and promote a fact - based , performance - oriented approach to human capital management . we focused on the two critical success factors that correspond to strategic human capital planning , namely ( 1 ) the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and ( 2 ) the use of data to make human capital decisions .
