while certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices continue to prevent gao from being able to issue an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government , the federal government has come a long way since enactment of the cfo act . today i would like to: outline progress made to date and the key challenges in improving federal financial management practices , and highlight the challenges posed by the government's fiscal condition and my views on a possible way forward . financial management systems and internal control have been strengthened . while there has been marked progress in federal financial management , a number of challenges still remain , including transforming financial management and business practices at dod , modernizing financial management systems , and building a financial management workforce for the future . towards this end , the congress has passed a series of management reform legislation aimed at improving and providing a strong foundation for federal financial management . while the problems are much more severe at some agencies than at others and progress has been made in addressing financial management systems' weaknesses , the lack of substantial compliance with the three requirements of ffmia , and the associated deficiencies , indicates that the financial management systems of many agencies are still not able to routinely produce reliable , useful , and timely financial information . the federal government's financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many may understand . we are currently experiencing strong economic growth and yet running large on - budget ( operating ) deficits that are largely unrelated to the global war on terrorism . the federal government faces large and growing structural deficits in the future due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care costs . if , for example , as shown in figure 2 , it is assumed that recent tax reductions are made permanent and discretionary spending keeps pace with the growth of our economy , our long - term simulations suggest that by 2040 federal revenues may be adequate to pay little more than interest on debt held by the public and some social security benefits . neither slowing the growth in discretionary spending nor allowing the tax provisions , including the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 , to expire — nor both together — would eliminate the imbalance . meeting our nation's large , growing , and structural fiscal imbalance will require a multipronged approach: increasing transparency and enhancing the relevancy of key financial , performance , and budget reporting and estimates to highlight our long - term fiscal challenges ; reinstituting and strengthening budget controls for both spending and tax policies to deal with both near - term and longer - term deficits ; strengthening oversight of programs and activities , including creating approaches to better facilitate the discussion of integrated solutions to crosscutting issues ; and reengineering and reprioritizing the federal government's existing programs , policies , and activities to address 21st century challenges and capitalize on related opportunities .
