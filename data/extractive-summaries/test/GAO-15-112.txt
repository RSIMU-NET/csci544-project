for example , in 2002 , former fbi agent jane turner filed a whistleblower complaint with doj alleging that her colleagues had stolen items from ground zero after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . the regulations lay out doj's process for handling fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints and describe various offices' responsibilities for investigating , adjudicating , and reviewing appeals related to these complaints . doj closed the majority of the 62 complaints we reviewed within 1 year , generally because the complaints did not meet doj's threshold regulatory requirements . doj closed 44 of the 62 complaints ( 71 percent ) that we reviewed within 1 year , most often because the complaint did not meet doj's threshold regulatory requirements . provides a way to channel such disclosures to those in the field who are in a position to respond and to correct management and other problems while also providing an on - site contact in the field for making protected disclosures.” in october 2012 , the president issued presidential policy directive 19 , which established whistleblower protections for employees serving in the intelligence community , including , among other things , explicitly providing protection to employees who are retaliated against for reporting wrongdoing “to a supervisor in the employee's direct chain of command up to and including the head of the employing agency.” presidential policy directive 19 excluded the fbi from the scope of these protections , and instead required doj to report to the president on the efficacy of its regulations pertaining to fbi whistleblower retaliation and describe any proposed revisions to these regulations to increase their effectiveness . first , in doj's april 2014 report , doj officials state that “the department believes the set of persons to whom a protected disclosure can be made is extensive and diverse , and has seen no indication that the list has impeded disclosures of wrongdoing.” however , when we asked officials how they arrived as this conclusion — particularly in light of our and doj's previous findings that numerous complainants had at least one claim dismissed for making a disclosure to someone in management or their chain of command — they could not provide supporting evidence or analysis for their conclusions . while doj's focus on the timeliness of complaint processing is important , dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee's supervisor or someone in his or her chain of command who is not a designated entity leaves some fbi whistleblowers with no recourse if they experience retaliation . as shown in figure 3 , these 3 cases lasted from just over 8 to 10.6 years . oig and doj - opr have not consistently provided complainants with periodic status updates nor have they always obtained complainants' approvals for extensions when the investigator reviewing the complaint needed more time , as required under doj's fbi whistleblower regulations . however , according to these whistleblower advocates , if the complainant is not satisfied with the investigating office's progress , the complainant may prefer to go directly to oarm . according to senior doj - opr officials , doj - opr has taken some steps to improve its management of whistleblower retaliation cases , but does not track investigators' compliance with specific regulatory requirements and does not have a formal oversight mechanism to do so . while doj officials' concern about timeliness is important , they are already taking other steps to improve the efficiency of this process . committing to specific time frames for returning doj decisions on the outcomes of fbi whistleblower retaliation cases could help doj achieve its commitment to improving efficiency in handling these complaints . we recommend the following four actions . to better ensure that fbi whistleblowers have access to recourse under doj's regulations should the individuals experience retaliation , and to minimize the possibility of discouraging future potential whistleblowers , we recommend that the attorney general clarify in all current relevant doj guidance and communications , including fbi guidance and communications , to whom fbi employees may make protected disclosures and , further , explicitly state that employees will not have access to recourse if they experience retaliation for reporting alleged wrongdoing to someone not designated in doj's regulations . to ensure that complainants receive the periodic updates that they are entitled to and need to determine next steps for their complaint , such as whether or not to seek corrective action from oarm , we recommend that counsel , doj - opr tailor its new case management system or otherwise develop an oversight mechanism to capture information on the office's compliance with regulatory requirements and , further , use that information to monitor and identify opportunities to improve doj - opr's compliance with regulatory requirements . this appendix provides information on the department of justice's ( doj ) reasons for closing the 62 federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblower retaliation complaints we reviewed . these 62 complaints represent the universe of fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints that were closed within the last 5 calendar years ( from 2009 through 2013 ) by the final doj office to review the complaint . in addition complainants may voluntarily withdraw their complaints .
