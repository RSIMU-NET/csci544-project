as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , our objectives for this fourth report are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) dod and va developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by the september 30 , 2009 , deadline and ( 2 ) the interagency program office established by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 is functioning as a single point of accountability for developing and implementing electronic health records . not all of dod's medical facilities yet have this inpatient medical system . moreover , our report and testimony also noted that the departments' interagency program office was not effectively positioned to function as a single point of accountability for achievement of full interoperability because it did not yet have fundamental it management capabilities and was not fulfilling key responsibilities , including establishment of performance measures , a project plan , or a detailed schedule . dod and va have achieved planned capabilities for the three remaining objectives ( expand questionnaires and self - assessment tools , expand essentris in dod , and demonstrate initial document scanning ) . having now met all six of their interoperability objectives , the departments' officials , including the co - chairs of the group responsible for representing the clinician user community , believe they have satisfied the september 30 , 2009 , requirement for developing and implementing systems or capabilities that allow for full interoperability . nevertheless , the departments are planning additional actions to further increase their interoperable capabilities , recognizing that clinicians' needs for interoperable electronic health records are evolving . specifically , dod has demonstrated the capability to scan a medical document , associate the document with a test patient , and save the document into the patient's electronic health record ; and va demonstrated the capability to search and retrieve the scanned document associated with that patient . clinicians have identified additional needs with respect to social history and physical exam data that have emerged since existing capabilities were made available in those areas . dod plans to further expand the implementation of essentris to sites beyond those achieved as of september 2009 . the interagency program office is not yet positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities . in addition , consistent with our prior recommendations , the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter in the areas of scheduling , planning , and performance measurement . however , the office's efforts to develop its capabilities in these areas are incomplete . however , the schedule does not include information about the tasks , resource needs , or relationships between tasks for the testing activity . moreover , according to the former interim director , the office was focused on providing briefings and status information on activities the office has undertaken to achieve interoperability , in addition to participating in the departments' efforts to define vler . additionally , in response to our prior recommendation that the departments establish a project plan and a compete and detailed integrated master schedule to improve management of their interoperability efforts , the chief of staff asserted that the interagency program office expects to have a draft project plan by the end of january 2010 and that va meets monthly with dod and the program office to coordinate input into an integrated master schedule . to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by the september 30 , 2009 , deadline , we reviewed our previous work on dod and va efforts to develop health information systems , interoperable health records , and interoperability standards to be implemented in federal health care programs .
