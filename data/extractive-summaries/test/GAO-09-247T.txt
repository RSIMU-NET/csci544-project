the current economic downturn has added to the significant financial stress facing that industry . deteriorating financial , real estate , and labor markets have reduced consumer confidence and available credit , and automobile purchases have declined . while most auto manufacturers have experienced declining sales in 2008 , recent economic conditions have particularly hurt sales of the “big 3” domestic auto manufacturers ( general motors , ford , and chrysler ) , in part because these companies have historically derived most of their sales from vehicles such as sport utility vehicles , which are less fuel efficient , but more profitable than small cars . in addition to potential job losses at auto manufacturers , the collapse or partial collapse of the domestic auto industry would adversely affect auto dealers , suppliers , and other sectors . in my statement today , i will discuss principles that could serve as a framework for considering the desirability , nature , scope , and conditions of possible federal financial assistance and , should congress decide to provide financial assistance , how these principles could be applied in these circumstances . we have identified three fundamental principles that can serve as a framework for considering large - scale federal assistance efforts . identify and define the problem: the government should clearly identify and define the specific problems confronting the industry — separating out those that require an immediate response from those structural challenges that will take more time to resolve . determine national interests and set clear goals and objectives that address the problem: after defining the problem , congress must determine whether a legislative solution best serves the national interest . protecting the government's interest: because these assistance programs pose significant financial risk to the federal government , appropriate mechanisms should be included to protect taxpayers from excessive or unnecessary risks . specifically , congress could 1 ) authorize immediate , but temporary , financial assistance to the auto manufacturing industry and 2 ) concurrently establish a board to approve , disburse , and oversee the use of these initial funds and provide any additional federal funds and continued oversight . this board could also oversee any structural reforms of the companies . among other responsibilities , congress could give the board authority to establish and implement eligibility criteria for potential borrowers and to implement procedures and controls in order to protect the government's interests . while the exact membership of a board to provide financial assistance to the big 3 auto manufacturers could differ , past federal financial assistance efforts suggest that it would be prudent to include representatives from agencies knowledgeable about the auto manufacturing industry as well as from those agencies skilled in financial and economic analysis and assistance . by defining the problem , determining whether a legislative solution to that problem best serves the national interest , and — assuming that such a solution is appropriate — establishing an appropriate governance structure , congress might better assure itself and the american people that the federal assistance will achieve its intended purpose .
