timetables in the doj report because of gsa's sense of urgency to upgrade security in its buildings , reduced staffing due to downsizing , data reliability problems , and uncertain funding sources have hindered gsa's upgrade program implementation . because of data reliability problems , neither gsa nor we can specify the exact status or cost of the building security upgrade program , and because gsa has not established program outcome measures , neither gsa nor we know the extent to which completed upgrades have resulted in greater security or reduced vulnerability for federal office buildings . thus , gsa is not in a good position to manage its program to mitigate security threats . nevertheless , based on the existing accounting system data , we estimate that from october 1 , 1995 , through march 31 , 1998 , gsa obligated roughly $353 million for the building security upgrade program nationally . we recommend that the gsa administrator direct the pbs commissioner to correct the data in gsa's upgrade tracking and accounting systems and institute procedures to accurately record approved and completed upgrades in the upgrade tracking system and accurately record obligations incurred for security upgrades in the accounting system ; review all gsa buildings to ensure that security evaluations have been complete agreements with omb on the most appropriate means of providing sufficient funding for the security of gsa - operated buildings at the minimum standard levels recommended by the doj report ; develop outcome - oriented goals and measures for its security program , identify security program evaluations to be done and implement them as appropriate , and identify the means by which fps will verify and validate measurement data related to security program goals in gsa's annual performance plan for 2000 ; and complete the internally recommended review of gsa's current security risk assessment methodology , and once the appropriate risk assessment methodology is determined , resume gsa's program of periodic building security inspections by gsa physical security specialists . specifically , we were to determine ( 1 ) what criteria gsa used to assess security risks and prioritize security upgrades for its buildings , ( 2 ) the implementation and operational status of gsa's security upgrade program and the costs gsa has incurred by both funding source and type of security upgrade , and ( 3 ) whether any problems have hindered gsa's implementation of the security upgrade program .
