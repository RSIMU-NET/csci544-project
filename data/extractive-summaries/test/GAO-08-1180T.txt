we are pleased to be here today to discuss physical and cyber security at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) . in fiscal year 2007 , lanl budgeted nearly $200 million to provide the laboratory with physical and cyber security to protect the sensitive and classified assets on which laboratory employees rely to conduct their work . a successful physical or cyber attack on nnsa sites containing nuclear weapons , the material used in nuclear weapons , or information pertaining to the people who design and maintain the u.s. nuclear deterrent could have devastating consequences for the site , its surrounding communities , and the nation's security . because of these risks , nnsa sites need effective physical and cyber security programs . more recently , in april 2008 , doe's office of independent oversight conducted an evaluation of security at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( livermore ) . in addition , in june 2008 , this committee requested that we review the status of physical security at livermore . our testimony today discusses ( 1 ) physical security at lanl , ( 2 ) preliminary observations from ongoing work on physical security at livermore , and ( 3 ) cyber security at lanl . examples of appropriate information security controls include user identification and authentication that allow computer systems to differentiate between users and verify their identities ; cryptography that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of critical and sensitive information ; configuration management that identifies and manages security features for all hardware , software , and firmware components of an information system and controls changes to them ; and audit and monitoring controls that help establish individual accountability and monitor compliance with security policies . nnsa's los alamos site office is required to conduct security surveys annually . physical security at lanl is in a period of significant improvement , and lanl is implementing over two dozen initiatives to reduce , consolidate , and better protect its classified assets , as well as reduce the physical footprint of the laboratory by closing unneeded facilities . we found that doe's office of independent oversight and the los alamos site office identified significant physical security problems at lanl that the laboratory had not fully addressed . in addition , external security evaluations had repeatedly identified concerns about the adequacy of lanl's assessments of its own security performance . lanl officials identified three management approaches that they asserted would sustain security improvements over the long term . however , these approaches were either in an early stage of development or contained important weaknesses that may impair their ability to ensure the sustainability of security improvements at the laboratory for the foreseeable future . we made three recommendations to the secretary of energy and the administrator of nnsa that , if effectively implemented , will improve physical security at lanl and help ensure that improvements lanl has achieved are sustained over the long term . during our visit to the laboratory 2 weeks ago , livermore officials told us they are finalizing corrective action plans to address deficiencies in their performance assurance and self - assessment programs and have already conducted a significant number of performance assurance tests with the protective force and on equipment since the completion of the office of independent oversight's 2008 evaluation . nnsa and the livermore site office have not always provided effective security oversight . though our observations are preliminary , livermore appears to be experiencing difficulties similar to lanl's in sustaining physical security performance . lanl has implemented measures to enhance its cyber security , but weaknesses remain in protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of information on its unclassified network . a key reason for the information security weaknesses we identified is that lanl has not yet fully implemented an information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained . the most recent reports , covering fiscal years 2006 and 2007 , documented significant weaknesses with lanl's unclassified information security program , including foreign nationals' access to the laboratory's unclassified network . although lanl cyber security officials told us that funding has been inadequate to address some of their security concerns , nnsa officials raised questions about the basis for lanl's funding request for cyber security . nnsa's chief information officer told us that lanl has not adequately justified requests for additional funds to address the laboratory's stated shortfalls . for example , we recommended that the secretary of energy and the nnsa administrator require the director of lanl to , among other things , ( 1 ) ensure that the risk assessment for the unclassified network evaluates all known vulnerabilities and is revised periodically and ( 2 ) strengthen policies with a view toward further reducing , as appropriate , foreign nationals' access to the unclassified network , particularly those from countries identified as sensitive by doe .
