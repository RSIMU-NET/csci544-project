officials at some of these police forces have raised concerns that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have caused their police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers . these concerns increased with the significant expansion of the federal air marshal program , which created numerous relatively high - paying job opportunities for existing federal uniformed police officers and reportedly lured many experienced officers from their uniformed police forces . as agreed with your offices , our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) determine the differences that exist among these federal uniformed police forces regarding entry - level pay , retirement benefits , and types of duties ; ( 2 ) provide information on the differences in turnover rates among these federal uniformed police forces , including where officers who separated from the police forces went and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available and used by the police forces to address turnover ; and ( 3 ) provide information on the possible difficulties police forces may have experienced in recruiting police officers and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available to help these police forces to recruit officers . we also interviewed officials at the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and the office of personnel management ( opm ) . four of the 13 police forces received federal law enforcement retirement benefits and received among the highest starting salaries , ranging from $37,063 to $39,427 . however , as of april 1 , 2003 , the pay gap between entry - level officers at the two forces had narrowed to $6,323 . additionally , during fiscal year 2002 , 8 of the 13 police forces experienced their highest annual turnover rates over the 6-year period , from fiscal years 1997 through 2002 . the total number of separations at all 13 police forces nearly doubled ( from 375 to 729 ) between fiscal years 2001 and 2002 . despite recruitment difficulties faced by many of the police forces , none of the police forces used important human capital recruitment flexibilities , such as recruitment bonuses and student loan repayments , in fiscal year 2002 . u.s . the number of separations across the 13 police forces included in our review increased by 354 between fiscal years 2001 and 2002 . given that tsa's federal air marshal program has now been established , and the buildup in staffing has been substantially completed , the increase in turnover experienced in fiscal year 2002 at 12 of the 13 police forces may have been a one - time occurrence . washington , d.c . table 7 shows , among other things , that during fiscal year 2002 , 12 of the 13 police forces experienced increased turnover from the prior fiscal year , while 8 of the 13 police forces experienced their highest turnover rates over the 6-year period , from fiscal years 1997 through 2002 .
