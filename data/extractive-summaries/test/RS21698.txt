within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , aerial assets are operated by the u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp's ) office of air & marine ( a&m ) . cbp utilizes advanced technology to augment its u.s. border patrol ( usbp ) agents' ability to patrol the border . both types of uavs have played key roles in recent conflicts . the recent uav modification is part of an ongoing push by some policymakers and cbp to both expand cbp's uav resources and open additional domestic airspace for uav operations along the border . on june 23 , 2010 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) granted a certificate of authorization requested by cbp , clearing the uav flights along the texas border and gulf region . other requests have reportedly been delayed due to safety concerns , some of which stem from previous incidents . despite safety concerns raised by such incidents , some policymakers continue to call for the increased domestic use of uavs . congress has directed dhs to study the feasibility of using uavs and to implement the technology to surveil the border on numerous occasions . the act also provided $10 million for the use of uavs . the supplemental appropriations bill of fy2010 ( h.r . 4899 ) would include $32 million for the acquisition of two additional uavs by a&m . as noted , the cost comparison between uavs and manned aircraft is complicated . the disparity in operating the two types of aircraft may be offset by the fact that uavs can remain in the air more than 10 times longer than the helicopters currently being used by a&m to support the usbp . "there are a number of other technologies that are capable of providing a greater level of usefulness at a far lower cost. . testing of uavs along the border has been limited . a possible issue for congress could include whether testing should be expanded before any decisions are made regarding the wide - scale use of uavs along the border . it has been noted that uavs suffer accident rates multiple times higher than manned aircraft .
