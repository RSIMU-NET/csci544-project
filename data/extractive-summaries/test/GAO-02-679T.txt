the enactment of federal welfare reform in august 1996 significantly changed federal welfare policy for low - income families with children in several ways , including establishing a 5-year lifetime limit on cash assistance . states have implemented a variety of initiatives intended to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce , including some enhancements to transitional medicaid . these initiatives have likely contributed to a drop in cash assistance caseloads of more than 50 percent from 1996 through mid - 2001 . employment in low - wage or part - time positions — which is common for these newly working individuals — frequently does not provide adequate access to affordable health insurance , whether through employer - sponsored or individually purchased health insurance , thus making transitional medicaid coverage an important option . our earlier work showed that , for the 21 states we reviewed , the implementation of transitional medicaid assistance varied across the states and that certain state practices had enhanced beneficiaries' ability to retain medicaid coverage . we also found , however , that many families did not receive their full transitional medicaid assistance benefits because they failed to report their income three times , as required , throughout the 12-month period of coverage . amending the medicaid statute to provide states with additional flexibility to ease income - reporting requirements for the coverage period of transitional medicaid assistance , as has been done for other aspects of the medicaid program , could further facilitate uninterrupted health insurance coverage for families moving from cash assistance to the workforce .
