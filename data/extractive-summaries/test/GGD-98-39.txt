this report responds to your request for information on the ( 1 ) number of igps nationwide and in irs' georgia district during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , ( 2 ) descriptions and results of igps in the state of georgia during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , and ( 3 ) controls and procedures irs has in place for igps . under its 1997 compliance initiative proposal ( cip ) , irs is attempting to link igps to a larger research framework and better manage igps to make them more useful for doing compliance research . irs examination staff can run igps in irs' national office , its 33 district offices , and its 10 service centers . over half of these igps ( 44 ) focused on four types of taxpayers: ( 1 ) businesses that potentially underreported income or overreported expense deductions ; ( 2 ) businesses that potentially did not properly report or pay taxes , such as excise taxes on fuel , chemicals , or heavy vehicle use ; ( 3 ) individual taxpayers who potentially claimed an improper exemption for dependents , a filing status ( e.g. , head of household ) , or earned income credit ; and ( 4 ) businesses and individual taxpayers who potentially did not file required tax returns . of the 76 igps , 41 were closed as of june 1997 . of the 32 projects involving audits , 23 were closed after auditing fewer than 50 returns each . for years , irs has had various controls and procedures in using igps as audit selection tools , including the approval and review of proposed projects , independence in the selection of returns , and limits on the duration of the audit phase . irs officials also review igp proposals to ensure that the project conforms with internal revenue manual requirements on igps . irs intends for these processes to introduce more rigor so that the results from igps and other projects can be used for research purposes . according to officials , irs began a total restructuring in fiscal year 1994 that reduced the number of district offices from 63 to 33 and shifted the responsibility for maintaining igp records . in addition , we reviewed examination division data for individual project results , such as the number of returns audited , total taxes recommended per audit hour and per audited return , additional taxes recommended plus penalty amounts , and the percentage of tax returns for which the audit recommended no tax change . we focused our efforts on all igps that were open at any time during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 .
