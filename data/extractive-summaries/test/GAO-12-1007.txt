these services include professional management support , information technology support , and medical support . in fiscal year 2011 , federal civilian agencies reported $161 billion in total contract obligations , of which $126 billion , or almost 80 percent , were for services . the act also requires gao to report to congress on omb's guidance , and agency implementation of the service contract inventory requirement for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 . the act also directs agencies to review their inventories within 180 days of the december 31 deadline to ensure that: each personal service contract is being performed according to laws and regulations ; the agency is giving special management attention to functions that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions ; the agency is not using contractor personnel to perform inherently governmental functions ; the agency has specific safeguards and monitoring systems in place to ensure that work performed by contractors has not changed or expanded during performance to become an inherently governmental function ; the agency is not using contractor personnel to perform critical functions that could jeopardize the ability of the agency to maintain control of its mission and operations ; and there are sufficient internal agency resources to effectively manage and oversee contracts . as a result , agencies did not report three data elements required by the statute in their fiscal year 2010 inventories — ( 1 ) the role the services played in achieving agency objectives , ( 2 ) the total dollar amount invoiced for services under the contract , and ( 3 ) the number and work location of contractor and subcontractor personnel . as a result , omb and congress cannot meaningfully use these service contract inventories to compare service contract obligations among agencies or develop spending trends , and agencies did not have a complete universe of service contracts to consider for review . progress , however , is being made towards collecting this information . for example , omb directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after march 1 , 2012 . five agencies , however , did not . one agency — dot — reported information on fiscal year 2010 obligations for its fiscal year 2011 inventory . we collected the required reports for 40 of the 49 agencies , either from their websites or omb . omb staff confirmed that the remaining 9 agencies , which accounted for less than 1 percent of civilian agency service contract obligations for fiscal year 2010 , did not submit the required information or made it publicly available . under the proposed far rule , if finalized , agencies would start collecting unavailable , but required data elements directly from contractors . although most agencies followed omb guidance for reporting on their inventory reviews , it is unclear based on the information provided in their reports whether the results of the reviews were a real indication of the agencies' effective and appropriate use of contractors or due to the different approaches used to conduct the inventory reviews . to help ensure that the service contract inventories contain consistent and reliable information and that the service contract inventory analysis reports have sufficient information to provide greater context and value , we recommend that the administrator of omb's office of federal procurement policy clarify guidance to: require agencies to fully describe in their inventory review reports the scope of the inventory reviews , including information such as the number of contracts and the percentage of contracts reviewed for each product and service code selected and the total universe of contracts ; require agencies to consistently report on the number of contractor personnel and functions that were involved with the workforce issues identified during their inventory reviews ; and require agencies to include , as part of their inventory review reports , the status of agency efforts to resolve findings identified in previous reviews until they are resolved . omb provided comments via e - mail , stating that it generally concurs with our recommendations . to assess civilian agencies' efforts to compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories , we reviewed the act and omb guidance to determine what data elements were required to be included in the service contract inventories .
