we appreciate the opportunity to testify on the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of repair stations that maintain and repair aircraft and aircraft components . our report discussed three main issues: ( 1 ) the practice of using individual inspectors in repair station inspections ; ( 2 ) the condition of inspection documentation ; and ( 3 ) current faa actions to improve the inspection process . faa was meeting its goal of inspecting every repair station at least once a year and 84 percent of the inspectors believed that the overall compliance of repair stations was good or excellent . however , more than half of the inspectors said that there were areas of compliance that repair stations could improve , such as ensuring that their personnel receive training from all airlines for which they perform work and have current maintenance manuals . we also found that while faa typically relies on individual inspectors , the use of teams of inspectors , particularly at large or complex repair stations , may be more effective at identifying problems and are more liable to uncover systemic and long - standing deficiencies . because of insufficient documentation , we were unable to determine how well faa followed up to ensure that the deficiencies found during the inspections were corrected . thus , we were not able to assess how completely or quickly repair stations were bringing themselves into compliance . because faa does not tell its inspectors what documentation to keep , the agency's ability to identify and react to trends is hampered . faa is spending more than $30 million to develop a reporting system that , among other things , is designed to enable the agency to apply its inspection resources to address those areas that pose the greatest risk to aviation safety . as we have reported in the past , this goal will not be achieved without significant improvements in the completeness of inspection records . since the may 1996 crash of a valujet dc - 9 in the florida everglades , faa has announced new initiatives to upgrade the oversight of repair stations . these initiatives were directed at clarifying and augmenting air carriers' oversight of repair stations , not at ways in which faa's own inspection resources could be better utilized . however , faa has several other efforts under way that would have a more direct bearing on its own inspection activities at repair stations . one effort would revise the regulations governing the operations at repair stations , and another would revise the regulations governing the qualifications of repair station personnel . however , the revision of the regulations began in 1989 and has been repeatedly delayed . the third effort is the addition of more faa inspectors , which should mean that more resources can be devoted to inspecting repair stations . finally , faa has recently announced a major overhaul of its entire inspection process . it is designed to systematize the process and ensure consistency in inspections and in reporting the results of these inspections so as to allow more efficient targeting of inspection resources .
