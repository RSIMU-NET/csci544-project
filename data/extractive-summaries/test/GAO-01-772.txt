despite additional funding provided by the congress to address this issue , the army is still reporting concerns about spare parts shortages . these parts shortages created inefficiencies in maintenance processes and procedures that have lowered morale of maintenance personnel . to compensate for the lack of spare parts , maintenance personnel use cannibalizations or substitutions of parts from one aircraft to another . a contributing factor , which was not identified in our review but which army and defense logistics agency officials acknowledged , was the difficulty in obtaining parts for these aging helicopters because original manufacturers may no longer be in business . these initiatives are separate from those in the army's strategic logistics plan . the team identified issues that have affected spare parts shortages , including ( 1 ) an increase in demands that led to reduced availability of reparable parts ; ( 2 ) understated times for administration and production of spare parts , which resulted in the reduced availability of consumable and reparable parts ; and ( 3 ) changes in requirements as the result of problems with parts that affected aircraft safety and readiness and minimally affected the availability of spare parts . to determine the reasons for the shortages of spare parts for the apache , blackhawk , and chinook helicopters , we obtained computerized lists of spare parts that caused the helicopters to be not mission capable from the army aviation and missile command from october 1999 through july 2000 and from the defense supply center , richmond , virginia , for fiscal year 2000 . repair kit 19 .
