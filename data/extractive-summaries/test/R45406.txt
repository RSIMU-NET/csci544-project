congress passed the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act on march 23 , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) . fy2019 began with seven appropriations bills , including usda , unfinished . the house and senate appropriations committees reported agriculture appropriations bills for fy2019 ( h.r . 5961 , s. 2976 ) , with the senate having amended and passed its version as division c of a four - bill minibus ( h.r . 6147 ) . congress and the president approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through december 21 , 2018 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . after december 21 , 2018 , a partial shutdown of the government , including many agencies within usda , occurred . one of the few exceptions was the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) , which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown . on january 25 , 2019 , an agreement was reached to continue funding for usda and other appropriations that had lapsed through february 15 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . 116-5 ) . the fy2019 consolidated appropriations act was signed into law on february 15 , 2019 , funding usda through the end of the fiscal year ( division b , p.l . 116-6 ) . for a general analysis of the fy2018 appropriations for agriculture , see crs report r45128 , agriculture and related agencies: fy2018 appropriations , and for fy2019 , see crs report r45230 , agriculture and related agencies: fy2019 appropriations . these include working land programs , land retirement and easement programs , watershed programs , technical assistance , and other programs . the two lead agricultural conservation agencies within usda are the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) , which provides technical assistance and administers most conservation programs , and the farm service agency ( fsa ) , which administers the conservation reserve program ( crp ) . most conservation program funding is mandatory , obtained through the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) and authorized in omnibus farm bills ( about $5.3 billion of ccc funds for conservation in fy2018 ) . other conservation programs — mostly technical assistance — are discretionary spending and are funded through annual appropriations ( about $1 billion annually ) . for the first time since fy2002 , the fy2018 agriculture appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs . similarly , the fy2019 appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs ; however , the enacted 2018 farm bill ( agriculture improvement act , p.l . 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs . the fy2018 appropriations act included a slight increase from fy2017 levels for discretionary conservation programs . the fy2019 appropriations act included a decrease from fy2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new farm production and conservation business center ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) . usda published contingency plans for each agency , including nrcs . as such , nrcs was initially able to claim as excepted 100% of its 9,342 staff using mandatory conservation program funding authorized through the farm bill ( and therefore not affected by the lapse in discretionary appropriations ) , and discretionary carryover funding from prior fiscal years . while this practice is infrequent and subject to various procedural rules and limitations , the agriculture appropriations bill may serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs . in some cases , the 2018 farm bill further amended the conservation programs that were amended in the fy2018 appropriations act . in addition to setting budgetary amounts , the agriculture appropriations bill may also include policy - related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out an appropriation . the fy2018 and fy2019 enacted appropriations also include a policy provision that waives the 250,000-acre project limit when the project's primary purpose is something other than flood prevention .
