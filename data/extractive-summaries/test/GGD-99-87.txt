our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what state regulators were doing to oversee the year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry , ( 2 ) how the regulatory oversight of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness compared with the oversight of the banking and securities industries , ( 3 ) the current status of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness , and ( 4 ) the nature and extent of year 2000 liability exposures that insurers face and the mitigation efforts taken to address such exposures . such variations raise a question about the extent to which states can rely on one another's judgments regarding the preparedness of nondomiciled companies doing business in their states . this would be especially problematic when relying on states where the level of year 2000 oversight activity is relatively limited or the criteria for assessing readiness may be considered too lax . variations in the year 2000 oversight activities of state insurance regulators raise a question about the reliability of regulatory information on the year 2000 readiness of insurers and the validity of related assessments . in general , insurance regulators also were less active in planning for and pursuing formal enforcement actions against companies identified as remiss in their year 2000 efforts or in danger of not being ready for the date change . in our january survey of 17 state regulators , we asked the following question: “based on your knowledge to date , how many domiciled insurance companies does your state consider to be at a high risk of not being year 2000 ready ? ” five states were confident that none of their domiciled insurers were at a high risk of not being year 2000 ready . the effectiveness of these efforts , however , remains uncertain because insurers face various potential marketplace and legal challenges . also , the level of regulatory activity to promote and assess insurance companies' year 2000 readiness and to validate self - reported information on readiness varied widely by state . at present , the magnitude of costs associated with claims and legal defenses for year 2000-related mishaps is not yet estimable but has the potential to be substantial for some property - casualty insurers . moreover , variations in oversight approaches among state regulators also made it difficult to ascertain the overall status of the insurance industry's year 2000 preparedness . a recorded menu will provide information on how to obtain these lists .
