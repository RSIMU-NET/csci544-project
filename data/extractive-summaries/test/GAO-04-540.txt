part of its reform strategy is to find more efficient ways to procure goods and services . since fiscal year 2000 , with the help of supply chain management initiatives , the postal service reported that it has saved about $866 million by leveraging its buying power and insisting on continuous improvement . to assist congressional efforts to enact fundamental postal reform , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the postal service has been successful in implementing and realizing savings from its supply chain management initiatives and ( 2 ) whether these initiatives have had an effect on small businesses . the postal service has had mixed success in implementing the supply chain management initiatives we reviewed . however , some of the claimed savings from reverse auctions were overstated , and we could not validate the $71.1 million in reported savings and revenue from the national contracts we reviewed because the postal service lacked accurate baseline data on what had been spent on the commodities before the supply chain management initiative . one has to do with profit . second , effective implementation has been hampered by the postal service's lack of success in bringing new fueling locations into the bulk fuel program . because of the success of this pilot effort , the postal service plans to use the system for all contracts under the bulk fuel program . prior to its use of national contracts , the postal service purchased corrugated boxes , custodial products , labels , retail packaging , and tires from a large number of suppliers . we could not gauge the effect on small businesses as a result of the other supply chain management initiatives we reviewed — the bulk fuel program and reverse auctions for highway contracts — because contracting officers and highway contractors used incorrect small business size standards and , consequently , the reported small business dollar amounts are unreliable . postal service officials have corrected this form . further , there is no mechanism in place to hold postal service officials accountable for implementing the postal service's objective of ensuring a continuing focus on , and improvement in , its relationships with small and diverse businesses . to improve small business reporting and participation train contracting officers on the appropriate size standards for different types of businesses and direct them to post the proper standard in the solicitation ; direct contracting officers and other acquisition personnel to ( 1 ) explore during acquisition planning ways that small business participation can be addressed in a supply chain management environment and ( 2 ) document their decisions ; and finally , establish targets for small business participation in postal service contracts . we did not validate these reported savings or determine the extent to which postal service buyers were using the contracts .
