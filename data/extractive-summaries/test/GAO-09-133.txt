the integrated wireless network ( iwn ) was intended to be a collaborative effort among the departments of justice ( doj ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and the treasury to provide secure , seamless , interoperable , and reliable nationwide wireless communications in support of federal agents and officers engaged in law enforcement , protective services , homeland defense , and disaster response missions . to address this objective , we reviewed and analyzed documentation from doj , dhs , and the treasury to determine the status of iwn , interviewed officials from each department about the extent to which they are collaborating with the other departments on iwn or on an alternative joint radio communications solution , reviewed and analyzed documentation for independent radio communications projects at doj and dhs to identify actions the departments are taking to improve their radio communications systems , reviewed and analyzed past and present agreements among the departments to determine the extent to which a governance structure is in place that enables effective collaboration , and compared collaboration activities performed by the departments to selected practices previously identified by gao as helpful to sustaining collaboration among federal agencies . instead of focusing on a joint solution , the departments have begun independently modernizing their own wireless communications systems . while doj and the treasury ( and later dhs ) collaborated on a pilot demonstration of iwn in the seattle / blaine area that continues to provide service to multiple agencies , the departments have determined that this specific system design cannot be implemented on a nationwide scale , and they have not acted collaboratively to identify an alternative approach for a jointly coordinated communications solution . in addition , the formal governance structure that was established among the three departments has been disbanded , and the contract for developing a new iwn design , awarded over a year and a half ago , is not being used jointly by the departments for this purpose . currently , doj is planning to implement a nationwide network for its component agencies , and dhs and its components are pursuing numerous independent solutions . a primary reason why the collaboration on a joint communications solution has not been successful is that the departments did not effectively employ key cross - agency collaboration practices . while dhs considers improving radio communications at the nation's borders to be a major priority , doj's priorities are in other areas . as a result , while the departments now have several initiatives aimed at high - level coordination , none are focused on developing a joint communications solution . while department officials have signed an updated memorandum of understanding related to coordinating their radio communications projects , they have not made any progress in reestablishing a joint governance structure and decision - making procedures to address the challenges of collaborating on a joint communications solution . further , these efforts will not ensure the interoperability needed to serve day - to - day law enforcement operations or a coordinated response to terrorist or other events . specifically , they could not agree on a common outcome or purpose to overcome their differences in missions , cultures , and established ways of doing business ; they have not established a collaborative governance structure with a process for decision making and resolving disputes ; and they have not developed a joint strategy for moving forward . in abandoning collaboration on a joint solution , the departments risk duplication of effort and inefficient use of resources as they continue to invest significant resources in independent solutions . doj and dhs program officials have both acknowledged doj , dhs , and treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution that differing priorities led to an inability to resolve conflicts .
