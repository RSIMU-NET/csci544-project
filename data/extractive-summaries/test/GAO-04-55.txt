for traditional wireline phones , most areas across the country now employ “enhanced 911” ( e911 ) services , where the caller's address automatically appears on - screen for the 911 call taker . however , implementing wireless e911 is inherently more challenging than wireline e911 . there are more than 6,000 of these answering points nationwide , often at a county or city level . the wireless communications and public safety act of 1999 designated 911 as the universal emergency telephone number within the united states and called on fcc to encourage and support efforts by the states to deploy wireless e911 services by working with state and local officials , the telecommunications industry , consumer groups , and those involved in public safety services.there is also a congressional e911 caucus that aims to educate lawmakers , constituents , and communities about the importance of 911 systems.you asked us to provide an overview of the deployment of wireless e911 services across the country . phase ii wireless e911 service is more complex to implement than phase i because of the need to install equipment to determine the geographic coordinates of the caller , transfer that information through the telephone networks , and have a mapping system in place at the psap that can display the latitude and longitude coordinates of the caller as a map location for dispatching assistance . another federal agency with an interest in this issue is dot . according to nena , as of october 2003 , nearly 65 percent of psaps nationwide had implemented phase i wireless e911 services , which provides the call taker with the callback number and the location of the cell tower and cell sector receiving the 911 call . currently , the dot / nena database does not differentiate between psaps that will need to be upgraded and those that will not , which limits usefulness of the database in accurately assessing progress toward full wireless e911 implementation . as the estimates from state contacts indicate , no clear picture is emerging on when phase ii will be fully deployed nationwide , raising the prospect of piecemeal availability of this service across the country for an indefinite number of years to come . other states evenly divided the funds among counties or psaps . while fcc requires wireless carriers to implement e911 , the commission has not mandated as a prerequisite to implementation that the carriers be reimbursed for their e911 expenses.although responses to our survey showed that 32 states and the district of columbia allow wireless carriers to recover their e911 costs from the state funding mechanism , state e911 contacts sometimes reported that it might be difficult for the carriers to recoup all of their e911 costs . these state coordinators perform tasks such as educating psaps about their wireless e911 responsibilities , providing technical assistance to psaps , bringing all parties together early on to discuss implementation issues and providing a single point of contact for all the parties , and lobbying for e911 funding and protecting the funding from being used for purposes unrelated to wireless e911 implementation . fcc and dot have been involved in the implementation of wireless e911 , but federal authority in overseeing the deployment is limited because of the traditional state and local jurisdiction over emergency response services . beyond enforcing deadlines on wireless carriers , fcc has taken actions to identify both roadblocks and best practices in wireless e911 implementation . 5 . in addition , this report will be available at no cost on the gao web site at http: / / www.gao.gov .
