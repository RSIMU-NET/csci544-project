several incidents in particular — contaminated air at naval air facility atsugi , japan ; contaminated air due to open burn pits in afghanistan and iraq ; and contaminated water at camp lejeune , north carolina — have recently garnered considerable congressional , public , and media attention . section 314 of the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 set out a number of congressional findings related to military environmental exposures and directed gao to conduct an assessment of possible exposures of individuals to environmental hazards while living and working on military installations.that mandate , our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which dod has policies for identifying and responding to possible human exposures to environmental hazards on its installations , ( 2 ) what programs currently exist to provide health care and compensation to individuals for health conditions resulting from environmental exposures on military installations and any factors that may affect how these individuals obtain access to health care or compensation , and ( 3 ) what features of alternative federal programs that provide medical benefits or compensation to large groups of individuals affected by a specific environmental exposure may be considered as possible options in the design of any future programs for individuals harmed by environmental hazards . dod has four types of policies to address aspects of environmental exposure: ( 1 ) environmental restoration policies that require the services to identify and respond to hazardous releases at military installations , ( 2 ) occupational and environmental health policies that require the services to identify and respond to unsafe or unhealthy activities in dod workplaces , ( 3 ) deployment health policies that require the services to collect and analyze occupational and environmental health data for individuals deployed in military operations in order to help identify environmental exposures , and ( 4 ) public health emergency management policies that establish general guidance for responding to specific situations ( see fig . in many cases , obtaining compensation for an environmental exposure further depends on an individual's ability to establish causation between an exposure and the adverse health condition , but this is often difficult because scientific research has not always established a clear link between the contaminant and an adverse health effect . certain individuals have legal standing under the federal tort claims act to file a lawsuit against the u.s. government for damages due to an environmental exposure under some circumstances . but damages under the federal tort claims act are not available to other types of individuals , and for certain types of claims , due to legal precedent or statutes . l. no . the radiation exposure compensation program and the energy employees occupational illness compensation program resolve claims in a nonadversarial manner ; thus , claims are adjudicated through a process in which the adjudicator investigates the facts of the case to determine the eligibility of the claimant.adversarial ; thus , claims are adjudicated through a process in which two opposing parties , such as the coal miner and his former employer , present their arguments for and against awarding compensation , and in contrast , the black lung program is responsibility for the payment of benefits is assigned to the liable party if the claim is approved . departments of labor and justice officials told us that when programs provide outreach and assistance to potential claimants both claimants and administrators benefit because the filed claims are more complete and contain fewer errors . however , this policy does not apply retroactively to past events such as those at camp lejeune . as such , dod cannot ensure that it has taken timely and appropriate responses to all public health risks . furthermore , because dod does not have a policy establishing when it is appropriate for installations to request public health assessments or follow - up work beyond the initial assessment of proposed national priorities list sites by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry , dod could be missing opportunities to identify and resolve concerns about some health threats . in its comments , dod partially concurred with our first recommendation and did not concur with our second and third recommendations . we continue to believe our recommendations remain valid , as discussed in the report . as noted in our report , the tracking system data provided to gao indicated that dod did not have information on the status of dod's response to 80 percent of the recommendations . without these improvements , dod is missing opportunities to ensure that vital public health issues are adequately addressed . we disagree . the objectives of our report were to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has policies for identifying and responding to possible human exposures to environmental hazards on its installations ; ( 2 ) what programs currently exist to provide health care and compensation to individuals for adverse health conditions resulting from environmental exposures on military installations and any factors that may affect these individuals' access to health care or compensation ; and ( 3 ) the features of alternative federal programs that provide medical benefits or compensation to large groups of individuals affected by a specific environmental exposure , which may be considered as possible options in the design of any future programs for individuals harmed by environmental hazards .
