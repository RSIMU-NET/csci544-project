fragmentation of care delivery can lead to poor quality of care , medical errors , inefficient delivery of services , higher costs , and patient dissatisfaction . the health care safety net act of 2008 directed gao to report on integrated health system models that integrate primary , specialty , and acute care and serve uninsured and medically underserved populations . we provided an oral briefing to congressional staff on october 8 , 2009 . the 15 idss vary in many aspects , including the degree to which they are integrated , specific organizational features , and payer mix ( e.g. , extent to which they serve medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured ) ( see app . i ) . we administered a structured interview protocol with chief medical officers ( or other system officials , as appropriate ) to obtain information on organizational features that idss use to support strategies to improve patient care ; approaches idss use to facilitate access to care for underserved populations ; and challenges idss encounter in providing care , including care provided to underserved populations . findings in this report are based on a judgmental sample and are not generalizable to all idss . the 15 idss in our sample collectively reported that organizational features such as using electronic health records ( ehr ) , operating health insurance plans , and employing physicians all support various strategies for improving patient care , including care coordination , disease management , and use of care protocols . officials at some idss in our sample told us that using ehrs supports their strategies to improve the quality of patient care by increasing the availability of clinical information and patient population data and by improving communication . officials from idss in our sample reported that operating a health insurance plan can support patient care strategies by providing to the ids both financial resources , such as savings resulting from reducing avoidable hospitalizations for health plan members , and data on health insurance plan members . ids officials reported that financial resources could be used to fund services such as care coordination — which many insurers do not reimburse — and the data could be used as a basis for implementing strategies such as disease management . employing physicians , rather than relying solely on community - based physicians who are not employed by the system , may facilitate strategies to improve the quality of patient care at an ids , in part because of the ids's ability to require or encourage certain aspects of care and to monitor certain aspects of the care employed physicians provide . officials from several idss told us that employment of physicians can facilitate provision of care to underserved populations because compensation from idss can mitigate physicians' concerns that they may not receive payment from uninsured patients . these include providing community - based care , conducting outreach , helping patients apply for coverage programs , providing financial assistance , integrating mental health and primary care services , and collaborating with community organizations . federally qualified health centers ( fqhc ) officials from several idss reported either operating or collaborating with fqhcs to provide care to underserved populations . to improve access to mental health care services for patients , including for underserved populations , some idss integrate mental health and primary care services by providing mental health screenings in primary care locations or collocating mental health providers in primary care settings . for example , intermountain and geisinger provide financial assistance to local health clinics . other operational challenges idss reported included finding specialty care for underserved patients , including mental health care ; sharing information with providers outside the system ; and changing management and physician cultures to adapt to organizational change . officials from some idss told us about challenges they faced as their systems have evolved , in particular , difficulty in changing management and physician cultures and in implementing an ehr . some ids officials said that implementing an ehr system is financially and operationally challenging .
