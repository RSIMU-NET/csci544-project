there has been increased concern over the size and sustainability of the united states' recent deficits and the country's long - run budget outlook . this concern has brought the issues of the federal government's revenue needs and fundamental reform of the tax system to the forefront of congressional debates . one place congress may turn to address these issues is the set of tax benefits for homeowners . the joint committee on taxation ( jct ) has estimated that the cost to the federal government in terms of foregone revenue from these benefits will be approximately $136.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2017 . economists have identified the set of tax benefits for homeowners as one area in which reform may improve economic efficiency . this report focuses on the two largest federal tax benefits available to homeowners â€” the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for state and local property taxes . the goals of this report are five - fold: ( 1 ) briefly summarize the trends in homeownership ; ( 2 ) provide an overview of what tax benefits are available ; ( 3 ) analyze the rationales commonly provided for offering such benefits ; ( 4 ) analyze the effect of the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction on the homeownership rate , housing consumption , and the economy ; and ( 5 ) present policy options . these long - term trends in homeownership behavior may be overshadowed by more recent trends in foreclosures . the three most expensive tax incentives in the jct's estimate are the mortgage interest deduction ( $77.3 billion annually ) , the itemized state and local property tax deduction ( $31.5 billion annually ) , and the exclusion of capital gains on the sale of a principal residence ( $26.5 billion annually ) . first , a high homeownership rates may bestow certain benefits to society as a whole such as higher property values , lower crime , and higher civic participation , among others . and lastly , homeownership may have a positive effect on living conditions , which can lead to a healthier population . this section analyzes these questions in turn . in addition , the decrease in home prices could lead to a reduction in new home construction , a reduction in homeowner wealth , and the possibility of higher defaults since some homeowners could find themselves underwater on their mortgages . if the policy objective of congress is to promote homeownership through the tax code , and congress believes the mortgage interest and property tax deductions increase homeownership , then limiting the deductions to more effectively target the benefits is an option . it could be argued that the deductions provide a tax benefit to a large number of taxpayers that would become homeowners regardless if they existed or not . in 2005 , president george w. bush's advisory panel on federal tax reform ( tax reform panel ) also proposed replacing the mortgage interest deduction with a credit .
