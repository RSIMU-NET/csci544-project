many committees now use email , official websites , blogs , youtube channels , twitter , and facebook pages to communicate — technologies that were either nonexistent or not widely available until recently . the communication strategies of congressional committees have changed with the development of these online social networking services . these technologies have arguably served to enhance the ability of committees to share information directly with stakeholder groups , including other members , federal agencies , and individual private citizens . this report examines how congressional committees are using social media . this includes how social media is altering how members organize and manage their personal and committee offices and impacting the ability of members to gather support for political and policy goals . after providing an overview and background of social media platforms , the report analyzes patterns of committee use of twitter and facebook during a 4½ - month period in 2013 and discusses three potential implications of social media for committees in congress: increased direct interaction with the public , real - time interaction with advocacy groups , and outreach of public constituencies . unlike postal letters , technology has reduced the marginal cost of communications . perhaps most importantly , they may transform the very nature of representation in the united states . as with any new technology , the number of committees using twitter and facebook and the patterns of use may change rapidly . thus , the conclusions drawn from these data cannot be easily generalized nor can these results be used to predict future committee behavior . consequently , committee communications often took place through press releases and committee websites . twitter and facebook have the potential to allow the committee to field ideas or hearing questions in real time from interested parties . the representational communication activities of both members and citizens are constrained by cost .
