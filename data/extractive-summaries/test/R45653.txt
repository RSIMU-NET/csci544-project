through its investigative powers , congress gathers information it considers necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary . when congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information , or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is considered inappropriate or unavailing , a subpoena — either for testimony or documents — may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands . an individual — whether a member of the public or an executive branch official — has a legal obligation to comply with a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena , unless a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification permits non - compliance . the subpoena , however , is only as effective as the means by which it is potentially enforced . without a process by which congress can coerce compliance or deter non - compliance , the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information . congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat non - compliance with subpoenas . the two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government . first , the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena . once the contempt citation is received , any later prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch . second , congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply . this process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands . but legislative leverage and the subpoena enforcement mechanisms do not always ensure congressional access to requested information , particularly from the executive branch . recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate — at least in the relatively rare instance that enforcement is necessary to respond to a current or former executive branch official who has refused to comply with a subpoena . each house. . the power could , for example , be used to remedy physical obstruction of the legislative body in the discharge of its duties , or physical assault upon its members for action taken or words spoken in the body , or obstruction of its officers in the performance of their official duties , or the prevention of members from attending so that their duties might be performed , or finally with contumacy in refusing to obey orders to produce documents or give testimony which there was a right to compel . that said , the prevailing enforcement mechanisms of criminal contempt of congress and civil enforcement , both of which rely on the assistance and participation of the other branches of government , have certain drawbacks that arguably limit their effectiveness in ensuring timely compliance with congressional subpoenas by executive branch officials .
