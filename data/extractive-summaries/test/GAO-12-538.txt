you asked us to review fema's management and training of daes . in a february 2012 fema town hall meeting , fema's administrator acknowledged that there are inconsistencies across the fema regions , and noted that due to differences in how regions operate , it is problematic to deploy someone based in one region to another during a disaster.cadre manager we interviewed cited inconsistency in policy application saying , “there is an ongoing problem of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing with respect to when policies are implemented or are in conflict with one another” . which describes fema's mission , purpose , and defines the agency's principles , fema advocates the practice of consistent decision making by those with authority to act.monitoring of the regional implementation of dae policies and procedures , as well as how daes implement disaster policies , could help provide fema with reasonable assurance that disaster assistance is being implemented by daes in accordance with policy and consistently across regions . as fema implements its disaster workforce transformation , developing a plan with time frames and milestones for how it will better communicate cadre - specific policies , procedures , and other information to daes when they are not deployed would provide fema with a roadmap to help ensure that it is providing daes the tools they need to be prepared for disaster deployments . fema has not established standardized hiring criteria for prospective daes , and fema headquarters provides limited guidance to regions on which to base dae salary determinations . iwmo and occhco officials noted in march 2012 that performance management is a critical component of the supervision of daes and stated that it must be improved in fiscal year 2012 during fema's disaster workforce transformation effort . in addition , 13 of 16 regional cadre managers stated that the appraisal process could be improved in various ways , such as implementing a rating scale instead of a pass / fail rating . by providing clear criteria and guidance for assigning ratings , as well as how the ratings are to be used , fema could help to ensure that daes' performance appraisals better reflect actual performance and provide managers with information to better inform performance management decisions . fema does not have a plan to ensure that all daes receive required training under fqs , which would ensure accountability for qualifying daes . thirteen of 16 regional cadre managers said that they would like more opportunities for daes to receive training . without a systematic process to track training costs , fema does not have a complete picture of training , including its total costs . fema relies heavily upon daes to respond to disasters . the agency has taken steps to improve the program , such as establishment of a credentialing program , fqs , and a planned transformation of the dae program ; however , it is too soon to assess the extent to which these efforts will address the challenges we identified with fema's management of the dae program , the workforce , and training . furthermore , fema's decentralized structure allows for flexibility ; however , establishing a mechanism to ensure ongoing monitoring of regional implementation of dae policies and procedures and daes' implementation of fema's disaster policies and procedures can assist management in ensuring that disaster assistance is conducted in accordance with policy and consistently applied across regions . further , fema's human capital controls do not adhere to internal control standards for hiring , compensation , and performance appraisals . moreover , fema's management of dae training is not consistent with training key practices for planning and tracking training costs . establishing a plan with milestones for training daes would provide fema with a roadmap to train its dae workforce and ensure accountability for qualifying daes under fqs . establish standardized criteria for hiring daes that include defined qualifications and skill sets to make hiring decisions and salary determinations ; 5 . in regards to the sixth recommendation , that fema establish a plan with milestones to ensure all daes have opportunities to participate in training and are qualified , dhs agreed and stated that as part of the changes in the dae program through the disaster reservist program , fema will ensure that all daes have opportunities to participate in training and are qualified to serve in a primary disaster - specific job title on the basis of fema's force structure requirements . the objectives of this report were to determine ( 1 ) to what extent does the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) have policies and procedures in place to govern the disaster assistance employee ( dae ) program ; ( 2 ) to what extent are fema's human capital controls over the dae workforce consistent with internal control standards ; and ( 3 ) to what extent does fema's dae training incorporate key attributes of effective training and development programs . the results of the focus groups are not generalizable .
