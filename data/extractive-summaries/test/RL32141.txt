congress recently completed action on the bush administration's fy2004 supplemental budgetrequest to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan .  ( 1 ) a majorissue in the congressional debate on this , and other such supplementals of the past , is whethermilitary and peacekeeping operations should be funded with supplemental requests or via the regulardefense appropriations process . some members of congress have urged the president to include thecosts of current and future operations in iraq and afghanistan in the department of defense's ( dod's ) regular appropriations , arguing that these are now ongoing operations that should beplanned for and funded in the annual defense budget . others prefer supplementals due to theunpredictability of military and peacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan . thisunpredictability , they argue , makes it extremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type ofoperation in advance . this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations , supplemental appropriations , or acombination of the two . table 1 shows that since 1990 , congress generally has funded combatoperations with supplemental appropriations . in initial post - combat peacekeeping operations,however , congress has tended to rely on a combination of supplemental and regular appropriations . as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing , congress has switched to using regularappropriations .
