in accordance with united states law , the u.s. government places conditions on the use of defense articles and defense services transferred by it to foreign recipients . violation of these conditions can lead to the suspension of deliveries or termination of the contracts for such defense items , among other things . on occasion , the president has indicated that such violations by foreign countries "may" have occurred , raising the prospect that termination of deliveries to or imposition of other penalties on such nations might take place . however , since the major revision of u.s. arms export law in 1976 , neither the president nor the congress have actually determined that a "substantial violation" did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act . this report reviews the pertinent sections of u.s. law governing permissible uses of u.s. - origin defense equipment and services by foreign nations , presidential and congressional options for dealing with such violations , and illustrative actions previously taken by the united states in response to possible violations . section 3 ( a ) of the arms export control act sets the general standards for countries or international organizations to be eligible to receive united states defense articles and defense services provided under this act . it also sets express conditions on the uses to which these defense items may be put . section 3 ( c ) of the arms export control act further sets out the circumstances under which a nation may lose ( a ) its u.s. foreign military financing , ( b ) its loan guarantees for purchases of u.s. defense articles and services , ( c ) its rights to have previously purchased u.s. defense articles or services delivered , ( d ) its rights to have previously made agreements for the sale of u.s. defense articles or services carried out . section 3 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( b ) of the aeca adds that , under the above conditions: "[n]o cash sales or deliveries pursuant to previous sales may be made...." section 3 ( g ) of the arms export control act , enacted in november 1999 , further requires that: any agreement for the sale or lease of any article on the united states munitions list entered into by the united states government after the date of enactment of this subsection [november 29 , 1999 ] shall state that the united states government retains the right to verify credible reports that such article has been used for a purpose not authorized under section 4 or , if such agreement provides that such article may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 4 , for a purpose not authorized under such agreement . other restrictions on military aid to argentina were already in place . the pertinent segment of that 1952 agreement between israel and the united states reads as follows: the government of israel assures the united states government that such equipment , materials , or services as may be acquired from the united states ... are required for and will be used solely to maintain its internal security , its legitimate self - defense , or to permit it to participate in the defense of the area of which it is a part , or in united nations collective security arrangements and measures , and that it will not undertake any act of aggression against any other state .
