export assistance centers . useac staff and customers , and officials of nonfederal partner organizations told us that , because of the useacs , u.s. firms are more knowledgeable about and have access to a broader range of federal and nonfederal export services . of the 28 customers who acknowledged receiving services from a second useac agency , 11 ( 40 percent ) indicated that they had found the second agency by themselves , rather than through their useac contact . for example , we learned that individuals at certain useacs were reluctant to recommend the services of another agency , even to clients who expressed a need , because they were unfamiliar with that agency's performance in delivering the service . currently , each agency appraises its own staff . to further improve the quality of services to customers , useac directors and staff acknowledged their need for a useac - wide , computer - based client tracking system . eximbank staff used an off - the - shelf computer program for maintaining information on customers . commerce , eximbank , and sba officials recently told us that they have agreed to allocate expenses based on a formula that reflects the limited capabilities of ita's financial accounting system . based on our review , we recommend that the secretary of commerce , working with the chairman of the eximbank and the administrator of sba give all useac directors the authority to contribute to the performance appraisals of all useac staff with regard to intra - useac cooperation and teamwork ( including development of an appropriate performance factor for staff appraisals and performance measures ) , establish a useac - specific customer tracking system that contains information on clients and services provided to them , and set up an accounting system that accurately tracks the full costs of creating and operating the useac network and , as part of that process , incorporate ways to give useac directors greater authority over useac expenditures . the surveys were completed anonymously .
