since its inception 36 years ago , the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) has combined the development of flood maps to identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding with mitigation efforts to reduce or eliminate flood risks to people and property and the availability of insurance that property owners can purchase to protect themselves from flood losses . the maps are principally used by ( 1 ) the approximately 20,000 communities participating in the nfip to adopt and enforce the program's minimum building standards for new construction within the maps' identified floodplains , ( 2 ) fema to develop accurate flood insurance policy rates based on flood risk , and ( 3 ) federally regulated mortgage lenders to identify those property owners who are statutorily required to purchase federal flood insurance . as part of map modernization , fema has promoted the use of a variety of advanced technologies to improve the accuracy of flood maps . these maps are more restrictive than the fema maps , which are used for setting insurance rates . in developing the new data system to update flood maps across the nation , fema's intent is to develop and incorporate flood risk data that are of a level of specificity and accuracy commensurate with communities' relative flood risks . according to fema , there is a direct relationship between the types , quantity , and detail of the data and analysis used for map development and the costs associated with obtaining and analyzing those data . however , fema has not yet established standards on the appropriate data and level of analysis required to develop maps based on risk level . according to fema , 38 states have begun drafting such plans . such a strategy could focus on how to assist these potential partners in garnering community resources and developing technological capabilities , how to coordinate with other agencies in their state , and how to integrate these efforts with fema's community outreach efforts to gain community support for mapping activities . one element of effective program management is establishing performance measures to determine how well fema is achieving its map modernization program objectives . fema's outreach strategy for involving stakeholders in map modernization appears to be reasonable . such standards can also help fema to target its map modernization resources more efficiently by matching the level of data collection and analysis with the level of flood risk . to help ensure that fema's map modernization achieves the intended benefits of improved flood mitigation , increased flood insurance participation , and improved multi - hazard mitigation and risk management capabilities through the production of more accurate and accessible flood maps , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the undersecretary of emergency preparedness and response to take the following four actions: develop and implement data standards that will enable fema , its contractor , and its state and local partners to identify and use consistent data collection and analysis methods for communities with similar risk .
