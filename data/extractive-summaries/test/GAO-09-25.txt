enrollment in these plans increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in june 2004 to about 2.3 million beneficiaries in june 2008 . about one - quarter of beneficiaries enrolled in ma plans in june 2008 were enrolled in a pffs plan , and 99 percent of medicare beneficiaries in 2008 had access to a pffs plan â€” up from 41 percent in 2005 . beneficiaries in pffs plans had projected health care expenditures that were 7 percent less than those of beneficiaries in other ma plans and 10 percent less than beneficiaries in medicare ffs . in addition , even if pffs plans covered the services as medically necessary , some pffs beneficiaries may have experienced substantially higher cost sharing if they or their providers did not contact their plans before receiving certain services . cms officials stated that pffs plans should not have used this term because pffs plans are not permitted to deny coverage for services when prior plan approval was not obtained . if pffs beneficiaries or their providers did not contact their plan before receiving a service to obtain an advance coverage determination , beneficiaries may have been responsible for the entire cost of the service if coverage for it was later denied by the plan because it was not medically necessary . however , these terms and conditions did not specify the penalty , if any , for not complying with this requirement . one plan increased the coinsurance rate for durable medical equipment and prosthetic devices from 30 percent to 70 percent for items that cost more than $750 if beneficiaries or their providers did not prenotify . however , pffs beneficiaries were more likely than other ma beneficiaries to be in a plan with high disenrollment rates . also , beneficiaries in pffs plans who resided in urban areas were more likely than rural beneficiaries to disenroll , but this was not the case for other ma plans . as of august 2008 , this information was available through moc based on data for 2004 and 2005 . we recommend that the acting administrator of cms take the following three actions: investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in pffs plans are faced with unexpected out - of - pocket costs due to the denial of coverage when they did not obtain an advance coverage determination from their plan ; ensure that cms guidance on prior authorization accurately reflects cms policy and that pffs plan materials conform to cms requirements ; and mail to medicare beneficiaries ma plan disenrollment rates for the previous 2 years for ma plans that are or will be available in their areas , as required by statute , and update disenrollment rates provided to medicare beneficiaries through moc . this appendix explains the scope and methodology that we used to address our reporting objectives that ( 1 ) compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in private fee - for - service ( pffs ) plans to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs ; ( 2 ) describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in pffs plans face , compared to beneficiaries in other medicare advantage ( ma ) plans and medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) , if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving services ; and ( 3 ) compare the rates at which beneficiaries in pffs plans disenroll to the rates for other ma plans and evaluate whether the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) met statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries . to compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in pffs plans , specifically age , gender , and residential location , to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs , we used medicare enrollment data from cms for april 2007 from the management information integrated repository ( miir ) database and data from cms on the average risk score for each ma plan in 2007 , which provide an indicator of the health status of the plan's beneficiaries .
