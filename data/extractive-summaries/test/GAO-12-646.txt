since that time , gsa has collected rent from tenant agencies , deposited it into the fbf , and used that money to fund its real property acquisition , operation , maintenance , and disposal . historically , however , the fund has not generated sufficient revenues to meet all needs . our overall approach to addressing these topics was to ( 1 ) review laws , studies , and gao , gsa inspector general , and congressional research service reports on federal real property and the fbf ; ( 2 ) analyze data and documents pertaining to the fund's balance , including budget requests and appropriations acts from fiscal years 2006 to 2012 ; ( 3 ) evaluate the financial performance of gsa's real property portfolio of approximately 10,000 assets based on data from fiscal years 2006 through 2011 ; ( 4 ) analyze data maintained by gsa on the identified repairs needed in its owned assets ; ( 5 ) compare gsa capital investment practices to leading practices for making capital investment decisions identified in the office of management and budget's ( omb ) capital programming guide and gao's executive guide ; ( 6 ) interview gsa officials and omb staff on the state of gsa's real property portfolio ; and ( 7 ) review the four highest cost repairs and alterations projects of gsa's fiscal year 2012 budget submission to assess data used to determine project requirements and how gsa evaluated project alternatives . the increased balance has primarily resulted from the growing difference between the resources deposited into the fbf and use of these funds as determined through the budgeting and appropriations process . for example , in fiscal year 2012 congress provided about 16 percent less than the president's budget request . gsa officials also stated that the authorization to obligate and spend the balance of funds in the fbf , which it anticipates will double to $4.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2013 , would enhance the agency's ability to manage its real property portfolio by ensuring that operations and maintenance are sufficiently funded and that capital investments , such as repairs and alterations and new construction projects , can continue to be made . rather , since 2008 , gsa has consistently requested obligational authority less than the total resources available in the fund . revenue . while the fbf as a whole has generated positive funds from operations , portions of gsa's inventory operate at a loss . from 2006 through 2011 , as the amount of space that gsa leased from the private sector grew from 172 million to 193 million square feet , gsa's losses ( as measured by funds from operations ) on its leased assets have increased . gsa officials and omb staff suggested that absent sufficient funding , the cost of operating gsa facilities could increase and the condition of gsa's portfolio could decline . the national research council estimates that each $1 in deferred maintenance results in a long - term capital liability of $4 to $5 , and that â€œan accumulation of deferred investments over the long term may be significantly greater than the short - term savings that public - sector decision makers were initially seeking. . in addition , the agency's lack of a comprehensive long - term capital plan could limit its ability to provide perspective on how funding for requested projects aligns with its long - term investment strategy . having such a plan would enable gsa and congress to better evaluate the full range of real property priorities for using funds in the fbf both over the next 5 years and annually and , should fiscal constraints so dictate , identify which might take precedence over others . in short , more transparency would allow for more informed decision making among competing priorities . to enhance transparency , allow for more informed decision making related to gsa's real property priorities , and make a stronger case for using funds in the fbf to meet capital investment needs , we recommend that the administrator of gsa take the following two actions: document in its annual budget request to omb how gsa uses its prioritization criteria to generate its annual and 5-year lists of prioritized projects to ensure that congress understands the rationale behind prioritized project lists and that gsa is maximizing return on fbf investments . with respect to our second recommendation , gsa indicated that it will work with stakeholders , omb , and congress in developing and providing a 5-year capital plan to include in its budget request . this report focuses on ( 1 ) the factors that have affected the resources available in the federal buildings fund ( fbf ) ; ( 2 ) the general services administration's ( gsa ) potential maintenance and repair liability for its owned assets and the implications for the fund ; and ( 3 ) the information gsa considers when evaluating capital investment proposals and how its practices compare to leading practices for making capital investment decisions .
