spurred by the information technology ( it ) revolution , trade liberalization and other economic reforms , the entry of an estimated 2 billion people into the labor force as a result of the breakdown of the soviet bloc and the opening of china , and the freer movement of capital and technology from developed countries to developing countries , the size of the global economy doubled over the decade preceding the 2008-2009 global financial crisis , increasing from $31 trillion in 1999 to $62 trillion in 2008 . with important responsibilities for the formulation of u.s. international trade and financial policies , congress has an interest in understanding how these shifts of wealth and power are affecting u.s. economic interests . this report addresses these concerns in two parts by ( 1 ) describing and analyzing trends that are transforming the global economy , and ( 2 ) highlighting varied policy challenges raised by the new global economy for congressional consideration . these trends have been accompanied by a major shift in the location of manufacturing from advanced to developing countries , particularly to asia . the rising economic powers have also increased their financial holdings and wealth and are becoming more important players in international financial markets . while a dominant share of financial assets , financial centers , and financial regulatory power remains concentrated in the united states and europe , these emerging economies have accumulated large volumes of foreign exchange reserves , established sovereign wealth funds , borrowed capital from international financial markets , attracted foreign direct investment , and begun investing some of their assets abroad . as a result of these changes , the long - standing division between advanced and developing countries has eroded , particularly for the handful of rising economic powers . the advanced or developed countries may still be the richest countries in terms of per capita incomes , but their economies may no longer be the largest , the fastest - growing , or the most dynamic . this development , in turn , has implications for u.s. economic well - being and global economic leadership that are subject to debate . the changing global economic landscape poses numerous challenges and opportunities for u.s. international trade and financial policies , including the functioning of the global economic institutions . the future direction of u.s. trade negotiations — multilateral , regional , and bilateral — as well as analysis of trade relations , may need to take into better account the growing role that production chains and trade in intermediate products are playing in today's global economy . new issues raised by the changing global landscape include the role of state - owned enterprises , access to developing country markets for procurement , and distinctions among developing countries concerning their world trade obligations . in addition , south - south trade barriers remain high and , if reduced , could provide substantial global welfare benefits . these include concerns about the adequacy of the regulatory system for integrating developing countries into international financial arrangements , rules for direct investment , the role and operation of sovereign wealth funds , and the future of the dollar as world's primary reserve currency . although these institutions have adapted over time to provide the rising powers with more power and influence in setting the rules and arrangements of the world economy , there are concerns that many rising powers may not be willing to take on more responsibility for the maintenance of the system . these issues are discussed in more detail below . on the other hand , the rising economies have affected u.s. employment opportunities and incomes differentially , with more favorable impacts for highly educated workers .
