this action was taken in response to the attack on the u.s. "diplomatic post in benghazi , libya" that had killed four america citizens , including u.s . on november 7 , 1973 , congress passed the war powers resolution ( p.l . 93-148 ) over the veto of president nixon . the war powers resolution ( wpr ) states that the president's powers as commander in chief to introduce u.s. forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities are exercised only pursuant to ( 1 ) a declaration of war ; ( 2 ) specific statutory authorization ; or ( 3 ) a national emergency created by an attack on the united states or its forces . once the agreements have been concluded , further congressional authorization is not necessary , but no such agreements have been concluded . section 8 ( a ) of the war powers resolution states that authority to introduce u.s. forces into hostilities is not to be inferred from any treaty , ratified before or after 1973 , unless implementing legislation specifically authorizes such introduction and says it is intended to constitute an authorization within the meaning of the war powers resolution . the issue of presidential authority to deploy forces in the absence of congressional authorization , under the war powers resolution , or otherwise , became an issue of significant controversy in late march 1999 when president clinton ordered u.s. military forces to participate in a nato - led military operation in kosovo . this action has become the focus of an ongoing policy debate over the purpose and scope of u.s. military involvement in kosovo . congress recessed on october 8 until november 29 , 1994 , so it did not discuss the issue of congressional authorization . a war powers issue for years was whether the use of u.s. force in iraq in the period after the early 1991 desert storm conflict had been authorized by congress . as enacted , section 1095 of p.l . 102-1 . except for the report of june 28 , 1993 , presidents bush and clinton did not cite the war powers resolution in their reports related to military activities in iraq in the period after the 1991 gulf war . rather , they submitted them "consistent with" p.l . since he announced the end of major combat operations against iraq on may 1 , 2003 , the president has made periodic reports on the current situation in iraq "consistent with" p.l . 107-243 , which have become the equivalent of reports to congress envisioned by the war powers resolution . a major issue for congress was whether to authorize u.s. action in somalia . having reviewed its prior opinions and supreme court holdings on cases deemed germane , the office of legal counsel stated that determining the president's legal authority to direct military force in libya turns on two questions: first , whether united states operations in libya would serve sufficiently important national interests to permit the president's action as commander in chief and chief executive and pursuant to his authority to conduct u.s. foreign relations ; and second , whether the military operations that the president anticipated ordering would be sufficiently extensive in "nature , scope , and duration" to constitute a "war" requiring prior specific congressional approval under the declaration of war clause . 292 , expressing the opinion of the house , among other things , that "the president shall not deploy , establish or maintain the presence of units and members of the united states armed forces on the ground in libya," except to rescue a member of the armed forces from imminent danger , and that the president shall within 14 days after passage of this resolution provide a report to the house detailing information about operation odyssey dawn and operation unified protector , and a report answering a number of questions detailing u.s. security interests and objectives , and the activities of united states armed forces , in libya since march 19 , 2011 . multinational interim force . an immediate issue for congress when the president introduces troops into situations of potential hostilities is whether to invoke section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the war powers resolution and trigger a durational limit for the action unless congress authorizes the forces to remain . if congress concurs in a president's action , application of the resolution may be desirable either to legitimize the action and strengthen it by making clear congressional support for the measure or to establish the precedent that the resolution does apply in such a situation . s. 5 , if enacted , would have repealed most of the existing war powers resolution . 23 into law on september 18 , 2001 ( p.l . 107-40 , 115 stat .
