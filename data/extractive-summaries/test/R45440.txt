since their creation a decade ago , cryptocurrencies have become more prominent in the global economy . cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that have no status as legal tender and are administer ed using distributed ledger technology , running on a network of independent , peer - to - peer computers . governments around the world are taking different approaches to cryptocurrencies . some governments are actively promoting digital currencies in their jurisdictions , while others are banning them outright . the interest and debate surrounding cryptocurrencies has led some central banks to examine whether the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could be leveraged to create digital versions of state - created currencies , which would have legal status in their jurisdiction of issue . a major policy question is whether state - issued digital currencies could draw on the benefits of cryptocurrencies while minimizing the risks , but there are varying views on the need for or desirability of digital fiat currencies . the policy questions posed by digital currencies , as well as variation in government responses , have also become a focus for several international organizations and forums . in november 2018 , the u.s. department of the treasury announced it is developing a report on cryptocurrency regulation , including a legislative framework for the 116 th congress to consider in 2019 . as congress considers issues related to digital currencies , including whether to regulate further the cryptocurrency industry , the approaches taken by other governments and international bodies may be of interest . as cryptocurrencies have proliferated , they have taken on more forms . many international organizations and forums are examining the potential implications of digital currencies and , in some cases , are starting to make policy recommendations . they have examined a range of issues , including the utility of digital currencies for improving the international payments systems ; the possible threats digital currencies may or may not pose to international financial stability ; the divergence of national - level cryptocurrency regulations and whether international regulatory coordination is desirable ; how cryptocurrencies should be treated in bank prudential regulation ; and how to adapt international recommendations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing to cryptocurrencies . the world bank , a multilateral development bank that promotes economic development around the world , has been critical of cryptocurrencies but used the underlying technology to issue the world's first bond created and managed using blockchain technology . meanwhile , governments are taking different approaches to cryptocurrencies . some central banks are also considering , or are in the process of , launching digital fiat currencies , while others have determined that at present digital fiat currencies are either unnecessary or undesirable . how do u.s. current regulations and the treasury's proposed framework , when released , compare to other countries' regulations ? . some governments are actively recruiting cryptocurrency companies and developing cryptocurrency industries . should the united states follow suit , or risk losing market share in the industry ? . alternatively , some governments are tightly restricting , or even banning , cryptocurrency activities to protect consumers . in the united states , do consumers have adequate protections in terms of cryptocurrencies ? . has the federal reserve adequately assessed the potential benefits and costs of developing a digital u.s. dollar relying on distributed ledger technology ? . if other countries proceed with digital fiat currencies and the united states does not , would this affect the status of the u.s. dollar as a reserve currency ? . what digital currency policies are being advocated by the trump administration at various international organizations ? . how do international recommendations and standards fit with u.s. regulations ? .
