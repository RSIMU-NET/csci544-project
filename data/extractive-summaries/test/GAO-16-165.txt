the mining law of 1872 encouraged development of the west by opening up federal land to exploration , extraction , and development of hardrock minerals such as gold , silver , and copper . under agency regulations , a mine operator must submit a plan , known as a mine plan of operation ( mine plan ) , that details the operational aspects of the mine , such as the mining methods and techniques that will be employed and how the site will be reclaimed once operations are concluded . from our list of mine plans approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , we selected 23 blm and forest service locations for additional interviews . however , the time varied widely , ranging from about 1 month to over 11 years , among the 68 mine plans we reviewed . in addition , blm and forest service officials stated that mine operators may have met all blm and forest service requirements but may be working to obtain additional permits or approvals from other federal , state , and local entities . blm and forest service officials said they have taken actions to address the two most frequently cited key challenges — the low quality of information operators provided in their mine plans and the agencies' limited allocation of resources for their hardrock mining programs — but the agencies could do more . federal standards for internal control state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals . for example , blm has worked to leverage existing resources by collaborating with other agencies , such as by requesting assistance from u.s . specifically , blm has not fully used its authority to establish fees to recover some costs associated with conducting mine plan reviews , which could be used to address resource needs . however , as of december 2015 , forest service officials said they had not established a fee structure or made a request to retain these fees because the agency was unaware of these authorities . in addition , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to take actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions by , for example , developing guidance for mine operators and agency field officials that instructs them to hold pre - plan submittal meetings whenever possible ; issue a rule that assesses fees associated with reviewing hardrock mine plans that involve conducting environmental assessments ; and create new codes in its lr2000 database distinguishing between different types of mine plans to help track the length of time to complete the mine plan review process . this report examines ( 1 ) the number of mine plans the bureau of land management ( blm ) and the forest service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , the time it took these agencies to complete the mine plan review process , and the extent to which these agencies track this process ; and ( 2 ) the challenges , if any , that have affected the length of time for blm and the forest service to complete the review process , and the actions , if any , these agencies have taken to address these challenges . gao - 13-45r . gao - 12-544 .
