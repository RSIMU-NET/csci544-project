specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the progress made by the 23 states that are required to implement enhanced i&m programs , including the difficulties that the states have encountered , and ( 2 ) the impact that delays in implementing enhanced i&m programs may have on the states' ability to comply with the national air quality standard for ozone . according to epa , the states that had not implemented their enhanced i&m programs as of november 1997 may be unable to demonstrate how they will achieve required voc reductions . in total , 12 states had begun testing vehicles under enhanced i&m programs by april 1998 . a number of factors account for the delays in implementing enhanced i&m programs , including opposition to the stringent requirements of epa's enhanced i&m regulation , the reluctance of some state legislatures to provide authority and funding for the programs , and difficulties in obtaining test equipment and software support . while the states can use mobile and stationary sources in conjunction with the mandated enhanced i&m programs to attain the ozone standard these sources , especially stationary sources , have already made significant reductions in their voc emissions , and , according to epa , further reductions from them will be costly and take some time to achieve . therefore , states will have to look to other mobile sources as well as stationary sources to meet their goals for reducing voc emissions . in view of the pivotal role that enhanced i&m programs play in reducing voc emissions and the delays experienced to date in implementing these programs , as well as the possibility of future delays , we recommend that the administrator of epa compile information on the more successful practices , such as public relations campaigns , used by the states that have implemented their enhanced i&m programs and share the information with those states that are in the early stages of developing and implementing their programs .
