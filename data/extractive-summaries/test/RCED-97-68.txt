from january 1996 ( the first full month of detailed records of inspections ) through december 1996 ( the most recent month for which data were available as of march 1997 ) , federal and state safety inspectors conducted over 25,000 safety inspections of about 3 million mexican trucks crossing into the united states . the monthly out - of - service rates ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent , with no consistent trend ( see fig . however , because inspectors target for inspection vehicles and drivers that appear to have safety deficiencies , their selections are not random . as a result , the out - of - service rates may not necessarily reflect the general condition of all vehicles . texas , with about two - thirds of the truck traffic from mexico , and arizona , with about 10 percent of the traffic , have no permanent truck inspection facilities at any of their border locations . california , with about 24 percent of truck traffic from mexico , has the most rigorous border state truck inspection program and has been inspecting trucks from mexico in its commercial zones for several years . according to state transportation officials , state truck enforcement officials , and transportation authorities in academia , four primary reasons have kept texas from building truck inspection facilities at border locations: key state agencies see nafta as a national issue and are reluctant to use state funds to enforce its provisions ; most of the major border crossings are in urban areas ( laredo , el paso , and brownsville ) , where little space is available to accommodate truck inspection facilities that would be adjacent to border entry points ; the state agency responsible for inspecting trucks , the department of public safety , has traditionally worked ( and prefers to work ) in a roving fashion , conducting roadside truck inspections rather than working out of one location ; and many texas border cities have developed close economic and social relationships with their mexican sister cities directly across the border and resist increased inspections if they perceive that a major crackdown on trucks could undermine such relationships . several of the specific initiatives under this strategy are developing a “safety assessment process” that the mexican government can use to determine the extent to which mexican operators ( 1 ) understand their obligations and the processes the united states uses in truck safety enforcement and ( 2 ) comply with u.s. requirements ; providing more than $1 million annually since fiscal year 1995 in grants to the four border states to prepare for enforcement activities related to nafta , such as increasing the number of state inspectors stationed at the border ; conducting educational campaigns on u.s. safety standards , including training seminars and leaflets , for mexican drivers and truck companies ; approving 13 dot truck inspector positions for 2 years to demonstrate a federal commitment to truck safety ; working with cvsa and state truck enforcement agencies to train inspectors in mexico in an attempt to increase truck safety overall in that country ; contracting with the international association of chiefs of police to conduct a series of truck safety forums in the u.s. border states to allow u.s. and mexican enforcement officials to discuss strategies and other truck safety issues of mutual concern ; and participating with the land transportation standards subcommittee , established under nafta , to develop compatible safety and operating standards in all three nafta countries . in february 1997 dot announced that its program that provides grants for statewide safety enforcement activities will incorporate performance - based goals to increase truck and driver safety . also , in march 1997 , dot submitted a legislative proposal , as part of the reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act , that would incorporate this performance - based , results - oriented approach . while mexican trucks entering the united states continue to exhibit high out - of - service rates for serious safety violations , federal and state officials believe that their efforts have had a positive effect and that mexican trucks are now safer than they were in 1995 . additional copies are $2 each .
