further , irtpa calls for the executive branch to implement a plan by december 17 , 2009 , under which , to the extent practical , at least 90 percent of decisions are made on applications for an initial personnel security clearance within 60 days , on average . to determine the completeness of the timeliness data that the executive branch reported for dod clearances granted in fiscal year 2008 , we reviewed the requirements specified in irtpa , conducted an independent analysis of the timeliness of dod personnel security clearances in fiscal year 2008 , and analyzed the timeliness data contained in the executive branch's 2009 report to congress on clearances granted in fiscal year 2008 . to determine the completeness of both investigation and adjudication documentation for initial top secret security clearances favorably adjudicated within dod , we independently and randomly selected and reviewed a generalizable sample of 100 opm - provided investigative reports and associated dod adjudicative files for clearances granted to military , dod civilian , and private industry personnel working on dod contracts in july 2008 by the central adjudication facilities of the u.s. army , u.s. navy , and u.s. air force . the report stated that the average time for completing the fastest 90 percent of initial clearances for military and dod civilians in fiscal year 2008 was 124 days . to determine whether dod and opm met irtpa's current timeliness requirement that clearance decisions on at least 80 percent of initial clearances be made within 120 days , on average , we conducted an independent analysis and took an average of the fastest 80 percent of 450,000 initial dod clearances including military and dod civilians , or private industry personnel working on dod contracts completed in fiscal year 2008 . these clearances were completed in an average of 87 days . dod has not issued formal guidance clarifying if and under what circumstances adjudicators can adjudicate incomplete investigative reports , although dod adjudicators follow a risk - managed approach when granting security clearances . however , because dod has not articulated in policy when it is appropriate for adjudicators to accept incomplete investigative reports , it cannot be certain that adjudicators are basing their decisions to accept and adjudicate from these reports on a uniform risk tolerance standard that is acceptable to dod . we estimated that 22 percent of the adjudicative files for about 3,500 initial top secret clearances that were favorably adjudicated had incomplete documentation . consideration of the foreign influence and financial guidelines were incorrect or missing . moreover , because the executive branch has not fully addressed quality in its irtpa - required reports to congress , it has missed opportunities to provide congressional decision makers with full transparency over the clearance process . to provide more comprehensive information about personnel security clearance timeliness , which would aid the ongoing personnel security clearance reform efforts , we recommend that the omb deputy director for management , in the capacity as the chair of the performance accountability council , include appropriate statistics that describe the full range of the time required to complete all initial clearance applications in the executive branch's irtpa - required annual reports . to improve the completeness of future adjudication documentation , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for intelligence to measure the frequency with which adjudicative files meet the requirements of dod regulation , so that the executive branch can identify the factors leading to incomplete files and include the results of such measurement in the annual irtpa - required report to congress on clearances . the report does not contain information about the reasons for the delays in the clearances that were excluded from the statistics presented in the report because the report did not present information on the full range of time to complete all initial clearances in the annual irtpa - required report . we are aware that opm periodically collects and reports data on the clearance process . opm also stated its ability to respond to our assessment on documentation completeness was greatly limited since we did not provide all of the investigative reports where we found incomplete documentation to opm officials so that they could review our work and provide an accompanying explanation . as we explained in our report , basing clearance decisions on incomplete documentation that has not fully adhered to federal investigative standards may reduce the assurance that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent dod from granting clearances to untrustworthy individuals . additionally , we reviewed previously issued gao clearance - related reports and testimonies that identified quality measures and their potential utility . gao - 09-271 .
