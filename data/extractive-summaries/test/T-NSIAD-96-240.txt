u.s. funding of heroin control efforts accounts for a small portion of the overall international drug control budget . the united states does not have a significant counternarcotics program in burma because of u.s. concerns over human rights violations by the burmese government and the unwillingness of the burmese government to yield control of the country to a democratically elected government . some of these minority groups control major opium production and heroin - trafficking areas . the impact of u.s. regional interdiction efforts to date has been limited by the ability of traffickers to shift their routes into countries with inadequate law enforcement capability and by poor law enforcement cooperation between the united states and china . from southeast asia , heroin is transported to the united states primarily by ethnic chinese and west african drug - trafficking organizations . the united states has also obtained successful counternarcotics cooperation with hong kong . however , we found that the projects have not significantly reduced opium production because ( 1 ) the scope of the projects has been too small , ( 2 ) the burmese government has not provided sufficient support to ensure project success , and ( 3 ) inadequate planning has reduced project effectiveness .
