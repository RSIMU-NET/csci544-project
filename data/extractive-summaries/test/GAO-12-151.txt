we also collected information from the regulators on the extent to which the dodd - frank act rules effective as of july 21 , 2011 , could impact certain variables ( such as the safety and soundness of regulated entities , cost and availability of credit , and costs of compliance with the rules ) or produce other costs and benefits . as part of the rulemaking process , federal financial regulatory agencies are required to conduct a variety of regulatory analyses , but benefit - cost analysis is not among the requirements . 12866 if the relevant agencies were required to follow it . most of the regulations also considered different compliance dates for enforcement to begin . although federal financial regulators said that they followed omb's guidance in spirit or principle , we found areas where regulators could have improved their regulatory analyses by applying omb's guidance more fully . specifically , a review of financial regulations by one analyst led him to conclude that “the nation's financial regulators ha largely failed to perform the rigorous analysis required of most other government agencies , especially those in the fields of health , safety , and environmental regulation.” other policy analysts concluded that regulatory analyses by independent regulatory agencies , including some federal financial regulators “generally do not analyze economic effects in a manner intended to meet any identifiable standards for such analysis.” however , an academic with whom we spoke stated that additional cost - benefit analysis requirements will provide only a marginal increase in value ; instead , according to the academic , the goal should be to accomplish regulatory objectives at minimum cost . for example , fsoc has developed a consultation framework for the rulemakings for which consultation with fsoc is required . although these tools are a positive development in facilitating coordination , they have limited usefulness . federal financial regulators , industry association representatives , and others told us that assessing the actual impact of the dodd - frank act regulations generally is premature for a number of reasons , including the following: industry representatives and regulators noted that sufficient time has not elapsed to allow for many of the dodd - frank act rules to be fully implemented and , in turn , assessed . although federal financial regulators told us that they planned to conduct retrospective reviews of their dodd - frank act regulations in response to statutory requirements or at their own discretion , some of the regulators we reviewed have not developed plans for such reviews . the act identifies specific areas for fsoc to study ( including making recommendations ) to help inform rulemaking . similarly , under the dodd - frank act , fsoc is also required to conduct periodic studies . to strengthen the rigor and transparency of their regulatory analyses , we recommend that the federal financial regulators take steps to better ensure that the specific practices in omb's regulatory analysis guidance are more fully incorporated into their rulemaking policies and consistently applied . to enhance interagency coordination on regulations issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act , we recommend that fsoc work with the federal financial regulatory agencies to establish formal coordination policies that clarify issues such as when coordination should occur , the process that will be used to solicit and address comments , and what role fsoc should play in facilitating coordination . to effectively carry out its statutory responsibilities , we recommend that fsoc direct the office of financial research to work with its members to identify and collect the data necessary to assess the impact of the dodd - frank act regulations on , among other things , the stability , efficiency , and competitiveness of the u.s. financial markets . with regard to the recommendation on developing coordination policies , fsoc noted the importance of coordination and said it would consider the recommendations as it continues to improve protocols and cftc outlined its coordination efforts . our objectives in this report were to examine ( 1 ) the regulatory analyses , including benefit - cost analyses , federal financial regulators have performed to assess the potential impact of selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; ( 2 ) how federal financial regulators consulted with each other in implementing selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the impact of the final dodd - frank act regulations . we also interviewed officials from the commodity futures trading commission , consumer financial protection bureau , federal deposit insurance corporation , the board of governors of the federal reserve system , financial stability oversight council , national credit union administration , office of the comptroller of the currency , office of financial research , omb , and securities and exchange commission to determine the extent to which benefit - cost or similar analyses were conducted and whether the analyses were required by statute , regulation , or executive order . to identify statutory and other requirements imposed on the federal financial regulators for conducting retrospective or similar reviews of their existing regulations , we reviewed statutes , executive orders , federal register releases , and gao and other reports . rule synopsis .
