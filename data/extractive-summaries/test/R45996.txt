over the years , the u.s. military has relied on pgms to execute ground , air , and naval military operations . pgms have become ubiquitous in u.s. military operations ; funding for these weapons has increased dramatically from fy1998 to the present as depicted in . in fy2021 , the department of defense ( dod ) requested approximately $4.1 billion for more than 41,337 weapons in 15 munitions programs . dod projects requesting approximately $3.3 billion for 20,456 weapons in fy2022 , $3.9 billion for 23,306 weapons in fy2023 , $3.9 billion for 18,376 weapons in fy2024 , and $3.6 billion for 16,325 weapons in fy2025 . potential issues for congress include planned procurement quantities and stockpile assessments , defense industrial base production capacity , development timelines , supply chain security , affordability and cost - effectiveness , and emerging factors that may affect pgm programs . dod defines a pgm as "[a] guided weapon intended to destroy a point target and minimize collateral damage. . pgms include air - and ship - launched missiles , multiple launched rockets , and guided bombs . current munitions typically use a combination of radio signals from the global positioning system ( gps ) , laser guidance , and inertial navigation systems ( ins ) âusing gyroscopesâto improve a weapon's accuracy to reportedly less than 3 meters ( approximately 10 feet ) . according to defense analyst barry watts , guidance systems showed promise in improving weapon accuracy ; however , these systems were not fully fielded during the second world war . laser - guided bombs gained prominence during operation desert storm in 1991 . counter - islamic state ( is ) operations in iraq and syria have used numerous weapons: in 2015 , coalition air forces used more than 28,000 weapons ; in 2016 , the campaign used an additional 30,700 weapons ; and in 2017 ( the height of operations ) , the campaign used 39,500 weapons ( see figure 2 for a graphical representation of operational usage compared to dod procurement ) . nearly all of the weapons employed were pgms , particularly joint direct attack munitions ( jdams ) and hellfire missiles . in addition to pgm use in current operations , the proliferation of anti - access / area denial ( a2 / ad ) systems is likely to increase the operational utility of pgms . some analysts argue that these systems can exceed dod munitions capabilities ( such as range and speed ) . another potential issue for congress is how dod's programs for developing and procuring pgms might be affected by emerging factors such as the u.s. withdrawal from the intermediate nuclear force ( inf ) treaty ; new u.s. military operational concepts for countering chinese a2 / ad forces in the indo - pacific region , such as the army's new multi - domain operations ( mdo ) operational concept and the marine corps' new expeditionary advanced base operations ( eabo ) concept , both of which possibly feature the potential use of such weapons from island locations in the pacific as a way of countering china's a2 / ad forces ; and emerging technologies such as hypersonics and artificial intelligence ( ai ) .
