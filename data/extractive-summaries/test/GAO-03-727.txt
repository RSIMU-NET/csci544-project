you asked that we determine ( 1 ) the magnitude of adjustments that affected previously recorded payments and dfas columbus's reported cost to make these adjustments during fiscal year 2002 , ( 2 ) why contracts , including payment instructions , were so complex , ( 3 ) the key factors that caused dfas columbus to make payment adjustments for the two contracts that we reviewed in detail , and ( 4 ) what steps dod has taken or planned to address the adjustment problem . for fiscal year 2002 , our analysis of dfas columbus data showed that about $1 of every $4 in contract payment transactions in mocas was for adjustments to previously recorded payments â€” $49 billion of adjustments out of $198 billion in disbursement , collection , and adjustment transactions . to research the payment allocation problems and make adjustments to correct the disbursing and accounting records , dfas columbus reported that it incurred costs of about $34 million in fiscal year 2002 , primarily for hundreds of dod and contractor staff . this represented about 35 percent of the $97.4 million that dfas columbus spent on contract pay service operations . this occurred because dfas columbus currently bills dod activities ( for example , the army ) for contract pay services based solely on the number of lines of accounting on an invoice . consequently , all dod activities pay the same line rate , regardless of whether substantial work is needed to reconcile problem contracts and adjust the payment records . as discussed later in this report , dod is taking action to change its billing structure for dod activities . our analysis of an army and an air force contract showed that the contracts and related payment instructions were complex because of a combination of factors , including the ( 1 ) legal and dod requirements to track and report on the funds used to finance the contract , ( 2 ) number of modifications made to the contract over the years that added goods and / or services , or added or changed payment instructions for these goods and / or services , and ( 3 ) different pricing provisions to pay for goods and services on the contract . in march 2001 , dfas columbus processed 1,262 transactions totaling over $26 million to adjust previously recorded payment allocations on the air force contract . therefore , many payments were not allocated in accordance with the current modification , and adjustments were needed to correct these allocations . dod has initiated a major long - term effort to develop and implement an enterprise architecture , which is intended to improve its business operations , including its acquisition and disbursement activities . if implemented successfully , this initiative may help correct many of the contract payment allocation problems . finally , a dod working group is examining payment allocation problems and plans to develop and implement payment allocation options for presenting standard payment instructions on contracts dod - wide to address these problems . in september 2002 , dod formed a working group to review contract payment instructions . for example , dfas columbus made $2.4 million in payment allocation errors on the army contract because the voucher examiners made errors when they manually applied payment amounts to acrns following complex , nonstandard payment instructions that changed several times . we also recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to direct the director of the defense finance and accounting service to automate the standardized payment instructions in mocas once the standard payment instructions are adopted and issue guidance reiterating dfas's internal requirement that when a contract does not contain payment instructions and the contractor invoice does not contain payment instructions , the payments for costs and services must be allocated to acrns financed on a cost reimbursable basis in accordance with dfas's desk procedures .
