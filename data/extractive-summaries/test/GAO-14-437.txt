corrosion affects military readiness by taking critical systems out of action and creating safety hazards . we further interviewed corrosion office officials to discuss the amount of funds dod spent on tcc projects . to determine the extent to which dod established goals for tcc and transitioned demonstrated results from projects to the military departments , we reviewed dod documents , such as dod's tcc definitions document and the 2014 dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan , to identify goals of the tcc program , as well as any successes to date cited by dod . according to corrosion office officials , the procedures for some aspects of the tcc program are not documented because the program is still evolving and they would like flexibility to enable innovation in determining how to manage the program . as a result , it is unclear what the corrosion office has spent on the tcc program . however , some of the documentation the officials provided did not fully reconcile with the final funding data they provided . according to corrosion office officials , the funding amounts differed because prior to 2013 , the office was not required to track and report tcc funds separately from other corrosion - related activity funds . corrosion office has spent on the tcc program . according to the 2014 dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan , tcc has the following goals: ( 1 ) develop individuals with education , training , and experience who will form the future core of the technical community within dod and private industry that specializes in work on corrosion prevention or control ; and ( 2 ) produce solutions ( i.e. , knowledge , technologies , processes , and materials ) that tangibly reduce the effect of corrosion on dod infrastructure and weapon systems . to address its goal of developing individuals through education , training , and experience , the corrosion office monitors tcc projects that include involving students in corrosion research . the corrosion office has established a research goal for producing solutions that tangibly reduce the effect of corrosion on dod infrastructure and weapon systems ; however , the office has not established a process for transitioning any results of the demonstrated research projects to the military departments . corrosion office officials stated that it is difficult to transition results of the tcc projects to the military departments because outputs of tcc research are in the early stages of technology evolution and thus are not mature enough to be used by the military departments . therefore , corrosion office officials acknowledged the need to establish a process to transition tcc results to the military departments . until the corrosion office establishes a process to study and determine what , if any , tcc results could transition to the military departments , dod will not be able to demonstrate the success of the tcc program and the extent to which tcc results are helping to prevent or mitigate corrosion . however , dod's corrosion office has not established a process for transitioning tcc program results to benefit the military departments , which is required by section 2228 . to enhance dod's ability to make consistent and informed decisions in its management of the tcc program in accordance with internal control standards , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics require the director , corrosion policy and oversight office , to document the procedures for approving projects within the tcc program for civilian institutions ; document the procedures for selecting and approving projects within the tcc program for military academic institutions ; document the procedures for selecting and approving military research labs supporting civilian and military institutions in conducting projects within the tcc program ; and track and maintain accurate records that include amounts of funds used for the tcc program , and have them readily available for examination to ensure that funding data will be accurately accounted for and reported in future reports , such as the annual budget report to congress . to better ensure that dod can demonstrate the success of the tcc program and the extent to which tcc results will help to prevent or mitigate corrosion , we recommend that the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics require the director , corrosion policy and oversight office , to establish a process for transitioning demonstrated results of tcc projects to the military departments as required by the section 2228 of title 10 of the united states code .
