in this report , discussion of the “impact of mutual funds on deposits” or of the “movement of money from deposits to mutual funds” refers not merely to direct withdrawal of deposits by customers for the sake of investing in mutual fund shares but also to customers' diversion into mutual funds of new receipts that otherwise might have been placed in deposits . at year - end 1994 , the amount of money in mutual funds ( $2,172 billion ) was considerably less than that in bank deposits ( $3,462 billion ) . the total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion . the movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little if any effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy , even though this movement may have shifted the intermediaries through which finance flows . thus , at the same time that a sizable amount of customer money went from bank deposits to mutual funds , the funds' purchases of securities became a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending . availability of finance for the three different borrower sectors — residential , consumer , and business — could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds , even when the total supply of loanable and investable funds is not affected . not all corporations reduced their bank loans , of course , but the declines outweighed the increases . nonetheless , presumably there is some portion of small businesses that is solely or heavily dependent on small banks for their credit .
