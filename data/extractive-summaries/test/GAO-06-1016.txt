as requested , we determined ( 1 ) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of rea , including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass ; ( 2 ) what agencies have done to implement rea fee and amenity requirements and sufficiency of guidance for rea implementation ; ( 3 ) the extent to which the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected recreation fee revenues ; ( 4 ) how participating agencies prioritize and approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues ; and ( 5 ) the extent to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations . gao informed congress of several areas that needed to be addressed to ensure the program's success . the four technical working groups formed by doi and usda to facilitate interagency cooperation and coordination on specific rea implementation issues have made progress . in addition , five new rracs are being established nationwide . agency officials at almost 17 percent of fee - collecting units within all four agencies responding to our survey said that the public participation process in general had delayed or prevented the establishment of or changes to recreation fees at their unit to a moderate , great , or very great extent since the passage of rea in december 2004 . however , the working group still has several months to meet their target pass implementation date of january 2007 . in 2005 , all agencies assessed existing fee programs to determine whether existing fee collecting sites met rea requirements , and some units made modifications to comply with rea . for example , whole administrative units , such as a national forest or a reclamation project , cannot be declared a hira . the unit has continued to charge a standard amenity fee since rea passed because unit officials thought it would be confusing to visitors to temporarily discontinue the fee while they worked on upgrading the area to meet rea criteria . many units have not implemented a system of routine audits to help ensure that fees are collected and used as authorized and that collected funds are safeguarded . at blm , fws , and fs , most proposed projects are approved at the local unit level . many agency officials at the unit and regional levels expressed frustration about the length of time it takes to obtain approval for funding nps projects , and some noted that the approval process has delayed project implementation and / or has contributed to units having unobligated fee revenue balances . the following examples highlight some of the reasons for unobligated balances at specific units . in addition , many of the unit staff we visited or who commented on our survey stated that recreation fee revenues are essential to providing services at their recreation areas that would not otherwise be funded . in order to improve agencies' implementation of the federal lands recreation enhancement act and improve the accountability and controls for recreation fee collection , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director , national park service ; director , bureau of land management ; and director , fish and wildlife service to promptly issue final regulations and implementation guidance on the fee program , including detailed policy and procedure guidance ; and director , bureau of land management and director , fish and wildlife services to ascertain the extent to which their units do not have effective processes and procedures for accounting for and controlling collected fees and develop guidance for implementing appropriate and effective internal controls over cash management . based on the congressional request letter of may 2005 and subsequent discussions with your staffs , we agreed to determine ( 1 ) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of the federal lands recreation enhancement act ( rea ) , including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass ; ( 2 ) what agencies have done to implement the rea fee and amenity requirements and sufficiency of guidance for rea implementation ; ( 3 ) the extent to which the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected recreation fee revenues ; ( 4 ) how participating agencies prioritize and approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues ; and ( 5 ) the extent to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations . as mentioned earlier in this report , reclamation has not implemented rea and , therefore , is not included in these results . the following are gao's comments on the department of agriculture's forest service letter dated september 7 , 2006 .
