i am pleased to be here today to discuss wildland fire management by the federal wildland fire agencies — the forest service within the department of agriculture and four agencies within the department of the interior — including key actions that we believe the agencies should take to improve their management of wildland fires and help contain the rising costs of preparing for and responding to fires . the forest service and four interior agencies — the bureau of indian affairs , bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , and national park service — are responsible for wildland fire management . the forest service and the interior agencies have improved their understanding of wildland fire's role on the landscape and have taken important steps toward improving their ability to cost - effectively protect communities and resources . under this policy , the agencies abandoned their attempt to put out every wildland fire , seeking instead to ( 1 ) make communities and resources less susceptible to being damaged by wildland fire and ( 2 ) respond to fires so as to protect communities and important resources at risk but also to consider both the cost and long - term effects of that response . these steps include reducing hazardous fuels , in an effort to keep wildland fires from spreading into the wildland - urban interface and to help protect important resources by lessening a fire's intensity . improving fire management decisions . although these efforts are new , and we have not fully evaluated them , we believe they have the potential to help the agencies strengthen how they select firefighting strategies . in addition , previous studies have found that agencies sometimes use more , or more - costly , firefighting assets than necessary , often in response to political or social pressure to demonstrate they are taking all possible action to protect communities and resources . despite the important steps the agencies have taken , much work remains . specifically , the agencies need to: develop a cohesive strategy . completing an investment strategy that lays out various approaches for reducing fuels and responding to wildland fires and the estimated costs associated with each approach and the trade - offs involved — what we have termed a cohesive strategy — is essential for congress and the agencies to make informed decisions about effective and affordable long - term approaches for addressing the nation's wildland fire problems . as a result , despite the improvements the agencies are making to policy , decision support tools , and oversight , we believe that managers in the field lack a clear understanding of the relative importance that the agencies' leadership places on containing costs and — as we concluded in our 2007 report — are therefore likely to continue to select firefighting strategies without duly considering the costs of suppression . clearly define financial responsibilities for fires that cross jurisdictions . although nonfederal entities — including state forestry entities and tribal , county , city , and rural fire departments — play an important role in protecting communities and resources and responding to fires , we reported in 2006 that federal officials were concerned that the existing framework for sharing suppression costs among federal and nonfederal entities insulated state and local governments from the cost of providing wildland fire protection in the wildland - urban interface . mitigate effects of rising fire costs on other agency programs . the sharply rising costs of managing wildland fires have led the forest service and the interior agencies to transfer funds from other programs to help pay for fire suppression , disrupting or delaying activities in these other programs . establishing a reserve account with a definite appropriation would provide the agencies with incentives to contain suppression costs within the amount in the reserve account , but depending on the size of the appropriation and the severity of a fire season , suppression costs could still exceed the funds reserved , and the agencies might still need to transfer funds from other programs .
