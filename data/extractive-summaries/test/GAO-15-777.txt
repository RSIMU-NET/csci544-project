small businesses in particular have fewer resources , such as robust cybersecurity systems , than larger businesses have to counter such threats . the joint explanatory statement to accompany the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision that gao assess the dod osbp's outreach and education efforts to assist small businesses in understanding cyber threats . in the absence of such a central repository , we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from the following organizations with cybersecurity expertise: dod chief information officer , defense security service , defense information systems agency , department of homeland security national protection and programs directorate , federal bureau of investigation cyber division , national institute of standards and technology , u.s. small business administration , federal communications commission , and the national cyber security alliance in order to identify examples of existing cybersecurity outreach and education programs potentially available to defense small businesses that could be leveraged by the dod osbp . dod osbp officials have explored some ways whereby the office could integrate cybersecurity into its existing outreach and education efforts ; however , as of july 2015 , the office had not identified and disseminated information about cybersecurity resources in its outreach and education efforts to defense small businesses . while dod osbp is not required to educate small businesses on cybersecurity , dod osbp officials acknowledged that cybersecurity is an important and timely issue for small businesses â€” and therefore the office is considering incorporating cybersecurity into its existing outreach and education efforts . while dod osbp officials recognized the importance of identifying and disseminating cybersecurity resources through outreach and education efforts to defense small businesses , they also identified a number of factors that had , to date , limited their progress in doing so . while we recognize that these factors could affect progress , federal government internal controls state that management should ensure that there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders who may have a significant impact on the agency's achieving its goals . while they had not yet identified or disseminated information about existing cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses , officials agreed that doing so could help the businesses to become more aware of cybersecurity practices and cyber threats . in addition , by identifying and disseminating this information , dod osbp could help defense small businesses to protect their networks against cyber exploits , which would support the 2015 dod cyber strategy goals of working with the private sector to help secure defense industrial base trade data and build layered cyber defenses . while dod osbp officials have recognized the importance of educating defense small businesses about cybersecurity , they have not identified and disseminated cybersecurity resources through their outreach and education efforts to businesses because they have been focused on other priorities , such as developing a training curriculum for dod professionals who work with small businesses . gao staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix iv . we focused our review on the department of defense ( dod ) office of small business programs ( osbp ) because this office is responsible for providing small business policy advice to the office of the secretary of defense and for providing policy oversight to dod military department and dod component small business offices , per dod directive 4205.01 . to address the extent to which the dod osbp has integrated cybersecurity into its existing outreach and education efforts for defense small businesses , we analyzed documentation and interviewed officials from the dod osbp about its existing cybersecurity outreach and education efforts to small businesses . gao - 15-758t .
