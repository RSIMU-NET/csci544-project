the primary federal law governing the manufacture , distribution , and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the controlled substances act ( csa or the act ) , which is administered and enforced by the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) in the u.s. department of justice . the regulatory framework under the csa relies primarily on a registration system: the act requires persons who handle controlled substances ( such as drug manufacturers , wholesale distributors , exporters , importers , health care professionals , hospitals , pharmacies , and scientific researchers ) to register with the dea and comply with the terms and conditions of the registration . this report first provides a brief overview of the opioid epidemic and then describes in greater detail the current federal legal regime governing opioids and other controlled substances under the csa and its implementing regulations . after that , the report examines dea actions taken that are specifically targeted at addressing opioid abuse and describes recently enacted laws amending the csa that impact the opioid regulatory system , including the substance use - disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act ( p.l . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) has declared that the nation "is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic," citing statistics that show the number of overdose deaths involving opioids ( including prescription opioids and illegal opioids such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical fentanyl ) has more than quadrupled since 1999 , and on average 115 americans now die each day from an opioid overdose . opioids can include prescription pain relief drugs such as hydrocodone , oxycodone , codeine , morphine , and fentanyl , as well as illegal drugs such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical ( illicitly produced ) fentanyl . how the opioid epidemic occurred , and who is responsible for fueling it , are complicated questions , though reports have suggested that many parties are likely involved to some extent , including pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors , doctors , health insurance companies , rogue pharmacies , and drug dealers and addicts . this section provides a general overview of the csa's closed system of distribution that regulates opioids and other types of controlled substances , including the schedules in which the substances are placed and the regulatory requirements and obligations that registrants must satisfy , such as ( 1 ) registering with the dea , ( 2 ) keeping accurate and complete records of controlled substance inventories and transactions , ( 3 ) implementing security measures to safeguard controlled substances from theft or diversion , ( 4 ) reporting certain information to the dea ( including suspicious controlled substance orders ) , ( 5 ) meeting production quotas , and ( 6 ) prescribing controlled substances only for legitimate medical purposes . existing legal authorities supplied dea with the tools for the agency's efforts to combat opioid abuse as described in the previous section . these potential additional amendments to the csa may resemble opioid legislation introduced , but not enacted to date , in the 115 th congress . legislative proposals introduced in the 115 th congress include the following: changes to the dea's authority to deny , revoke , or suspend a registration , and to issue immediate suspension order s . the opioid addiction prevention act of 2017 ( s. 892 ) would , among other things , amend the csa to prohibit the dea administrator from registering , or renewing the registration of , a practitioner who is licensed under state law to prescribe controlled substances in schedule ii , iii , or iv , unless the practitioner certifies to the dea that he will not prescribe any schedule ii , iii , or iv opioid for the initial treatment of "acute pain" ( except opioids approved by the fda for treating drug addiction ) in an amount greater than a seven - day supply of the drug ( with no refills allowed ) , or exceeding an opioid prescription limit established under state law , whichever is lesser . increasing penalties for fentanyl trafficking .
