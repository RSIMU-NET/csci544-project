to further increase the efficiency of it spending , in may 2012 , omb initiated a “cut and reinvest” effort that required agencies , as part of their fiscal year 2014 budget submission , to propose reductions in it that represented 10 percent of their overall spending and to propose reinvestments of between 50 and 100 percent of the savings . we chose these agencies , in part , because they had the highest proposed reinvestment dollar amounts . to help agencies manage their it more effectively , reduce duplication , and achieve cost savings , omb implemented a series of initiatives beginning in 2010: data center consolidation and optimization . in total , 24 of the 26 agencies reported achieving approximately $3.6 billion in cost savings and avoidances from the implementation of omb's it reform efforts between fiscal years 2011 and 2014 . more specifically , although about two - thirds of agencies had established long - range reinvestment plans in their irm strategic plans , most agencies had not fully implemented omb's guidance for establishing fiscal year 2014 reduction and reinvestment plans . see table 5 for an assessment of agencies' one - time fiscal year 2014 proposed reductions and reinvestments against omb's guidance . specifically , agencies should have submitted a total of $7.6 billion in reductions and proposed reinvestments between $3.8 and $7.6 billion . without complete reinvestment plans in their integrated data collection submissions , agencies will lack important information that could be used to better ensure that cost savings and avoidances from omb it reform efforts are being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible . the remaining three agencies — education , labor , and interior — had not tracked performance results against their planned it reductions . the lack of agency tracking of the actual performance of their reinvestments is due , in part , to weaknesses in omb's requirements for submitting reinvestment information . until omb requires agencies to report actual reinvestment performance and defines performance targets to guide agency reinvestment efforts , it will be limited in its ability to ensure that agencies are reinvesting funds as planned and may not be able to hold agencies accountable . while the four agencies that we selected documented key governance processes and fully embraced omb's “cut and reinvest” guidance by proposing to reinvest the full amount of their proposed reductions in their fiscal year 2014 budget submissions , none of the four agencies was able to provide support that they had tracked the actual performance of their proposed reinvestments . specifically , omb and 12 agencies agreed with our recommendations , while 1 ( state ) did not state whether it agreed or disagreed , 3 had no comments , and 1 ( defense ) partially agreed . our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess agencies' progress in achieving savings from their information technology ( it ) reform efforts ; ( 2 ) evaluate the extent to which agencies have established plans to reinvest their savings ; and ( 3 ) evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings , including the extent to which it governance processes are in place to oversee such reinvestments . we rated this requirement as “fully implemented” if the agency's submission met or exceeded omb's reduction and reinvestments targets and included all required supplemental information ; “partially implemented” if the agency's submission either did not meet omb's reduction and reinvestment targets or did not include the required supplemental information for each of the proposed reductions and reinvestments ; and “not implemented” if the agency did not meet omb's reduction and reinvestment targets and did not provide supplemental information for all required fields , or the agency did not submit the required documentation to omb . for evaluating how selected agencies have reinvested their savings , including the extent to which it governance processes are in place to oversee such reinvestments , we selected four federal agencies ( the departments of education , interior , and labor , and the social security administration ) based on their fiscal year 2014 proposed it reductions and reinvestments , as documented in their budget submission documentation . to improve the department's it savings reinvestment plans and tracking of reinvestments , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the cio to take the following two actions: ensure that the department's integrated data collection submission to omb includes , for all reported initiatives , complete plans to reinvest any resulting cost savings and avoidances from omb - directed it reform - related efforts .
