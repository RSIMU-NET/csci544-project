despite a massive deployment of resources and support from both military and civilian agencies , many have regarded the federal response as inadequate . in addition , the plan's catastrophic incident supplement , which was supposed to have listed specific proactive actions agencies would take in response to a catastrophe , had not been approved during the 9 months between the plan's issuance and katrina's landfall . this report presents the results of our review of the military response to hurricane katrina , which examined ( 1 ) the extent to which pre - katrina plans and training exercises reflected the military assistance that might be required during a catastrophic , domestic , natural disaster , ( 2 ) the support that the military provided in responding to katrina and factors that affected that response , and ( 3 ) the actions the military is taking to address lessons learned from katrina and to prepare for the next catastrophic event . the nrp is the federal government's plan to coordinate its resources and capabilities across agencies and integrate them with other levels of government , as well as private sector organizations , for prevention of , preparedness for , response to , and recovery from natural disasters , terrorism , or other emergencies . moreover , disaster plans had not been tested and refined with a robust exercise program . as a result of the inadequate plans — and the lack of realistic exercises to test those plans — a lack of understanding existed within the military and among federal , state , and local responders as to the types of assistance and capabilities that the military might provide , the timing of this assistance , and the respective contributions of the active - duty and national guard components . moreover , the functional plan did not establish time frames for the response . like dod's functional plan 2501 , the mississippi and louisiana national guard plans were adequate for smaller disasters but insufficient for a catastrophe , and did not adequately account for the outside assistance that could be needed during a catastrophe . even though there was a lack of detailed planning , the military mounted a massive response to hurricane katrina that saved many lives and greatly assisted recovery efforts , but several factors affected this response . some factors that affected the military response were: a lack of timely damage assessments , communications difficulties , problems integrating the use and capabilities of active - duty and national guard forces , uncoordinated search and rescue efforts , and challenges with the significant logistics functions that fema unexpectedly turned over to dod . growing concerns about the magnitude of the disaster prompted dod to deploy large active - duty ground units beginning on september 3 , 2005 , 5 days after katrina's landfall . for example , dod deployed a joint task force , medical personnel , helicopters , ships from texas , virginia , and maryland , and construction battalion engineers . it also did not address coordination with civilian responders . while it is too early to fully evaluate the effectiveness of these ongoing and planned actions , many appear to hold promise for improving future responses . to improve situational awareness and assist in damage assessment after a catastrophe , dod is working on a plan to coordinate and synchronize surveillance and reconnaissance requests and assets . while dod's efforts to address the katrina lessons learned appear to be steps in the right direction , some of the issues dod is facing are complex and long - standing and cut across agency boundaries . many of the problems encountered during the katrina response were also reported after hurricane andrew in 1992 . without urgent and detailed attention to improve planning , the military and federal government risk being unprepared for the next catastrophe . finally , based on the above action by the national guard bureau to identify the national guard units that are likely to respond to domestic disasters under state - to - state mutual assistance agreements , we also recommend that the secretary of defense establish milestones and identify the types of scalable federal military capabilities and the units that could provide those capabilities in response to the full range of domestic disasters and catastrophes covered by dod's defense support to civil authorities plans . fema = federal emergency management agency . 20 .
