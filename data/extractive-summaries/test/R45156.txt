the electrical grid in the united states comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems that bring power to end - use customers . the "grid" also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies in different states and regions of the united states . however , with changes in federal law , regulatory changes , and the aging of the electric power infrastructure as drivers , the grid is changing from a largely patchwork system built to serve the needs of individual electric utility companies to essentially a national interconnected system , accommodating massive transfers of electrical energy among regions of the united states . the modernization of the grid to accommodate today's power flows , serve reliability needs , and meet future projected uses is leading to the incorporation of electronic intelligence capabilities for power control purposes and operations monitoring . the "smart grid" is the name given to this evolving intelligent electric power network , with digital technologies increasingly replacing analog devices , thus enabling smart grid hardware and software functions . the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) describes the smart grid as "an intelligent electricity grid â€” one that uses digital communications technology , information systems , and automation to detect and react to local changes in usage , improve system operating efficiency , and , in turn , reduce operating costs while maintaining high system reliability. . the smart grid is viewed as a modernization of the nation's power grid by the edison electric institute ( eei ) , the trade association of the u.s. investor - owned utilities , which serve approximately 68% of u.s. electricity customers . in 2014 , doe issued a report assessing the status of smart grid deployment , concluding that the adoption of smart grid technologies ( i.e. , digital sensing , communications , and control technologies ) was accelerating but at varying rates "depending largely on decision - making at utility , state , and local levels. . doe noted that the nation's electricity system is in the midst of "potentially transformative change," with challenges for smart grid deployment remaining with respect to the incorporation of grid - connected renewable and distributed energy sources and adaptability to current and future consumer - oriented applications . in 2011 , the electric power research institute ( epri ) estimated that $338 billion to $476 billion over a 20-year period would be required for a "fully functioning smart grid. . as part of that investment , brattle identified $880 billion in transmission and distribution system modernization to integrate renewable energy and continue the installation of the smart grid . cost of operations could be reduced and system resiliency improved by further integration of automated switches and sensors , even considering the cost of a more cybersecure environment . but with the potentially high costs of a formal transition , some see smart grid deployment continuing much the same as it has , with a gradual modernization of the system as older components are replaced . while other potential issues exist , most electric utilities appear to view the intelligence and communications capabilities of smart grid systems positively with regard to the potential benefits of smart grid adoption discussed earlier in this report . in the 115 th congress , the "distributed energy demonstration act of 2017" ( s. 1874 ) , introduced in september 2017 , would direct the secretary of energy to establish demonstration grant programs related to the smart grid and distributed energy resource technologies that are likely dependent on its deployment . federal matching funds would be provided for qualifying smart grid investments . in the 114 th congress , the "north american energy security and infrastructure act of 2015" ( h.r .
