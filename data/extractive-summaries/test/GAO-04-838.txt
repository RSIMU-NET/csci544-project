further , the coast guard intends to conduct on - site compliance inspections of all facilities by january 1 , 2005 , and all vessels by july 1 , 2005 , to ensure that they have satisfactorily implemented their plans . the coast guard estimated that the security improvements imposed by these requirements would likely cost port stakeholders $7.3 billion over 10 years â€” most of it borne by facility and vessel owners and operators . our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the progress made to develop , review , and approve facility and vessel security plans by july 1 , 2004 ; ( 2 ) the coast guard's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that facility and vessel security plans are implemented ; and ( 3 ) the accuracy of the coast guard's estimates of costs for complying with mtsa security planning and implementation requirements . the key dates in the process established by the coast guard included the following: by december 31 , 2003 , those facilities and vessels subject to mtsa's security plan requirements had to submit security plans to the coast guard for review or self - certify that their plans would be developed and implemented by july 1 . these two options both involved review by the coast guard , but there was considerable difference in what was being reviewed before the start of the compliance phase on july 1 , 2004 . for facilities , after an on - site visit the captain of the port may issue a letter to the owner or operator , identifying the areas of the plan requiring significant revision and allowing the facility to continue operations through october 31 , on the condition that temporary security measures are implemented while the security plan continues to be reviewed . limited span of time included in the analysis . the uncertainty about whether the coast guard will be able to meet its timeframes for conducting on - site compliance inspections of the more than 12,300 facilities and vessels and questions about whether it will have enough staff and a sufficient experience base to handle so many inspections will undoubtedly challenge management and staff to effectively implement the strategy . having qualified inspectors is key to this effort . level . cargo . the coast guard estimated the maritime transportation industry will spend $7.3 billion to develop and implement security plans through the year 2012 . likewise , while the coast guard took the step of working with an expert panel , coast guard officials said this effort was not as extensive or sustained as under ideal circumstances .
