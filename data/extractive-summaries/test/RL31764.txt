radio frequency spectrum is managed primarily by regulations that set rules , for example , for permissible uses , certification of devices , requirements for public safety , and the acquisition of licenses . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) is responsible for overseeing licensed and unlicensed spectrum used for commercial purposes and by state and local agencies , including first responders , as well as most other radio frequencies not assigned for federal use . although congress has a legislative role in spectrum management , the fcc routinely takes on the responsibility of making decisions about the assignment of spectrum for different uses and sets the rules for auctions of spectrum licenses . two recent important auctions of spectrum licenses were for the 700 mhz band , auction 73 , and the advanced wireless services ( aws ) , designated auction 66 or aws - 1 . the auction for licenses at 700 mhzâairwaves that are or will be available because of the planned switch from analog to digital television broadcastingâended march 18 , 2008 . the bids in this auction totaled over $19.5 billion . spectrum is considered to be a natural resource with a combination of characteristics that differentiate it from other resources . airwaves used to broadcast any transmission can be reused after the broadcast is completed . technology dependent . administrative decisions as to how to allocate spectrum ( for example , the number of channels to assign with a license ) influence its commercial potential and the supply of spectrum for commercial and public use . auctions are a market - driven solution to assigning licenses to use specific frequencies and are a recent innovation in spectrum management and policy . creation of two important trust fundsâthe spectrum relocation fund and the digital television and public safety fundârequired new language and amendments to existing law to permit some auction revenues to be applied directly to specific programs through trusts . spectrum value depends on many factors , such as bandwidth , its frequencies ( since signal transmission characteristics vary along different parts of the spectrum ) , the geographic area covered , the services permitted by fcc rules , the availability of equipment that can operate at those frequencies , the demand for services that do not interfere with other bands , the amount of alternative spectrum already available for similar services , the number of incumbents presently occupying the spectrum , and whether incumbents will remain in that spectrum or be relocated to other spectrum . the omnibus budget reconciliation act amended the communications act of 1934 with a number of important provisions affecting the availability of spectrum licenses and authorized the fcc to organize auctions to award spectrum licenses for certain wireless communications services . today , spectrum for commercial applications is typically auctioned to the highest bidder , but many commercial users have spectrum acquired before the present - day auction process was implemented . auctions as a means of allocating spectrum are considered a success by many observers because of the federal revenue generated , as well as for the speed with which licenses auctioned have gone to the companies that value them the most and are most likely to put them to use .
