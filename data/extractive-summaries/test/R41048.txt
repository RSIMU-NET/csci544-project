one question raised by this idea is whether the exclusion of aliens could be done by amending the federal census statutes ( title 13 of the u.s. code ) , or whether such action would require an amendment to the constitution . however , in the event that the ongoing issue of the presence of unauthorized aliens in the united states remains unresolved by congressional legislation or executive agency action , the issue of whether to exclude unauthorized aliens from census data for apportionment may arise with regard to guidelines for future decennial censuses and apportionments . the fairness in representation act ( h.r . an amendment introduced by senator vitter to the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2010 ( s.amdt . 2644 to h.r . 2847 ) would have cut off funding for the census unless the census form included questions on u.s. citizenship and immigration status . the amendment was subsequently ruled to be non - germane . h.j.res . on the other side of the issue , the every person counts act ( h.r . while the constitution permits congress to conduct the census "in such manner as they shall by law direct," the census cannot be done in a way that is constitutionally impermissible . the constitutionality of the other provisions in the legislation would appear to depend on whether the constitution requires that all aliens must be included in the census count for any reason . if so , then it would appear that any exclusion would have to be done by constitutional amendment . on the other hand , if the constitution requires such individuals to be excluded from the census count , then congress could not prohibit the commerce secretary from asking questions about citizenship and immigration status . as mentioned above , it appears some are concerned that aliens , particularly those individuals in the country unlawfully , are included in the data used to apportion house seats among the states and determine voting districts within the states . the data must be used to apportion the house seats among the states , although there is no constitutional requirement it be used to determine voting districts within the states . the term "whole number of persons" appears broad enough to include all individuals , regardless of citizenship status , and thus would appear to require the entire population be included in the apportionment calculation . 11 in the 111 th congress , would likely be necessary in order to exclude any individuals from the census count for the purpose of apportioning house seats . from time to time , congress has considered legislation that would exclude all aliens or only unauthorized aliens from being included in the census to apportion the house seats among the states . such legislation would have either amended the census clause of the constitution or enacted or amended federal census statutes . however , if male inhabitants who were 21 years old and u.s. citizens were disenfranchised by a state for reasons other than participation in the confederate rebellion or a crime , the population count of that state for purposes of apportionment would be reduced by the ratio of these disenfranchised male citizens to the total number of male citizens in that state .
