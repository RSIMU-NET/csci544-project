in addition , the number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent ( from 41,235 to 47,219 ) from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015 — an increase that many researchers and child welfare professionals attribute to the opioid epidemic . under capta , state governors are required to provide an assurance to the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that their states have in effect and are enforcing a law or statewide program that requires ( 1 ) health care providers to notify child protective services ( cps ) of all infants affected by substance use or withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure , and ( 2 ) a plan of safe care be developed for all such infants , including the affected caregiver . in this review , we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify cps of substance - affected infants , and to guide how cps officials respond once they receive a notification ; ( 2 ) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to develop plans of safe care for substance - affected infants , and any challenges associated with implementing such policies and procedures ; and ( 3 ) steps hhs has taken to assist and monitor states' efforts in implementing capta provisions related to substance - affected infants . the circumstances under which a mandatory reporter must make a report vary from state to state , according to hhs . although one state reported in our survey that it does not require or encourage health care providers to notify cps about substance - affected infants , in an interview , state officials explained that its policy requires that health care providers notify cps if , through an assessment , they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse and neglect . in addition to having policies and procedures regarding the reporting of substance - affected infants , in written responses to our survey some states reported providing training and guidance to support the efforts of health care providers to notify cps about these infants . plans also address other needs , such as infants' immediate medical and longer - term developmental needs , as well as caregiver's substance use treatment needs . for example , massachusetts state cps officials told us that plans of safe care are developed for each family based on the information that staff collect from the safety , risk , and family assessments , as well as information collected from individuals who may have knowledge that would inform the family assessments , such as medical and treatment providers , and family members . for example , massachusetts officials said that their plans include everything that a family might need to ensure the safety of the child , including resources to ensure stabilization and reunification of a family , but they are not sure whether the plans meet new capta requirements , in part because they are not familiar with the term “plan of safe care.” an official in another state was also unsure about whether his state's “safety plans” would meet capta requirements . in hhs' role to assist states in the delivery of child welfare services , two agencies — acf and the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) — provided technical assistance to states through the national center on substance abuse and child welfare ( ncsacw ) . most states reported in our survey that additional guidance and assistance would be extremely or very helpful ( see figure 3 ) . states' suggestions ranged from assisting in the development of substance abuse training curriculum for staff to video conferences with other states to share information about implementing capta . while acf could not provide the number , officials reported that some of the state plans submitted to date did not meet the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans . hhs did not concur with our recommendation . hhs stated that: in january 2017 , acf clarified in guidance several of the issues raised in the report , including the population of infants and families covered by the provision and the state flexibility inherent in determining which infants are “affected by” substance abuse , and the terminology used in the federal law of what a “plan of safe care” is ; acf believes it is necessary to allow states the flexibility to meet the requirements in the context of their state cps program ; several of the challenges that the gao notes are not specific to capta compliance with the safe care plan and notification requirements ; and it does see the value in continuing to provide technical assistance to states to address known challenges and to enhance their understanding of capta requirements . effective implementation of our recommendation should help states better implement protections for children .
