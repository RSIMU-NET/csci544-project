the 2010 small business jobs act mandates us to conduct an annual audit of the sblf program . sblf participants had increased lending over baseline levels as of june 30 , 2013 , according to treasury's lending growth report . total qualified small business lending for sblf participants — banks and cdlfs — increased by almost $10.4 billion over their aggregate baseline of about $36.5 billion . for those participants that did not provide a reason to treasury , we contacted 10 former participants that fully repaid their sblf funds to ask them their reasons for leaving the program . factors that help to explain the variation in qualified small business lending across sblf banks include the condition of banks' loan portfolios , amount of net capital received from sblf , and demand for credit , among others . specifically , for the median bank in the first quartile , sblf net capital represented 2.9 percent of total assets compared to 2.2 percent for the median bank in the second quartile , 1.3 percent for the median bank in the third quartile , and 0.87 percent for the median bank in the fourth quartile . by conducting an impact evaluation , treasury could more effectively inform the public and congress on how sblf has affected the participants' lending compared to other factors , such as economic conditions , and could better assist congress in making future decisions about similar capital investment programs or alternatives to such programs that support small businesses' access to capital . treasury has taken steps to assess sblf program performance ( participants' lending patterns ) by including a peer - group analysis in the lending growth reports and collecting additional performance information through annual surveys of program participants . the survey covered several topics for the period from july 1 , 2011 , to june 30 , 2012: changes in participants' small business lending standards and demand ; obstacles to increasing small business lending ; actual increases in small business lending by industry sector , number , actions associated with use of sblf funds , including projected total increase in small business lending over 2 years ; and small business outreach activities required by the small business jobs act of 2010 . although treasury has taken actions to improve its reporting and analysis of sblf program performance , treasury officials told us they recently started to review additional methods for evaluating the effectiveness of the program and its impact on participants' small business lending , but have not yet provided us with a plan to evaluate the program's impact or selected an approach for conducting the evaluation . according to gao guidance on program evaluation , when a program is influenced by outside factors , as is the sblf program , impact evaluations are usually required to assess the net effect of a program ( or its actual effectiveness ) by comparing the observed outcomes to an estimate of what would have happened in the program's absence . treasury has continued to develop and refine its approach to assessing the performance of sblf and measuring the extent to which sblf participants have increased small business lending . treasury officials have told us that they are exploring various approaches to evaluating the program and have a firm under contract that is helping to identify different statistical analyses that could be used . to help ensure that treasury can provide a useful assessment of sblf that informs congress and stakeholders of the effectiveness of this capital investment program in increasing lending , treasury should follow through in conducting an impact evaluation of the program . treasury provided written comments , which are reprinted in appendix iii . to determine reasons for variation in growth of qualified small business lending at sblf banks , we used the most current level of qualified small business lending as of june 30 , 2013 , reported in treasury's october 2013 lending growth report , to divide 265 banks into four quartiles based on their level of qualified small business lending and compared the four quartiles to one another using financial and regulatory data . we also relied on the results report of treasury's first sblf annual survey .
