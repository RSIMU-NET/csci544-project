specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) the progress relevant agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended psi policies and procedures and issuing required annual reports ; and ( 2 ) the extent to which psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. counterproliferation efforts . for both objectives , we also interviewed relevant officials from those agencies . the u.s. government's psi efforts involve participation in three broad activities: multilateral psi planning meetings called operational experts group ( oeg ) meetings , psi exercises , and other efforts to encourage support and capacity for interdictions , such as workshops and conferences.military , law enforcement , intelligence , legal , and diplomatic experts from the united states and other oeg countries meet to consider ways to enhance the wmd interdiction capabilities of psi participants , build support for the initiative , develop operational concepts , organize psi exercises , and share information about national legal authorities . u.s. agencies have adopted interagency guidance documents that establish policies and procedures for all agencies participating in psi activities . the report is to consist of a 3-year plan describing psi - related activities and identifying estimated expenditures for these activities , and a description of the psi - related activities and associated expenditures carried out during the fiscal year preceding the year of the report.report , although responsibility for leading the annual effort alternates dod and state co - author each between the two . although reports contain some expenditure data from agencies other than dod , none of the other agencies provide this data for all of the annual reports . in addition , they have extended access to psi activities to more countries that are not part of the 21-country oeg . despite recommendations in the 9 / 11 act and by gao that agencies develop psi performance indicators , dod , state , cbp , and fbi have not developed indicators that can be used to systematically measure progress toward further , the agencies have not systematically the stated psi objective.evaluated psi activity results . although some officials indicated plans to develop psi performance indicators , officials from dod and state also cited several challenges to developing indicators to measure psi activities' results , including difficulty quantifying how psi activities improved capacity . however , gao has previously reported that , despite challenges , evaluating results and developing measures are possible . one approach psi agency officials could consider is developing a framework to link performance measures , such as number of participants trained , to outcomes , such as changes in national policies that strengthen their authority to perform interdictions . while u.s. agencies have undertaken a range of psi efforts since 2008 , they have not established a framework to measure psi activities' results and , therefore , it is unclear to what extent these activities have enhanced and expanded capacity to prevent the flow of wmd , their delivery systems , and related materials on the ground , in the air , and at sea , to and from states and nonstate actors of proliferation concern . dod officials said they have general counterproliferation goals but have not developed psi indicators . they have also submitted annual reports covering fiscal years 2008 through 2010 documenting their psi activities , but these reports have not included the associated funding information for all psi implementing agencies , as required by law . develop a framework for measuring psi activities' results , including performance measures where possible that help link the results to psi's objective . in commenting on the draft report , dod partially concurred with both of our recommendations . state partially concurred with the recommendation to provide expenditure information for all u.s. agencies participating in psi activities . we also reviewed psi annual reports submitted to congress by the departments of state ( state ) and defense ( dod ) and analyzed them for compliance with the requirements in the 9 / 11 act .
