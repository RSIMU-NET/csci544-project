the coast guard is managing a multi - billion dollar acquisition portfolio as it seeks to modernize its aging assets , including ships , planes , and information technology . we reviewed ( 1 ) how selected assets are performing operationally and to what extent they are achieving desired performance levels in testing ; ( 2 ) the current cost of the coast guard's acquisition portfolio as well as plans to fund its assets ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the coast guard is experiencing capability gaps , if any , given known affordability issues . to assess the cost and schedule of the coast guard's portfolio and steps taken to address affordability concerns , we reviewed each asset's acquisition program baseline as well as the coast guard's budget and discussed the acquisition portfolio with coast guard , dhs , and office of management and budget ( omb ) officials and followed up on previous efforts to address affordability . according to dhs and coast guard acquisition guidance , results of operational tests are used to evaluate the degree to which the capability or system being acquired meets its requirements and is able to operate in its intended environment , both before and often after full - rate production commences . however , neither asset met all key requirements during initial operational testing . for example , dhs and coast guard guidance provide that the coast guard should determine if the capability meets the established minimum performance standards , but do not specify when this determination should be made . specific information on testing outcomes for each asset follows . the table does not include all changes because the coast guard did not have data for some of the modifications . while testing the c4isr system at the same time as the assets can work , this strategy is not consistent with coast guard acquisition guidance if the c4isr system's key performance parameters are not tested . initial cost estimates are being developed for this project . as acquisition program costs increase across the portfolio , consuming significant amounts of funding , the coast guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009 , in terms of the money needed to finish these programs . in 2009 , we found that the coast guard needed $18.2 billion to field its original baseline , but it now needs $20.7 billion to finish fielding these same assets . as program cost increases consume significant amounts of funding , the coast guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009 , in terms of the money needed to finish these programs . the coast guard is repeatedly delaying and reducing its capability through its annual budget process , but does not know the extent to which its mission needs can be tailored and still achieve desired results . thus , the coast guard does not know what capability it will be able to provide and whether or not this capability will meet mission needs . without such a plan , the coast guard does not have a mechanism to aid in matching its requirements and resources . the coast guard has no method in the coast guard's acquisition guidance supports using a long range capital planning framework . as a result , the navy has some knowledge of its future funding challenges . to help ensure that it receives accurate information on the full effect of funding decisions on acquisition programs , congress should consider amending the law that governs the 5-year capital investment plan to require the coast guard to submit cost and schedule information that reflects the impact of the annual president's budget request on each acquisition across the portfolio — in addition to the current practice of reporting the cost and schedule estimates in current program baselines . to help the coast guard improve the long - term outlook of its portfolio , we recommend that the commandant of the coast guard take the following action: develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets . we provided a draft of this report to dhs for review and comment . to assess how selected assets are performing operationally and to what extent they are achieving desired performance levels in testing , we selected key assets that are being used in operations that were a part of the original 2007 baseline — the maritime patrol aircraft ( hc - 144 ) , fast response cutter , national security cutter , and the command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) systems — and reviewed test reports and operational data for these assets . gao - 13-325 .
