as part of an agreement to increase the statutory limit on public debt , the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l . 112-25 ) aimed to reduce annual federal budget deficits by a total of at least $2.1 trillion from fy2012 through fy2021 , with approximately half of the savings to come from defense . congress provides budget authority by law to federal agencies to obligate money for goods and services . after the joint select committee on deficit reduction did not reach a deficit - reduction deal and triggered backup budgetary enforcement measures of steeper reductions to the initial bca caps beginning in fy2013 , the "security" category was revised to the narrower "defense" category , which included only discretionary programs in the national defense budget function ( 050 ) . lawrence korb , an assistant secretary of defense during the reagan administration , said the bca has "affected defense capability somewhat," but noted congress has blunted the law's impact by increasing the caps and by exempting from the restrictions funding for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) , allowing the department of defense ( dod ) to use such funds for base - budget activities . the spending limits ( or caps ) apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority . the caps are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration , which automatically cancels previously enacted spending by an amount necessary to reach prespecified levels . the defense discretionary spending limits apply to national defense ( budget function 050 ) but not to funding designated for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) or emergencies . congress has repeatedly amended the budget control act of 2011 ( p.l . 112-25 ) to revise the discretionary spending limits . the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) , enacted on february 9 , 2018 , amended the bca to raise defense discretionary spending caps for fy2018 and fy2019 , with increases more than three times larger than previous changes ( see figure 2 ) . a sequester is implemented through a sequestration order issued by the president as required by law . while the deficit decreased from $1.1 trillion ( 6.8% of gross domestic product ) in fy2012 to $665 billion ( 3.5% of gdp ) in fy2017 , it is projected to increase to $1.1 trillion ( 4.9% of gdp ) in fy2021 . over the same period , federal debt held by the public has increased from $11.3 trillion ( 70.4% of gdp ) in fy2012 to $14.7 trillion ( 76.5% of gdp ) in fy2017 and is projected to further increase to $19 trillion ( 83.1% of gdp ) in fy2021 .
