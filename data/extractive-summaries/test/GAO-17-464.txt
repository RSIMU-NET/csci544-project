specifically , our objectives were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) gsa's plans and guidance to federal agencies for transitioning to eis incorporate lessons learned from prior transitions and ( 2 ) selected agencies are following established planning practices for their transitions . based on these criteria , we selected five agencies — the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , labor ( dol ) , and transportation ( dot ) , as well as the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) and the social security administration ( ssa ) . according to gsa , customer agencies' responsibilities under eis include: identifying key personnel , chiefly a senior transition sponsor , lead transition manager , and transition ordering contracting officer ; engaging expertise from chief information officers , chief acquisition officers , and chief financial officers to build an integrated transition team of telecommunications managers , acquisition experts , and financial staff ; developing a financial strategy and budget for transition costs beginning in fiscal year 2017 ; analyzing and confirming the accuracy of the inventory of active services that must be transitioned ; developing an agency transition plan by october 2016 that describes the agency's technological goals , transition schedule , strategy for awarding task orders on eis for transitioning services , and any constraints or risks ; and preparing solicitations for task orders to be released immediately upon award of eis contracts . gsa compiled lessons learned from previous telecommunications transitions , including 35 lessons that described actions that agencies should take during future transitions . the guidance sources did not address 7 lessons , including those related to agencies ( 1 ) bearing the costs associated with contract extensions resulting from delays in their contract selections , transition planning , or ordering ; and ( 2 ) not assuming that a transition to a new contract with the same vendor will be easier than a change in vendors . by not including all lessons learned in its plans and guidance to agencies , gsa limits agencies' ability to plan for actions that will need to be taken later in the transition . as a result , the risk is increased that agencies could repeat prior mistakes , including those that could result in schedule delays or unnecessary costs . incorporate strategic needs into transition planning . establish transition objectives , risks , and measures of success . dot , sec , ssa , and usda ) had generally addressed parts of all five practices and one agency had fully implemented one practice . the selected agencies provided various reasons for not fully adopting the practices , ranging from their uncertainty due to delays in awarding the eis contracts and the lack of specific direction and planned contractor assistance from gsa to implement the practices , to having plans to implement practices later as part of established agency procedures for managing it projects . however , going forward , if the agencies do not fully implement the practices , they will be more likely to experience the kinds of delays and increased costs that occurred in previous transitions . the remaining two agencies , dol and sec , had not yet implemented this practice . ◒ agency has partially implemented practice activity .  ( recommendation 8 ) the secretary of labor should ensure that the department's chief information officer identifies transition - related roles and responsibilities related to the management of assets , human capital , and information security , and legal expertise ; develops a transition communications plan ; and uses project , configuration , and change - management processes in dol's transition ( recommendation 9 ) the secretary of labor should ensure that the department's chief information officer identifies the resources needed for the full transition , develops justifications for the costs of changes to hardware and software , identifies staff resources needed for the remainder of the transition , and analyzes training needs for staff assisting with the transition . we provided a draft of this report to gsa , usda , dol , sec , dot , and ssa for comment . one agency agreed with two recommendations and disagreed wholly or in part with three other recommendations . ssa disagreed with our remaining two recommendations . based on our assessment , we classified the status of a lesson learned as “fully addressed” if the lesson learned appeared in at least one planning and guidance source or if all of the concepts described in a practice were found collectively in multiple guidance sources ; “partially addressed,” if part of the lesson learned appeared in at least one document ; or “not addressed,” if the lesson learned did not appear in any of the planning and guidance sources . based on experiences during previous telecommunications transitions , the general services administration ( gsa ) identified 96 lessons learned . table 7 describes the 35 agency - focused lessons learned identified by gsa during previous telecommunication transitions and the extent to which each was addressed in gsa's eis transition plans and guidance .
