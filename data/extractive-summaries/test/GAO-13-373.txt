approximately 2 million of these housing units are manufactured homes ( i.e. , mobile homes ) that were built before 1976 , when new standards for energy efficient construction went into effect . these older manufactured homes are generally considered to have some of the poorest energy efficiency of all housing units . many of the occupants of these homes qualify for federal assistance to help pay their energy bills through the u.s. department of health and human services' ( hhs ) low income home energy assistance program ( liheap ) . our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify states that have funded programs to replace older manufactured homes with more energy efficient models and describe these programs ; ( 2 ) identify challenges , if any , these states reported facing in implementing these programs ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which these programs resulted in energy savings sufficient to offset replacement costs . however , because funds from liheap , which assists low - income families in reducing their energy bills by making long - term energy efficiency improvements to their homes , precluded from being used for new construction , they cannot be used to replace existing homes with newer , more efficient models . we identified three states – – maine , montana , and washington — that have used a combination of state and federal funds to conduct pilot programs that replaced older manufactured homes with more energy efficient models . the three programs were relatively small , accounting for about $4.5 million in spending and responsible for replacing 81 homes , over about 2 years . the programs differed in program requirements , the types of financing used , and the types of replacement homes used . unlike maine , the pilot did not require the beneficiary to own the land on which the home was situated but required that the beneficiary's lease on the land exceed the terms of the loan . officials from all three state replacement pilot programs and representatives of organizations and agencies that aided these programs told us that they faced three key types of challenges: ( 1 ) many potential beneficiaries were not eligible to participate ; ( 2 ) some potential beneficiaries were not willing to participate ; and ( 3 ) other logistical challenges , such as finding suitable replacement homes within a reasonable distance to transport them to beneficiaries , which resulted in higher costs . did not own or have a long - term lease for the land . poor credit histories . some potential beneficiaries were doubtful that such a program would be legitimate . unwilling to take on any debt . unwilling to move from their current location . some potential beneficiaries may be unwilling , or unable , to pay the increased property taxes that would result from the increased value of their homes . specifically , the two programs that maintained information on energy use and estimated savings spent an average of about $56,119 per unit to replace each older manufactured home and estimated about $489 in annual energy savings per home . the average cost of replacement homes varied across the three programs we examined . in addition , we analyzed costs and projected energy savings for individual replacement homes where data were available , and we found the data confirmed that the energy savings were not sufficient to recover the costs of replacing the homes over a typical loan period.montana — where the average replacement cost was $42,339 — the average projected energy savings on a replacement home were estimated to be $1,070 per year . nonetheless , state officials told us that these replacement programs were not specifically designed for energy savings to offset replacement costs , and some officials told us that energy efficiency gains were secondary to the health and welfare benefits of getting occupants into safer , more weather - tight manufactured homes . hhs provided technical and clarifying comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
