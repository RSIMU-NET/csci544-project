at your request , we will first discuss the status of the national weather service ( nws ) systems modernization and then address the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring noaa's marine data . in brief , although nws is nearing completion of its systems modernization effort , two significant challenges face it this year â€” deploying the final system of the modernization and ensuring that all of its mission - critical systems are year 2000 compliant . nws has made progress on both fronts . in the noaa fleet area , noaa now outsources for more of its research and data needs but plans to spend $185 million over the next 5 years to acquire four new replacement noaa fisheries research ships . in the noaa fleet area , continuing congressional oversight of noaa's budget requests for replacement or upgraded ships is needed to ensure that noaa is pursuing the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring marine data .
