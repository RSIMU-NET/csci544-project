in 2005 , the crop insurance program provided $44 billion in insurance coverage for over 200 million acres of farmland at a cost of $2.7 billion to the federal government , including $117 million estimated by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) risk management agency ( rma ) to have resulted from fraud , waste , and abuse . this act provided rma and usda's farm service agency ( fsa ) with new tools for monitoring and controlling program abuses . arpa required the secretary of agriculture to develop and implement a coordinated plan for fsa to assist rma in the ongoing monitoring of the crop insurance program and to use information technologies , such as data mining — the analysis of data to establish relationships and identify patterns — to administer and enforce the program . my testimony today focuses on two primary issues discussed in the september 2005 report: ( 1 ) the effectiveness of usda's procedures and processes to prevent and detect fraud , waste , and abuse in selling and servicing crop insurance policies , and ( 2 ) the extent to which program design issues may make the program more vulnerable to fraud , waste , and abuse . we identified weaknesses in four key areas: ( 1 ) field inspections , ( 2 ) data mining processes that exclude many large farming operations when farmers do not report their interest in them , ( 3 ) quality assurance reviews conducted by insurance companies , and ( 4 ) imposition of sanctions . in terms of rma's regulations , farmers can insure their fields individually instead of insuring all fields combined , which makes it easier for them to switch production among fields , either to make false insurance claims or to build up a higher yield history on a particular field in order to increase its eligibility for higher future insurance guarantees . the cases show how farmers , sometimes in collusion with insurance agents and others , falsely claim prevented planting , weather damage , and low production . several of these cases also demonstrate the importance of having fsa and rma work together to identify and share information on questionable farming practices / activities . inspections during the growing season are not being used to maximum effect . between 2001 and 2004 , farmers filed claims on about 380,000 policies annually , and rma's data mining identified about 1 percent of these claims as questionable and needing fsa inspection . rma's data analysis of the largest farming operations is incomplete . the average ownership interest of the persons not disclosed for the 21,310 entities was 33 percent ; as a result , rma should be able to recover up to $74 million in claims payments . rma is not effectively overseeing insurance companies' quality assurance programs . rma has infrequently used its new sanction authority to address program abuses . although arpa expanded rma's authority to impose sanctions on farmers , agents , and adjusters who willfully and intentionally provide false or inaccurate information or fail to comply with other fcic program requirements , rma has only used this authority on a limited basis . while not all of these policy irregularities were necessarily sanctionable , rma imposed only 114 sanctions from 2001 through 2004 . according to rma officials , rma requested and imposed few sanctions because it had not issued regulations to implement its expanded authority under arpa . while rma can improve its day - to - day oversight of the federal crop insurance program in a number of ways , the program's design , as laid out in rma's regulations or as required by statute , hinders officials' efforts to administer certain program provisions to prevent fraud , waste , and abuse , as the following discussion indicates . high premium subsidies may inhibit rma's ability to control program abuse . high premium subsidies shield farmers from the full effect of paying higher premiums . some of the issues we identified are reflected in eight recent crop insurance fraud cases that usda's office of inspector general ( oig ) investigated and that resulted in criminal prosecution between june 2003 and april 2005 .
