this report ( 1 ) describes the status and financial outlook of the postal service retiree health benefits fund , ( 2 ) analyzes how alternative approaches for funding retiree health benefits could affect future usps payments and unfunded liabilities , and ( 3 ) determines key considerations for policymakers assessing the alternative approaches . we also reviewed our prior work and reviewed and summarized reports and data from usps and others on how usps's financial condition has changed since 2006 . paea , enacted in 2006,transferred all responsibility for costs related to csrs military service credit from usps back to the u.s. treasury , both retroactively and prospectively ; this included all csrs military service costs for postal employees since the inception of the postal service in 1971 ; established the psrhbf to begin prefunding the health benefits of current and future postal retirees and transferred about $20 billion of “start - up” funds into the psrhbf ( $3 billion from the discontinued csrs escrow — as usps's annual csrs payment was suspended — and $17 billion from the surplus in the csrs fund ) ; required usps to make annual payments ranging from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion per year into the psrhbf from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 to begin prefunding its retiree health benefit liability ; and required opm to calculate the remaining unfunded liability in 2017 and each subsequent year , and to calculate an amortization payment based on an amortization period that extends to 2056 or , if later , 15 years from the then - current fiscal year . for fiscal year 2012 , usps had a net loss of almost $16 billion , which included $11.1 billion for required psrhbf prefunding payments furthermore , usps's future financial outlook that usps did not make.is bleak as it projects further declines in mail volume and revenue by fiscal year 2020 . because of usps's financial difficulties , however , usps has not made all of its required prefunding payments . while the psrhbf balance covered about 49 percent of usps's retiree health benefit liability at fiscal year - end 2012 , usps's deteriorating financial outlook will make it difficult under current requirements for usps to continue prefunding the remaining unfunded liability in the short term , and possibly to continue funding the remaining unfunded liability over the next several decades , as required under paea . beginning in fiscal year 2017 , the current law switches to an “actuarial approach” for the remaining funding , under which usps's share of premium payments for existing retirees and beneficiaries is paid from the psrhbf rather than by usps , and usps makes annual payments to the psrhbf consisting of two components: 1. the actuarially determined cost of future benefits attributable to employee service during the fiscal year ( known as the annual “normal cost” ) , and 2. the actuarially determined amount that , as calculated by opm , would be projected to fully fund the remaining unfunded liability over an amortization period ending in the later of fiscal year 2056 or 15 years subsequent to the then - current fiscal year . the house bill ( h.r . key features of current law and these alternative approaches are summarized in table 2 . as a result , the liability is projected to be 70 percent funded by 2040 , close to the 73 percent projected funded percentage under the modified senate approach.modified senate approach , the seal and grow approach is projected to result in a significant improvement in the funded percentage over the projection period , while still leaving a substantially larger unfunded liability relative to the modified current law , house , and administration approaches . protecting the future viability of usps by not overwhelming it with bills and unfunded liabilities for the cost of employee benefits after these employees have already retired is complicated by the organization's immediate cash flow challenges including having reached the maximum of its borrowing authority . usps accounts for these benefits using private - sector multiemployer accounting rules , under which usps does not recognize the unfunded liability for these benefits on its balance sheet . as previously cited , deferrals and lower payments in the short - term will reduce usps's reported financial losses in the short - term , but would increase its unfunded retiree health benefit liability and require larger annual payments in the future ; yet at the same time , currently required short - term payments are higher than what would be required under the actuarial approach that begins in 2017 . furthermore , postal ratepayers provide usps with funding , but as mail volumes decline , there may be fewer ratepayers in the future to pay for deferred costs . usps agreed that comprehensive reform is necessary to achieve financial sustainability . we noted in our report that none of the funding approaches will be viable unless usps has the ability to make the required payments , and that a comprehensive package of actions is needed to improve usps's financial viability . while our report did not examine comprehensively the reasons for other entities' prefunding decisions , we noted that although prefunding is not required , a number of private , state , local , and federal entities have elected to prefund some percentage of their retiree health benefits , as follows: standard & poor's ( s&p ) reported that 126 of the 296 companies in the s&p 500 that offered “other post - employment benefits” ( opeb ) prefunded some percentage of the associated liabilities ; the usps oig reported that 38 percent of fortune 1000 companies that offer retiree health benefits prefund them , at a median funding level of 37 percent ; 18 states and 13 of the 39 largest local governments had set aside at least a combined $25 billion in assets to cover their opeb liabilities ; and the department of defense prefunds its retiree health benefits for medicare - eligible retirees and beneficiaries , with a 100 percent target funding percentage , and that this fund , which was started in 2002 in reaction to rapidly rising health care costs , had assets of $166 billion as of fiscal year - end 2010 . the differences between these two assumption bases are described in the report .
