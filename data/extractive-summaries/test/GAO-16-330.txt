in 2007 , however , a gao covert vulnerability testing effort revealed that weaknesses persisted as gao investigators , after setting up a fictitious company , were able to obtain a genuine nrc license and then alter it to obtain agreements to purchase devices containing , in aggregate , a dangerous ( category 3 ) quantity of radioactive materials . you asked us to review and assess the steps nrc and agreement states have taken to strengthen their licensing processes . this report ( 1 ) examines what steps nrc and agreement states have taken since 2007 to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations , and licensees can obtain materials only in quantities allowed by their licenses , and ( 2 ) presents the results of our covert vulnerability testing designed to test the effectiveness of these controls . we also examined nrc documents on the use of nrc's key data systems — the national source tracking system , web - based licensing system , and license verification system . nrc has relinquished regulatory authority for licensing and regulating certain radioactive material to 37 states that have entered into an agreement with nrc ( agreement states ) . nrc and agreement states have taken several steps since 2007 to help ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations and that licensees can only obtain such materials in quantities allowed by their licenses , but have not taken some measures for better controlling category 3 quantities of radioactive materials . nrc does not require that category 3 quantities be tracked in nsts nor does it require all category 3 licenses be included in wbl . nrc also established a 14-point checklist to guide prelicensing site visits and developed a list of questions and activities related to the applicant's business operations , facility , radiation safety operations , and personnel qualifications , to scrutinize the applicant and provide a basis for confidence that the applicant will use the radioactive material as specified in the license . because they do not require transferors of category 3 and smaller quantities of radioactive materials to verify the validity of a transferee's license by contacting the appropriate regulatory body directly , and do not make lvs available for use by these transferors , nrc and agreement states do not have assurance that their systems would prevent bad actors from altering licenses or fraudulently reporting the details of their licenses to transferors , accumulating dangerous materials by aggregation to category 2 or larger quantities on the basis of those fraudulent licenses , and thereby endangering public health and safety . in order to test the effectiveness of nrc's revised guidance , screening criteria , checklists , and the prelicensing site visit , we established three fictitious companies ; leased vacant space in an industrial or office park for each company ( two in agreement states , one in an nrc state ) ; and submitted an application to the appropriate nrc regional office or agreement state for a specific radioactive materials license to possess a high - level category 3 quantity source that was only slightly below the threshold for a category 2 quantity source . according to nrc officials , while the nrc prelicensing checklist does not require that a site have implemented all the requirements that apply to licensees , its purpose , among other things , is to establish a basis for confidence that radioactive material will be used as specified on the license being sought , and we made no attempt to improve or outfit the site to make it appear as if a legitimate business was operating there . gao also obtained a license for a fictitious business in 2007 in 2007 , gao tested controls on the licensing of radioactive materials in two states — a state regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission and an agreement state . to do this , gao established two fictitious businesses and submitted a radioactive materials application to the relevant regulatory body for each state . this time , we were able to complete a similar covert vulnerability test in which we obtained a real license for a category 3 quantity of radioactive material and altered it to obtain commitments from multiple vendors to sell us , in aggregate , a more dangerous category 2 quantity of a type of radioactive material considered attractive for use in an rdd . nrc also developed and provided a training webinar for nrc and agreement state staff to further emphasize prelicensing guidance and providing adequate scrutiny during site visits . finally , according to nrc officials , nrc and agreement state working groups are currently developing and evaluating enhancements to ( 1 ) current prelicensing guidance overall , and ( 2 ) license verification and transfer requirements and prelicensing guidance for category 3 licenses in particular . because some quantities of radioactive materials are potentially dangerous to human health if not properly handled , we recommend that nrc take action to better track and secure these materials and verify the legitimacy of the licenses for those who seek to possess them . in its written comments , reproduced in appendix i , nrc neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations , but noted that the agency has formal evaluations underway considering all three recommendations . specifically , nrc stated that the agency would consider gao's recommendations as part of the working groups the agency has established to evaluate ( 1 ) including category 3 sources in wbl and nsts , ( 2 ) license verification transfer requirements for category 3 sources , and ( 3 ) enhancing security and safety measures as part of the prelicensing process .
