the various systems that collect , process , and disseminate intelligence are encompassed inthe budget category known as intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ( 1 ) ) . isr covers a multitude ofprograms ranging from billion - dollar satellites to hand - held cameras . somesystems are used only by military units ; others are national systems operated by washington - leveldefense agencies . understanding the procedures for acquiring isr systems is , however , complicated by the factthat different isr systems are acquired in entirely different ways , by different intelligence agenciesor military services , and are designed for different users . in 1995 , the senate selectcommittee on intelligence ( ssci ) expressed its misgivings about existing cooperation amongagencies and recommended a joint review by the director of central intelligence ( dci ) and thedeputy secretary of defense to ensure that "both intelligence community and defense departmentequities are served in the planning , programming , and management of all intelligence activities andprograms. . 104-293 ) included provisions thatstrengthened the ability of the dci "to manage the intelligence community by codifying hisauthority to participate in the development of the budgets for defense - wide and tacticalintelligence...." ( 4 ) theconference committee stated: "giving the dci a database of all intelligence activities and requiringall national foreign intelligence program ( nfip ) elements ( 5 ) to submit periodic budget execution reports should enable the dcito make better use of his existing authorities - - given to him by congress in 1992 - - to approve thebudgets of nfip elements and to transfer funds and personnel with the concurrence of affectedagency heads .  ( 12 ) p.l . there is a widespread sense that the optimal mix of isr systems has not yet been determined . given the potential for the need for future budgetary restraints on isr programs , with orwithout a new procedural framework , the acquisition of expensive new systems will undoubtedlyremain an especially complex challenge to government decisionmakers .  ( 62 ) whileno serious observer would argue that u.s. isr requirements could be met by only one approach,many believe that there have been insufficient efforts to achieve an appropriate mix that providesoptimal collection capabilities while avoiding unnecessary duplication or wasted resources .  ( 67 ) according to one media account , the program is more than ayear behind schedule and is forcing a shift of some $4 billion from other isr programs .  ( 68 ) some observers have,accordingly , suggested that many of the capabilities of reconnaissance satellites could be realizedby relying on less expensive , high - altitude unmanned aerial vehicles such as global hawk , whichhas recently become available for operational missions and has been used during operation iraqfreedom .  ( 69 ) there are advantages and disadvantages to both satellites and uavs ( as well as mannedaircraft which can also be used advantageously in some circumstances ) .
