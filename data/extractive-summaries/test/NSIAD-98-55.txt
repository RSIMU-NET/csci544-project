thus , the number or size of units is not as important as the number of people that volunteer . creating fewer larger - sized flying squadrons should have little impact on wartime missions as well . although squadrons are assigned to wings in peacetime , war plans described to us did not call for these wings to deploy or operate together . redistributing the reserve's component c - 130 and kc - 135 existing aircraft into fewer , larger squadrons and wings would reduce operating costs . for example , redistributing 16 c - 130 aircraft from two 8-aircraft wings to one 16-aircraft wing would save about $11 million dollars annually , primarily from personnel savings . we developed five options for redistributing the existing reserve component c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft into larger - sized squadrons that show a gradual increase in savings in operating costs â€” from $51 million to $209 million annually . the reserve components' c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft can be redistributed into larger - sized squadrons and still accomplish their peacetime and wartime missions . therefore , we recommend that you direct the secretary of the air force to develop a plan to organize the c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft in the air national guard and air force reserve into larger wings at fewer locations and seek congressional support for the plan . this option would save about $35 million annually . most locations would be able to recruit personnel to fully meet personnel requirements , but recruiting would be challenging at some locations . facilities could be expanded at low cost at every location . also , squadrons with duplicative functions could be eliminated . in making this assessment , we ( 1 ) determined the effect of a reorganization of the c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft on mission accomplishment , ( 2 ) determined whether costs could be reduced through a restructuring of the aircraft squadrons , and ( 3 ) developed five possible options for increasing the number of aircraft in c - 130 and kc - 135 squadrons and analyzed their effect on operations and costs .
