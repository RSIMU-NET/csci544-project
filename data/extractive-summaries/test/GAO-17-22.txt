these plans primarily base payment amounts on a borrower's income and extend repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years with any remaining balance forgiven at the end of that period . by june 2016 , 24 percent of borrowers repaying their loans ( or 5.3 million borrowers ) were doing so in idr plans , and it is likely that more will join in the future . to what extent do education's approach to estimating idr plan costs and quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates ? . we conducted this performance audit from march 2015 to november 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . education officials confirmed that this higher estimated loan volume is likely related to three key factors: more generous idr plans available for loans issued since fiscal year increased efforts to make borrowers aware of idr plans , and increased overall volume of direct loans issued as a result of increased college attendance following the 2008 economic downturn and the end of the federal family education loan program ( which guaranteed federal student loans issued by private lenders ) in 2010 . when we used education's data and computer programs to adjust borrowers' future incomes for inflation , as well as the federal poverty guidelines used to calculate their discretionary incomes , we found that idr plan budget estimates declined by over $17 billion , when compared to education's current idr plan budget estimates . education's model redesign is anticipated to be a multi - year project , and until the model has been completed and tested to ensure reasonable results , education's idr plan budget estimates are vulnerable to underestimated idr plan participation and costs . further , federal guidance for estimating subsidy costs of federal loan programs states that loan characteristics — such as loan types — are critical for identifying factors that predict subsidy costs and should be preserved . second , management has not reviewed or approved that model . we recently recommended that education improve documentation of its overall process for estimating costs of direct loans . further , education conducted sensitivity analysis on only one key assumption — borrower incomes — at the request of omb . developing a sound set of assumptions is , of course , important . given growth in idr plan cost estimates over time due to the rising volume of loans expected to be repaid in these plans , it would also be useful to disclose that current estimates assume that no borrowers will switch from other repayment plans into idr plans in the future . some uncertainty is unavoidable when anticipating long - term loan costs , but we found numerous shortcomings in education's estimation approach and quality control practices that call into question the reliability of its budget estimates and affect the quality of information congress has to make informed budget decisions . in addition , until education's planned revisions to its student loan model have been completed and tested to ensure reasonableness , the agency's idr plan budget estimates will not reasonably reflect participation trends in idr plans , particularly the extent to which borrowers in other repayment plans may switch into them . in the interim , education may continue to understate idr plan costs by billions of dollars , as past trends in estimates indicate . gao staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix vi . this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing ( 1 ) the u.s. department of education's ( education's ) current income - driven ( idr ) repayment plan budget estimates and how they have changed over time and ( 2 ) the extent to which education's approach to estimating idr plan costs and its quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates . to analyze education's current idr plan budget estimates and how they have changed over time , we reviewed education's annual submissions to the president's budget for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 , which include estimated idr plan loan volume and subsidy rates for direct loans to be issued in the year the of the budget and the two preceding fiscal years . we focused on pslf participation because actual participation is not yet known for this program and education assumed that any borrower they estimated to be eligible for pslf would choose to participate .
