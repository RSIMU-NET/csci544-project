specifically , this report ( 1 ) identifies the criteria cpsc uses to select projects and reviews the information it relies upon in making these choices , ( 2 ) assesses the information cpsc draws on to perform risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses and evaluates the agency's methodology for conducting cost - benefit analyses , and ( 3 ) describes cpsc's procedures for releasing manufacturer - specific information to the public and reports whether evidence exists that cpsc violated its statutory requirements concerning the release of such information . the congress may require cpsc to study a wide - ranging product area . cpsc has established criteria to help in project selection , such as the numbers of deaths and injuries associated with a product . these criteria , which are incorporated in agency regulations , include the following: the frequency of injuries and deaths resulting from the hazard ; the severity of the injuries resulting from the hazard ; addressability — that is , the extent to which the hazard is likely to be reduced through cpsc action — agency regulations note that the cause of the hazard should be analyzed to help determine the extent to which injuries can reasonably be expected to be reduced or eliminated through cpsc action ; the number of chronic illnesses and future injuries predicted to result from the hazard ; preliminary estimates of the costs and benefits to society resulting from unforeseen nature of the risk — that is , the degree to which consumers are aware of the hazard and its consequences ; vulnerability of the population at risk — whether some individuals ( such as children ) may be less able to recognize or escape from potential hazards and therefore may require a relatively higher degree of protection ; probability of exposure to the product hazard — that is , how many consumers are exposed to the potential hazard , or how likely a typical consumer is to be exposed to the hazard ; and other — additional criteria to be considered at the discretion of cpsc . as with exposure data , these investigations are not conducted for every project and are completed only after a project is well under way . however , cpsc usually does not conduct a formal numerical risk assessment before issuing a regulation , and the law does not require it . both risk assessment and cost - benefit analysis require extensive data . cpsc staff and commissioners , industry representatives , and consumer advocates expressed a wide variety of opinions on the effectiveness of these requirements , and some individuals favored specific changes . industry representatives also said that the current restrictions do not provide sufficient protection when information is released on product groups instead of on the products of an individual manufacturer .
