the 111 th congress enacted a number of renewable energy tax incentives as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . as various incentives for renewable energy , renewable fuels , and energy efficiency are scheduled to expire at the end of 2011 , the 112 th congress may want to explore various policy options for encouraging investment in renewable energy . one barrier to investments in renewable energy projects is that such projects are highly capital intensive . one option for attracting additional capital to the renewable energy sector that congress may consider is allowing renewable energy activities access to the master limited partnership ( mlp ) business structure . the final sections of this report highlight how the mlp structure might be able to attract additional capital to the renewable energy sector , while also discussing some potential policy concerns . as a result , the partnership business structure became more favorable for tax purposes than the corporate structure . 3545 , the 100 th congress noted "to the extent activities that would otherwise be conducted in the corporate form , and earnings that would be subject to two levels of tax ( at the corporate and shareholder levels ) , the growth of publically traded partnerships engaged in such activities tends to jeopardize the corporate tax base. . when irc ยง 7704 was enacted , effectively subjecting most ptps and mlps to corporate taxation , existing ptps and mlps were allowed to continue operating as a partnership for 10 years . instead of being forced to choose an alternative organizational form , grandfathered ptps and mlps were given the option of paying a 3.5% tax on gross income , as an alternative to corporate income taxes . this change was made as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) , at an estimated cost of $119 million over 10 years . these policies were consistent with the objectives of the obama administration , which has emphasized the importance of investments in clean energy technology , including resources and infrastructure . under this program , qualified taxpayers could elect to receive a one - time grant from the treasury in lieu of the renewable energy ptc or investment tax credit ( itc ) . it has been argued that the section 1603 grant program prevented what could have been a substantial decline in renewable energy investments , and may have resulted in additional investments in renewable energy generation capacity . one policy option that proponents note might attract capital to the renewable energy sector would be to allow renewable energy developers to structure as a master limited partnership ( mlp ) .  , should congress decide to expand the definition of qualifying income to include renewable energy , or make other changes to current tax laws that would allow renewable energy entities to structure as mlps , congress may decide to stipulate which clean or renewable energy activities would qualify . the mlp structure could be extended to renewable energy technologies already eligible for other renewable energy tax incentives , or expanded to include other technologies that might support expanded use of renewable energy , such as advanced energy storage and transmission technologies . additional access to capital has the potential to stimulate investment and growth in the renewable energy sector . mlps could also allow investors to benefit from other renewable energy tax incentives , and thereby avoid tax - equity markets for monetization of renewable energy tax benefits , if changes to existing passive loss restrictions were enacted . specifically , expanding the definition of mlps to include other types of activity could be viewed as a narrowing of the corporate tax base . further , if changes in current law regarding qualifying income under the mlp structure are coupled with changes in passive activity loss rules , there are concerns that such changes could lead to tax shelter opportunities . in the energy sector alone , the number of energy mlps increased from 6 in 1994 to 72 in 2010 . nearly 90% of market capital in mlps is attributable to energy and natural resources , with more than 70% of total market capitalization attributable to midstream oil and gas operations ( see figure a - 2 ) .
