the department of defense ( dod ) reports that more than 83,000 persons remain missing from past conflicts in vietnam , korea , the cold war , the persian gulf , and world war ii . between fiscal years 2002 and 2012 , dod accounted for an average of 72 missing persons each year . this act required the secretary of defense to provide such funds , personnel , and resources as the secretary considers appropriate to increase significantly the capability and capacity of dod , the armed forces , and commanders of the combatant commands to account for missing persons , so that the accounting community has sufficient resources to ensure that at least 200 missing persons are the act also accounted for annually , beginning in fiscal year 2015.added all world war ii losses to the conflicts for which dod would be responsible to account for missing persons . jpac reports to the u.s. pacific command ( pacom ) . while dod has made some progress in promoting collaboration and communication among members of the missing persons accounting community , its capability and capacity to accomplish its missing persons accounting mission is being undermined by longstanding top - level leadership weaknesses and a fragmented organizational structure . leadership from both the under secretary of defense for policy ( usd policy ) and pacom have not been able to resolve disagreements between key members of the accounting community . specifically , we identified issues related to planning , roles and responsibilities , conducting operations outside of pacom's area of responsibility , having criteria to prioritize cases , communication , and other areas discussed below . moreover , the fragmented organizational structure — with each member of the accounting community reporting to a different line of authority — has exacerbated these problems , such that a majority of accounting community members believe that alternative structures would be more effective . while dod has made some progress in drafting a community - wide plan to increase its capability and capacity , as of june 2013 dod had not completed a community - wide plan . law no . moreover , the lack of clarity in the guidance has given rise to overlapping and fragmented efforts among accounting community members . however , this resolution has not yet been documented . the updated agreement , signed in april 2013 , specifies european command's and jpac's responsibilities and procedures for conducting investigations and recoveries in european command's area of responsibility . as a result , no single entity can implement or enforce decisions without obtaining widespread consensus . we found that 12 of the 13 survey respondents who answered the question ranked an option with a more centralized chain of command as the most effective in enabling the accounting community to achieve its mission . until the secretary of defense ensures that activities associated with the accounting mission are efficiently and effectively carried out with unity of command and effort , the inefficient and potentially avoidable overlap and disagreements among the community members may continue , and recovery operations could be hindered by unexpected operational concerns and a lack of standard procedures . dod's comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix v. in agreeing with our first eight recommendations , dod stated that it: needs to examine options to unify the personnel accounting community's fragmented organizational structure ; will clarify the roles and responsibilities of members of the accounting will negotiate a new memorandum of agreement between jpac and the life sciences equipment laboratory ; will finalize its community - wide plan to develop increased capability and capacity to account for missing persons ; will establish criteria that can be used to prioritize efforts to recover will establish a mechanism for community - wide communications ; needs to formalize communication procedures for the organizations identified by the gao ; and will develop personnel files for all unaccounted - for persons . the questionnaire was also reviewed by an independent gao survey specialist .
