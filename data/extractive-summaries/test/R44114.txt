the u.s. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly - pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) . as of june 17 , 2015 , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) reported 223 cases of hpai in domestic flocks in 15 states . more than 48 million chickens , turkeys , and other poultry have been euthanized to stem the spread of the disease . cases have been caused by several highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza ( ai ) strains that result in substantial mortality in domestic poultry . turkey and egg - laying hen farms in minnesota and iowa have been hardest hit . commercial broiler farms have not been affected to date . according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , no infections in humans have been associated with the current hpai outbreak , and cdc considers the public health risk to be low . with the start of summer , the rate of new cases slowed . the last reported new case was in iowa on june 17 , 2015 . in order to achieve this , the animal health protection act ( ahpa ; 7 u.s.c . ยง8301 et seq. ) . authorizes usda to take extraordinary measures , such as seizing , restricting movement , or euthanizing animals to protect the health of animals . aphis , in cooperation with state and local animal health officials , euthanize poultry , disinfect and clean poultry premises and equipment , and then test for the virus to ensure poultry farms can be safely repopulated . poultry owners are indemnified for euthanized poultry , and aphis pays for cleaning and disinfecting , and testing . in the event of an animal health emergency , usda has the authority to request additional funds from the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) as necessary , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) may make an apportionment to provide money to contain and eliminate an animal disease . as of july 7 , 2015 , aphis has committed over $500 million to help producers control the spread of hpai , including $190 million for indemnity payments . the cost of the hpai outbreak to the poultry industry is high . the direct losses from euthanized turkeys and egg - laying hens are estimated at nearly $1.6 billion , $530 million for turkeys and $1.04 billion for laying hens . the economy - wide impact to date is estimated at $3.3 billion . since the hpai findings in december 2014 , 18 trading partners have imposed bans on all shipments for u.s. poultry and products , and 38 trading partners have imposed partial , or regional , bans on shipments from states or parts of states experiencing cases ( see figure 4 ) . china , russia , and south korea , 3 of the top 10 destinations for u.s. poultry meat in 2014 , have banned all imports of u.s. poultry . the hearings covered the experiences and lessons learned from containing and eliminating the current outbreak , and touched on issues to be addressed for the future . it is believed that an hpai outbreak is likely to occur again in the fall when wild birds begin their migrations through the four flyways . this may likely result in more spread of ai , possibly in the poultry - producing eastern and southeastern regions untouched during the current outbreak . usda has not approved a vaccine for hpai .
