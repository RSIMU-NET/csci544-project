some applicants use fraudulently obtained visas to facilitate illegal activities in the united states , including crimes of violence , narcotics , human trafficking , and terrorism . this report examines ( 1 ) countries and visa categories subject to the most visa fraud ; ( 2 ) state's technologies and resources to combat fraud ; and ( 3 ) training requirements of state officials responsible for fraud prevention . to determine the countries and visa categories subject to the most visa fraud , we analyzed state fraud digest reports from 1996 through 2012 , reviewed fraud summaries for posts with high rates of fraud , reviewed compilations of diplomatic security monthly status reports , analyzed data on the number of visa applications referred to fraud prevention units , and interviewed state officials at headquarters and abroad to discuss fraud trends . to assess state's use of technologies and resources to combat fraud , we met with state's bureau of consular affairs office of consular systems and technology to review state's major data systems as well as the latest technological tools available to consular officers and fraud prevention managers , and we visited the kentucky consular center ( kcc ) to observe prescreening and anti - fraud activities . certain countries , such as brazil , china , the dominican republic , india , and mexico , had high numbers of suspected fraud cases in fiscal year 2010 , and certain visa categories , such as work visas , student visas , and diversity visas , had high levels of fraud . according to state officials , some visitor visa applicants provide fraudulent statements or documents , such as a false bank statement , to demonstrate strong ties with their home country and therefore overcome the presumption that they intend to use their temporary visitor visa to illegally immigrate to the united states . however , state does not have a policy to systematically utilize its domestic anti - fraud resources to offset fraud workload overseas . for example , state may find higher rates of fraud among visa applicants who rely on services provided by a particular local visa company . currently , kcc provides prescreening services for selected posts overseas . any post may request kcc assistance in conducting research and analysis on visa applications , either on an ad - hoc basis for individual cases , or on a pilot basis for larger - scale projects . anti - fraud staffing levels in fraud prevention units vary widely across overseas posts , causing disproportionate workloads . personnel from state's office of fraud prevention programs said resource decisions for fraud prevention units are driven by visa workload and other factors at posts , not by the number of fraud cases.statistics on the number of fraud cases confirmed , unconfirmed , or inconclusive are used by posts to direct anti - fraud strategies , consular affairs does not use these statistics to determine the appropriate distribution of personnel to fraud prevention units . for example , a fraud prevention manager in a high - fraud post that we visited told us that the post would like additional kcc prescreening of certain visa categories , but was unaware of how to request kcc assistance . although state offers anti - fraud courses in a classroom setting and online , state does not require fraud prevention managers to take them . detecting fraudulent documents ( pc544 ) : this course teaches consular officers how to determine whether a document has been altered or is counterfeit . in 2011 , a little more than half of the students enrolled in pc541 were entry - level officers , and state could not determine whether fraud prevention managers were among them . additionally , between october 2009 and july 2012 , entry - level officers made up approximately 22 percent ( 489 of 2,252 ) of the total number of students who registered for detecting imposters ( pc128 ) and 21 percent ( 486 of 2,246 ) of the total number of students who registered for detecting fraudulent documents ( pc544 ) . entry - level officers are required to take only limited fraud prevention training that does not include new anti - fraud technologies . to further improve the visa fraud prevention process , we recommend that the secretary of state take the following two actions: ( 1 ) formulate a policy to systematically utilize anti - fraud resources available at the kentucky consular center , based on post workload and fraud trends , as determined by the department ; and ( 2 ) establish standardized training requirements for fraud prevention managers , to include training in advanced anti - fraud technologies , taking advantage of distance learning technologies , and establishing methods to track the extent to which requirements are met .
