u ruguay is a small nation of 3.4 million people located on the atlantic coast of south america . the country emerged as an independent state in 1828 following a three - year war between brazil and argentina over control of the disputed territory . uruguay has drawn increased congressional attention in recent years as a result of the country's controversial decisions to legalize cannabis and grant refugee status to six men who had been detained at the u.s . naval station at guantanamo bay , cuba . president tabaré vázquez of the center - left broad front ( frente amplio ) coalition was inaugurated to a five - year term on march 1 , 2015 . this is his second term in office — he previously served as president from 2005 to 2010 — and the third consecutive term in which the broad front holds the presidency and majorities in both houses of the uruguayan general assembly . vázquez's initial election ended 170 years of political domination by the center - right national and colorado parties . since taking power in 2005 , the broad front has maintained market - oriented economic policies while gradually expanding social welfare programs , establishing a more progressive tax system , and implementing union - empowering labor reforms . this policy mix , combined with a boom in international prices for uruguay's agricultural commodity exports , produced several years of strong economic growth and considerable improvements in living standards . the broad front also has enacted several far - reaching social policy reforms , some of which have been controversial domestically . the coalition has positioned uruguay on the leading edge of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) rights in latin america by allowing lgbt individuals to serve openly in the military , legalizing adoption by same - sex couples , allowing individuals to change official documents to reflect their gender identities , and legalizing same - sex marriage . additionally , the broad front has legalized abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy and has enacted legislation that legalizes and regulates every aspect of the cannabis market , from production to consumption ( see " security concerns and marijuana legalization ," below ) . u.s. - uruguayan relations are strong and have grown closer in recent years . some analysts predicted that bilateral relations would deteriorate following the broad front's assumption of power , given ideological opposition to working with the united states by some sectors of the coalition . over the past decade , the united states and uruguay have forged closer trade and investment ties and have worked together to promote stability and security in latin america and around the world . the difficult economic situation likely will limit president vázquez's ability to enact far - reaching policy changes and could lead to increased disenchantment among his coalition's base . short - term commercial cooperation may focus on the removal of trade barriers under the tifa ; the conclusion of a bilateral social security agreement to eliminate double taxation and fill gaps in benefit protection for individuals who have worked in both countries ; and uruguay's entry into the visa waiver program , which would allow temporary , visa - free travel by uruguayan and u.s. citizens . cooperation on international affairs likely will continue as the countries support international peacekeeping efforts and collaborate on the u.n. security council and in other multilateral institutions . at the same time , uruguay is likely to continue pursuing closer commercial and diplomatic ties with a range of other partners , including fellow members of mercosur , the european union , and china .
