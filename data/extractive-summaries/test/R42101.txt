delegations from more than 190 countries and regions meet from november 28 to december 9 , 2011 , in durban , south africa , to continue discussions of how to address climate change under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) . the year 2012 will mark both the 20 th anniversary of the opening for signature of the unfccc ( in rio de janeiro , 1992 ) and the end of the first "commitment period" ( 2008-2012 ) of the unfccc's subsidiary kyoto protocol . for many low - income nations and environmental groups , the key ambitions for the durban meeting are to find agreement on 1. a second commitment period under the kyoto protocol with stronger ghg reduction commitments from the annex i parties ; 2. the legal form of any new agreements , including proposals for legally binding commitments to ghg reductions to take effect by 2020 ; 3. design of the new green climate fund , and materialization of funds during the "fast - start" period of 2010-2012 , provisions for the unreferenced period of 2013-2020 , and the pledged mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020 ; 4. design of the new technology mechanism ; and 5. evolution of the adaptation committee . in this context of strongly held differences within the united states , and between the united states and most other countries , the durban conference will tackle questions of the future of the kyoto protocol and the possibility of a mandate for future quantitative , binding ghg obligations for all parties . on the one hand , the united states has been cool to such a mandate: it seeks assurance that all major emitters , including china and other non - annex i parties , would be bound by commitments in any future agreement . in cancun , parties agreed to establish a green climate fund ( gcf ) , through which a portion of financing will flow to support low - income countries' actions on mitigation and adaptation . the cop will also need to decide on the role and composition of a new standing committee on financial matters , agreed in cancun , that would assist the cop in coordinating and streamlining the various funds established under the unfccc and kyoto protocol , and in ensuring transparent reporting and verification of financing provided by parties . the text of the cancun agreements states that the monies should come from "a wide variety of sources , public and private , bilateral and multilateral , including alternative sources of finance. . as global temperatures continue to increase , and as many parties perceive that pledges to mitigate ghg emissions are likely insufficient to abridge climate change , more attention and urgency is being given to addressing adaptation under the unfccc .
