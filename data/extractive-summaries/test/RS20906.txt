the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventi ons and administers the registration of trademarks . it also assists other federal departments and agencies to protect american intellectual property in the international marketplace . the uspto is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as "offsetting collections" and subject to spending limits established by the committee on appropriations . p.l . however , to address the issue of fees withheld from the office in the past , the america invents act creates within the treasury a "patent and trademark fee reserve fund" into which fee collections above that "appropriated by the office for that fiscal year" will be placed . these funds will be available to the uspto "to the extent and in the amounts provided in appropriations acts" and may only be used for the work of the uspto . proponents of the withholding approach to funding the uspto claimed that despite the ability of the appropriators to impose limits on spending current year fee collections , the office was provided with sufficient financial support to operate . critics argued that , over time , a significant portion of the fees collected were not returned to the uspto due to the ceilings established by the appropriations process and the inability of the office to use the fees on a dollar - for - dollar basis . under the america invents act , the budget authority to use fees collected by the uspto remains within the congressional appropriations process . however , the office must still obtain congressional authority to use these "excess" funds .
