however , each of these disposal methods has associated challenges . specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether marad will meet the statutory deadline of september 2006 to dispose of its obsolete ships and , if not , what factors may prevent it from doing so ; and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which marad has used alternative methods , other than ship scrapping , to dispose of its obsolete ships and the barriers to using such alternatives . marad is unlikely to meet the statutory deadline of september 30 , 2006 , to dispose of its inventory of obsolete ships . the ship disposal program's slow progress stems primarily from program leaders not establishing a comprehensive management approach that better focuses the program's efforts on meeting the myriad of challenges that the program faces in eliminating its inventory in a timely and efficient manner . of the remaining 139 ships , as of september 2004 , marad had awarded contracts for the disposal of another 29 , leaving 110 ships that were still awaiting disposal actions . while marad has stated this general goal , it has not developed specific performance measures with targets to track its progress toward achieving this goal . these challenges include domestic disposal capacity limitations ; environmental , legal , and regulatory restrictions on export ; and similar restrictions on other disposal options . in addition , marad has not been able to provide congress and other stakeholders with a reasonable timetable and the associated annual funding requirements needed to meet the 2006 deadline , nor has it clearly articulated the areas that congressional assistance may be needed to expedite the disposal of these deteriorating ships that continue to pose potentially costly environmental threats to the waterways near the sites where these ships are stored . although congress directed marad in fiscal year 2001 to consider alternative methods in designing its ship scrapping program , the program has made only limited use of these methods — artificial reefing , deep - sea sinking , and donations — because of a number of environmental , financial , and legislative barriers . despite these positive steps , marad may still be years away from increasing the number of disposals using these alternative methods . since fiscal year 2002 , marad has inappropriately used a procurement method — prda — to acquire most of its ship disposal services rather than other procurement methods that are appropriate for acquiring such services . in addition to being inconsistent with cica and the far , marad's use of prdas to acquire ship scrapping services has led to a lack of transparency and raised questions about the fairness of marad's contract award process . since fiscal year 2002 , marad has used prdas as its primary procurement method . with respect to funding , the prdas did not ask firms to explain their costs to research or develop new methods or approaches for ship disposal ; instead , the prdas specified that funding “must be proposed in sufficient detail to show all anticipated costs associated with the complete dismantlement of the vessel ( s ) , including cost categories such as towing , remediation of hazardous materials , labor costs , etc. , as appropriate.” thus , rather than soliciting proposals to perform research or to develop new methods or technologies to scrap ships , marad's prdas essentially contemplate the award of production contracts to firms with ship disposal experience . consequently , firms are often unable to determine why their proposal was not selected over another proposal . while we could not isolate the specific impact of foreign competition and other factors on reducing the cost of ship disposal , marad attributes the overall decrease in ship disposal costs almost exclusively to overseas competition . however , other factors , such as larger annual program funding allowing for more ships per contract and increases in the scrap value of steel , may have also played a role . develop a comprehensive approach to manage marad's ship disposal identify a strategy and an implementation plan to dispose of all existing obsolete ships and future transfers in a timely manner , maximizing the use of all available disposal methods ; determine the needed resources , the associated funding plan , and specific milestones for this disposal ; establish a framework for decision making that would delineate roles and responsibilities and establish guidance and procedures ; identify external factors that could impede program success and develop plans to mitigate them ; and annually evaluate results and implement corrective actions . we also compared marad's acquisition methods for ship disposal services with those used by the navy .
