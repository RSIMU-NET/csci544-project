human health and well - being require clean and safe water , and the lack of access to such water is a significant threat to human health , according to a 2014 study by the water research foundation . moreover , the u.s . this report examines ( 1 ) the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of these impacts on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure ; ( 2 ) technical assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional technical assistance to utilities ; and ( 3 ) financial assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional financial assistance to utilities . we also interviewed federal officials at each agency . for example , one expert said that epa and other relevant federal agencies could provide guidance and leadership for a network of ( 1 ) university and federal climate services providers that would assess the risks that potential climate impacts pose to utilities and ( 2 ) utility technical assistance providers , including consultants and industry groups , to help utilities apply those assessments to their infrastructure to make it more resilient . by identifying and engaging existing technical assistance providers in a network to help drinking water and wastewater utilities incorporate climate resilience into their projects and planning on an ongoing basis , epa would have more reasonable assurance that climate information was effectively exchanged among federal agencies and infrastructure owners and operators . the agencies have taken some actions to promote climate resilience when providing financial assistance for water infrastructure projects , but they do not consistently include the consideration of climate resilience when funding such projects . most selected experts we interviewed suggested that requiring the consideration of climate change risks in the planning and design of all federally funded water and wastewater infrastructure projects could help enhance climate resilience and limit future federal fiscal exposure . fema . officials also said that hud provides guidance on how financial assistance requirements for states and entitlement communities can be waived so that states and communities can use community development block grant funding for disaster recovery and resilience in presidentially - declared disaster areas . as a result , according to officials , utilities do not consider climate resilience consistently when planning and designing projects that receive financial assistance from usda . in our previous work , we said that building resilience can help reduce the federal fiscal exposure . by identifying existing technical assistance providers and engaging them in a network to help drinking water and wastewater utilities consider climate resilience in the planning and design of projects on an ongoing basis , epa , as chair of the water sector government coordinating council , would have more reasonable assurance that climate information was effectively exchanged among federal agencies and infrastructure owners and operators . to enable agencies to further drive climate resilient investments by drinking water and wastewater utilities , changes would be needed to programs that epa , fema , hud , and usda administer to require that climate resilience be incorporated into planning for projects that receive federal financial assistance .  ( recommendation 1 ) . the objectives of our review were to examine ( 1 ) the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of these impacts on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure ; ( 2 ) technical assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional technical assistance to utilities ; and ( 3 ) financial assistance federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional financial assistance to utilities . specifically: environmental protection agency's ( epa ) environmental finance centers . epa's training and technical assistance for small systems grants .
