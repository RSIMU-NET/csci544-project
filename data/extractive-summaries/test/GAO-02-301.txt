tva relied on its 11 coal - burning plants to supply about 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001 . these plants account for almost all of tva's emissions of two key air pollutants — sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , which has been linked to reduced visibility , and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone . to meet this demand , tva estimates that it will need to expand its current generating capacity of 30,365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually — nearly the equivalent of building an average - size power plant , or contracting for the power from one , every year . building new generating capacity can result in additional emissions , which raises environmental concerns . in part to lessen the need for new capacity , tva and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through “demand - side management” programs , which are designed to reduce the amount of energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed . concerned about tva's dual challenge of reducing emissions while managing increased demand on its power system , you asked us to: ( 1 ) determine how tva plans to meet future demands for electricity through 2005 while minimizing its emissions of so2 and nox ; ( 2 ) describe the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts ; and ( 3 ) compare the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts to those of selected other utilities' efforts . tva estimates that demand for its electricity will increase about 1.7 percent annually through 2010 . according to a tva official , the expected increase after 2003 is directly related to planned increases in generating capacity at its coal plants . such programs involve all major types of customers — commercial , industrial , and residential . as a result , peak - time consumption was presumably higher than it would have been if tva had not taken these actions . tva projects that its demand - side management programs will save nearly twice as much in the fiscal year 2001 through 2005 period as they did in the previous 5-fiscal year period . while tva plans to substantially reduce its so2 and nox emissions by three means — installing control devices , using lower - sulfur coal , and relying largely on noncoal sources for additional capacity — it could reduce emissions even more by more aggressively pursuing an existing fourth option — demand - side management .
