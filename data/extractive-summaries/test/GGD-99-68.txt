in response , the committee asked us to examine several events related to personnel reassignments , appointments , and activities at sba . federal regulations govern the salary - setting process for new appointees . in 169 ( 55 percent ) of the 310 appointments that we reviewed , sba set the appointees' starting salaries at the minimum step of the pay grades for the positions they accepted . sba said that it is revising its procedures to ensure program managers know extensions and terminations of interagency details are to be documented on a notification of personnel action ( sf - 50 ) and that the new procedure will ensure that sba's personnel / payroll system provides automated “ticklers” to help eliminate the possibility of any funds from reimbursable details not being collected . for example , like political appointees , regional advocates can be hired noncompetitively . although the assistant administrator did not address our two recommendations directly , she noted actions that sba had taken or was taking that were associated with those recommendations . however , we also report a number of cases in which sba could not provide documentation allowing a determination as to whether sba followed appropriate procedures when setting advanced salaries at the time the employees were hired . consequently , sba had not developed a recruitment bonus plan , as required by regulations . our second objective was to determine whether sba followed applicable policies and procedures when appointing - - and setting the starting salaries of - - individuals hired during the period january 1 , 1993 , through december 31 , 1998 , from outside of sba for the position of district director , and the procedures sba's office of advocacy used in hiring regional advocates and assistant advocates during calendar year 1998 . application materials from other applicants for this position were available for our review . 6 . personnel practices: career appointments of former political and congressional employees ( gao / ggd - 97-165 , sept. 2 , 1997 ) .
