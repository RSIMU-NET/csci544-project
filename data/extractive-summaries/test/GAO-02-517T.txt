ops oversees the safety of 2.2 million miles of pipelines that transport potentially dangerous materials , such as oil and natural gas . as a result , ops has the lowest implementation rate of any transportation agency for recommendations from the national transportation safety board ( the safety board ) . in recent years , ops has initiated several actions to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry , including requiring “integrity management” programs for individual operators to assess their pipelines for risks , take action to mitigate the risks , and develop program performance measures . we are here today to discuss ( 1 ) ops' progress in implementing integrity management and other initiatives , ( 2 ) ops' progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , and ( 3 ) issues that are critical to the future success of ops' initiatives to improve the safety and oversight of the pipeline industry . these initiatives include: revising forms and procedures to collect more complete and accurate data , which will enable ops to better assess the causes of incidents and focus on the greatest risks to pipelines . allowing more states to oversee a broader range of interstate pipeline safety activities . however , some recommendations and requirements dealing with issues that are critical for pipeline safety — such as requiring pipeline operators to periodically inspect their pipelines — are more than a decade old and ops still has not implemented them . these challenges include ( 1 ) developing performance measures for the integrity management approach , ( 2 ) ensuring sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators' integrity management programs , ( 3 ) providing consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and ( 4 ) issuing requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines .
