the national park service ( park service ) , within the department of the interior , manages more than 75,000 assets — including buildings , roads , and water systems — at 413 park units that cover 84 million acres across all 50 states , the district of columbia , and some territories . the park service defines deferred maintenance as maintenance that was not performed when it should have been or was scheduled to be and is delayed for a future period . maintenance allocation data from fiscal year 2015 are the most current data available . this sample is not generalizable to all park units . in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , the park service allocated $1.16 billion on average to operate and maintain the agency's assets . trails , which includes hiking trails . on average , deferred maintenance for paved roads made up about 44 percent of the park service's total deferred maintenance from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2015 in both nominal and inflation - adjusted dollars , and it generally grew — from about $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2009 to about $6.0 billion in fiscal year 2015 ( or , from $3.8 billion to $6.0 billion in fiscal year 2015 dollars ) . specifically , about $10.5 billion in deferred maintenance was for park units established more than 40 years ago . once projects are identified , park unit staff use the park service's capital investment strategy to rank maintenance projects for funding decisions . to assign maintenance priority to an asset , the park service uses two tools to rate an asset's importance and condition — the asset priority index ( api ) and facility condition index ( fci ) — both of which are consistent with asset management guidance from the office of management and budget and the national academies federal facilities council . park unit staff also enter projects into the agency's project management information system . fiscal year 2015 was the first budget year in which projects ranked using the strategy were funded , and as such some regional and park unit officials said that it is too soon to determine if the capital investment strategy is meeting its objectives , such as maintaining the condition of its high - priority assets . the park service does not have a plan or time frame for evaluating whether the strategy has been successful . a senior official said that the agency had not determined what is needed to begin such an evaluation and that it would be beneficial to verify that the capital investment strategy is achieving intended outcomes and if changes need to be made . working with volunteers . to ensure that the elements of the agency's process for making asset maintenance decisions are achieving desired outcomes , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of the park service to evaluate the capital investment strategy and its results to determine if it is achieving its intended outcomes or if changes need to be made . our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) how much the national park service ( park service ) has allocated to maintain assets in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , ( 2 ) the amount and composition of the park service's deferred maintenance in fiscal years 2009 through 2015 , ( 3 ) how the park service makes asset maintenance decisions , and ( 4 ) the actions the park service is taking to help address its maintenance needs . specifically , for each of the seven regions , we selected three parks: ( 1 ) the park with the greatest amount of deferred maintenance as of the end of fiscal year 2015 , ( 2 ) a park that had a deferred maintenance amount in the lower half of all park units in that region , and ( 3 ) a park unit recommended by regional officials as taking additional or notable actions to help address deferred maintenance .
