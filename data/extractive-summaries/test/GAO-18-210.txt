medicare beneficiary data are created , stored , and used by a wide variety of entities , such as health care providers , insurance companies , financial institutions , academic researchers , and other federal / state agencies for a wide variety of purposes . cms shares medicare beneficiary data with three major types of external entities: ( 1 ) medicare administrative contractors ( macs ) , the contractors that provide the core processing and distribution functions that support the payment of medicare part a , part b , and durable medical equipment ( dme ) beneficiary claims on behalf of cms , ( 2 ) research organizations ( researchers ) , academic and non - profit entities that use medicare beneficiary data to assist cms in monitoring , managing , and improving medicare programs or the services provided to beneficiaries , and ( 3 ) qualified public or private entities that use claims data on behalf of cms to evaluate the performance of medicare service providers and equipment suppliers . like researchers , after they have been approved to access data by cms , qualified entities must enter into a data use agreement with cms . cms has developed requirements for implementing security controls that align with federal guidance for two of the three types of external entities that access medicare fee - for - service data . without providing comprehensive , risk - based requirements for implementing security controls to all external entities that have access to medicare beneficiary data , cms increases the risk that external entities possessing cms data may not have applied security controls that meet cms standards . while cms requires macs and qualified entities to implement security controls consistent with nist guidance and provides additional guidance to ensure that those controls are consistent with cms standards , it does not provide supplemental guidance tailored for researchers . additionally , these officials stated that they believe the lack of specific guidance gives the researchers more flexibility to independently assess their security risks and determine which controls to implement based on that assessment . however , by not providing guidance to researchers that includes security implementation requirements tailored to cms - authorized uses of medicare data , cms cannot ensure that researchers implement security measures that are commensurate with the sensitivity of the data that is provided to them . macs are subject to two types of independent annual assessments that regularly identify weaknesses in their implementation of security controls . additionally , cms has not established a corresponding program for overseeing the implementation of security controls by researchers and qualified entities . table 3 describes these key categories of weaknesses . without more consistent tracking of identified issues through plans of action and milestones , it may be difficult for cms to fully determine the extent to which security weaknesses identified during assessments of the macs are remediated . however , cms has not required the documentation of low - risk weaknesses in the cms fisma controls tracking system so that cms can track the macs' remediation of weaknesses that have been identified in recurring annual assessments . further , cms has not established an oversight program for qualified entities and researchers to assess whether they are implementing security controls as they are required .  ( recommendation 3 ) . our objectives were to ( 1 ) identify the major entities that collect , store , and process medicare beneficiary data and that connect with centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) systems and networks ; ( 2 ) determine whether requirements for the protection of medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance ; and ( 3 ) assess the programs cms has in place to oversee the implementation of security protections for medicare beneficiary data .
