this report discusses the extent to which: ( 1 ) sba enforces its regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source 8 ( a ) contracts to subsidiaries of the same anc ; ( 2 ) sba limits subsidiaries of the same anc from operating in the same primary line of business ; ( 3 ) information is known about compensation , revenues , and benefits distribution of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) sba has addressed challenges , if any , to its oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 ( a ) program since 2011 . the findings from these site visits and interviews are not generalizable to the other sba district offices . to assess whether contract awards are in line with this prohibition , sba regulations require contracting agencies to provide an offer letter with details on 17 items related to the contract , such as type of contract , acquisition history ( if any ) , contract value , and the names of any small business contractors who have performed the requirement in the previous 24 months . alaska district office officials — those officials responsible for reviewing sole - source offer letters for 50 percent of the active anc - owned firms in the program — agreed that it would be helpful if sba required agencies to specifically list whether a contract is a follow - on , sole - source contract in their offer letter ; as well as ensure that information about the incumbent firm , or the small business that previously performed the contract , that was awarded the previous contract , if there was one , is listed in their offer letter . however , this positive change has not been adopted more broadly across the agency . however , sba's current systems still do not collect and track firms' underlying revenue activity as we recommended in 2006 and 2012 , including revenues generated from secondary lines of business that would help sba identify firms that are potentially circumventing the intent of its prohibition . contributing to sba's challenges in tracking naics revenues are limitations placed on sba district office staff's ability to access and share important subsidiaries' naics codes across district offices . sba officials told us that this access limitation can also occur within a district office when different business opportunity specialists are responsible for servicing different subsidiaries that are owned by the same parent anc . our review also identified other differences that were reported about compensation to sba from year to year for the same firms . however , in its 2014 annual review , this same firm reported that its parent corporation compensated its general manager nearly $240,000 . this official and other senior officials from business development told us that the continuing eligibility review unit will be designed to ensure better compliance with 8 ( a ) rules by taking a more detailed look at the financial documents provided by anc - owned firms and verifying the self - reported information supplied , among other things . to establish an effective compliance oversight process for anc - owned firms in the sba 8 ( a ) program as part of sba's efforts to develop a more comprehensive oversight strategy , we recommend that the administrator of sba direct district office staff implementing the program to take the following three actions: improve sba's ability to prohibit follow - on , sole - source contracts from being awarded to anc - owned sister subsidiaries participating in the program by ( 1 ) requesting that procuring agencies specifically state whether a contract is a follow - on in its offer letter , ( 2 ) providing additional training to sba staff that specifically address how to monitor for follow - on , sole source contracts , and ( 3 ) providing additional guidance to sba officials on the enforcement of related policies ; enhance internal controls and oversight of anc - owned firms in the 8 ( a ) program serviced in the alaska district office by enforcing policies regarding the separation of duties and supervisor or administrator approval in order to improve supervisory review of anc - owned firm transactions and related documentation ; and develop a comprehensive approach to staffing its alaska district office to include succession planning and managing attrition and retirements in order to improve the agency's capacity to keep pace with oversight activities . further , as we describe in our report , these staff did not consistently follow - up with agencies when they could not make an informed determination . sba's plans to share the spreadsheet used to track firm's obligations among all business opportunity specialists will address our fifth recommendation , once this information includes data about the firm's primary and secondary revenue streams . the objectives of this review were to examine the extent to which: ( 1 ) sba enforces its regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source 8 ( a ) contracts to subsidiaries of the same anc ; ( 2 ) sba limits subsidiaries of the same anc from operating in the same primary line of business ; ( 3 ) information is known about compensation , revenues , and benefits distribution of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) sba has addressed challenges , if any , to its oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firm participating in the 8 ( a ) program since 2011 .
