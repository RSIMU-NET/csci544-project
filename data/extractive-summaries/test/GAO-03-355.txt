since 1990 , we have identified the department's management of secondary inventory as a high - risk area because levels of inventory were too high and management systems and procedures were ineffective . nevertheless , the department has attributed readiness problems to parts shortages . in response to your request , this report ( 1 ) provides information on changes in and make up of the department's inventory and ( 2 ) analyzes changes in inventory requirements , with a focus on causes of requirements changes derived from a sample of navy inventory items . furthermore , an item's reorder point can move up or down over time and — depending on the item — may include one or more of the following: war reserves , unfilled requisitions , a safety level to be on hand in case of minor interruptions in the resupply process or unpredictable fluctuations in demand , minimum quantities for essential items for which demand is not normally predicted ( also referred to as insurance items ) , inventory to satisfy demands while broken items are being repaired , inventory to satisfy demands during the period between when the need to replenish an item through a purchase is identified and when a contract is let ( also referred to as administrative lead time ) , and inventory to satisfy demands during the period between when a contract for inventory is let and when the inventory is received ( also referred to as production lead time ) . these inventory increases were primarily due to the navy reporting aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons that were previously not reported and to overall dod inventory requirements increases . in addition , large imbalances in the inventory continue to exist . as of september 30 , 2001 , over 1.7 million items had $38 billion of inventory on hand or on order that exceeded the items' current inventory operating requirements of $24.9 billion . overall , the amount of dod's inventory that exceeds current operating requirements has decreased since 1996 . dod's overall inventory requirements increased by $10.6 billion , or 26 percent , between the end of fiscal years 1999 and 2001 , with some of the navy's requirements being overstated . a large part of the navy increase , $3.4 billion , was due to the navy reporting change we discussed in the previous section — that is , reporting aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons as inventory that were previously not reported . however , some navy increases were caused by inaccurate data used to compute administrative lead time requirements , and as a result , those requirements are overstated . the navy was responsible for the largest share of dod's overall inventory requirements increase , with $4.7 billion of the $10.6 billion inventory change . the remaining navy increase was due to such reasons as price increases and increased usage of items . generally , the change in accounting for these requirements resulted in a $3.4 billion increase in navy insurance item requirements , from $2.4 billion on september 30 , 1999 , to $5.8 billion on september 30 , 2001 . for example , revised data reduced the lead time from 200 days to 183 days for medium - sized sole - source contracts for repairable items . we recommended that the secretary of defense , in conjunction with the secretaries of the army , the navy , and the air force , and the director of the defense logistics agency review and improve the processes for identifying and canceling orders , focusing on areas such as the accuracy of inventory management records ; the level at which the services and the defense logistics agency identify excess inventory on order that is subject to cancellation review , including low - dollar excess inventory on order that is excluded from cancellation review ; the timeliness and frequency of reviews for identifying excess items on - order ; and the validity and use of the military components' termination models in making economic analyses .
