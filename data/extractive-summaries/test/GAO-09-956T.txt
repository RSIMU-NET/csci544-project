the act established the sbir program to stimulate technological innovation , use small businesses to meet federal r&d needs , foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r&d . in this context , you asked us to summarize the successes and challenges that our past work has identified about the sbir program , summarize the concerns we have previously identified on sba's efforts to establish an interagency database that includes information on sbir applicants and awards , and describe the process that agencies use to determine the eligibility of sbir applicants for the program . the sbir program successfully attracts many qualified companies , has had a high level of competition , consistently has had a high number of first - time participants , and attracts hundreds of new companies annually . sbir has helped serve agencies' missions and r&d needs , although we found that agencies differ in the emphasis they place on funding research to support their mission versus more generalized research . our reviews of the sbir program during that time have also identified a number of areas of weakness that , over time , have been either fully or partially addressed by the congress in reauthorizing the program or by the agencies themselves . the fast program was not reauthorized when it expired in 2005 . many of the solutions cited above to improve and strengthen the sbir program relied to some extent on the collection of data or the establishment of a government - use database , so that sba and participating agencies could share information and enhance their efforts to monitor and evaluate the program . however , in 2006 , we reported that sba was 5 years behind schedule in complying with the congressional mandate to develop a government database that could facilitate agencies' monitoring and evaluation of the program . to address the concerns that we identified with regard to the quality of the data that sba was collecting for the tech - net database , we recommended in our 2006 report that sba work with the participating agencies to strengthen the completeness , accuracy , and consistency of its data collection efforts . according to an sba official , the database is currently operational and agencies have entered data for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 over the internet . specifically , we reviewed dod's , nih's , and sba's processes to determine eligibility of applicants for the sbir program and found that they focused largely on three sbir criteria in their eligibility reviews â€” ownership , size in terms of the number of employees , and for - profit status of sbir applicants . for example , while both nih and dod noted the determination of ineligibility in the applicant's file , nih also centrally tracked ineligible firms and made this information available to all of its institutes and centers that make sbir awards . in conclusion , mr. chairman , while the sbir program is generally recognized as a successful program that has encouraged innovation and helped federal agencies achieve their r&d goals , it has continued to suffer from some long - standing evaluation and monitoring issues that are made more difficult because of a lack of accurate , reliable , and comprehensive information on sbir applicants and awards . although sba did not meet its statutorily mandated deadline of june 2001 , the database has been operational since october 2008 , and contains limited new information but may also contain inaccurate historical data .
