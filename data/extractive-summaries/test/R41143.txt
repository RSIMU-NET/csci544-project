preferential trade agreements ( ptas ) comprise a variety of unilateral , bilateral , or regional arrangements which favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences . this is because the effects of the agreements on the patterns of trade and investment can depend on the content of the pta as well as the size and magnitude of the barriers being reduced . with weakening momentum for multilateral trade liberalization , ptas , particularly ftas , have proliferated markedly in recent years . in the post - war period , the european union ( eu ) has been central to the proliferation of ptas . of the 199 ptas in force and notified to the wto by december 2008 , or to its predecessor organization , the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) , 35 involved the eu , making the eu's network of ptas the largest in the world . if the eu's new ftas follow this template , they are likely to be more similar to the ftas negotiated in recent years by the united states â€” ftas which are often referred to as state - of - the art or "gold standard" agreements . as outlined in its 2006 global europe strategy , the eu targeted a number of larger countries and regions for negotiations , including south korea , india , canada , and the association of south east asian nations ( asean ) . others had already started at a point in time ( mercsur ) or were subsequently added ( canada ) . coincidentally , the eu change in fta strategy has come at a time when the u.s. fta policy has moved toward a "holding pattern" or "pause. . in the meantime , calls from the u.s. business community sector have increased for a more activist u.s. fta policy , much out of fear of losing export sales and market share to eu competitors who may be gaining more favorable access to larger foreign markets as a result of new ptas . given the need for the u.s. economy to rely on an increase in exports for faster growth , these concerns have also resonated in congress and the obama administration . two studies , however , have undertaken such a comparison , albeit based on a different universe of ptas . in addition , eu and u.s. ptas are compared in terms of trade coverage and competition . these impacts are discussed below . it is not clear what direction europe's pta policy will head in the future . these would be the handful of remaining countries that fall outside the eu's network of ptas , namely the united states , china , japan , and australia . pta negotiations with these countries , it is argued , could yield significant economic benefits and provide the biggest impact ( for good or ill ) on the world trading system . bigger trade partners such as the united states and china , however , would likely demand openings in agriculture and services , sectors where there is widespread opposition to liberalization . from a different perspective , some european economists maintain that the competitiveness of eu firms has more to do with internal eu market conditions ( domestic trade policy ) than with opening export markets through pta negotiations . if public support in the eu is lacking for undertaking significant agricultural reforms and services liberalization to position itself to negotiate an fta with the largest economies , european policymakers could explore a number of alternative approaches to trade liberalization both with the united states and with other big economies such as china .
