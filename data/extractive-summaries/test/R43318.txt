until recently , the di trust fund was projected to be depleted in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 , at which time ongoing revenues to the di trust fund were projected to be sufficient to pay only about 80% of scheduled benefits . 1314 ; p.l . 114-74 ) extended the projected solvency of the di trust fund by authorizing a reallocation of the social security payroll tax rate between the di and the old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) trust funds to provide di with a larger share . next , the report examines the financial status of the di trust fund over the past 20 years and the causes of the di trust fund's financial imbalance . specifically , ssdi provides benefits to nonelderly insured workers who meet the statutory definition of disability and to their eligible dependents . the federal disability insurance trust fund finances the benefits of disabled workers and their dependents , and the federal old - age and survivors insurance trust fund pays for the benefits of retired workers and their dependents as well as survivors of deceased workers . each trust fund is a separate account in the u.s. treasury , and under current law , the two trust funds may not borrow from one another . over the past 20 years , the annual di income rate has remained relatively flat at about 1.81% of taxable payroll , which is roughly the combined share of the tax rate allocated to the di trust fund for that period plus a small amount of other income . the increase in the annual di cost rate stems largely from the growth in the number of beneficiaries on ssdi . between 1995 and 2014 , the total number of disabled workers and their dependents in receipt of ssdi increased 85% , from 5.9 million to 10.9 million . the trustees project that the share of the insured population in receipt of ssdi will stabilize in the future , because some of the principal drivers of past growth — namely , the aging of the insured population and the increase in female enrollment rates — have come to pass and are not likely to occur again . the social security act provides no guidance on the payment of benefits once a trust fund's asset reserves have been depleted and current tax revenues are insufficient to meet current cost . although individuals who meet social security's eligibility requirements are legally entitled to disability benefits , a provision in the antideficiency act prohibits a federal agency from spending in excess of available funds . because the social security act stipulates that ssdi benefit payments shall be made only from the di trust fund , without a change in the law , monthly cash payments to beneficiaries could be delayed or reduced if the di trust fund were depleted . 114-74 ) will increase income from payroll taxes to the di trust fund by $117 billion and reduce income from payroll taxes to the oasi trust fund by the same amount . if the reallocation provision in the bipartisan budget act of 2015 had been proposed as a standalone piece of legislation , it could have been vulnerable to a point of order under the new rule because it would have reduced the actuarial balance of the oasi trust fund by more than $42.1 billion . for information on reform proposals that would affect the solvency of the di trust fund ( or both trust funds ) , see the following resources: crs report r43054 , social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) reform: an overview of proposals to manage the growth in the ssdi rolls , by [author name scrubbed] ; cbo's 2012 report , policy options for the social security disability insurance program , at http: / / www.cbo.gov / publication / 43421 ; cbo's 2015 report , social security policy options , 2015 , at https: / / www.cbo.gov / publication / 51011 ; oact's summary of provisions that would change the social security program , at https: / / www.ssa.gov / oact / solvency / provisions / summary.pdf ; oact's collection of cost estimates for various proposals affecting the solvency of the trust funds at https: / / www.ssa.gov / oact / solvency / index.html ; and the government accountability office's ( gao ) 2015 report , social security's future: answers to key questions , at http: / / www.gao.gov / products / gao - 16-75sp . although h.r .
