mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee: we are pleased to be here today to discuss our observations on the office of management and budget's ( omb ) efforts to carry out its responsibilities to set policy and oversee the management of the executive branch . first , we will provide an outline of omb's wide - ranging management responsibilities and note that the question of whether to integrate or separate management and budget functions has been long debated . the cfo act mandated significant financial management reforms and established the deputy director for management ( ddm ) position within omb . in addition to serving as the government's key official for financial management , the ddm is to coordinate and supervise a wide range of general management functions of omb . omb is responsible for providing guidance and oversight for various other laws and executive orders as well . omb's perennial challenge is to carry out its central management leadership responsibilities in such a way that leverages opportunities of the budget process , while at the same time ensuring that management concerns receive appropriate attention in an environment driven by budget and policy decisions . prior omb reorganizations , reflecting these different points of view , have alternated between seeking to more directly integrate management into the budget review process and creating separate management offices . previous congressional and omb attempts to elevate the status of management by creating separate management units within omb sought to ensure that an adequate level of effort was focused on management issues . in recent years , omb has focused increased attention on management issues , but there is much more that needs to be done . we recommended that omb ensure that agencies incorporate appropriate goals and strategies in their annual performance plans and describe their relevance to achieving the priority management objectives described in the governmentwide performance plan . omb has a vital role in leading and overseeing agencies' efforts to instill a more performance - based approach to decisionmaking , management , and accountability . in addition , our work has provided numerous examples of mission fragmentation and program overlap within federal missions as shown in table 1. performance into budget functions — a well - known and long used budget classification structure that focuses on federal missions , or “areas of national need.” we found in reviewing the fiscal year 1999 plan that in several parts of the plan , descriptions of program performance were presented in a sequential , agency - by - agency format that missed opportunities to address well - known areas of fragmentation and overlap . mr. chairman , the record of omb's stewardship of management initiatives that we have highlighted today suggests that creating and sustaining attention to management improvement is a key to addressing the federal government's longstanding problems . in the past , management issues often remained subordinated to budget concerns and timeframes , and the leverage the budget could offer to advance management efforts was not directly used to address management issues . many management policies require budgetary resources for their effective implementation , whether it is financial management reform or information systems investment . continued improvement in omb's plans would provide congressional decisionmakers with better information to use in determining the extent to which omb is addressing its statutory management and budgetary responsibilities , as well as in assessing omb's contributions toward achieving desired results .
