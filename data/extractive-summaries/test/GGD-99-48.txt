in response to a request from the chairman , subcommittee on oversight , house committee on ways and means , this report ( 1 ) provides information on the number , results , and duration of correspondence audits as well as the characteristics of the audited returns and ( 2 ) examines the processes and requirements that irs has had for years to govern correspondence audits . during fiscal years 1992-97 , the correspondence audit program experienced distinct shifts . according to customer service officials , these 3 fiscal years represented irs' traditional practices for doing correspondence audits . as a result , the tax amounts recommended per audited return declined by as much as about half ( from $2,483 in 1993 to $1,298 in 1995 ) . for traditional correspondence audits closed in 1996 , we found that the time between the filing of the return and the start of the audit averaged 10 months , and the time between the start of the audit and the assessment of any additional taxes took , on average , over 11 more months . however , 44 percent of all income tax returns filed by individuals in 1996 reported taxable incomes of less than $15,000 . we did not ask irs to check these eic claims to determine whether any of these taxpayers received an eic to which they were not entitled or were denied a claim to which they were entitled . for the traditional correspondence audits closed in 1996 , an estimated 57 percent of taxpayers did not respond to irs' audit letters . in reviewing irs' correspondence audit processes and requirements , we found weaknesses that undermine its ability to ( 1 ) identify and audit all questionable tax issues on tax returns , ( 2 ) support its audit recommendations for additional taxes , ( 3 ) consistently accept justification for eic claims , ( 4 ) review adherence to audit requirements and quality standards , and ( 5 ) solicit taxpayers' responses about the tax issues being audited . nevertheless , each weakness can , individually or in combination , erode the integrity of irs' correspondence audit processes , which are designed to help ensure that taxpayers pay the correct tax . gao recommends that the irs commissioner improve controls to better ensure that irs' correspondence audit processes adhere to existing audit requirements and standards on classifying filed returns , and in particular , referring returns with complex schedules that may have potential tax changes to staff with sufficient knowledge to classify them ; documenting the support for audit findings and recommendations in the ensuring consistency in the treatment of audited eic claims by collecting and using the information required , including verification from third parties , to justify the claims ; and including all types of closed audits across the 10 service centers in the samples for measuring audit quality . gao also recommends that the irs commissioner require supervisors in the service centers to document their reviews of eliminate the discretion that service centers have to exclude audits that lack documentation on the audit steps and support for audit recommendations from the calculations irs does to measure adherence to the audit quality standard on workpaper documentation ; and determine the reasons , through statistically valid and cost - effective means , for taxpayers' not responding to irs' audit letters , so that irs can identify ways to encourage more taxpayers to respond .
