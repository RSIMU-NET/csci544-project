we reviewed ( 1 ) the department of transportation's ( dot ) efforts to track how states use istea funds for facilitating intermodal transportation and the nature and extent of istea funds used by states for intermodal freight projects , ( 2 ) how some local and regional areas that handle a large volume of freight have considered intermodal freight transportation issues as part of their planning process , and ( 3 ) what kind of impediments some areas face in improving intermodal freight transportation . in addition , we developed information on intermodal freight transportation trends . as of december 31 , 1995 , $68.4 million , or 36 percent , had been obligated by the states for these projects . our review of available information in the cmaq , stp , and “priority intermodal” funding categories found that federal intermodal freight project funding obligated in roughly the first 4 of istea's 6 fiscal years totaled $104 million . in addition to the planning done by mpos , public and private sector officials are also identifying and addressing intermodal freight movement issues that transcend state boundaries . such a planning time frame is necessary to conduct impact studies or obtain funding . based on our review of department of transportation ( dot ) data and interviews with public and private sector officials , we attempted to identify intermodal freight projects financed with the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) funds not specifically targeted for priority projects ( see table i.1 ) . section 1108 of istea authorized funds to various states for “priority intermodal projects,” commonly referred to as “demonstration” projects.for projects specifically related to improving intermodal freight transportation , istea authorized $191.8 million for 20 projects in 9 states .
