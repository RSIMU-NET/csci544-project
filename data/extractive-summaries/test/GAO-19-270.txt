the toxic substances control act of 1976 ( tsca ) provides epa with the authority to review chemicals already in commerce ( existing chemicals ) and chemicals yet to enter commerce ( new chemicals ) , obtain more information on the effects of chemicals on human health and the environment , and regulate those that epa determines pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment . to describe the extent to which the iris program has addressed identified challenges and made progress toward producing chemical assessments , we interviewed iris officials , including leadership and staff , and leadership in epa's national center for environmental assessment , which manages the iris program . to describe the extent to which epa has demonstrated progress , if at all , implementing tsca , and the key challenges that remain , we interviewed epa officials in the office of chemical safety and pollution prevention ( ocspp ) , the epa office with primary responsibility for implementing tsca , including staff in the office of pollution and prevention's ( oppt ) chemical control division — responsible for risk management — and staff in the risk assessment division — responsible for risk assessment . according to epa , risk assessments provide information on potential health or ecological risks . in its review , nas made additional recommendations to the program . some of these issues have resulted in litigation . in our review of the 2011 and 2014 nas reports and other documentation as well as our interviews with iris officials and leadership and officials in program and regional offices that use iris assessments , we identified the key actions the iris program has taken to address lack of timeliness in producing assessments and lack of transparency in how it produces assessments . to address the length of time it takes to produce assessments , the iris program is ( 1 ) employing project management principles and specialized software that enable the program to better plan assessment schedules and utilize staff to make the systematic review process more efficient ; ( 2 ) focusing on better scoping assessments to create timely , fit - for - purpose products that address specific agency needs ; and ( 3 ) streamlining the peer review process as much as possible . for example , one industry representative expressed concern in august 2018 about transparency before the program began making changes , describing the iris program as a “black box” because “no one knew how the program created its methodologies , weighted evidence , or produced assessments.” in response , the iris program has in the past several years ( 1 ) implemented systematic review , which provides a structured and transparent process for identifying relevant studies , reviewing their methodological strengths and weaknesses , and integrating these studies as part of a weight of evidence analysis , and ( 2 ) increased outreach efforts with stakeholders and the public , both in terms of the frequency and the depth of content about assessment preparation . cuts to the program could impact epa's regulatory work: officials in almost all of the program and regional offices that use iris assessments told us that they rely on iris assessments to do their work — it is the first place they look for chemical toxicity values , and if the iris program is unable to produce assessments , their offices would be challenged to meet statutory deadlines and there would be a generally negative effect on public health . this survey was sent by memorandum in august 2018 . according to officials from the iris office , who were queried for advice by officials from some program offices , ord's second request was made verbally at a meeting and included direction to the program offices to limit their requests to no more than three to four chemicals . furthermore , four assessments that were in the later stages of development and had not been issued were not included in the december 2018 outlook . in october 2018 — 4 months after iris assessments were stopped from being released — 28 of approximately 30 iris staff were supporting oppt with 25 to 50 percent of their time . epa has demonstrated progress implementing tsca by responding to tsca's statutory deadlines through the end of fiscal year 2018 , including promulgating rules , developing guidance , and releasing reports . these three rules are the risk prioritization rule , which explains epa's process for prioritizing existing chemicals for risk evaluation ; the risk evaluation process rule , which explains epa's process for conducting risk evaluations on existing chemicals ; and the inventory notification rule , which requires manufacturers and processors of chemical substances to report which chemicals are currently in commerce . specifically , the environmental organizations argue , among other things , that the plain language of tsca requires epa to consider all conditions of use in prioritizing chemicals for review under tsca , rather than excluding , for example , uses that epa believes are “legacy uses” for which a chemical is no longer marketed . epa and industry intervenors responded by arguing that tsca grants epa discretion to determine what conditions constitute a chemical's conditions of use . epa also provided additional technical comments , which we have incorporated as appropriate . gao - 13-696t . high - risk series: an update .
