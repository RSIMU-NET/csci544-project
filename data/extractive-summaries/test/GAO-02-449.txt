the earned income credit ( eic ) is a refundable tax credit available to low - income , working taxpayers . since the eic recertification program's implementation , irs has , among other things , expanded the information on recertification available to taxpayers , revised some of the correspondence it sends to taxpayers , and improved examiner training . although irs has revised some of the correspondence it sends taxpayers as part of the recertification process , two standard forms that are an integral part of the process can lead to unnecessary taxpayer burden because they ( 1 ) are of questionable value to the recertification process and / or ( 2 ) provide the taxpayer with inadequate or confusing information . that form is confusing and incomplete . administering the eic is not an easy task for irs . irs has to balance its efforts to help ensure that all qualified persons claim the credit with its efforts to protect the integrity of the tax system by guarding against fraud and other forms of noncompliance associated with the eic . irs's outreach and correspondence to taxpayers and its training of examiners have improved since then .
