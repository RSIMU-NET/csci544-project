in 2002 , the united states experienced one of the worst wildland fire seasons in the past 50 years . as a result , when lightning storms hit california and oregon from july 12 to 15 , there were limited resources available to fight the hundreds of ongoing fires , including five fires that eventually burned together to form the biscuit fire . in this context , we reviewed ( 1 ) whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified ; ( 2 ) what resource management issues , if any , affected the ability of firefighting personnel to effectively fight the biscuit fire ; and ( 3 ) what differences , if any , existed in key personnel certification standards at federal and state agencies involved in fighting wildland fires — particularly in oregon — and whether any such differences affected efforts to respond to the biscuit fire . to facilitate the swift suppression of new fires — called the “initial attack” phase of a fire — local dispatch center personnel can first contact neighboring dispatch centers directly , including those in adjacent regions , before elevating resource requests to the regional or national level . at 6:40 p.m. , in response to the july 13 request for a helicopter , a regional dispatch official in portland working with officials in the northern california regional dispatch center in redding , the fortuna dispatch center , and the grants pass dispatch center arranged for a cdf helicopter with a water bucket to respond to the biscuit fires , as allowed under the provisions of the mutual aid agreement . grants pass personnel explained that they did not request assistance from the fortuna dispatch center on july 13 because , based on the daily fire situation reports , they believed no resources would be available due to the fires in northern california . this was largely because the biscuit fires were not threatening lives and property . in contrast , contracted engines and other equipment had fewer problems . in the case of the biscuit fire , grants pass dispatch personnel did communicate resource needs to their regional dispatch center in portland , but no resources were immediately available due to other higher priority fires in the region . since no request was made , the priority of the biscuit fire relative to other ongoing fires within the fortuna dispatch center's direct protection area was not discussed on the first day of the biscuit fire , and the outcome of such a request , had it been made , remains unclear . the forest service commented that the report appears to be accurate and the agency generally agrees with its contents . the department of the interior did not provide comments . we interviewed a number of federal and state personnel knowledgeable about the biscuit fire , including officials from the siskiyou and six rivers national forests , odf , and cdf , and the management teams and other key support staff that were assigned to the biscuit fire .
