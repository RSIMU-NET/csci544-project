the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) , enacted in 1938 , is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers . the minimum wage provisions of the flsa have been amended numerous times since then , typically to expand coverage or raise the wage rate . given the generally broad minimum wage coverage of the flsa , it is likely that most workers in states with minimum wages below the federal rate are covered by the flsa rate . in 2019 , the range of state minimum wage rates is as follows: 29 states and the district of columbia have enacted minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour ; 2 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate ; 5 states have no state minimum wage requirement ; and the remaining 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate . in the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage , only individuals who are not covered by the flsa are subject to those lower rates . the appendix provides detailed information on state minimum wage policy in all 50 states and the district of columbia , including the legislation authorizing the state minimum wage and the relevant legislative language regarding the rate and mechanism of adjustment . instead the interaction of federal and state rates has led to the federal minimum wage playing a fluctuating , but generally decreasing , role in establishing a wage floor for the civilian labor force , particularly during periods in which the federal rate is not increased . prior to the federal increases in 1990 and 1991 , the number of states with higher minimum wages rose from 3 in 1984 to 16 in 1989 and the share of the u.s. civilian labor force in states for which the federal rate was the floor fell from 98% to 70% . as discussed previously , for those states with current or scheduled minimum wages above the federal rate , three main mechanisms are in place to adjust future rates: ( 1 ) scheduled increases , ( 2 ) indexation to inflation , or ( 3 ) reference to the federal rate plus an add - on ( i.e. , a state minimum wage is a percentage or dollar amount above the federal rate ) .
