the department of defense ( dod ) spends billions of dollars each year to maintain operational systems and processes intended to support its mission . for decades , dod has been challenged in modernizing its systems environment to reduce duplication and increase integration between its systems . in light of the critical role that military department architectures play in dod's enterprise architecture construct , you asked us to assess the status of the departments of the air force , army , and navy's enterprise architecture programs . in this regard , it provides a flexible benchmark against which to plan for and measure architecture program management maturity that permits thoughtful and reasonable discretion to be applied in using it . version 2.0 of the framework arranges 59 core elements into a matrix of seven hierarchical stages . the air force , army , and don each have long - standing efforts in place to develop and use an enterprise architecture , but much remains to be accomplished before these efforts can be considered sufficiently mature to fully support ongoing organizational transformation and corporate optimization efforts . specifically , the air force has fully satisfied 20 percent , partially satisfied 47 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of gao's enterprise architecture framework elements . the army has fully satisfied 12 percent and partially satisfied 42 percent of elements , with the remaining 46 percent not satisfied . finally , don has satisfied 27 percent , partially satisfied 41 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of framework elements .  ( table 1 summarizes each military department's satisfaction of core enterprise architecture management elements and detailed results are presented in appendices iii , iv , and v. ) more specifically , while the military departments have each demonstrated that they are beginning to establish an institutional commitment to their respective enterprise architecture by addressing many of the elements described in stage 1 of gao's enterprise architecture management framework and to develop initial enterprise architecture content ( stage 3 ) , they have generally not established a well - developed enterprise architecture management foundation ( stage 2 ) . finally , the departments have taken limited steps to continuously improve their respective architecture programs and use their architectures to achieve enterprisewide optimization ( stage 6 ) . officials at the military departments stated that they continue to face long - standing enterprise architecture management challenges , such as receiving adequate funding , overcoming cultural resistance and attaining sufficient senior leadership understanding . in addition , for fiscal year 2012 , dod has requested about $38 billion for its it investments . consequently , dod as a whole is not well positioned to realize the significant benefits that a well - managed set of architectures can contribute to its ongoing operational and it system modernization efforts , such as eliminating system overlap and duplication . because dod is provided with over $30 billion each year for its it systems environment , the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its it investments is significant . stage 2 of gao's eammf describes elements that build on the strategic leadership commitment established in stage 1 by creating the managerial means to accomplish activities in later stages , including developing an initial version of the enterprise architecture ( stages 3 and 4 ) and evolving and continuously improving an enterprise architecture ( stages 5 and 6 ) that can be used to help guide and direct investments and achieve the architecture's stated purpose . consistent with these approaches , the air force and don have begun to develop initial enterprise - level architecture content , but this content does not include separate views of the current and target environments and neither of the two military departments has fully established a sequencing plan that describes how the department is to transition from its current to the target environment and is based on an analysis of the gaps between these environments . nevertheless , as stated previously in this report , dod has been provided with considerable resources for its it systems environment and architecture budgetary needs have not been identified and justified through reliable cost estimating and expected program benefits . without fully developed and effectively managed enterprise architectures and a plan , the air force , army , and don do not have the needed road maps for transforming their business processes and modernizing their supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability . to ensure that the military departments establish commitments to fully develop and effectively manage their enterprise architectures , we recommend that the secretaries of the air force , army , and navy each expeditiously provide to the congressional defense committees a plan that identifies milestones for their respective department's full satisfaction of all of our enterprise architecture management maturity framework elements . we therefore believe our recommendation remains valid as stated .
