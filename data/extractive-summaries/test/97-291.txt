u.s. - mexico and u.s. - canada bilateral waste - tradeagreements also areincluded , and the parties may agree to add others . to facilitate nafta passage , two related agreements werenegotiated , which are discussed below . theborder environmental cooperation agreement authorized the establishment of the north american development bank ( nadb ) andthe border environment cooperation commission ( becc ) to assist bordercommunities in financing environmental infrastructureprojects . the agreement noted the need for environmental infrastructure , especially in the areas of water pollution,wastewatertreatment , and municipal solid waste . the nadb is authorized to make only market - rate loans , however , and this hasbeen a major obstacleto the bank's ability to finance projects in low - income border communities . in the 107th congress , the environment - related provisions of nafta and its side accord received attention during consideration oftrade promotion authority legislation and the u.s. - jordan free trade agreement ( fta ) ; both adapted environmentalprovisions fromthe naaec and nafta . in the 108th congress , efforts to reform the becc and nadb continued , and in april 2004 , the president signed into law p.l.108-215 ( h.r . 254 , h.rept . moreover , both agreements include environmental cooperationandcapacity - building provisions . while welcoming the heightened consideration of environmental matters since the nafta debate , some members of congress andenvironmental groups remain concerned that the provisions in the current tpa law and in recently negotiated tradeagreements maynot be sufficient to safeguard legitimate environmental measures from challenges , particularly those involvinginvestor - state disputes.consequently , while the debate over whether environmental matters should be a part of trade negotiations generallyhas been settled,the debate over how to address such issues is likely to continue . the effect of the environment - related provisionsin recent u.s.bilateral trade agreements , and thus the shape of the debate , may become clearer with the ongoing implementationof nafta andsubsequent agreements that have incorporated nafta and naaec - like provisions .
