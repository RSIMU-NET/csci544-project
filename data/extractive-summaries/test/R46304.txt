the outbreak of coronavirus disease ( covid - 19 ) , first in the people's republic of china ( prc or china ) , and now globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the united states and other ec onomies depend on critical manufacturing and global value chains that rely on production based in china . congress is particularly concerned about these dependencies and has passed legislation to better understand and address them . an area of particular concern to congress in the current environment is u.s. shortages of medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity . at the same time , the chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in china , directing all production for domestic use . the chinese government also directed the national bureaucracy , local governments , and chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market . as china's manufacturing sector recovers while the united states and other countries are grappling with covid - 19 , the chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery . in sectors where china has extensive capacity ( such as steel ) , some fear china could overwhelm overseas markets , as it ramps up export - led growth to compensate for the sharp economic downturn in the first quarter of 2020 . because of china's role as a major u.s. and global supplier of medical ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients ( appendix b ) , reduced exports from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states . the covid - 19 pandemic has also precipitated a sharp downturn in consumer demand , first in china and now globally . 116-136 , the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act includes several provisions that expand drug shortage reporting requirements to include apis and medical devices . the bill also requires certain drug manufacturers to draw up risk management plans and requires the fda to maintain a public list of medical devices that are determined to be in shortage . additionally , the bill directs the national academies of science , engineering , and medicine to conduct a study of pharmaceutical supply chain security . 5982 , the safe medicine act , would direct hhs to assess vulnerabilities in the u.s. pharmaceutical supply chain by issuing a report that examines u.s. dependence on china for critical apis and gaps in domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities . possible questions for congress in the context of covid - 19 include: whether to prioritize economic openness and free flows of information ; whether to prioritize diversifying sources of medical supplies , and if so , how ; how best to overcome current and future bottlenecks in health care supply chains in the united states and partner nations ; whether to respond to china's attempts to control the global narrative about key covid - 19 events , and if so , how ; and whether to look to reform global health and trade governance in light of covid - 19 developments , and if so , how . p.l .
