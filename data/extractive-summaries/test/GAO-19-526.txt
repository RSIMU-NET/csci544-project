fema and the american red cross ( red cross ) are the primary agencies responsible for coordinating mass care under the federal disaster response framework . this report is also part of gao's comprehensive evaluation of the federal government's preparedness , response , and recovery efforts related to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria . this review addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which fema and the red cross effectively coordinated mass care in response to the 2017 hurricanes , and ( 2 ) the extent to which fema supported and used state and local assessments of mass care capabilities for the 2017 hurricanes . we analyzed mass care capability information for six grantees of dhs preparedness funds: florida , puerto rico , texas , and the u.s. virgin islands , as well as two urban areas within these states and territories — houston , texas , and miami , florida . fema provides guidance and technical assistance to state and local partners in their self - assessment efforts . as a result , some remaining shelters were at maximum capacity . damaged roads and communications infrastructure: damaged and flooded roads and the affected terrain in all four states contributed to challenges in distributing supplies , especially in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands . in puerto rico , fema received complaints from municipalities that food was not reaching neighborhoods in need . although red cross has written agreements with some state and local partners , counties we visited in florida , texas , and the u.s. virgin islands — states where red cross shelters disaster victims — did not have written agreements that clearly specified what mass care services would be provided by the red cross . information on the mass care capabilities of state and local jurisdictions that fema collected in 2016 and 2017 was not specific enough to aid the agency in its response to the 2017 hurricanes , according to fema's after - action report and agency officials . however , by not requiring that grantees solicit input from organizations that provide mass care , or that grantees name specific organizations in their submissions , fema may rely on capabilities assessments developed without consultation with voluntary organizations providing key mass care services . fema reviews grantees' capabilities assessments using standard checklists , but does not have a systematic process for providing feedback to grantees on their submissions in order to improve the usefulness of the information in them . fema does not explicitly require grantees to involve key mass care providers in their capabilities assessments .  ( recommendation 1 ) in addition , we are making the following four recommendations to the fema administrator: to better clarify what mass care services voluntary organizations can provide , especially for severe or overlapping hurricanes , fema should strengthen its guidance to state and local governments to emphasize the importance of clearly defining roles and responsibilities related to mass care when state and local governments develop written agreements with partner organizations .
