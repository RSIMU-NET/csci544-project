this report presents the results of our review of the programs administered by the department of commerce and federal trade commission ( ftc ) for controlling the acceptance and reporting of travel expenses incurred by their employees and paid by nonfederal organizations . the commerce , consumer , and monetary affairs subcommittee asked us on november 9 , 1993 , to determine ( 1 ) the adequacy of commerce's administration of its employees' acceptance and reporting of travel funds from nonfederal sources and ( 2 ) the implications , if any , of commerce's denying the office of government ethics ( oge ) access to its records of reimbursed travel in 1992 . ftc's procedures for accepting and reporting reimbursed travel were basically sound . the overall effect of commerce's temporary denial of access was minimal in that oge eventually received access to commerce records , and oge has not been denied access to such records at any other agency . we recommend that the secretary of commerce take actions to ensure that all commerce employees' travel requests containing all of the necessary information , such as the name of the payer and the amount and type of expenses to be paid , are reviewed and approved before a trip ; the office of general counsel , as part of its responsibilities for submitting semiannual reports to oge , ensure that these reports include the required information , including the dates and nature of events attended and expenses paid ; and commerce offices require ( 1 ) travel vouchers and ( 2 ) receipts for reimbursed expenses , except for meals since they are not required by federal travel regulations to be supported in this manner . the focus of our review was to determine how well these controls over reimbursed travel were being implemented .
