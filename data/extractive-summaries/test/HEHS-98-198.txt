you asked that we determine ( 1 ) whether ssa's plan to process 8.1 million cdrs during fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will result in cdrs being done for all beneficiaries for whom cdrs are required by law and ( 2 ) whether the ddss' cdr processing capacity and the cdr funding authorized by the congress for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will be sufficient to process the cdrs required by law . cdr full medical reviews are costly ( about $800 each in fiscal year 1996 ) because they involve a labor - intensive process: ( 1 ) ssa headquarters personnel determine that a cdr is due and notify the ssa processing center ; ( 2 ) personnel at the processing center locate the beneficiary's file and send it to the appropriate ssa field office ; ( 3 ) field office personnel contact the beneficiary , conduct a lengthy interview , and send the file to the appropriate dds ; ( 4 ) the dds requests medical records from the beneficiary's treating physicians and other medical treating sources and , if these sources cannot provide sufficient evidence , schedules medical and / or psychological examinations with consulting physicians outside the dds ; and ( 5 ) a dds team , consisting of a disability examiner and a physician or psychologist , determines whether the beneficiary continues to meet ssa disability criteria . by the end of fiscal year 2002 , if ssa's new cdr plan is completed as envisioned , all the cdrs required by law will be complete or under way , including those that are overdue and those due to begin by the end of 2002 ( see app . when ddss award disability benefits , they set dates for starting cdrs , and every month these prescheduled cdr start dates come due for many beneficiaries . ssa's more cursory mailer questionnaires require about 6 months . ssa estimates that about 835,000 required cdrs that are due to start in fiscal year 2002 will not be completed by year - end ; according to ssa , these cdrs will be completed in fiscal year 2003 . however , ddss could potentially encounter additional caseloads not envisioned in ssa's plan . furthermore , if the volume of initial disability applications or requests for reconsideration of denied applications is larger than assumed by ssa , ddss may have to accumulate larger backlogs of these cases in order to complete cdr full medical reviews . such events , if they occur , could lead ssa to decide to increase dds capacity ; but timely expansion of dds capacity faces potential barriers . consequently , if ssa's efforts to develop statistical selection formulas for these children and adult groups prove unsuccessful , ssa will not have an adequate basis for identifying appropriate mailer recipients ; in that case , ssa would have to substantially increase the number of dds full medical reviews in order to meet the goal of completing 8.1 million cdrs by the end of fiscal year 2002 . according to ssa staff , if it becomes necessary to increase dds cdr full medical review workloads significantly because mailers cannot be used to the full extent planned , an increase in the capacity of many ddss might be needed . if so , the authorized funding would be inadequate . if ssa's assumptions do not hold , unexpected increases in these other disability workloads could result . for all nondeferred beneficiary groups , however , ssa plans to complete all required cdrs that are due or overdue during fiscal years 1998 to 2002 except those for ( 1 ) beneficiaries whose cdrs are due to start too close to the end of fiscal year 2002 to be completed by year - end , ( 2 ) beneficiaries who become old enough to move into the deferred age groups before being selected for cdrs , ( 3 ) beneficiaries who die before cdrs are completed , and ( 4 ) ssi beneficiaries whose benefits are terminated , due to income and resources , before cdrs are completed .
