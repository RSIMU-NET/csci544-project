tribes and their members determine how to use indian energy resources to meet the needs of the community . in addition , in june 2015 , we reported that bia staff limitations , a complex regulatory framework that involved multiple agencies , tribes' limited access to capital and energy markets , and other factors also hindered indian energy development . the general services administration ( gsa ) is one of the agencies included in the energy subgroup because it is responsible for purchasing energy for the federal government — the largest consumer of energy in the united states . this report examines ( 1 ) whether the actions of the energy subgroup and service center have helped to overcome long - standing factors hindering development , ( 2 ) bia's efforts to address workforce challenges that hinder indian energy development , ( 3 ) the progress of federal agencies to implement the preference authority to purchase energy from tribes , and ( 4 ) any additional opportunities stakeholders identified that federal agencies could take to help overcome factors hindering indian energy development . specifically , we interviewed federal officials from bia , ieed , doe , doe's western area power administration , usda , gsa , and the u.s. department of housing and urban development ( hud ) who may have a role associated with indian energy development . resource identification . purchase power . according to doe and interior officials , since may 2014 , the federal agencies that formed the energy subgroup have taken the following actions: ie and ieed signed a memorandum of understanding in june 2016 as a format for collaboration between the two agencies ; ie and ieed began to meet regularly in august 2015 to discuss projects involving both agencies and grant release dates , among other things ; ie , with input from numerous other agencies , developed a web - based tool that provides information about grant , loan , and technical assistance programs available to support tribal energy projects ; ie hosted events to encourage tribal engagement , such as the september 2015 national tribal energy summit: a path to economic sovereignty ; and ie , interior , usda , gsa , dod , and treasury convened a meeting to discuss opportunities to provide technical and financial assistance to a planned 1-gigawatt wind and transmission infrastructure project . federal agencies have dedicated few staff and financial resources to the energy subgroup , have not identified the resources needed to accomplish its goals , and do not have an agreed - upon funding model . without dedicated resources , key activities completed to date are generally the result of individual federal agencies that voluntarily identified and applied their own budgetary resources to specific work activities . in some instances , specific congressional authority or dedicated funding from congress may be used for the interagency funding for collaborative mechanisms . if the energy subgroup does not identify resources and a funding model , it is unclear to what extent the energy subgroup's collaborative efforts can be effectively sustained to accomplish its stated policy goals . the energy subgroup has not documented how participating agencies will collaborate . interior has recognized the need for collaboration in the regulatory process and described the service center as a center point of collaboration for permitting that will break down barriers between federal agencies . in this review , we found that bia also has high vacancy rates at some agency offices , and it has not conducted key workforce planning activities that may be further contributing to its long - standing workforce challenges . the standards and leading practices include the following: ( 1 ) possessing and maintaining staff with a level of competence that allows them to accomplish their assigned duties ; ( 2 ) identifying the key skills and competencies the workforce needs to achieve current and future agency goals and missions , assessing any skills gaps , and monitoring progress towards addressing gaps ; and ( 3 ) conducting resource planning to determine the appropriate geographic and organizational deployment to support goals and strategies . bia has not identified key skills needed or skill gaps . recognizing the importance of a collaborative federal approach to help indian tribes achieve their energy goals and to more efficiently fulfill regulatory responsibilities and manage some indian energy resources , the president and interior undertook two key initiatives , in the form of the energy subgroup and the service center . however , bia is hiring new staff without incorporating effective workforce planning principles . however , gsa — the primary entity responsible for purchasing power for the federal government — has not developed guidance to implement the authority to provide a tribal preference government - wide . we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of the bureau of indian affairs to take the following six actions: ( 1 ) include the other regulatory agencies in the service center , such as fws , epa , and the army corps of engineers , so that the service center can act as a single point of contact or a lead agency to coordinate and navigate the regulatory process .
