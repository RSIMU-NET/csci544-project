some analysts state that "the united states took an early lead in exploiting the promise of precision - strike systems and the use of precision weaponry has given the united states a battlefield edge for twenty years . however , these weapons are now spreading: other countries , and non - state actors , are acquiring them and developing countermeasures against them. . the fact that this ability of the united states to project power could also diminish , possibly leaving u.s. forces — and eventually the united states itself — increasingly vulnerable to precision weapons in the hands of its adversaries , will raise a number of serious considerations for members of congress . the proliferation of precision strike creates potential issues for congress . oversight issues include whether the department of defense ( dod ) is properly taking adversary precision strike weapons into account in its own plans and programs . authorization and appropriations issues include whether congress should approve , reject , or modify proposed dod programs for responding to those weapons . congress's decisions regarding combating the proliferation of precision strike in its oversight role could be wide - ranging , substantially affecting a variety of key factors , including capabilities and funding requirements ; service force levels and missions ; technology proliferation strategy ; forward - deployed basing considerations ; level of support given to allies ; strength of u.s. influence around the globe ; and the defense industrial base . only recently , starting with the successful use by the united states during operation desert storm , has the world seen the kind of impact precision guided weapons can have . today , as technology and tactics have evolved , those same uav platforms armed with such weapons as hellfire missiles are being used extensively in the war on terror . it is maintained by the u.s. government and is freely accessible by anyone with a gps receiver . the restrictions attempt to prevent use of the receiver in a ballistic missile , but the restrictions would not prevent the use in a cruise missile , which travels at much lower altitudes and slower speeds . many experts believe the proliferation of precision strike has already begun and will continue to accelerate as more and more countries continue to develop and purchase precision strike weaponry . category iv countries are those that will have commercial access to some precision strike munitions , particularly short range systems. . although these efforts often failed due to technological and political constraints , in several cases they are being revived today by existing and prospective u.s. opponents , many of whom have a greater incentive to compete asymmetrically than their predecessors given the scale of u.s. dominance , in addition to having access to capabilities far superior in range , accuracy , and endurance than those employed a century ago . this report focuses primarily on proliferating precision strike weapons systems and not the myriad issues associated with the ramifications of such proliferation or strategies to defend against them . in areas that exploit precision strike capabilities to build sophisticated anti - access / area denial capabilities , does the united states have enough surface and sub - surface ships to economically cripple the aggressor state through a naval blockade ? . what is the cost of these additional assets ? . what type of timeline is required ? . in regard to the developed and developing precision strike weapons possessed by china , how does that affect u.s. ability to support democratic taiwan ? .
