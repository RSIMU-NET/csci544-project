in 2008 , the u.s. supreme court decided district of columbia v. heller , in which the court held that the second amendment to the u.s. constitution protects an individual right to possess a firearm , unconnected with service in a militia , and the use of that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home . shortly afterward in mcdonald v. city of chicago , the supreme court held that the second amendment also applies to the states , but it did not further explore the scope of the second amendment . since heller and mcdonald , both federal and state firearms laws have been regularly challenged under the second amendment . this report first discusses the standard of judicial review that the lower courts generally have fashioned to determine if a firearm law is in violation of the second amendment . the following decisions indicate how reviewing courts have evaluated the constitutionality of concealed carry laws , and thus , how courts may assess future challenges to these laws . the court reached this conclusion on the basis that the general ban on carrying a firearm includes an exception for home possession of a handgun without obtaining a permit . although many firearms laws have been upheld as constitutional , the differences in how courts interpret the text of heller , insofar as providing some guidance on the scope of the second amendment , as well as how they apply the two - step inquiry may impact the burden upon the government to prove its case .
