my testimony today is based on our report being released today , entitled nuclear power plants: efforts made to upgrade security , but the nuclear regulatory commission's design basis threat process should be improved ( gao - 06-388 ) . the dbt characterizes the elements of a potential attack , including the number of attackers , their training , and the weapons and tactics they are capable of employing . the dbt does not represent the maximum size and capability of a terrorist attack that is possible but , rather , nrc's assessment of the threat that the nuclear power plants must at all times be prepared to defend against “to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety.” furthermore , nrc regulations do not require nuclear power plants to protect against attacks by an “enemy of the united states,” whether a foreign government or other person . our march 2006 report examined ( 1 ) the process nrc used to develop the april 2003 dbt for nuclear power plants , ( 2 ) the actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised dbt , and ( 3 ) nrc's efforts to strengthen the conduct of its force - on - force inspections . security for commercial nuclear power plants is addressed by nrc's office of nuclear security and incident response . nrc also conducts baseline inspections at nuclear power plants . the process by which nrc revised the dbt for nuclear power plants was generally logical and well defined in that trained threat assessment staff made recommendations for changes based on an analysis of demonstrated terrorist capabilities . while nrc followed a generally logical and well - defined process to revise the dbt for nuclear power plants , two aspects of the process raised a fundamental question — the extent to which the dbt represents the terrorist threat as indicated by intelligence data compared with the extent to which it represents the threat that nrc considers reasonable for the plants to defend against . the changes made by the nrc staff — in particular , the size of the vehicle bomb and list of weapons that could be used in an attack — reflected some ( but not all ) of nei's objections . these security enhancements were in addition to other measures licensees implemented — such as stricter requirements for obtaining physical access to nuclear power plants — in response to a series of security orders nrc issued after september 11 , 2001 . despite the substantial security improvements we observed at the four sites we visited , it is too early to conclude , either from nrc's force - on - force or baseline inspections , that all nuclear power plant sites are capable of defending against the revised dbt for the following two reasons: first , as of march 30 , 2006 , nrc had completed force - on - force inspections at 27 of the 65 sites , and it is not planning to complete force - on - force inspections at all sites until 2007 , in accordance with its 3-year schedule . based on our observations of three force - on - force inspections , other areas where nrc may be able to make further improvements included the following: ensuring the proper use of laser equipment ; varying the timing of inspection activities , such as the starting times of the mock attacks , in order to minimize the artificiality of the inspections ; ensuring the protection of information about the planned scenarios for the mock attacks so that security officers do not obtain knowledge that would allow them to perform better than they otherwise would ; and providing complete feedback to licensees on nrc inspectors' observations on the results of the force - on - force exercises .
