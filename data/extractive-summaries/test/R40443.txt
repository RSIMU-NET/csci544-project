the majority of both total funding and total staffing , however , is with the food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) at the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , which regulates most meat and poultry , and the food and drug administration ( fda ) at the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) , which regulates virtually all other foods . after discussing several recent food safety incidents and the systemic food safety problems that they illustrate , this report describes the existing food safety legal and regulatory landscape and presents an overview of efforts by the 111 th congress to revise federal food safety authorities and activities , principally at fda . it then provides a detailed overview of the major provisions in the newly enacted law — the fda food safety modernization act ( fsma , p.l . 111-353 ) . it also does not impose new registration fees for food facilities . it requires that access be provided to the hhs secretary if he or she "has a reasonable belief that an article of food , and any other article of food that the secretary reasonably believes is likely to be affected in a similar manner , is adulterated and presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals," or if the secretary "believes that there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to an article of food , and any other article of food that the secretary reasonably believes is likely to be affected in a similar manner , will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. . such practices are issued as fda guidance , not regulations . the provision that could have the most direct effect on on - farm activity — particularly growers of fresh produce — is the establishment of new standards for produce safety . in meeting the inspection requirements , the secretary is authorized to rely on inspections conducted by other federal , state , or local agencies . fda may conduct voluntary , on - site assessments of private accredited laboratories . the new law also contains language regarding revocation of accreditation and avoidance of conflicts of interest . during the food safety debate in congress , another senate bill , s. 3767 ( the food safety accountability act of 2010 , as introduced by senator patrick leahy ) , was considered for inclusion in the final senate version of the food safety bill ( s. 510 ) . in addition to the general provisions of fsma that apply to most foods , including supplements , fsma includes two provisions specifically focused on supplements ( both found in fsma , section 113 ) . before enactment of fsma , ffdca ( 21 u.s.c . each importer's program will be able to assure that each of its foreign suppliers produces the imported food employing processes and procedures , "including reasonably appropriate risk - based preventive controls," that are documented in a written plan and equivalent in preventing adulteration and reducing hazards to requirements of other relevant provisions of ffdca . some have questioned whether fsma will provide fda with so - called "equivalence authority," such as that governing u.s. imports of meat and poultry products under usda's fsis jurisdiction .
