in particular , we have found that the department of the interior's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) has inefficiently managed indian energy resources and the development process and thereby limited opportunities for tribes and their members to use those resources to create economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities . in addition , we have found numerous challenges facing interior's bureau of indian education ( bie ) and bia and the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) indian health services ( ihs ) in administering education and health care services , which put the health and safety of american indians served by these programs at risk . in 2016 , congress found in the indian trust asset reform act that “through treaties , statutes , and historical relations with indian tribes , the united states has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support indian tribes and indians.” as further stated in that act , the fiduciary responsibilities of the united states to indians arise in part from commitments made in treaties and agreements , under which indians surrendered claims to vast tracts of land , and this history of federal - tribal relations and understandings has benefitted the people of the united states and established “enduring and enforceable ederal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.” through improvements to federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members , agencies can improve the efficiency of federal programs under which services are provided to tribes and their members . in this context , my testimony today primarily discusses the findings from three of our prior reports on indian energy development . in our prior work , we identified concerns associated with bia management of energy resources and categorized them into five broad areas: ( 1 ) oversight of bia activities ; ( 2 ) collaboration and communication ; ( 3 ) bia workforce planning ; ( 4 ) technology ; and ( 5 ) bia's data . in the past 2 years , we issued three reports on indian energy resources and development in which we made 14 recommendations to bia . bia agreed with most of these recommendations , and has identified steps it will take to address some of the recommendations . however , bia does not have a documented process or the data needed to track its review and response times — such as data on the date documents are received , the date the review process is considered complete by the agency , and the date documents are approved or denied . we recommended in our june 2015 report that interior direct bia to develop a documented process to track its review and response times . interior agreed with the recommendation and stated it would try to implement a tracking and monitoring mechanism by the end of fiscal year 2017 for oil and gas leases . however , interior did not indicate whether it intends to track and monitor its review of other energy - related documents that must be approved before tribes can develop resources . we recommended , among other things , that bia develop a systematic mechanism for tracking these agreements through the review and approval process . we found that bia had taken steps to form an indian energy service center that was intended to , among other things , help expedite the permitting process associated with indian energy development . however , we found that bia did not coordinate with other key regulatory agencies , including interior's fish and wildlife service , the u.s. army corps of engineers , and the environmental protection agency . we recommended that bia include other regulatory agencies in the service center so that it can act as a single point of contact or a lead agency to coordinate and navigate the regulatory process . interior agreed with our recommendations and described its plans to address them . in our june 2015 report , we found that bia's long - standing workforce challenges , such as inadequate staff resources and staff at some offices without the skills needed to effectively review energy - related documents , were factors hindering indian energy development . however , bia is hiring new staff without incorporating effective workforce planning principles . specifically , bia has not assessed key skills needed to fulfill its responsibilities related to energy development or identified skill gaps , and does not have a documented process to provide reasonable assurance its workforce composition at agency offices is consistent with its mission , goals , and tribal priorities . we also recommended bia establish a documented process for assessing bia's workforce composition at agency offices taking into account bia's mission , goals , and tribal priorities .
