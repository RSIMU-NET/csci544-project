however , these alternative methods may pose challenges to students using them to do homework . to examine challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access , we analyzed data on internet access and use from the census bureau's november 2017 current population survey ( cps ) : computer and internet use supplement , sponsored by ntia . we compared fcc efforts to federal internal control standards related to using quality information and communicating externally and pilot - program design best practices .  ( see fig . students in mobile wireless - only households may have to rely on devices like smartphones that may not be well suited for academic tasks . most of these projects provide wireless internet access to students who lack in - home fixed internet and do not necessarily limit it to students in lower - income households . in september 2016 , fcc issued a public notice requesting public comment on two petitions filed with the agency seeking to allow the petitioning school districts to use existing e - rate - program - supported services and equipment for off - premises access without having to cost - allocate that traffic out of their existing e - rate discounts . the pilot program provided funding from july 2011 to june 2012 and sought to “investigate the merits and challenges of wireless off - premises connectivity services” and to “gain a better understanding of operation and administrative issues associated with off - premises use and connectivity , as well as the financial impact on the e - rate program overall.” furthermore , the pilot program sought to help fcc determine whether off - premises connectivity services “should ultimately be eligible for e - rate support.” fcc provided a total of $9 million in grants to 20 pilot - program participants — 19 schools or school districts and one community library system — to implement projects enabling innovation in learning outside the boundaries of school buildings and the traditional school day , including those that provided off - premises wireless access and wireless devices to students . as discussed earlier , school districts we met with said that existing e - rate program rules that require cost - allocation of off - premises access to e - rate discounts limit their ability to address the homework gap and providing off - premises access remains a challenge for schools and school districts . the differences in internet access — and therefore in the ease of doing homework — between school - age children in lower - income households and those in higher - income households that are more likely to be well connected has resulted in a “homework gap” that could inhibit the academic success of underconnected students . while school districts have made efforts to address the homework gap , such efforts may be inhibited by existing restrictions in fcc's e - rate program . we are making the following recommendation to fcc: the chairman of the federal communications commission should determine and execute a methodology for collecting and analyzing data — such as conducting a new pilot program regarding off - premises wireless access or analyzing other data — to assess the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises wireless access eligible for e - rate program support , and publish the results of this analysis .  ( recommendation 1 ) . our objectives for this report were to examine: ( 1 ) challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework that involves internet access and ( 2 ) what selected school districts are doing to expand wireless internet access for their students , and the federal role in such efforts . we also reviewed a non - generalizable sample of six projects involving seven local school districts taking steps to provide wireless internet access outside of school for students who may lack internet at home . during these interviews , we asked interviewees about a range of topics , including the extent to which school - age children have access to in - home and wireless internet and challenges faced by students who may only have mobile wireless access . we also reviewed information on education's relevant survey efforts .
