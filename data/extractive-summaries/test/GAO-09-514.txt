in its role as the nation's tax collector , the internal revenue service ( irs ) has a demanding responsibility to collect taxes , process tax returns , and enforce the nation's tax laws . this report is being provided to you to ( 1 ) provide the status of financial audit and financial management - related recommendations and the actions needed to address them and ( 2 ) demonstrate how the recommendations relate to control activities central to irs's mission and goals . to determine the current status of the recommendations , we ( 1 ) obtained irs's reported status of each recommendation and corrective action taken or planned as of april 2009 , ( 2 ) compared irs's reported status to our fiscal year 2008 audit findings to identify any differences between irs's and our conclusions regarding the status of each recommendation , and ( 3 ) performed additional follow - up work regarding irs's actions taken to address the open recommendations . in order to determine how these recommendations fit within irs's management and internal control structure , we compared the open recommendations and the issues that gave rise to them , to the control activities listed in the internal control standards and to the list of major factors and examples outlined in our internal control management and evaluation tool . over the years since we first began auditing irs's financial statements in fiscal year 1992 , irs has taken actions that enabled us to close over 200 of our financial management - related recommendations . at the same time , however , our audits continue to identify additional internal control issues , resulting in further recommendations for corrective action , including 16 new financial management - related recommendations resulting from our fiscal year 2008 financial audit . while most of these can be addressed in the short term , a few , particularly those concerning irs's automated systems , are complex and will require several more years to fully and effectively address . irs has made substantial progress in improving its financial management since its first financial audit , as evidenced by unqualified audit opinions on its financial statements for the past 9 years , resolution of several material internal control weaknesses and significant deficiencies , and actions taken resulting in the closure of hundreds of financial management recommendations . this progress has been the result of hard work by many individuals throughout irs and sustained commitment of irs leadership . further efforts are needed to address the internal control deficiencies that continue to exist . effective implementation of the recommendations we have made and continue to make through our financial audits and related work could greatly assist irs in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management . in commenting on a draft of this report , irs expressed its appreciation for our acknowledgment of the agency's progress in addressing its financial management changes as evidenced by our closure of 35 open financial management recommendations from prior gao reports . irs has improved its methodology for allocating its costs of operations at the business unit level . during our fiscal year 2008 audit , we identified four juveniles hired in fiscal year 2008 who were not provided a revised form 13094 . however , these issues do represent weaknesses in various aspects of irs's control environment that should be addressed .
