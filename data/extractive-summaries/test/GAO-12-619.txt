according to dod , the u.s. military's dependence on liquid fuel in countries like afghanistan creates an enormous logistics burden that exposes forces to enemy attack and diverts operational resources from other mission areas to support delivery of this critical resource . in 2011 , dod consumed almost 5 billion gallons of fuel in military operations worldwide , at a cost of approximately $17.3 billion . the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 established a director of operational energy plans and programs ( oep&p ) and developed an operational energy strategy , providing the department with an opportunity to increase attention on improving fuel demand management . specifically , this report addresses ( 1 ) dod's approach for fuel demand management , including at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan ; ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has initiatives to promote fuel efficiency at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan and efforts to coordinate and collaborate on such initiatives ; and ( 3 ) dod's efforts to measure the results of its fuel demand management initiatives and establish a baseline measure of fuel consumption in afghanistan . dod has taken steps since our 2009 report to establish an approach for managing overall fuel demand , but is still developing comprehensive guidance to address fuel demand management . since that time , dod has taken several steps to increase its visibility and accountability for fuel demand management , and is developing comprehensive guidance on how dod will incorporate energy efficiency considerations into operations , planning , and training decisions for current and future military operations . since our 2009 report on fuel demand management , various dod organizations have issued guidance for fuel demand management and the department is still developing more comprehensive guidance on how to incorporate energy efficiency considerations into dod's operational , planning , and training decisions . we recommended that multiple organizations within dod develop specific guidance on fuel demand management in their areas of responsibility . dod's operational energy strategy implementation plan also acknowledges the need for additional comprehensive guidance and directs the joint staff and military departments to report to the defense operational energy board by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 on how the strategy's goals will be reflected in policy , doctrine , and professional military education . without a systematic approach , dod may be limited in its ability to provide full visibility over all of its fuel demand management initiatives , achieve efficiencies , and avoid unintended duplication or overlap of activities . however , its data collection efforts face some continuing challenges . the army and marine corps have begun collecting information on fuel consumption at their forward - deployed locations in afghanistan . to further enhance dod's approach for managing fuel demand , including at forward deployed locations such as those in afghanistan , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs , in consultation with the joint staff , combatant commanders , and military service components , to finalize and implement a systematic approach that includes establishing a mechanism to identify and track fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded , or are in the research and development phase to ensure information concerning these efforts is effectively shared across the services .
