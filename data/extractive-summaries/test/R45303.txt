an officially secular nation , india has a long tradition of religious tolerance ( with periodic and sometimes serious lapses ) , which is protected under its constitution . for some observers , prime minister modi's 2016 u.s. visit — and address to a joint session of congress — completed the "political rehabilitation" of a foreign leader who was at one time viewed by many in the united states as a pariah: in 2005 , modi had been denied a u.s. visa over concerns about his role in government during lethal anti - muslim violence in gujarat in 2002 . in early 2017 , the bjp won a sweeping state - level victory in north - central uttar pradesh ( up ) , india's most populous state with more than 200 million residents , one - fifth of them muslim . with modi's blessing , the party then sat a vitriolic hindu cleric and hardliner , yogi adityanath , as up chief minister . new york - based human rights watch ( hrw ) , for example — which in 2018 removed laudatory language about india's "strong civil society , vigorous media , and an independent judiciary" found in previous annual reports — lists serious human rights concerns , and argues that , "vigilante violence aimed at religious minorities , marginalized communities , and critics of the government — often carried out by groups claiming to support the ruling bjp — became an increasing threat in india in 2017": the government failed to promptly or credibly investigate the attacks , while many senior bjp leaders publicly promoted hindu supremacy and ultra - nationalism , which encouraged further violence . perceived abuses have produced friction in the u.s. - india relationship , including within the u.s. congress . the population of approximately 1.3 billion includes a hindu majority of about 80% , as well as a large muslim minority of some 185 million ( about 14% ; india's muslim community is the world's third - largest , after indonesia's and pakistan's ) . both public and private actors pursued this effort.… at the federal level , prime minister narendra modi has made statements decrying mob violence , but members of his own political party have affiliations with hindu extremist groups and many have used discriminatory language about religious minorities . its labor wing , the bharatiya majdoor sangh ( indian workers' union ) , is the country's largest trade union , claiming more than 8 million members . in 2016 , maharashtra's former senior - most police official reportedly called for banning the rss as "the country's largest terror organization. . the vhp also is a leading force calling for a nationwide ban on religious conversions . a study by india's daily hindustan times found that , although only a small proportion of the more than 50,000 national and state - level politicians assessed were facing criminal charges for inciting religious violence or hatred ( less than one - half of one percent ) , the bjp had the highest proportion ( 1.3% ) of any party , more than triple that of the congress party . leading hindutva and widely - held rss aspirations include scaling back laws and government programs designed to benefit the religious minorities , muslims in particular ; establishing a uniform civil code ( to replace current personal law based on religious customs and thus standardizing all national laws regarding such topics as marriage , divorce , and inheritance ) ; repealing article 370 of the indian constitution , which grants limited autonomy to the state of jammu and kashmir ( a step that would , if implemented , allow citizens from other states to buy property in jammu and kashmir , see " the kashmir dispute ," below ) ; redrafting public school textbooks to remove what are alleged to be insults to hindu gods and excessive praise of the subcontinent's past muslim rulers ; constructing a ram temple on the ayodhya site of the babri mosque that was razed in 1992 ; and preventing cow slaughter through legislation ( cows are revered animals in hinduism ) .
