fema then makes a recommendation to the president concerning whether a declaration should be issued . the average number of major disaster declarations issued per year in the 1960s ( the first full decade for declarations ) was roughly 18.6 . in contrast , from 2000 to 2009 the average number of declarations issued per year was 57.1 . calendar year 2011 was the busiest year on record with 97 major disaster declarations . congressional concern over the rising number of declarations is primarily focused on their associated costs because once declared , the majority of disaster relief costs ( at least 75% ) are shifted from the state to the federal government . the increase in declarations has led some critics to argue that thresholds for issuing major disaster declarations are set too low , allowing too many "marginal incidents" to receive a declaration . this report provides a historical overview of the three categories of declarations , including the average number of declarations declared and turned down , and the distribution of declarations by incident type and state . this report discusses a wide range of factors that might be contributing to the increase in declarations and provides policy options that might reduce the number of declarations and some of their associated costs . today the principal authority governing federal assistance for emergencies and major disasters in the united states is the robert t. stafford relief and emergency assistance act ( p.l . if the increase in the number of declarations is a concern for the federal costs that accompany them ( or for other reasons which have been discussed in this report ) , congress may choose to address the issue . addressing the issue may be conceptualized as two approaches: ( 1 ) limiting the number of declarations and ( 2 ) limiting the amount of spending that can occur after a declaration has been made . given the variables described in this report that can lead to an increase in the number of declarations , including trends in severe weather patterns , population growth , and development , the upward trend of declarations will likely continue if declarations policies remain unchanged . some may contend that the policy mechanisms used to address the number of declarations should be shaped in response to the causes of the increase . alternatively , thresholds for federal assistance could be adjusted to eliminate what may be perceived to be marginal incidents and focus federal assistance on large - scale disasters . another method would be shifting a greater share of the responsibility for providing assistance from the federal government to states and localities . if the increase is tied to state policies then mechanisms such as the use of loans or other incentives could be implemented to help decrease the number of state requests for assistance . finally , as mentioned throughout this report , a combination of all of the above could be implemented . while it is generally agreed that the government should help disaster victims in time of need , it is debatable whether the fiscal responsibility resides primarily with the federal or the state government . it remains to be seen if reducing declarations and / or limiting the amount of disaster assistance provided to requesting states would severely disrupt the state's ability to recover from an incident or if states would be able to adjust to the changes by reallocating available state resources .
