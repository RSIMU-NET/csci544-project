carbon capture and sequestration ( or storage ) — known as ccs — is a physical process that involves capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere . ccs could reduce the amount of co 2 emitted to the atmosphere from the continued use of fossil fuels at power plants and other large , industrial facilities . the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) has pursued research and development of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated ccs system since 1997 . congress has appropriated nearly $7 billion in total since fy2008 for ccs research , development , and demonstration ( rd&d ) at doe's office of fossil energy: nearly $3.5 billion in total annual appropriations ( including fy2015 ) and $3.4 billion from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 ; enacted february 17 , 2009 , hereinafter referred to as the recovery act ) . the large and rapid influx of funding for industrial - scale ccs projects from the recovery act was intended to accelerate development and demonstration of ccs in the united states . however , the future deployment of ccs may take a different course if the major components of the doe program follow a path similar to doe's futuregen project . u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed rules and guidelines for reducing greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new and existing coal - fired power plants have been a focal point of discussion in congress about ccs . for example , in 2010 doe stated that the cost of deploying available ccs post - combustion technology on a supercritical pulverized coal - fired power plant would increase the cost of electricity by 80% . in addition , one remaining active project in the ccpi program that received funding in round 2 , prior to enactment of the recovery act — the kemper county energy facility — also is discussed . under the 2010 ccs roadmap , and with the large infusion of funding from the recovery act , doe's goal is to develop the technologies to allow for commercial - scale demonstration in both new and retrofitted power plants and industrial facilities by 2020 . it could also be argued that much of the future success of ccs is riding on these three programs . testimony from scott klara of the national energy technology laboratory sums up a crucial metric for the success of the federal ccs rd&d program , namely , whether ccs technologies are deployed in the commercial marketplace: the success of the clean coal program will ultimately be judged by the extent to which emerging technologies get deployed in domestic and international marketplaces . to date , there are no commercial ventures in the united states that capture , transport , and inject large quantities of co 2 ( e.g. , 1 million tons per year or more ) solely for the purposes of carbon sequestration . the success of these demonstration projects will likely bear heavily on the future outlook for widespread deployment of ccs technologies as a strategy for preventing large quantities of co 2 from reaching the atmosphere while plants continue to burn fossil fuels , mainly coal . the proposed epa standard to limit co 2 emissions from new coal - fired power plants has invited renewed scrutiny of ccs technology and its prospects for commercial deployment . congress may wish to carefully review the ccs r&d program and particularly the results from the demonstration projects as they progress . such a review could help congress evaluate whether doe is on track to meet its goal of allowing for an advanced ccs technology portfolio to be ready by 2020 for large - scale demonstration and deployment in the united states .
