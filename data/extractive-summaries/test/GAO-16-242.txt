however , while a replacement rate provides an individual with important information for developing a long - term savings goal , it does not provide a plan for achieving it . based on our analysis of 2013 ce data , mid - career households had one of the highest spending levels , while older households generally spent less . more specifically , in 2013 , mid - career households — those aged 45- 49 — spent an estimated average of about $58,500 , while young retiree households — those aged 65-69 — spent about $46,800 , or 20 percent less overall ( see fig . while the share of spending was relatively consistent across age groups in some categories , there were larger variations by age for other categories . for example , the proportion of homeownership without a mortgage for young retiree households was three times higher than for mid - career households . for example , young retiree households spent an average of around $4,900 on health care , compared to about $3,500 for mid - career households . more specifically , the difference in average total spending for low - income households between the mid - career and young retiree age groups was not statistically significant , while the difference across these same age groups was over $20,000 for the highest income quartile . nevertheless , with a substantial portion of spending going toward basic expenses , households with limited resources may not have much flexibility to adjust spending levels . we found that accounting for how a household's spending may change in retirement is an important step in determining a target replacement rate — that is , a recommendation for how much pre - retirement income an individual or household needs to replace in retirement . for example , women often have shorter careers than men . dol's employee benefits security administration ( ebsa ) provides guidance on retirement income savings for workers via a number of publications available in print and online . they also indicated that they limited the information on factors that could affect replacement rates to keep the document from being too complex and cluttered . without the ability to adjust the replacement rate used in the tools , workers may over - or under - estimate how much they need to save for retirement . additionally , dol's tools do not provide flexibility to allow a user to customize or compare rates . to help workers make appropriate adjustments to the replacement rates used in calculating their specific retirement income needs , the secretary of labor should take the following two actions: include in its retirement planning tools information about examples of individual circumstances that research has shown to result in higher or lower income replacement needs ( e.g. , household characteristics and income level ) and guidance on the direction and magnitude of the changes attributable to such circumstances as well as those due to particular lifestyle choices . to analyze consumption in retirement and how target replacement rates are defined and used to assess retirement readiness , we examined ( 1 ) whether and how spending patterns have varied by age ; ( 2 ) the key factors used to develop target replacement rates for how much income workers need to replace in retirement ; and ( 3 ) the usefulness of information on replacement rates provided to workers by the department of labor . ce is a program that consists of two ongoing surveys , the quarterly interview survey and the diary survey , that provide information on the buying habits of american consumers , including data on their expenditures , income , and consumer unit characteristics . to identify target replacement rates recommended to u.s. workers , we reviewed our selected studies for ( 1 ) references to rules of thumb for income replacement rates in retirement , ( 2 ) references to target rates recommended by other researchers or organizations , and ( 3 ) target replacement rates recommended or developed by the report's authors . we identified four factors from the articles and reports we reviewed in addition to spending , household characteristics , and pre - retirement earnings that raised important considerations for developing the underlying assumptions behind a target replacement rate . further , ltc service rates can be expensive . 14 , no . replacement rates for retirees: what makes sense for planning and evaluation ? . actuarial note 155 .
