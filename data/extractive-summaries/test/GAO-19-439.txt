many of the department of defense's ( dod ) major defense acquisition programs face challenges delivering innovative technologies to the warfighter to keep pace with evolving threats . in the national defense authorization acts for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 , congress included numerous reforms that could help to streamline acquisition oversight and field capabilities faster . we recommended that dod eliminate reviews and information requirements that do not add value or are no longer needed . in addition , new processes are in place to improve dod's consideration of program cost , fielding , and performance goals and assessment of technical risk although questions remain about how they will be implemented . dod has yet to determine what types of business case information should be submitted to decision makers to help ensure well - informed decisions about program initiation and how program performance will be measured consistently . for a middle - tier acquisition program , business case information would help decision makers make well - informed decisions , to include assessing whether the program is likely to meet objectives established in statute to complete a prototype with a residual operational capability ( in the case of a rapid prototyping program ) or complete fielding ( in the case of a rapid fielding program ) within 5 years of an approved requirement . lastly , dod has yet to develop processes to assess the effectiveness of recent reforms . middle - tier acquisition . in the longer term , without resolving these issues , dod cannot ensure that it is achieving the balance between oversight and accountability and efficient program management that senior leadership expects as an outcome of acquisition reform . these sweeping changes have resulted in some disagreements about oversight roles and responsibilities between the office of the secretary of defense and the military departments that have not been fully resolved . this report addresses ( 1 ) the progress the department of defense ( dod ) has made to implement selected oversight reforms for major defense acquisition programs ; ( 2 ) how dod has used middle - tier acquisition pathways and the extent to which dod has developed guidance on middle - tier program oversight ; and ( 3 ) challenges dod faces related to reform implementation . to identify the progress dod has made to implement selected oversight reforms for major defense acquisition programs , we analyzed three selected reforms that affect processes related to dod's oversight of major defense acquisition programs: designating military departments to be the milestone decision performing independent technical risk assessments ; and establishing cost , fielding , and performance goals . to determine how dod has used middle - tier acquisition pathways , we reviewed the relevant statute and guidance , and obtained information from the military departments about the number and types of programs using middle - tier acquisition pathways as of march 2019 . we also collected and analyzed information about dod's actions taken to implement prior recommendations we have made to improve portfolio management at dod and analyzed the acquisition oversight reforms we included in this review to identify opportunities and challenges related to portfolio management that dod may face as it continues to implement acquisition reforms . for all objectives , we also conducted interviews with officials from the office of the secretary of defense , the joint staff , and the military departments to obtain additional insight into implementation status , implementation challenges , and future plans , including: office of the secretary of defense: the office of the under secretary of defense for research and engineering , the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment , the office of the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) , the office of the chief management officer , the office of the director of operational test and evaluation , the office of the director of cost assessment and program evaluation , and the office of the general counsel .
