some economists predict that by 2030 , the nation could experience a labor shortage of 35 million workers . as the shortage approaches and labor markets begin to tighten , one option available to increase the labor supply is to encourage people to stay in the labor force beyond traditional retirement ages , especially because people who are age 55 or older will constitute nearly a third of the total population â€” an increase of 46 percent over three decades . with the potential labor shortage and an aging population , increasing demands will be made on the workforce development system to help ensure that older workers are provided adequate opportunities to help address the anticipated labor shortage and meet employer needs for labor . concerned that existing federal employment and training programs may not be oriented towards the needs of older workers , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which people aged 55 and older are enrolled in federal employment and training programs and what services they receive , ( 2 ) how employment and training services are provided to older workers , and ( 3 ) how performance measures may have affected services for older workers . for the dislocated worker program , participants' earnings after completing the program are expressed as a percentage of their earnings before entering the program . approximately 12 percent of all older people who were not working and wanted a job were enrolled in federal employment and training programs ; most of these individuals received subsidized community service jobs or job search assistance , while a smaller number received training . for example , many scsep providers help participants create resumes and prepare for job interviews . in addition , many other older people may have received job search assistance through wia's core services without enrolling in the program and were not counted in program statistics . research findings on how older workers learn and whether they need special services have been inconsistent , and providers under different programs have taken various approaches to serving older workers . employment and training providers report that , as a result of wia's performance measures , they are less likely to enroll some older workers in services such as training . officials in six of the ten local workforce areas that we visited consider performance measures a barrier to enrolling older workers into wia because their high prior wages and / or their tendency to work part time negatively impact the area's performance . 6 ) . in light of concerns that older workers have unique employment characteristics that could adversely affect certain program outcomes and that older workers who need in - depth job search assistance and job training to remain in , or re - enter , the workforce may not receive such services , we recommend that the secretary of labor assess wia performance measures and make adjustments as necessary to eliminate the disincentive to enrolling older workers in wia . workforce investment act: coordination between tanf programs and one - stop centers is increasing , but challenges remain . workforce investment act: better guidance and revised funding formula would enhance dislocated worker program .
