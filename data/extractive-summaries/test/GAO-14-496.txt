because some virtual currency transactions provide greater anonymity than transactions using traditional payment systems , law enforcement and financial regulators have raised concerns about the use of virtual currencies for illegal activities . further , we interviewed officials from the following federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies: the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal the bureau of consumer financial protection ( also known as the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb ) ; the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) ; the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , including u.s. immigration and customs enforcement – homeland security investigations ( ice - hsi ) and the u.s. secret service ( secret service ) ; the department of justice ( doj ) , including the criminal division and two of its components — the asset forfeiture and money laundering section and computer crime and intellectual property section — and the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) ; the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , including the financial crimes enforcement network ( fincen ) and the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) ; the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) ; the national credit union administration ( ncua ) ; and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) . to examine the actions and collaborative efforts federal agencies have undertaken in response to the emergence of virtual currencies , we reviewed agency information , including fincen's regulatory guidance and administrative rulings on the applicability of bsa to virtual currency participants , testimony and written statements from the previously mentioned congressional hearings , written responses to congressional questions , intelligence assessments , a cfpb query of its consumer complaint database , and press releases.from the agencies listed previously to obtain further information on the actions they have taken to address the emergence of virtual currencies and their efforts to collaborate with other federal agencies on this issue . virtual currencies are financial innovations that have grown in number and popularity in recent years . in previous work , we described the latter type of virtual currencies as “open flow.” open - flow virtual currencies have received considerable attention from federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies , in part because these currencies interact with the real economy and because depository institutions ( for example , banks and credit unions ) may have business relationships with companies that exchange virtual currencies for government - issued currencies . other virtual currencies that have been created are not based on the bitcoin protocol . virtual currencies have presented these agencies with emerging challenges as they carry out their different responsibilities . because they operate over the internet , virtual currencies can be used globally to make payments and funds transfers across borders . for example , law enforcement may have to rely upon cooperation from international partners to conduct investigations , make arrests , and seize criminal assets . volatile prices . access . however , interagency working groups addressing virtual currencies have not focused on consumer protection and have generally not included cfpb . in addition , sec has taken enforcement action against an individual and entity that are alleged to have defrauded investors through a bitcoin - denominated ponzi scheme.investor alerts , has begun to review a registration statement from an entity that wants to offer virtual - currency - related securities , and is monitoring for potential securities law violations related to virtual currencies . these parties have included administrators and users of centralized virtual currency systems designed to facilitate money laundering or other crimes , parties who have used virtual currencies to buy or sell illicit goods and services online , and virtual currency exchanges and online payment processors operating without the proper licenses . also in may 2013 , law enforcement agencies shut down liberty reserve , a centralized virtual currency system that was allegedly designed and frequently used to facilitate money laundering and had its own virtual currency . federal agencies have also begun to discuss virtual currency issues in existing interagency working groups that address broader topics such as money laundering , electronic crimes , and the digital economy , as follows: the bsa advisory group — which is chaired by fincen and includes the prudential banking regulators , treasury , federal and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies , and industry representatives — has addressed virtual currency issues in a number of ways . fincen consulted with financial regulators and law enforcement agencies as it was formulating its march 2013 guidance on virtual currencies . cfpb might be a relevant participant in a broader set of collaborative efforts on virtual currencies because virtual currency systems provide a new way of making financial transactions , and cfpb's responsibilities include ensuring that consumers have timely and understandable information to make responsible decisions about financial further , cfpb's strategic goals include helping consumers transactions.understand the costs , risks , and tradeoffs of financial decisions and surfacing financial trends and emergent risks relevant to consumers . more recently , in february 2014 , mt . these bitcoins were worth more than $460 million when mt . gox filed for bankruptcy . incidents involving the use of virtual currencies for illicit purposes have made money laundering and other law enforcement issues primary concerns , and existing interagency working groups are primarily composed of agencies that share responsibilities for these matters . therefore , these efforts may not be consistent with key practices that can benefit interagency collaboration , such as including all relevant participants to ensure that their knowledge , skills , and abilities contribute to the outcomes of the effort . as a result , future interagency efforts may not be in a position to address consumer risks associated with virtual currencies in the most timely and effective manner . to help ensure that federal interagency collaboration on virtual currencies addresses emerging consumer protection issues , we recommend that the director of cfpb ( 1 ) identify which interagency working groups could help cfpb maintain awareness of these issues or would benefit from cfpb's participation ; and ( 2 ) decide , in coordination with the agencies already participating in these efforts , which ones cfpb should participate in .
