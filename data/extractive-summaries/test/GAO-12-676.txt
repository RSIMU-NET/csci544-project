in november 2007 , dod and va began pilot testing the integrated disability evaluation system ( ides ) at three military treatment facilities in the washington , d.c. area , and expanded the number of sites over time . this phase involves four stages: ( 1 ) the servicemember is counseled by a dod board liaison on what to expect during the ides process ; ( 2 ) the servicemember is counseled by a va case manager on what to expect during the ides process and medical exams are scheduled ; ( 3 ) medical exams are conducted according to va standards for exams for disability compensation by va , dod , or contractor physicians , and ( 4 ) exam results are used by the meb to identify conditions that limit the servicemember's ability to serve in the military.an impartial medical review by a physician not on the meb , or both . reported satisfaction rates for each phase are based on an average of responses to these four questions , and reported overall satisfaction with ides ( which is used to track the percent satisfied under the performance goal ) is an average of satisfaction rates for the three phases . since fiscal year 2008 , the average number of days for servicemember cases to be processed and receive benefits increased from 283 to 394 for active duty cases ( compared to the goal of 295 days ) and from 297 to 420 , for reserve component cases ( compared to the goal of 305 days ) ( see fig . along with increasing average processing times , the percent of ides cases awarded benefits within timeliness goals has steadily declined . at all the facilities we visited , officials told us dod board liaisons and va case managers had large case loads . in addition to timeliness , dod and va evaluate ides performance using the results of servicemember satisfaction surveys . dod is reconsidering its options for measuring customer satisfaction , but has yet to select a particular approach . the secretaries of dod and va have met several times since february 2011 to discuss progress in improving ides timeliness and have tasked their agencies to find ways to streamline the process so that the timeliness goals can be shortened . however , staff are not required to provide this information and rules and procedures for its use have not been established . improving local ides reporting capability: dod and va are implementing solutions to improve the ability of local military treatment facilities to track their ides cases , but multiple initiatives may result in redundant work efforts . officials noted that the air force and navy completed substantial efforts to correct the issues identified at that time , but army efforts continue . as a result , dod , with va's assistance , began a business process review to better understand how ides is operating and identify best practices for possible implementation . ultimately , according to dod officials , this business process review could lead to short - and long - term recommendations to improve ides performance , potentially including changes to the different steps in the ides process , performance goals , and staffing levels ; and possibly the procurement of a new information system to support process improvements . further , while va concurred with our recommendation that it work with dod to develop timeframes for completing the ides business process review and implementing any resulting recommendations , va stated that dod is leading the business process review , and therefore should develop the timeframes for completing the review . in conducting our review of the integrated disability evaluation system ( ides ) , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which the departments of defense ( dod ) and veterans affairs ( va ) are meeting ides performance goals , and ( 2 ) steps dod and va are taking to improve ides performance . while va manages vta , both dod and va staff enter data into vta , and the evaluation of ides data is primarily conducted by staff at dod's office of warrior care policy ( wcp ) . past gao worknumber of steps to follow up on past assessments of vta . similarly , the case for a median servicemember — whom we classified as “satisfied” with the overall ides process — was completed 15 percent more quickly and was 49 percent more likely to have met the timeliness goal than the median servicemember who was “dissatisfied.” the model estimates in table 11 confirm that the gao measure of satisfaction and timeliness ( time spent in ides ) are negatively related even when holding constant several other variables . military and veterans disability system: preliminary observations on evaluation and planned expansion of dod / va pilot . military disability system: improved oversight needed to ensure consistent and timely outcomes for reserve and active duty service members .
