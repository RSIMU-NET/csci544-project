the federal government is dramatically changing the manner in which it purchases goods and services . we included the following six civilian agencies in our review: the general services administration ( gsa ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of treasury , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . second , it requires developing accurate information on the numbers and locations of employees and their competencies and skills , data on the profile of the workforce , and performance goals and measures for human capital approaches . all six agencies that we reviewed have published or drafted human capital strategic plans for their overall workforces and are taking actions specifically targeted at strengthening their acquisition workforces . three agencies are developing specific acquisition workforce plans . also , acquisition rules and regulations are changing , making it difficult for agencies to predict what will be required of their acquisition workforce in years to come . for example , in addition to having a firm understanding of contracting rules and processes , acquisition workers will need to be adept at consulting and communicating with line managers , and they will need to be able to analyze business problems , identify different alternatives in purchasing goods or services , and assist in developing strategies in the early stages of the acquisition . another challenge for agencies is the lack of data on the characteristics of the current workforce ( e.g. , size of workforce ; deployment across the organization ; knowledge , skills and abilities ; attrition rates ; retirement rates ; etc. ) . nasa and va are developing their own management information systems to capture this data . to address this issue , it is developing an agencywide workforce planning system that will allow better management of the existing workforce and enable better strategic decisions about future workforce needs . status of overall workforce strategic plans ✔ agency has published / drafted human capital strategic plan ✔ defined vision / objectives ✔ identified competencies needed ✔ identified competencies present ✔ gap analysis ✔ transition plans status of acquisition workforce strategic plans ✔ separate human capital strategic plan for acquisition workforce ✔ defined vision / objectives ✔ identified competencies needed ✔ identified competencies present ✔ gap analysis ✔ transition plans efforts the elements of the acquisition career development program include an intern program , a training and certification program , and a program to develop future leaders of the acquisition workforce by providing educational and experiential opportunities . challenges hhs officials said they faced the following challenges in trying to address their future acquisition workforce needs: the lack of standardized equivalencies for acquisition training courses taken at other government agencies to help determine skill levels and competencies , a lack of data to identify / characterize the workforce , and a need to improve focus on the agency mission and develop competencies for effective acquisitions to support that mission . gao - 02-373sp . in order to leverage the experiences of federal agencies' efforts , including those of dod , to address future acquisition workforce needs , we recommend that the ofpp administrator work with procurement executives to ensure that the lessons learned from these efforts are shared with all federal agencies as they continue with their initiatives to improve the acquisition workforce . these six agencies accounted for about 72 percent of the federal dollars contracted by civilian ( non - dod ) agencies in fiscal year 2001 .
