in examining these concerns , you requested that we review several issues related to the postal service's development and marketing of new products and provide information on expenses and revenues associated with new products the service introduced in recent years . as agreed with the subcommittee , this report addresses the following objectives: identify the statutory and regulatory authorities and constraints covering all major groups of new products . provide information on the postal service marketing department's new product development process and determine , for three selected products , how closely that process was followed . provide information , including financial data , on all new postal and nonpostal products the service marketed and / or had under development during fiscal years 1995 , 1996 , and 1997 . h.r . 22 and the postal service's proposed reform legislation to determine how existing statutory and regulatory authorities and constraints governing new products may be affected by enactment of either of these legislative proposals . we gathered pertinent information from the service's finance department to develop profiles , including financial data , on the remaining new products the service marketed and / or had under development during fiscal years 1995 , 1996 , and 1997 and that had been publicly announced as of november 1997 . the postal service has broad statutory authority to develop , test , approve , and market a variety of new products , including new capital , philatelic , domestic and international postal , and nonpostal products . however , our analysis shows that the service is subject to at least three constraints . first , since it is the underlying statutory mission of the postal service to provide postal services to bind the nation together , the service needs to be able to explain how any new product it develops will further that mission . second , under its statutory authority , before marketing ( including test marketing ) a new domestic postal product , which necessarily involves classification of mail , the service must request a recommended decision from prc regarding the propriety of the service's proposed classification , rates , or fees for the new product . prior to issuing its recommended decision , prc is required to hold hearings on the service's proposal . finally , the service's ability to market new products can be constrained or influenced by congressional oversight , restrictions imposed during the appropriations process , or other legislative actions . adoption of h.r . 22 would provide the service with broader latitude to test market experimental postal products . the requirement to request a recommended decision from prc before marketing a new product applies , however , only to new domestic postal products . a postal product would be specifically defined as “any service that provides for the physical delivery of letters , printed matter , or packages weighing up to 70 pounds , including physical acceptance , collection , sorting , or transportation services ancillary thereto.” a nonpostal product would be defined as “any product or service offered by the postal service ( or that could have been offered by the postal service under section 404 ( a ) ( 6 ) , as last in effect before the date of enactment of the postal modernization act of 1998 ) that is not a postal product.” having specifically distinguished between postal and nonpostal products , h.r . additionally , to facilitate the process of developing and introducing new products and to ensure effective management control , the service developed a formalized system of checks and balances that requires top management buy - in at critical stages of the development process . under the new product development process , new products initiated by the marketing department's new business initiatives and products group go through four distinct stages: the ( 1 ) concept stage , ( 2 ) business plan stage , ( 3 ) test stage , and ( 4 ) implementation stage . total revenues and expenses reported for the 19 products , through fiscal year 1997 , were $148.8 million and $233.5 million , respectively , resulting in a net loss of $84.7 million .
