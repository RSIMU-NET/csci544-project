medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health services for most persons 65 years of age and older and for most permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65 . part b , the supplementary medical insurance program , covers a broad range of medical services including physician services , laboratory services , durable medical equipment , and outpatient hospital services . part c ( also known as medicare advantage , or ma ) provides private plan options , such as managed care , for beneficiaries who are enrolled in both parts a and b . part d provides optional outpatient prescription drug coverage . in general , the total payment received by a provider for covered services provided to a medicare beneficiary is composed of two parts: a program payment from medicare plus any beneficiary cost - sharing that is required . because of its rapid growth , both in terms of aggregate dollars and as a share of the federal budget , the medicare program has been a major focus of legislative attention , as outlined below . however , even when payments are frozen ( as has been the case in some years with payments to acute care hospitals , inpatient rehabilitation facilities , long term care hospitals , and with the physician fee schedule ) , medicare spending continues to increase each year as the number of beneficiaries increases , and the number and complexity of services becomes greater . 111-148 as amended , aca ) , is estimated to achieve substantial program savings through , permanent reductions in the maximum amount paid to ma plans , and reductions in the annual updates to medicare's fee - for - service ( ffs ) providers ( other than physicians' services ) , among other provisions . second , in general , it specifies that the adjustment allows for negative payment updates and as such , payment rates for a year may be less than for a preceding year . though the aca payment changes to medicare providers and plans is expected to slow the growth in medicare spending and extend the solvency of the hospital insurance ( part a ) trust fund , some have suggested that such a policy may not be sustainable in the long run , "without unprecedented improvements in health care provider productivity. . ipab is prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020 and is also prohibited from recommending changes in premiums , benefits , eligibility , and taxes or other changes that would result in rationing . unlike other agencies that advise congress , ipab's recommendations are to be automatically implemented unless congress acts . payments for most medicare benefits will be subject to a maximum 2% reduction each year from march 2013 through 2021 . in the case of medicare parts c and d , reductions are made to the monthly payments made to the private plans that administer these parts of the program . provider - specific sequestration adjustments are not reflected in the tables that follow because they are temporary adjustments to payment systems . this report provides a guide to medicare payment rules by type of benefit . the first column in each table lists the type of payments that may be received by the provider ( e.g. , the separate operating and capital payments paid to short - term general hospitals under the prospective payment system as described in medicare payment policies ( table 1 ) , or lists subcategories of providers under the general provider category ( such as the different types of non - physician providers that are all listed in table 7 ) . the second column of each table discusses the general policy for determining payments while column three describes how the general payment amounts are updated , or adjusted each year ( e.g. , amounts may be updated by a measure of inflation , economy - wide productivity , or statutorily specified reductions to updates ) . this report is updated to reflect the most recent legislative changes to the program and payment updates available through january 2013 .
