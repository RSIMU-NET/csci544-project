since the deepwater horizon oil spill began on april 20 , 2010 , congress has given much attention to the compensatory liability provisions in the oil pollution act . congress has also addressed the compensatory liability provisions of the jones act and the death on the high seas act in connection with the deaths of 11 workers when the deepwater horizon platform exploded on april 20 . this report summarizes selected federal civil and criminal penalty provisions that may be found violated in connection with the gulf spill and related worker fatalities . it does not purport to be exhaustive . crs stresses that it has no knowledge of the facts surrounding the gulf spill other than what has been publicly reported ; hence the provisions listed here are only an informed guess as to those that ultimately may be found violated . as for the migratory bird treaty act and occupational safety and health act , the outer continental shelf lands act broadly declares that the laws of the united states are extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf , "and to all artificial islands , and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed" to explore for or produce resources . at the outset , the reader should note that the penalty ceilings stated in the program statutes listed here may not be the applicable ones . this act requires federal agencies to adjust at least once every four years the maximum ( and minimum , if any ) dollar amount on civil penalties within their jurisdiction to reflect movement in the consumer price index . by whatever authority imposed , these inflation adjustments to the program - statute maximums are indicated in the following list by the phrase " ( adjusted to [dollar amount] ) . . as for ceilings on criminal penalties , the criminal fine improvements act ( cfia ) often applies . under this statute , the maximum criminal fine a court may impose may be up to the greater of the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense or various alternative ceilings in the cfia . on december 15 , 2010 , the u.s. department of justice filed a civil complaint against multiple parties alleged to be responsible for the gulf spill â€” the only suit it has filed thus far related to the gulf spill .
