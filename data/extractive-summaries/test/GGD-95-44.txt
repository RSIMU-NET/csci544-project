this report responds to your request that we review the internal revenue service's ( irs ) processes for handling undeliverable mail . you asked us to identify the amount of undeliverable mail and reasons why some of the mail irs sends to taxpayers was undeliverable and the impact nondelivery of this mail had on taxpayers and irs . the postal service may not deliver or forward mail , and mail is returned to irs . irs incorrectly records taxpayers' addresses in its databases . although irs could not provide us precise estimates of the total costs of undeliverable mail to irs — either in added costs of operations or in lost revenues — a few studies have attempted to measure component parts of the overall cost . a 1992 national office quality improvement project reported that irs had at least 1.2 million invalid business addresses in irs computer files , resulting in about 2.25 million pieces of undeliverable mail annually . the recommendations included ( 1 ) developing standardized procedures for processing undeliverable mail throughout irs and making the collection function's automated systems available to other service center functions ; ( 2 ) testing alternative methods for taxpayers to provide address changes to irs , such as the use of a tear - off return stub on notices ; and ( 3 ) adopting procedures to help ensure that taxpayers' addresses would be accurately updated in its databases . although it is unlikely that the problem of undeliverable mail can be totally eliminated , irs needs to give undeliverable mail more attention because it adversely affects operations and can cause undue burden on taxpayers . irs is aware of the need to better manage its undeliverable mail and is considering ways to better deal with this mail . the implementation of this recommendation could help irs implement its planned centralized unit in each service center to process all undeliverable mail starting with the initial occurrence of returned mail .
