in 2015 , more than 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving large trucks , the majority of whom were either in another vehicle or were pedestrians or bicyclists . with inspection and crash information , fmcsa uses its safety measurement system ( sms ) to generate a percentile ranking of a carrier's safety performance relative to other carriers in several different categories . the fixing america's surface transportation act ( fast act ) included a provision for us to examine the cost and feasibility of establishing a system for self - reporting en route equipment problems for commercial motor carriers , and report by december 4 , 2016 . this report examines ( 1 ) potential safety impacts of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs for commercial motor carriers and their drivers , and ( 2 ) factors that could affect the feasibility and cost of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs . carriers were selected for diversity in fleet size and haul distance . views we gathered from these stakeholders are not generalizable to all industry and safety groups , motor carriers , or drivers . we assumed that a self - reporting system would: apply only to problems identified during a driver's day , that is between the pre - trip inspection and the end of the day when the driver vehicle inspection report is completed ; not apply to equipment problems that would result in out - of - service require drivers to report equipment problems and repairs through a telephone hotline or internet website or other electronic platform ; require repairs to be made before the beginning of the next day on duty ( e.g. , within a day of when the problem was reported , if the driver ended his trip that evening and planned another trip the following day ) ; still result in a carrier receiving a violation for the equipment problem if pulled over for a roadside inspection , but once a self - reported equipment problem was repaired within the requisite time frame and fmcsa was so notified , fmcsa would exclude the violation from the carrier's relative safety ranking ( i.e. , basic percentile for vehicle maintenance ) ; and not prompt fmcsa to take action if a carrier or driver self - reported an equipment problem , but never received a violation for that equipment problem . the office of management and ( omb ) and the department of transportation ( dot ) provide guidance on estimating a program's societal impact , such as its health and safety benefits , through a benefit - cost analysis . representatives from five of six industry and safety associations we interviewed said they would be unlikely to support a self - reporting system as outlined above . for example , three drivers thought a self - reporting system could potentially yield some safety benefits if it incentivized drivers to do more thorough pre - trip or en route inspections . on the other hand , three carriers and two other drivers we interviewed thought a self - reporting system could potentially yield some negative safety impacts if it incentivized some drivers to delay or avoid making repairs for problems they had self - reported . fmcsa officials stated they could design a self - reporting system to be compatible with the agency's existing it systems . creating a self - reporting system could place new demands on fmcsa's information technology resources . for example , one industry group thought fmcsa should focus on improving its dataq system , which allows carriers to challenge , and correct as appropriate , violations appearing on their records . while we cannot estimate costs for the type of self - reporting system described in this report with any degree of confidence , fmcsa broadly estimated that a self - reporting system would cost between $5 and $10 million to establish and operate for the first year . dot provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
