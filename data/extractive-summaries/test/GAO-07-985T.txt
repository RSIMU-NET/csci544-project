i am pleased to be here today to provide the subcommittee with information on the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) process for providing senior executive service ( ses ) performance awards ( bonuses ) . we have also identified key practices of effective performance management for the ses , which include the linkage or “line of sight” between individual performance and organizational success , the importance of linking pay to individual and organizational performance , and the need to make meaningful distinctions in performance . in 2006 , we identified certain principles for executive pay plans that should be considered to attract and retain the quality and quantity of executive leadership necessary to address 21st century challenges , including that they be sensitive to hiring and retention trends ; reflect responsibilities , knowledge , skills , and contributions ; and be competitive . my comments today will focus on ( 1 ) va's policies , procedures , and guidelines for evaluating and awarding ses member bonuses , including the composition and responsibility of va's performance review boards ( prb ) , which recommend ses bonuses ; ( 2 ) the number and amount of bonuses awarded for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 by va headquarters and field locations and compared to the amount of bonuses given to ses members at other major cabinet - level departments ; and ( 3 ) the office of personnel management's ( opm ) and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) roles in certifying va's and other agencies' ses performance appraisal system . va uses four prbs that review and make recommendations on ses members' ratings , awards , and pay adjustments based on these performance plans . members are appointed to the boards on the basis of the positions held , and consideration is given to those positions where the holder would have knowledge about the broadest group of executives . according to va policy , bonuses are generally awarded only to those rated outstanding or excellent and who have demonstrated significant individual and organizational achievements during the appraisal period . opm and omb evaluate agencies' ses and senior - level employee performance appraisal systems against nine certification criteria jointly developed by the two agencies . our review of va's requirements for ses performance plans as represented in both its 2006 submission and 2007 draft submission to opm shows that va made changes to the requirements for its performance plans to reflect greater emphasis on measurable results . provisional certification lasts for 1 calendar year . in 2006 , the letter from opm to va discussing its decision to grant the va provisional certification rather than full certification , opm stated that while the va “system met certification criteria , clear alignment and measurable results must be evident in all plans across the entire agency.” in addition , opm said that it expected to see “well over 50 percent of an executive's performance plan focused on business results” and that va “needs to ensure its 2007 executive performance plans weight business results appropriately.” va officials told us that the 2007 submission is in draft and they expect to submit it to opm by the june 30 , 2007 , deadline .
