we are pleased to be here today to discuss medicare's skilled nursing facility ( snf ) , home health care , and inpatient rehabilitation benefits and the administration's forthcoming legislative proposals related to them . earlier discharges from hospitals led to the substitution of days spent in snfs for what in the past would have been the last few days of hospital care ; use of ancillary services , such as physical therapy , in snfs has increased , and specific controls for these services have not been implemented ; rapid growth in the number of inpatient rehabilitation beds available and use of these beds by beneficiaries , as well as the likelihood of some substitution of rehabilitation days for general hospital days , led to higher expenditures for inpatient rehabilitation ; and a diminution of administrative controls over the benefits , resulting at least in part from fewer resources being available for such controls , reduced the likelihood of inappropriately submitted claims being denied . the administration's major proposals for both snfs and home health care are designed to give the providers of these services increased incentives to operate efficiently by moving them from a cost reimbursement to a prospective payment system . what remains unclear about these proposals is whether an appropriate unit of service can be defined for calculating prospective payments and whether hcfa's databases are adequate for it to set reasonable rates . administration officials also have discussed their intention to propose in the future a coordinated payment system for all post - acute care as a method to give providers efficiency incentives . this concept has appeal , but we have concerns about it similar to those we have for snf and home health prospective payments . finally , the administration is proposing that snfs be required to bill for all services provided to their medicare residents rather than allowing outside suppliers to bill . this latter proposal has merit because it would make control over the use of ancillary services significantly easier .
