in 2003 , most hospitals — over 80 percent — demonstrated that they met the applicable conditions of participation through accreditation from the joint commission . as such , the joint commission is not required to periodically reapply to cms for this approval . as a result , the two organizations have acknowledged the need to ensure that jcr's consultative services do not affect , and are perceived not to affect , the independence of the joint commission's accreditation process , either through the improper sharing of information about facilities using jcr's services with joint commission accreditation staff or through any implication that using jcr's services will provide an undue advantage in the joint commission accreditation process . both of the organizations attempted to address these concerns through the development of a “firewall” — policies designed to establish a barrier between the organizations to prevent conflicts of interest and sharing of facility - specific information . for example , the firewall is intended to prevent jcr from sharing the names of its hospital clients with the joint commission . in this report , we describe ( 1 ) how the joint commission and jcr are related to one another through their governance structure and operations , and ( 2 ) the significant steps both organizations have taken to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , obtained through their hospital accreditation and consulting activities , since the creation of jcr . we also interviewed board members from the joint commission and jcr and reviewed documents from both organizations , including documents related to the organizations' financial relationship . to provide information on the significant steps taken by the joint commission and jcr since jcr's creation to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , we reviewed relevant policies developed by the two organizations . the joint commission , a nonprofit organization founded in 1951 , was created to provide voluntary health care accreditation for hospitals . in addition , jcr manages all joint commission publications and educational activities , while the joint commission provides various support services and some management oversight to jcr . v. ) cms did not comment on our findings or concluding observations . both the joint commission and cms provided us with technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . we examined the relationship between the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) and joint commission resources , inc. ( jcr ) as it relates to the independence of the joint commissions' hospital accreditation process from jcr's hospital consulting services .
