under the constitution , the house alone has the power to formally chargeâthat is , impeachâa federal official . the impeachment process may be initiated as the result of various actions and events , including the receipt and referral of information from an outside source , investigations by congressional committees under their general authority , or the introduction of articles of impeachment in the form of a house resolution . third , the full house considers the articles of impeachment and , if they are adopted , appoints managers from the committee to present the articles in the senate . as discussed in detail below , the house relies upon many of its usual procedures to consider the resolution explicitly initiating an investigation , conduct the investigation , and consider the articles of impeachment . if a resolution authorizing an impeachment investigation was introduced through the hopper and referred to the rules committee , that committee would then choose whether to report the resolution to the full house for consideration . if reported , the resolution would be privileged , which means a member could call it up on the floor , though only at the direction of the rules committee . the resolution would then be considered under the hour rule , a method of considering legislation in the house that permits members to speak for up to an hourâbut also allows a numerical majority to vote to end debate and limit the opportunity for amendment . a motion to recommit the resolution with or without instructions could be offered after the previous question was ordered , but it would not be debatable . the house could also , however , choose to consider the resolution under any of its other regular processes , including suspension of the rules ( requiring a two - thirds vote for passage ) , a rule from the rules committee ( requiring only a majority vote ) , or unanimous consent . the rules of the house since 1975 have granted committees the power to subpoena witnesses and materials , administer oaths , and meet at any time within the united statesâpowers that were previously granted through resolutions providing blanket investigatory authorities that were agreed to at the start of a congress or through authorizing resolutions for each impeachment investigation . if the house does approve an authorizing resolution , then in addition to the rules committee , the judiciary committee can report an original resolution authorizing an impeachment investigation if impeachment resolutions have been referred to the committee . in the case of the most recent authorization of a presidential impeachment inquiry , the judiciary committee reported such a resolution , and the full house debated it . the resolution was privileged for immediate consideration . in late 1973 , the house agreed to another resolution that provided for additional expenses of the committee , and floor debate and the report from the committee on house administration indicate that the funds were intended in part for the impeachment inquiry . it has not been unusual for the judiciary committee to authorize subcommittees or to create task forces to conduct impeachment investigations , and in that case the full committee would establish the authority of the subcommittee or task force . in recent practice , the house has appointed managers by agreeing to a house resolution . the house also , by resolution , informs the senate that it has adopted articles of impeachment and authorizes the managers to conduct the trial in the senate . a full description of senate procedures in an impeachment trial is beyond the scope of this report .
