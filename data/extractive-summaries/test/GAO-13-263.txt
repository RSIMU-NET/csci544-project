however , rising costs and other budget priorities have slowed the construction program . we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which the judiciary's capital - planning process aligns with leading practices and provides information needed for informed decision making and ( 2 ) the extent to which courthouse projects recommended for funding in fiscal years 2014 to 2018 were assessed under the judiciary's current capital - planning process . the amp process , which the judiciary has applied to about 67 percent of its courthouses , represents progress by the judiciary in aligning its capital - planning process with leading capital - planning practices , but the document the judiciary uses to request courthouse construction projects lacks transparency and key information . figure 2 summarizes leading capital - planning practices and our assessment of the extent to which the amp process aligns with those practices . two courthouse projects illustrate how the amp process has changed the way the judiciary evaluates its need for new courthouses . the plan does not provide decision makers with detailed information about proposed construction projects or how they were selected . as a result , there is a risk that funding decisions could be made without complete and accurate information . judiciary officials said that they did not want to delay the projects or force them to undergo a second capital - planning process review because the judiciary had already approved the projects . the change in the rankings of the 4 projects calls into question the extent to which the projects remaining on the 5-year plan represent the judiciary's most urgent projects and whether proceeding with these projects while hundreds of amp reviews remain to be done represents the most fiscally responsible path . we recognize that conducting amp reviews of the 10 projects on the 5-year plan would involve additional costs ; however , not conducting amp reviews on these projects could involve spending billions of dollars over the next 20 years on courthouses that may not be the most urgent projects . for example , the amp process introduces a criterion for when new construction is warranted — when two or more courtrooms are needed — but the 5-year plan does not show how this criterion applies to the recommended projects . in the meantime , future 5- year plans should provide comprehensive information on new courthouse projects , including: a ) a summary of why each project qualifies for new construction and is more urgent than other projects , including information about how the amp process and other judiciary criteria for new courthouse construction were applied to the project ; b ) complete cost estimates of each project ; and c ) the alternatives to a new project that were considered , including courtroom - sharing , and why alternatives were deemed insufficient . in addition , 10 of the 12 projects on the current 5-year plan do not qualify for new construction under the amp process . to assess recent courthouse projects recommended for funding under the judiciary's current capital - planning process , we reviewed the judiciary's documents detailing the projects recommended for funding for fiscal years 2009 through 2018 , called 5-year plans , and other documents on: congressional authorizations and funding appropriations for courthouse projects ; judiciary information on courts and courthouses ; and gsa information on federal buildings , existing and planned federal courthouses , courthouse design , and federal historic property . 3 . 12 .
