title iv - b of the social security act , comprised of two subparts , is the primary source of federal funding for services to help families address problems that lead to child abuse and neglect and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families . my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) states' use of title iv - b funds in providing a wide array of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and foster care placements , as well as other child welfare services ; ( 2 ) factors that hinder states' ability to protect children from abuse and neglect ; and ( 3 ) hhs's role in helping states to overcome the challenges they face in protecting children from abuse and neglect . those findings were based on multiple methodologies , including a survey of child welfare directors on states' use of title iv - b funds ; an analysis of 600 exit interview documents completed by staff who severed their employment from 17 state , 40 county , and 19 private child welfare agencies ; and a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia regarding their experiences in developing and using information systems and their ability to report data to hhs . in particular , low salaries hinder agencies' ability to attract potential child welfare workers and to retain those already in the profession . in addition , several factors affect the states' ability to collect and report reliable adoption , foster care , and child abuse and neglect data , including insufficient caseworker training , inaccurate and incomplete data entry , and technical challenges reporting the data . although hhs plays a role in monitoring child welfare programs , additional oversight or technical assistance could assist states in meeting the needs of children served by child welfare agencies . for example , hhs's oversight of title iv - b focuses primarily on states' overall child welfare systems and outcomes , but the agency provides relatively little oversight specific to the services provided under title iv - b subpart 1 . in addition , hhs plays a limited role in states' workforce activities by offering partial reimbursement for training expenses and managing discretionary grant programs . acf is responsible for the administration and oversight of federal funding to states for child welfare services under titles iv - b and iv - e. hhs headquarters staff are responsible for developing appropriate policies and procedures for states to follow in terms of obtaining and using federal child welfare funds , while staff in hhs's 10 regional offices and 10 national resource centers provide guidance and technical assistance to improve child welfare services nationwide . in our september 2003 report on title iv - b , we found that states use these funds to provide a wide variety of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and foster care placements , as well as services to help children in foster care and their parents ; however , relatively few subpart 1 dollars are used to provide family support and family preservation services , while the majority of subpart 2 funds are used for these purposes . according to these caseworkers , high turnover rates and staffing shortages leave remaining staff with insufficient time to establish relationships with children and families and make the necessary decisions to ensure safe and stable permanent placements . hhs disagreed with our second recommendation , stating that it believes that its level of oversight is commensurate with the scope and intent of the program and minimizes states' reporting requirements . to improve the reliability of state - reported child welfare data , we recommended in our july 2003 sacwis report that the secretary of hhs consider , in addition to hhs's recent efforts to improve afcars data , ways to enhance the guidance and assistance offered to states to help them overcome the key challenges in collecting and reporting child welfare data .
