this report responds in part to your request for information concerning personnel management in the district of columbia courts . specifically , this report provides information about staffing and workload levels for the courts from 1989 through 1998 , assesses how the courts evaluate the sufficiency of the levels of nonjudicial staff who work on processing and disposition of cases , and compares the d.c. courts' staffing methodology to other available methodologies . fte levels fluctuated between 1,231 and 1,187 during the period from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1997 . the rise in staffing levels in the court system , according to the executive officer of the d.c. courts , was due to an increase from 51 to 59 superior court judges in 1990 , the assumption by the courts ( from the d.c. department of administrative services ) of responsibility for janitorial services in court buildings in 1993 , and the assumption by the courts ( from the d.c. department of public works ) of responsibility for all maintenance of court buildings in 1996 . the clerk of the court of appeals said that , as with the superior court , staffing decisions are made on a functional basis for each division of the court , rather than for the court as a whole . the federal court system and some state court systems use formulas based on court workload data to determine satisfactory levels of staffing and resources . such work units consider tasks associated with the nature and types of cases , given a standard rate of efficiency ( how much time and resources such cases should take ) . while d.c. court officials apparently consider caseload data in judging whether staffing levels are adequate , they have not measured the amount of time required by case processing staff to process differing types of cases nor used such data to determine whether the size of the courts' workforce is inadequate , adequate , or excessive for the work of the courts . the courts commented that our presentation of workload data did not present a complete picture in that it did not reflect the causal factors that account for increased backlog .
