federal agencies support research or research and development ( r&d ) projects at small businesses through the small business innovation research ( sbir ) and small business technology transfer ( sttr ) programs . these awards have supported development and commercialization of innovative technologies . this report covers fiscal year 2014 and addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies met sbir and sttr program spending requirements , ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies and sba complied with certain program reporting requirements , ( 3 ) the potential effects of basing the spending requirements for the programs on an agency's total r&d budget authority instead of its extramural r&d obligations , and ( 4 ) what is known about how much agencies spent to administer the programs . to examine the extent to which participating agencies and sba complied with certain reporting requirements for fiscal year 2014 , we compared information in the reports that agencies submit to sba to describe the methodology for calculating their extramural r&d obligations , referred to as their methodology reports , with requirements in the small business act and program policy directives . we also reviewed the total amounts the 7 agencies estimated they would spend on the administrative pilot program in fiscal year 2014 as described in their proposals for the program , calculated the total amount that these agencies spent on the administrative pilot program in fiscal year 2014 , and compared these numbers . officials at the department of commerce ( commerce ) told us that they were unable to meet their sbir spending requirement in fiscal year 2014 because they received more funding for their sbir program than they had planned for , in addition to sbir funding that they carried over from fiscal year 2013 from supplemental appropriations for superstorm sandy , and they did not include enough topics in their solicitation for applications to allow them to make enough awards to meet the spending requirement . in fiscal year 2014 , 5 of the 11 participating agencies — commerce , dhs , the department of education ( education ) , epa , and usda — provided some or all of the dollar amounts associated with each of their exclusions . however , in fiscal year 2014 , dot itemized exclusions but did not report the dollar amounts excluded . sba is not required to request the reports from agencies . agency officials identified several benefits and drawbacks that changing the calculation methodology could have on their agencies' sbir and sttr programs . for example , if the spending requirements were calculated based on an agency's total r&d budget authority rather than its extramural r&d obligations using the same percentages and participation thresholds defined in current law , we estimate that total spending requirements in fiscal year 2014 for the sbir and sttr programs would have increased from $2.3 billion to $4.2 billion , an increase of roughly $1.9 billion , or 83 percent , based on our analysis of budget authority data and data submitted to sba . seven agencies — dod , doe , hhs , nsf , usda , commerce , and dot — participated in the administrative pilot program in fiscal year 2014 , and these agencies reported spending $19.1 million on administrative and oversight activities as part of the program . more agencies participated in the administrative pilot program in fiscal year 2014 than in the previous year , but some agencies identified potential constraints that limited their participation , including the temporary nature of the program and the requirement to expend funds only on new activities . until sba submits its fiscal year 2014 report and includes information on the administrative pilot program , sba and congress will not have the information they need to know whether the administrative pilot program has met its goals or whether there are constraints to participating , such as those that we identified . restoring this guidance could help sba fully evaluate and report to congress on the accuracy of agencies' methodology reports . third , because sba has not submitted a report on the administrative pilot program to congress for fiscal year 2014 , it has not evaluated the effects of potential constraints on agencies' ability to participate in the pilot program for that year and the steps needed to address these constraints . to ensure full compliance with sbir and sttr spending and reporting requirements and improve participation in the administrative pilot program , we recommend that the sba administrator take the following three actions: review sba guidance regarding when an agency is required to start up an sbir or sttr program , and if necessary , update the guidance to provide greater clarity to agencies with r&d obligations greater than the thresholds for participating . the data that the agencies submitted to the small business administration ( sba ) indicate that four of the five participating agencies spent amounts for the small business technology transfer ( sttr ) program that met or exceeded their fiscal year 2014 spending requirements , while 1 agency did not .
