this report responds to your request of july 21 , 1997 , that we review gpo's procedures involving the management of its inventory of publications that it determines to be excess , particularly its management of a major inventory reduction of excess publications that took place in september 1996 . in may 1996 , financial projections indicated that the sales program expected a substantial loss for fiscal year 1996 , the first such loss in 15 years . superintendent of documents policy no . he also said that he wanted to identify and dispose of as much excess inventory as possible in fiscal year 1996 rather than in later years , when it otherwise would have been identified , disposed of , and charged to expense . the responsible ims said he knew that in the past the senate historian's office had inquired about the status of the senate history volumes on several occasions and that , while he recalled the previous inquiries by the senate historian's office , he did not recall being told in june 1996 that the senate historian's office wanted any excess copies . at our recommendation , the superintendent of documents put his oral instructions in writing in august 1997 . the superintendent said that gpo did not have a systematic process for identifying or designating such publications but that , in response to our recommendation , gpo would develop a formal system for identifying publications that should remain in inventory indefinitely . in a may 6 , 1997 , letter to senator byrd , the public printer said that , on the basis of a study gpo had done , it was more cost - effective to maintain an adequate inventory of sales publications based on their projected life cycle and to reprint if necessary , than to hold excess copies of publications in inventory . because of the erroneous belief of the superintendent of documents , who heads gpo's sales program , that gpo had to physically remove excess publications from the gpo warehouse by september 30 , 1996 , in order to record them as an expense for fiscal year 1996 , and because of his express instruction to disregard policies and procedures , gpo staff disposed of about 2,100 different publications without first contacting the issuing agencies of those publications . as agreed with your offices , our objectives were to determine the facts surrounding the september 1996 inventory reduction ; whether it followed existing policies and procedures ; and the fate of the 3,258 copies of the senate 1789-1989 , a four - volume set written by senator byrd , that were destroyed as part of that reduction .
