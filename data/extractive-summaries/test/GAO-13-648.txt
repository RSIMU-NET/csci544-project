l. no . additionally , the act directed gao to submit annual evaluations of dod's reports to congress within 90 days of receiving these reports from dod . to determine whether dod acted on gao recommendations to improve its report submissions and what opportunities , if any , exist for dod to improve future reporting , we identified prior gao recommendations and reviewed the status of dod's actions to implement those recommendations in its reporting submissions on sustainable ranges . over time , we found that as dod reported annually on its progress in implementing its comprehensive plan , it continued to improve its sustainable ranges reports , and it has reported on the actions it has taken in response to prior gao recommendations . we found that the 2012 sustainable ranges report met the annual statutory reporting requirements for dod to describe its progress in implementing its sustainable ranges plan and any actions taken or to be taken in addressing training constraints caused by limitations on the use of military lands , marine areas , or airspace . these recommendations were to: ( 1 ) develop an integrated training range database that identifies available training resources , specific capacities and capabilities , and training constraints caused by limitations on the use of training ranges , which could be continuously updated and shared among the services at all command levels , regardless of service ownership ; and ( 2 ) develop a readiness reporting system to reflect the impact on readiness caused by training constraints due to limitations on the use of training ranges . in its 2013 report , dod provided updates to several elements of the plan required by the act . these elements include ( 1 ) proposals to enhance training range capabilities and address any shortfalls , ( 2 ) goals and milestones for tracking progress implementing dod's sustainment plan , and ( 3 ) projected funding requirements for implementing planned actions , among others . all of the military services reported that their range assessment data had not significantly changed from the 2012 report . dod has developed seven goals in support of this plan . the elements of dod's 2013 sustainable ranges report describe the department's progress in implementing its comprehensive plan and addressing training constraints at its ranges , thus meeting the annual reporting requirements of the act . additionally , dod created a range visibility tool within its range scheduler system to enable a user to query and identify the availability of training ranges across the army , marine corps , and navy . future improvements include plans to provide a link to the air force range scheduling system to optimize utilization of training resources . to determine whether the department of defense's ( dod ) 2013 sustainable ranges report met the reporting requirements specified in section 366 ( a ) of the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 , as amended , we reviewed the report and compared it with those requirements .
