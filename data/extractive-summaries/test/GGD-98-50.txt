unicor has , in my opinion , exploited their special status instead of making changes which would make them more efficient.” in the same article , the deputy commander of dla's defense personnel and support center , who wrote a letter of complaint about fpi to a congressman in may 1996 , was cited as saying that fpi's prices were higher than commercial companies' prices by an average of 13 percent and “there is no practicable way to terminate a contract or recoup monies that would normally be owed by a commercial firm.” fpi and its proponents have acknowledged that there may have been problems with some fpi products in the past but claim it has made efforts to improve its products and delivery performance . furthermore , it ( 1 ) remains vulnerable to assertions by its critics that federal customers are dissatisfied and , in turn , should no longer be required to buy fpi products ; and ( 2 ) possibly misses opportunities to improve its operations by having better data on how federal customers view its performance . however , these systems are not designed to systematically obtain feedback on timeliness , price , and quality from federal customers . fpi's manager of information systems told us that fpi does not have a management information system that tracks customer satisfaction . major customer agencies — dla , fss , army , ssa , and the postal service — consider price when awarding contracts and monitor factors like quality and timeliness while administering contracts for all vendors , including fpi . it should be recognized , however , that the contracting officer's leverage in resolving procurement problems is different for fpi from the leverage the contracting officer has for private sector vendors since the rules that typically govern contracts with commercial vendors do not apply to fpi . in this regard , on september 13 , 1993 , the acting attorney general issued a legal opinion which held that fpi , as a seller of goods to the federal government , is not covered by the far , and must be treated under its authorizing legislation and far subpart 8.6 . furthermore , agencies cannot use past performance information to deny awarding a contract to fpi because , under the law , fpi is a mandatory source of supply for products . however , at fpi's discretion , they can use it to negotiate with fpi on factors such as product quality or delivery time frames , or to seek a waiver from fpi so that they can buy from a commercial vendor that can better meet their quality or delivery requirements . in order to institutionalize within fpi an assessment of overall customer satisfaction and the use of this assessment to measure and improve performance , we recommend that the director , bureau of prisons , direct fpi's chief operating officer to ( 1 ) examine available approaches to collect and use customer satisfaction data to determine the most cost - effective approaches for fpi ; ( 2 ) develop a plan for collecting customer satisfaction data that would allow for supportable conclusions about federal customers' views on timeliness , price , and quality ; ( 3 ) develop a timetable for implementing the plan ; and ( 4 ) set performance goals for the levels of customer satisfaction that fpi wants to attain and measure results against these goals . our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) if federal prison industries ( fpi ) has data , either from its management information systems or other sources , to support overall conclusions about how federal customers who buy and use its products and services view their timeliness , price , and quality ; and ( 2 ) whether agencies who are among the largest buyers of fpi products and services monitor fpi's performance the same way they do commercial vendors in terms of timeliness , price , and quality .
