concerned about the performance of the federal agencies in handling this incident , you asked us to determine the ( 1 ) basis for the federal agencies' decisions to require producers to demonstrate that their food products did not contain levels of dioxin above one part per trillion ; ( 2 ) federal agencies' effectiveness in working together to make decisions to address the problem of dioxin - contaminated feed and in communicating their decisions to the affected state agencies , producers , and processors ; and ( 3 ) impact of the food safety system on the handling of this dioxin incident . fsis and fda have the authority to prevent adulterated products from reaching consumers . industry officials with whom we spoke informed us that fda's and fsis' actions did not , to their knowledge , result in the widespread destruction of beef , pork , poultry , or fish products , but some eggs had to be destroyed . these delays increased producers' costs . fda and fsis requested the producers and processors to halt the distribution of the affected food products with dioxin levels above one part per trillion because of their concern about the potential risk to human health . although scientists have not yet determined the level at which dioxin may pose a risk to human health , the agencies chose a level of dioxin that is somewhat higher than the background level in food products to distinguish the food products affected by the use of adulterated feed from other food products . according to these officials , fda did not provide any evidence to support the decision to request that products with a dioxin level of one part per trillion be halted . the agencies involved in addressing the dioxin incident had to overcome the inherent inefficiencies associated with the current food safety system , in which responsibility for ensuring food safety is spread among several agencies . as we have reported on numerous occasions , this fragmented food safety system necessitates extensive coordination efforts to minimize wasteful duplication of effort , prevent gaps in regulatory coverage , and avoid conflicting actions . however , as we have stated , the food safety and inspection service's guidance to the affected producers and processors was impractical because it did not provide enough time for some processors to test and receive results before the agency's deadline and because it was not delivered to the producers in a timely manner so that they were aware of the steps that needed to be taken before they could deliver their products to market .
