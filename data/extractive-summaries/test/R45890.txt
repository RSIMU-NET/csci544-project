congress established the national wild and scenic rivers system ( nwsrs ) in 1968 through the wild and scenic rivers act ( wsra ) . the wsra established a policy of preserving designated free - flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations . the wsra established three classes of wsrs , reflecting the characteristics of a river at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of development that may be allowed afterward: w ild rivers are free from impoundments ( dams , diversions , and so forth ) and generally inaccessible except by trail . at the passage of the wsra in 1968 , congress initially designated 789 miles in eight rivers as part of the nwsrs and began to expand the system in 1972 ; since then , every congress has added rivers . altogether , the system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico . in some cases , prior to adding a river to the system , congress first directs in legislation that a study be conducted to determine whether the river area is suitable for wild and scenic designation . congress also has directed the secretaries of agriculture and the interior to evaluate rivers for inclusion in the nwsrs through agency planning processes . the act states that the studies are to discuss , among other things , the "outstandingly remarkable values" ( orvs ) that make the area worthy or unworthy of addition to the system ; current land ownership and use ; potential future uses of the land and water that could be affected by addition to the system ; the federal agency that would administer the area ; the cost of acquiring the land , if applicable ; and the extent to which management costs would be shared by state and local agencies . a state - nominated river may be added to the national system if the river is designated for protection under state law , approved by the secretary of the interior , and permanently administered by a state agency ( see " state - administered wild and scenic rivers " for further information ) . the national park service ( nps ) acts as the federal administrator for rivers entirely on nonfederal lands . the wsra authorizes or prohibits certain activities for all wsrs . the designated secretary then administers the river through one of the four federal land management agenciesâthe bureau of land management ( blm ) , nps , or u.s . fish and wildlife service ( fws ) within the department of the interior or the forest service ( fs ) within the department of agriculture . agencies sometimes provide more specific direction regarding crmp components . for example , in addition to the components listed , blm specifies that crmps should describe existing resource conditions , including detailed descriptions of orvs ; define the goals for protecting river values and the desired condition of the river ; address water quality and instream flow ; identify resources requiring compliance with other authorities ; identify regulatory authorities of other agencies that relate to river values ; and describe a river monitoring strategy . in addition to the statutory direction discussed above , management of wsrs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency's lands . wsrs need not flow entirely through federal land . wsrs designated by congress may flow wholly through nonfederal land or may have segments on nonfederal land . wsrs on nonfederal land managed at the state , county , or other nonfederal level , and usually congressionally designated , are referred to colloquially as partnership wild and scenic rivers ( or partnership wsrs ) . wsrs also may be designated through an administrative process . these wsrs , as well as those that contain both federal and nonfederal land , generally are not referred to as partnership wsrs . for rivers administered by the four federal land management agencies , congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual congressional appropriations for the relevant agencies . each agency approaches river management differently in its budget . rivers administered exclusively by states typically do not receive federal funding for river administration . the wsra authorizes federal agencies to assist states and their political subdivisions ( such as counties , townships , and others ) , landowners , organizations , or individuals in planning , protecting , and managing wsrs ; this provision includes financial and technical assistance , except in the case of administratively designated wsrs . wsr designation has been controversial in some cases , especially for wsrs containing nonfederal lands . initially , congress primarily designated rivers on federal land and rivers on nonfederal land were primarily added to the nwsrs through the state nomination authority . opinions regarding the balance of federal and local control over partnership wsrs have varied . congress and nps have used varying methods to address concerns about local versus federal control of partnership wsrs and about adequate levels of protection for partnership wsrs , either in individual designating legislation or in agency action prior to or after designation . congress may consider whether it is preferable to encourage use of the state - nominated process , which includes a set of fixed provisions , or to continue to establish partnership wsrs though individual designating statutes , whose provisions vary .
