for many years , "donor states" ( mostly in the south , but also including some states in the midwest and the west ) have complained that they receive significantly less federal highway aid than their highway users pay into the highway account of the highway trust fund ( htf ; unless otherwise indicated all references to the htf are to the highway account ) . the donor - donee issue has often been the most difficult issue to resolve during surface transportation reauthorization . the most recent multi - year authorization , the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act: a legacy for users ( safetea ; p.l . a series of extension acts has extended safetea , most recently through december 31 , 2011 . one method of determining a state's status as a donor or donee is based on dollars ; if the state's highway users are estimated to have paid more into the highway account in a given year than the state's apportionment and allocation of federal highway funding , it would be considered a donor state . the share - in / share - out calculation makes the donor - donee controversy self - perpetuating: there will always be donor states unless the distribution of every cent of federal spending is based on 100% rate of return on state payments to the highway account . these figures are compiled from the fe - 221 tables in fhwa's annual highway statistics , which provides a consistent source for this information since 1972 . also , if revenues to the highway account were to decline , as they did in fy2001 , fy2008 , and fy2009 , congress would be faced with the choice of drawing money from the general fund , drawing down the unexpended balance of the highway account , or allowing program spending to drop for the year . in a safetea baseline scenario that assumes transfers from the general fund to the highway trust fund , having a scope limited to the part of the highway budget funded by the htf might make sense . other programs would have been taken over by the states . although no proposal to devolve the surface transportation programs has been enacted , restructuring the eb program so that each state receives close to 100% of its road users' payments in federal highway grants would tend to bolster the case for devolution , as the federal government's role becomes more like that of a tax collector for the states . and if congress were to opt for an increase in highway revenues , perhaps through an increase in fuel taxes large enough to make the highway account of the htf self - sufficient again , the argument for resolving the donor - donee issue by devolving federal highway programs to the states might be revitalized . the total minimum guarantee program funding needed to achieve this total was over $6 billion . these programs could be designated in law as being inherently federal .
