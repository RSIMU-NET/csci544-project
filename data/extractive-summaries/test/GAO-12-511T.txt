i am pleased to be here today to discuss our preliminary observations on efforts by the social security administration ( ssa ) to modernize its disability criteria . in the last 20 years , ssa disability benefit payments to beneficiaries and their dependents have increased almost fivefold , from $35 billion in 1990 to over $164 billion in 2010 . gao has designated ssa's federal disability program as a high - risk area ; in 2008 , we reported that the agency's medical criteria did not fully reflect medical and technological advances , and the occupational criteria it used from the department of labor ( labor ) had not been updated since 1991 , despite the trend away from manual labor jobs and towards service - and knowledge - based jobs . my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review for this subcommittee and examines the status and management of ssa's efforts to ( 1 ) update its medical listings to reflect current medical knowledge and ( 2 ) develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) to reflect labor market changes . to examine these issues we reviewed prior gao and ssa office of inspector general reports ; relevant federal laws and regulations ; program documentation including policies , procedures , strategic goals , and supporting project plans and cost estimates ; and position papers and testimonies from disability groups and commissions . at this step , ssa examiners assess the applicant's medical impairment ( s ) against the listings of impairments , also known as the medical listings , which are organized into 14 major body systems for adults and reflect medical conditions that have been determined by the agency to be severe enough to qualify an applicant for benefits . in 2008 , we reported that ssa had established a new process for revising the listings — referred to by ssa as the “business process” — to better incorporate feedback into its continuous updates . with respect to information on jobs in the national economy that supports ssa's occupational criteria , we and others have reported that the dot , which ssa still relies on to assess eligibility at steps 4 and 5 of the process , is outdated . the dot has not been updated since 1991 , and labor has since replaced the dot with a new database called the occupational information network ( o*net ) .determined that o*net is not sufficiently detailed for evaluating di and ssi disability claims and therefore has begun developing its own ois in order to better reflect the physical and mental demands of work in the national economy . under this system , ssa first completes a comprehensive listings update for a body system that reviews all the diseases and disorders listed within that system and makes revisions it determines are needed . for subsequent updates of listings for a body system that underwent a comprehensive revision , ssa will pursue a more targeted approach — that is , ssa will conduct ongoing reviews with the expectation of making targeted revisions for a small number of medical diseases or disorders that need to be updated . another change , according to agency officials , is that in 2010 the ssa commissioner set a 5-year cycle time for updating listings for each body system . previously , ssa set expiration dates for periodically updating listings according to each body system , ranging from 3 to 8 years , but frequently extended them . for example , ssa contracted with the institute of medicine to study its medical criteria for determining disability and to make recommendations for improving the timeliness and accuracy of its disability decisions , resulting in a 2007 report with recommendations and a symposium of experts in 2010 . ssa continues to face delays in completing both comprehensive and other ongoing updates . for example , as of early march 2012 , ssa officials told us they still needed to complete comprehensive revisions for listings of six body systems that have been ongoing for the last 19 to 33 years , after numerous extensions beyond the original expiration periods ( see table 1 ) . ssa created an internal office and working group , as well as an occupational information development advisory panel , comprised of external experts in areas related to the development of occupational information systems . as of february 2012 , ssa had made progress on many of the baseline activities outlined in its research and development plan for the ois . while ssa has made progress on several key activities , agency officials delayed 2011 completion dates for certain activities and anticipate making additional changes to its timeline as a result of not meeting its staffing goals for fiscal year 2011 . to address this challenge , ssa officials hired consultants to meet some of their needs . as part of our ongoing work , we are assessing ssa's current ois project schedule and cost estimates against best practices , and have preliminarily identified some gaps in ssa's approach . for our final report due later in 2012 , we plan to deliver more comprehensive findings on how well ssa is managing the development of its ois against best practices , such as estimating costs of the ois and ensuring that the project schedule reliably estimates related activities , the length of time they will take , and how they are interrelated .
