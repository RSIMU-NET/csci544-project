in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the perception that the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives market contributed to systemic risk , the dodd - frank act ( p.l . 111-203 ) sought to remake the otc market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges . in the dodd - frank act , some of the crucial reforms included a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies . clearinghouses require traders to put down cash ( called initial margin ) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses , and they require subsequent deposits ( called maintenance margin ) to cover actual losses to the position . the intended effect of margin requirements is to eliminate the possibility that any firm can build up an uncapitalized exposure so large that default would have systemic consequences . while the clearing of derivatives helps to address systemic concerns , it also imposes the cost of posting margin on those who trade derivatives . many nonfinancial firms complained during the debate over the dodd - frank act that their use of derivatives posed no systemic threat and thus they should not be subjected to the cost of clearing these otc derivatives . this particular debate came to be known as "the end user debate," as it referred to so - called "end users" of derivatives . as a result of these concerns , the dodd - frank act in section 723 includes a broad exemption from the clearing requirement for firms that are primarily nonfinancial in nature . nevertheless , such firms have continued to be concerned that the act could impose indirect costs on them , or that the rulemaking process by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) could do so . in addition , concern about derivatives has been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices — particularly oil — in 2008 and early 2011 . such steep jumps , along with unexplained price volatility in a range of commodities , have fostered apprehension that financial speculation in derivatives might be creating such volatility in commodity prices . for instance , during the course of 2008 oil prices doubled to more than $145 per barrel and then fell by 80% , before rebounding again , while there was little actual interruption of physical supplies . in early 2011 , there was again a run - up of about 20% , sending gasoline prices to near 2008 highs . such severe fluctuations tend to anger consumers and thus are relevant for congress . in the 112 th congress , several bills , discussed below , address the impact of financial speculation and derivatives on spot commodity prices . h.r . 814 to h.r . two other bills — h.r . 2112 ( senator crapo ) would require the cftc , before adopting final rules under title vii of dodd - frank , to adopt an implementation schedule and to complete and submit to congress a study of the effects of title vii on ( 1 ) u.s. economic growth and job creation , ( 2 ) the international competitiveness of u.s. financial markets , ( 3 ) derivatives market depth and liquidity , as well as an assessment of the degree of harmonization among u.s. regulators and an analysis of the progress of members of the group of 20 and other countries toward implementing derivatives regulatory reform .
