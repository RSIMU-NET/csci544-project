it enables military aircraft to fly farther , stay airborne longer , and transport more weapons , equipment , and supplies than unrefueled forces . kc - 46 aircraft are expected to replace over forty percent of the kc - 135 stratotanker fleet , currently the mainstay of the u.s. tanker force . this force is now over 50 years old on average and costs increasingly more to maintain and support , with additional concerns that age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet . the kc - 46 development contract is designed to hold boeing accountable for cost associated with the development of four test aircraft and includes options to manufacture the remaining production lots . kc - 46 total program acquisition costs ( development , production , and military construction costs ) have remained relatively stable since program start , changing less than 1 percent since february 2011 , and the program is meeting schedule and performance goals . dod's office of the director , operational test and evaluation , which is responsible for approving operational and live fire test and evaluation within each major defense acquisition program , recently issued its 2013 annual report and continued to recommend that the air force plan for a 6- to 12-month delay to the start of initial operational test and evaluation to allow more time to train aircrew and maintenance personnel and verify maintenance procedures . as of december 2013 , about $75 million in unallocated reserves remain . the program office and boeing held the program's cdr in july 2013 and released over 90 percent of the total engineering design drawings , a key indicator that the design is stable . overall , software development is progressing largely according to plan ; however , software verification testing has not yet started and software problem reports are increasing . the flight test program is also a concern because it depends on coordination among several separate government entities , requires timely access to receiver aircraft ( the aircraft the kc - 46 will refuel while in flight ) , and requires a more aggressive pace than on past programs . as of january 2014 , boeing estimates that 15.8 million lines of code will be needed for the kc - 46 . notably , boeing must verify the software code to determine if it works as intended . currently , boeing , the program office , the air force , navy , faa , and officials from the office of the secretary of defense organizations for developmental and operational testing are finalizing detailed test plans , which are needed to guide flight test activities that are scheduled to begin in june 2014 for the 767-2c and in january 2015 for the kc - 46 . boeing has started manufacturing all four development aircraft on schedule , but has experienced some delays with the first aircraft . this includes identifying and assessing critical manufacturing processes to determine if they are capable of producing key military subsystems in a production representative environment . the program also established a reliability growth curve and boeing will begin tracking its progress towards reaching reliability goals once testing begins . boeing officials attributed the schedule slip to late supplier deliveries . the program plans to review and verify that process controls are in place to ensure the quality of the manufacturing process as part of its next assessment of critical manufacturing processes prior to the low rate production decision in august 2015 . the kc - 46 program has made good progress to date â€” acquisition costs have remained relatively stable , high - level schedule and performance goals have been met , the critical design review was successfully completed , and the contractor is building development aircraft . while all of the risks currently appear to be recognized , any slips in software testing , flight testing , and manufacturing as the program moves forward could cause delays in the program . due to existing schedule risks and the fact that the program is entering a challenging phase of testing , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the air force to study the likelihood and potential effect of delays on total development costs , and develop mitigation plans , as needed , related to potential delays .
