the navy expects to have invested at least $3 billion through fiscal year 2020 in the development of the unmanned carrier - launched airborne surveillance and strike ( uclass ) system . the system , which is expected to enhance the intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , targeting , and strike capabilities of the navy's aircraft carrier fleet , is comprised of three segments: ( 1 ) air system , ( 2 ) aircraft carrier , and ( 3 ) control system and connectivity . in august 2013 , the navy awarded contracts worth $15 million each to four competing contractors to develop and deliver preliminary designs for the air system . the next anticipated steps for the uclass program will be to solicit proposals and award the contract for development , design , fabrication , test , and delivery of the air system . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision that gao review the status of the uclass acquisition program annually . to assess the extent to which the navy has the knowledge about resources it needs to develop the uclass system , we applied best practice standards developed by gao for using key product knowledge to support program investment decisions , and identified and reviewed relevant legislation such as the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 . since our last review in september 2013 , the system's intended mission and required capabilities have come into question , delaying the navy's uclass schedule . the main options are a largely surveillance role with limited strike operating in less contested environments , or a largely strike role with limited surveillance operating in highly contested environments . at this point , if more demanding requirements add technical risk , the navy would likely need to conduct additional systems engineering work before it could establish an executable business case and a program baseline . as such , the navy would need to revisit its understanding of available resources in the areas of design knowledge , funding , and technologies as detailed below: knowledge gained through preliminary design reviews may no longer be applicable: during the four preliminary design reviews that ended in may 2014 , the navy evaluated contractor designs against a set of performance specifications issued in july 2013 . once the jroc has validated uclass requirements , and in order to ensure that the navy has a sound and executable business case and establishes an acquisition program baseline before awarding a development contract and committing significant resources , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy to provide a report to the congressional defense committees and the secretary of defense demonstrating that the navy has the resources available and a strategy to deliver those required uclass capabilities . on behalf of dod , the navy partially agreed with our recommendation .
