in addition to providing aviation weather products that are developed at its own facilities , nws also provides staff on - site at each of faa's en route centers — the facilities that control high - altitude flight outside the airport tower and terminal areas . over the last few years , faa and nws have been exploring options for enhancing the efficiency of the aviation weather services provided at en route centers . since then , nws has developed and submitted two proposals to faa , both of which were rejected . as requested , this statement summarizes our draft report that ( 1 ) determines the status and plans of efforts to restructure the center weather service units , ( 2 ) evaluates efforts to establish a baseline of the current performance provided by the center weather service units so that faa and nws can ensure that any operational changes do not degrade aviation weather services , and ( 3 ) evaluates challenges to restructuring the center weather service units . faa's primary mission is to ensure safe , orderly , and efficient air travel in the national airspace system . in 2005 , the agency requested that nws restructure its aviation weather services by consolidating its center weather service units to a smaller number of sites , reducing personnel costs , and providing products and services 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . nws and faa are considering plans to restructure the way aviation weather services are provided at en route centers . having a clear understanding of an organization's current performance — a baseline — is essential to determining whether new initiatives ( like the proposed restructuring ) result in improved or degraded products and services . while nws subsequently identified eight additional performance measures in its proposal , faa has not yet approved these measures . however , the agencies have not established a baseline of performance for the 9 other performance measures . nws officials reported that they are not collecting baseline information for a variety of reasons , including that the measures have not yet been approved by faa , and that selected measures involve products that have not yet been developed . it is important to obtain an understanding of the current level of performance in these measures before beginning any efforts to restructure aviation weather services . without an understanding of the current level of performance , nws and faa will not be able to measure the success or failure of any changes they make to the center weather service unit operations . nws and faa face challenges in their efforts to modify the current aviation weather structure . unless and until these challenges are addressed , the proposed restructuring of aviation weather services at en route centers has a reduced chance of success . however , faa rejected all three of nws's proposals in september 2008 on the basis that the costs of the proposals were too high , even though cost was not specified in faa's requirements . if a proposal is accepted , both agencies could face challenges in demonstrating that existing services will not be degraded during the restructuring . specifically , we are recommending that the secretaries direct the nws and faa administrators , respectively , to improve their ability to measure improvements in the center weather service units by establishing and approving a set of performance measures for the center weather service units , and by immediately identifying the current level of performance for the five potential measures that could be identified under current operations ( forecast accuracy , customer satisfaction , service delivery conformity , timeliness of on - demand services , and training completion ) so that there will be a baseline from which to measure the impact of any proposed operational changes . in addition , we are recommending that the secretaries direct the nws and faa administrators to address specific challenges by improving interagency collaboration by defining a common outcome , establishing joint strategies to achieve the outcome , and agreeing upon each agency's responsibilities ; establishing and finalizing requirements for aviation weather services at en ensuring that any proposed organizational changes are aligned with nextgen initiatives by seeking a review by the joint program development office responsible for developing the nextgen vision ; and before moving forward with any proposed operational changes , address implementation challenges by developing a feasible schedule that includes adequate time for stakeholder involvement ; undertaking a comprehensive demonstration to ensure no services are degraded ; and effectively transitioning the infrastructure and technologies to the new consolidated structure . we also reviewed planning documents for the next generation air transportation system .
