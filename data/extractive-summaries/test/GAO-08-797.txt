fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , comprises about 585 refuges on more than 96 million acres of land and water that provide habitat for millions of waterfowl and other migratory birds , threatened and endangered species , and other plants and wildlife . each year , nearly 40 million visitors take part in one or more of the refuge system's six wildlife - dependent visitor activities — hunting , fishing , wildlife observation , wildlife photography , environmental education , and environmental interpretation — and other recreational activities . you asked us to ( 1 ) describe changing factors that the refuge system experienced from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , including funding and staffing changes , and ( 2 ) examine how habitat management and visitor services changed during this period . we visited headquarters , 4 regional offices , and 19 refuges , and conducted phone interviews with officials at the other 4 regional offices and about 50 additional refuges . visitor services . from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , the refuge system experienced fluctuations in funding and staffing levels , the introduction of several new refuge system policy initiatives , and increases in the influence of external factors such as extreme weather and development that affect refuge operations . inflation - adjusted funding for core refuge system activities — measured as obligations for refuge operations , maintenance , and fire management — increased by 6.8 percent from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 for the celebration of the refuge system's centennial , then declined quickly to 4.7 percent below peak levels by fiscal year 2005 , before increasing again to 2.3 percent below peak levels in fiscal year 2007 , when adjusted for inflation ( in 2002 dollars ) ; it ended the period 4.3 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels . core refuge system staffing levels peaked in fiscal year 2004 after increasing 10.0 percent , and then declined more slowly than funding to 4.0 percent below this level by the end of fiscal year 2007 ; they ended the period 5.5 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels . during the same period , several refuge system policy initiatives were implemented to reduce staff levels and reprioritize funding among refuges , ensure the completion of required conservation plans , shift focus toward constructing a greater number of smaller visitor facilities , and increase the number of full - time law enforcement officers and associated training ; other initiatives increased the administrative workload on refuges . from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , several changes occurred in refuges' habitat management and visitor services , creating concerns about the refuges' abilities to maintain high - quality habitat and visitor services in the future . however , managers are concerned that staffing and funding constraints will inhibit the refuges' ability to maintain quality habitat in the future . 20 ) . based on our statistical models , which assess the effects of a change in external factors while adjusting for the effects of tier designation and the change in staff time , we estimate that refuges that experienced no net increase in the number of external factors were about 7.0 times more likely to experience improved , rather than worsened , waterfowl habitat quality and 5.1 times more likely to experience improved , rather than worsened , habitat quality for other migratory birds . as might be expected given reported improvements in habitat quality during our study period , refuge managers reported increasing the time spent on basic habitat management activities such as haying , mowing , prescribed burning , or manipulating water levels on 43 percent of refuges and increasing time spent on habitat restoration activities , such as planting native grasses or trees , and creating water control structures , such as levees , at about 48 percent of refuges since fiscal year 2002 . even though our survey showed that a large number of refuges increased staff time on habitat management activities , some refuge managers we interviewed explained that staff were simply working longer hours to get the work done . given staff reductions due to workforce planning and comments from managers that visitor services are the first to be cut when resources are constrained , it also is not surprising to see that time spent by permanent staff on visitor services had been reduced at more than one - third of refuges . the department provided technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate . survey questions were crafted to obtain information on a variety of issues , including how the following changed between fiscal years 2002 and 2007: the quality of various types of habitat , the extent of various habitat problems , the extent to which external factors affected habitat problems , the amount of time spent on various management activities , the amount and quality of visitor services infrastructure , and the quality of visitor services . 3 .
