my statement today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which dhs has used its other transaction authority , ( 2 ) the status of dhs's implementation of gao's previous recommendations , and ( 3 ) the accountability challenges associated with the use of these agreements . other transaction authority was created to enhance the federal government's ability to acquire cutting - edge science and technology by attracting nontraditional contractors that have not typically pursued government contracts . these agreements are generally not subject to the far . the homeland security act of 2002 created dhs and granted the agency the authority to enter into other transactions for research and development and prototype projects for a period of 5 years . the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 extended this authority until september 30 , 2008 . though it has since used this authority less frequently , it continues to obligate funds for its earliest agreements . about 77 percent of the $443 million spent on dhs's agreements has been on 7 of the 37 agreements . s&t contracting representatives reported that all of these agreements were for prototype projects . dhs reported a total of 37 other transaction agreements , 30 of which were entered into in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 . according to s&t , all of these agreements included at least one nontraditional contractor , most commonly as a subcontractor . beyond these efforts , gao found some areas for improvement and recommended that: dhs provide guidance on when to include audit provisions in agreements ; provide more training on creating and managing agreements ; capture knowledge gained from current agreements for future use ; and take measures to help rotational staff avoid conflicts of interest . provide guidance: we recommended that dhs develop guidance on when it is appropriate to include audit provisions in other transaction agreements . however , the guidance only addresses prototype agreements over $5 million . operational challenges to successfully making use of other transaction authority include: attracting and ensuring the use of non - traditional contractors ; acquiring intellectual property rights ; financial control ; and maintaining a skilled acquisition workforce . prior gao work has noted the importance of maintaining institutional knowledge sufficient to maintain government control .
