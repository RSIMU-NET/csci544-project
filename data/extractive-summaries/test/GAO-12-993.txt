the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act of 2009 ( tgaaa ) , passed as part of the american reinvestment and recovery act in february 2009 , reauthorized and amended trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) programs that assist trade - impacted workers , farmers and fishermen , firms , community colleges , and communities . for fiscal year 2010 , the department of commerce's economic development administration ( eda ) awarded $36.8 million in ctaa grants to 36 communities to develop a strategic plan to help the community adjust to trade impacts and to promote economic diversification or to implement programs and projects as part of a strategic plan . the administration proposed to discontinue the program , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program . congress responded by repealing the ctaa program in 2012 . in response to your interest in a report on the repealed ctaa program and , more specifically , on how eda awarded the ctaa grants and how those grants fit in with other eda grant programs , we examined the ctaa program to determine ( 1 ) how eda made grant award decisions , ( 2 ) what mechanisms eda established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness , and ( 3 ) how the ctaa program compared with other eda community grant programs . eda officials said that this process was similar to the standard process they use to administer other eda grant programs , but with some modifications to address the unique aspects of the ctaa program . outreach and technical assistance . eda regional staff said that they conducted a technical review of each application , verifying , among other things , the eligibility of the applicant as outlined in the federal funding opportunity . merit review . eda continues to monitor ctaa grants through its standard process of reviewing periodic progress and financial reports that grantees are required to submit . grantees with construction projects are required to report on certain eda performance measures — such as the number of jobs created and retained — 3 , 6 , and 9 years after the award . in 2013 , those grantees will be required to report measures relating to jobs created , jobs retained , and level of new private investment . for example , they receive financial reports , performance reports , budget documents , and requests for disbursement from the grantee . in our review of 12 of the 36 grant files , we found no evidence of deficiencies in the required performance and financial reports that eda regional offices received from grantees . eda officials identified two other programs that target economically distressed communities — eda's economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) and public works — which may have been able to provide assistance to ctaa communities . we found that eda , through ctaa grants , assisted some trade - impacted communities that may not have qualified for eda's other community grant programs due to differences in eligibility and cost - share requirements . as shown in table 3 , eda required communities in the ctaa program to provide between 5 and 25 percent of the costs of the grants , while eda requires communities in the eaa and public works programs to provide up to 50 percent of the costs . although eda officials credited the ctaa program with providing a funding stream to assist more communities , some officials suggested that funding for trade - impacted communities could have been designated within , and similar services could have been delivered through , eda's existing programs , for the following reasons: ctaa communities met the primary eligibility requirements . in its comments , commerce concurred with this report and provided additional information clarifying that the outcomes of the ctaa grants may not be known until 2019 , when the final nine - year reports on impact will be provided by the grantees . we selected a nonprobability sample of 12 grant recipients for a file review .
