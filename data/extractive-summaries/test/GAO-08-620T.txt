the fy 2009 budget request is a road map for how irs intends to allocate resources in order to carry out ambitious plans of improving enforcement , improving taxpayer service , increasing research , and continuing to invest in modernized information systems . one complicating factor for carrying out irs's ambitious plans in the immediate future is the recent passage of the economic stimulus act of 2008 , which creates additional , unanticipated workload for irs this year . based on your request , our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess how the president's budget request for irs for fy 2009 allocates resources for enforcement , service , research , and systems modernization primarily compared to fy 2008 enacted levels ; ( 2 ) assess the rationales for differences between the 2 years , including the rationales for initiatives and the extent to which those rationales have been justified ; ( 3 ) determine the status of irs's efforts to develop and implement its bsm program ; and ( 4 ) determine the total cost of administering the economic stimulus program . the budget proposes a 7 percent increase in enforcement spending , including funds and staffing for various legislative and nonlegislative initiatives . according to the proposal , the legislative initiatives would raise about $36 billion in revenue over 10 years . they are projected to cost $23 million in fy 2009 , funding irs would not need if none of the legislative initiatives were enacted . similarly , if irs were to fall behind in meeting its challenging hiring goals for the nonlegislative initiatives , it would not need all $226 million of the associated funding for fy 2009 . although the budget request provides performance measure data , it does not provide roi for programs or activities that constitute a large part of the budget request — activities other than the proposed initiatives . irs estimates that the cost of implementing the economic stimulus legislation may be up to a total of $767 million , including a $202 million supplemental appropriation . in addition to the supplemental appropriation , irs is reallocating resources from enforcement to taxpayer service by shifting hundreds of collections staff to answering telephone calls and , as a result , may forego up to $565 million in enforcement revenue . in order to maintain taxpayer service at recent levels despite a decrease in real spending and staffing , irs expects to realize efficiency gains . we recently reported that while irs has continued to make progress in implementing bsm projects and improving modernization management controls and capabilities , challenges and risks remain , and further improvements are needed . when we asked about the impact of this reduction on its operations , irs told us that the proposed funding level will allow it to continue developing and delivering its primary modernization projects but did not provide details on how plans to deliver specific projects or benefits to taxpayers would be affected . however , the agency has yet to develop long - term plans for completing bsm and consolidating and retiring legacy systems . because of the increased call volume , irs expects its assistor level of service to drop from 82 percent ( the 2008 goal ) to as low as 74 percent — the lowest level since 2002 . irs is already experiencing some declines in telephone service .
