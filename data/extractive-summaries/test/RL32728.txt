the public utility holding company act ( puhca ) ( 1 ) and the federal power act ( fpa ) of 1935 ( title i and title ii of the public utility act ) ( 2 ) established a regime ofregulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federalgovernment . the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electricityutility industry , including financial transactions , wholesale rate regulation , transactions involvingtransmission of unbundled retail electricity , interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity,and ensuring adequate and reliable service .  ( 3 ) for the first time , utilitieswere required to purchase power from outside sources . purpa was established in part to augment electric utilitygeneration with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electricconsumers . these rates are called market - based rates . the energy policy act of 1992 ( epact ) ( 5 ) removed several regulatory barriers to entry into electricitygeneration to increase competition of electricity supply . specifically , epact provides for thecreation of entities , called "exempt wholesale generators" ( ewgs ) , that can generate and sellelectricity at wholesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca . under epact , ewgsare also provided with a way to assure transmission of their wholesale power to a wholesalepurchaser . electric utility provisions are included in comprehensive energy legislation ( h.r . in part , this law repeals the public utility holding company act ( puhca ) . anelectric reliability organization ( ero ) is created and the ero will promulgate mandatory,enforceable reliability standards for the electric industry that includes cybersecurity protection . in addition to creating a new type of wholesale electricity generator , exempt wholesalegenerators ( ewgs ) , the energy policy act ( epact ) provides ewgs with a system to assuretransmission of their wholesale power to its purchaser . as a result of epact , on april 24 , 1996 , ferc issued orders888 and 889 .  ( 7 ) in issuingits final rules , ferc concluded that these orders will "remedy undue discrimination in transmissionservices in interstate commerce and provide an orderly and fair transition to competitive bulk powermarkets. . one argument for additional puhca reform has been made by electric utilities that wantto further diversify their assets . state regulators have expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses,including cross - subsidization: a regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate . puhca repeal , such groups argue , could only exacerbatemarket power abuses in what they see as a monopolistic industry where true competition does notyet exist . proponents of purpa repeal - - primarilyinvestor - owned utilities ( ious ) located in the northeast and in california - - argued that their stateregulators' "misguided" implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to paycontractually high prices for power they do not need . additionally , opponents of purpa repeal argued that it would result in lesscompetition and greater utility monopoly control over the electric industry .
