a september 2009 study from the royal society divided most geoengineering proposals into two main categories: carbon dioxide removal ( cdr ) and solar radiation management ( srm ) . in contrast , srm offsets temperature increases by reflecting a small percentage of the sun's light back into space . our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the general state of the science regarding geoengineering approaches and their potential effects ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the federal government is sponsoring or participating in geoengineering research or deployment ; and ( 3 ) the views of legal experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering activities , and associated challenges , if any , to geoengineering governance . we then categorized the remaining activities into three broad types: ( 1 ) activities related to conventional carbon mitigation efforts that are directly applicable to a proposed geoengineering approach , although not designated as such ; ( 2 ) activities related to improving basic scientific understanding of earth systems , processes , or technologies that could be applied generally to geoengineering ; and ( 3 ) activities designed specifically to address a proposed geoengineering approach that does not overlap with a conventional carbon mitigation strategy . we also reviewed federal laws and international agreements , interviewed 7 legal experts , and interviewed officials from the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the department of state ( state ) to identify potentially relevant federal laws and international agreements and discuss how these laws and international agreements might apply to future geoengineering efforts , and associated challenges , if any , to geoengineering governance . other cdr approaches have been the focus of relatively few laboratory and field experiments , and fundamental questions remain about their potential efficacy . according to our review of relevant studies and expert interviews , understanding of srm is more limited than that of cdr because there have been few laboratory experiments , field experiments , or computer modeling efforts . based on our literature review and interviews with experts , to date only one study has been published for a field experiment related to srm technologies — a 2009 russian experiment that injected aerosols into the middle troposphere to measure their reflectivity . experts we interviewed and relevant studies identified several major uncertainties in the field of geoengineering that are in need of further investigation . for example , the nrc study acknowledged the importance of improving understanding of srm and its consequences , without replacing or reducing existing research on climate change science or other approaches to limiting climate change or adapting to its impacts . epa has taken steps to regulate one cdr approach and has determined that an existing law provides sufficient authority to regulate two other approaches . this official was not aware of cercla's applicability to any other geoengineering activity . geological sequestration . legal experts and state officials had differing views about an international governance framework for geoengineering . legal experts and epa officials we interviewed generally agreed that the federal government should take a coordinated , interagency approach to domestic geoengineering regulation . furthermore , legal experts and epa officials agreed that liability for unintended consequences was an important issue that would need to be addressed . while agencies identified about $100.9 million in research funding relevant to geoengineering in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 , federal officials also said that a substantial portion of the existing federal climate change and earth science research could be relevant to understanding geoengineering — roughly $2 billion in requested budget authority for 2010 alone . however , because there is no coordinated federal geoengineering strategy , it is difficult to determine the extent of relevant research . gao recommends that the appropriate entities within the executive office of the president ( eop ) , such as the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , in consultation with relevant federal agencies , develop a clear , defined , and coordinated approach to geoengineering research in the context of a federal strategy to address climate change that ( 1 ) defines geoengineering for federal agencies ; ( 2 ) leverages existing resources by having federal agencies collect information and coordinate federal research related to geoengineering in a transparent manner ; and if the administration decides to establish a formal geoengineering research program , ( 3 ) sets clear research priorities to inform decision - making and future governance efforts .
