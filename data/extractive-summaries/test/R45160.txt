the federal election commission ( fec ) is a six - member independent regulatory agency . the commission is responsible for administering federal campaign finance law and for civil enforcement of the federal election campaign act ( feca ) . commissioners are appointed by the president and are subject to senate confirmation . feca requires that at least four of the six commissioners vote to make decisions on substantive actions . this report provides a brief overview of the fec's policymaking powers without at least four commissioners in office . the topic may be relevant for congressional oversight of the agency , particularly if it loses its policymaking quorum , and for senate consideration of nominations to the agency . other crs products provide additional information about campaign finance policy , the fec , and procedural issues . as of this writing , the fec is operating with four commissioners instead of six , as shown in table 1 below . in late 2007 , in anticipation of only two commissioners remaining in office in 2008 , commissioners amended the fec's rules of internal procedure to permit executing some duties if the agency lost its four - member policymaking quorum . as explained previously , this means that even if all remaining commissioners agreed on an outcome , the agency would have too few votes to execute its most consequential duties .
