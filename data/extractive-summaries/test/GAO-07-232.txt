at a time when u.s. military forces and their equipment are in high demand , the effectiveness and efficiency of the department of defense's ( dod ) inventory management is critical to ensure that the warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time . nevertheless , the department continues to attribute readiness problems in part to shortages of spare parts . the report summarizes inventories by dod component and inventory category . from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2005 , the air force's total on - hand inventory increased by $1.2 billion , representing about 10 percent of the total $12.6 billion increase in dod inventory during this period . more than half of the air force's on - order and on - hand secondary inventory , worth an average of $31.4 billion , was not needed to support its requirements from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , although increases in demand have contributed to a slight reduction in the percentage of this on - hand inventory and a reduction in the number of years of supply this inventory represents . however , this inventory represents an average of about 65 percent ( about $18.7 billion ) of the value of unneeded on - hand inventory . while increasing demands have resulted in the air force reducing the number of years of supply this inventory represents , 79 percent of the air force's inventory items not needed to support requirements had no recurring demands at all , resulting in a potentially infinite supply of those items . however , we calculated as of september 30 , 2005 , that it cost the air force at least $15 million annually to store its useable inventory not needed to support on - hand requirements . on the basis of number of items and value , in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2005 the largest category of air force secondary inventory not needed to support requirements was “2 to 10 years of supply.” at the end of fiscal year 2005 , there were 6,361 unique items valued at about $4.2 billion within this category . although more than half of its secondary inventory was not needed to support requirements , the air force still had shortages of certain items in inventory . when the air force buys unneeded items , it is obligating funds unnecessarily , which could lead to not having sufficient funds to purchase needed items , which also may negatively affect readiness . to meet customer expectations while minimizing inventory and to reduce the air force's inventory not needed to support requirements , we are recommending that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to take the following four actions: modify its policies to provide incentives to reduce purchases of on - order inventory that are not needed to support requirements , such as requiring contract termination review for all unneeded on - order inventory or reducing the funding available for the air force materiel command by an amount up to the value of the air force's on - order inventory that is not needed to support requirements ; conduct a comprehensive assessment of the inventory items on hand that are not needed to support requirements and that have no recurring demands and revalidate the need to continue to retain these items , and , as part of this assessment , consider establishing ongoing requirements for items supporting weapon systems that have lengthy projected life spans ; evaluate the reasons why the air force continually experiences decreases in demands which have contributed to having more than half of its inventory on hand not needed to support requirements ; and after evaluating the reasons for the decreases in demand , determine what actions are needed to address these decreases and then take steps to implement these actions .
