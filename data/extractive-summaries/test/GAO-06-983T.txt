in fact , the supply chain can be the critical link in determining whether our front - line military forces win or lose on the battlefield . during the subcommittee's october 2005 hearing on this subject , i stated that dod's plan addressing supply chain management was a good first step toward putting dod on a path toward resolving long - standing supply chain management problems , but that the department faced a number of challenges and risks in fully implementing its proposed changes across the department and measuring progress . as requested , my comments today will focus on dod's progress in ( 1 ) implementing the supply chain management improvement plan and ( 2 ) incorporating performance measures for tracking and demonstrating improvement . in 2005 , we modified the title for this high - risk area from “dod inventory management” to “dod supply chain management.” in the 2005 update , we noted that during operation iraqi freedom , some of the supply chain problems included backlogs of hundreds of pallets and containers at distribution points , millions of dollars spent in late fees to lease or replace storage containers because of distribution backlogs and losses , and shortages of such items as tires and radio batteries . since october 2005 , dod has continued to make progress implementing the initiatives in its supply chain management improvement plan , but it will be several years before the plan can be fully implemented . while dod has generally stayed on track , dod has reported some slippage in meeting scheduled milestones for certain initiatives . given the long - standing nature of the problems being addressed , the complexities of the initiatives , and the involvement of multiple organizations within dod , we would expect to see further milestone slippage in the future . although the endorsement of dod's plan by the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics is evidence of a strong commitment to improve dod's supply chain management , dod will have to sustain this commitment as it goes forward in implementing this multiyear plan while also engaged in departmentwide business transformation efforts . while dod has incorporated several broad performance measures in its supply chain management improvement plan , the department continues to lack outcome - focused performance measures for many of the initiatives . therefore , it is difficult to track and demonstrate dod's progress toward improving its performance in the three focus areas of requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . for example , dod could show near - term progress by adding intermediate measures for the dod supply chain management improvement plan , such as outcome - focused performance measures for the initiatives or for the three focus areas . dod's supply chain management improvement plan includes four high - level performance measures that are being tracked across the department , but these measures do not necessarily reflect the performance of the initiatives or explicitly relate to the three focus areas . in addition , while not required by the regulation , the performance measures dod has included in the plan are not explicitly linked to the three focus areas , and it has not included overall cost metrics that might show efficiencies gained through supply chain improvement efforts . dod has multiple plans aimed at improving aspects of logistics , including supply chain management , but it is unclear how all these plans are aligned with one another . in september 2005 , dod issued its focused logistics roadmap , also referred to as the “as is” roadmap . it documents logistics - enabling programs and initiatives directed toward achieving focused logistics capabilities . it is intended to provide a baseline of programs and initiatives for future capability analysis and investment . these plans were developed at different points of time , for different purposes , and in different formats . therefore , it is difficult to determine how all the ongoing efforts link together to sufficiently cover requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution and whether they will result in significant progress toward resolving this high - risk area . until dod clearly aligns the supply chain management improvement plan with other department plans and ongoing initiatives , supply chain stakeholders will not have a comprehensive picture of dod's ongoing efforts to resolve problems in the supply chain . to address this concern and guide future logistics programs and initiatives , dod is in the process of developing a new strategic plan — the “to be” roadmap . this plan is intended to portray where the department is headed in the logistics area , how it will get there , and monitor progress toward achieving its objectives , as well as institutionalize a continuous assessment process that links ongoing capability development , program reviews , and budgeting .
