throughout the first 150 years of the federal government , access to government information does not appear to have been a major issue for the federal branches or the public . there were a few instances during this period when the president , arguing the need to maintain the constitutional independence and equality of his branch , vigorously resisted attempts by congress and the courts to obtain executive records . among these legislative responses were the enactments of four statutes . two provide access to federal records: the freedom of information act ( 1966 ) and the privacy act ( 1974 ) . two provide access to federal meetings: the federal advisory committee act ( 1972 ) ; and the government in the sunshine act ( 1976 ) . this report offers an overview of each of these statutes , including the boundaries of their authority . this report then provides citations to additional resources on each of the laws . when agencies resist these requests , congress has formal and informal methods of encouraging or requiring agencies to comply . in general , an agency's dispute with the legislature over access to information is often resolved through negotiation — reduction of the quantity of records initially sought , substitution of other information , alternative delivery mechanisms , or limitation of the number of individuals who will examine materials provided by another branch . in view of the american separation of powers model of government , such conflicts among the three branches are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive — and probably will continue to occur . the administrative office of the u.s. courts provides statistical information on the number of foia cases filed in u.s. district courts in its compendium , judicial business of the united states courts . other transparency watchdog organizations also track litigation related to federal access laws . the u.s. house of representatives committee on government reform has published several editions of its report , a citizen's guide on using the freedom of information act and the privacy act of 1974 to request government records — most recently in september 2012 . crs report r41933 , the freedom of information act ( foia ) : background , legislation , and policy issues , by [author name scrubbed] crs legal sidebar wslg93 , the freedom of information act ( foia ) and the drone strikes program , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r43924 , freedom of information act legislation in the 114th congress: issue summary and side - by - side analysis , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed] crs report r44253 , federal advisory committees: an introduction and overview , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r44232 , creating a federal advisory committee in the executive branch , by [author name scrubbed] crs report r44248 , the federal advisory committee act: analysis of operations and costs , by [author name scrubbed] crs report rl30240 , congressional oversight manual , by [author name scrubbed] et al . u.s. congress .
