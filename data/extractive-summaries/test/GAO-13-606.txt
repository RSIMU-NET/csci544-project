subject to certain requirements , the regional centers are permitted to use a portion of these funds to waive the reimbursement of the costs for foreign officials and other personnel , such as representatives of nongovernmental and international organizations , to participate in the regional centers' programs and activities . l. no . in this report , we ( 1 ) describe how the regional centers' activities compare with those of other dod training and education organizations , and ( 2 ) evaluate the extent to which dod has developed and implemented an approach to oversee and assess the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities . these activities are carried out under various statutory authorities . the five regional centers for security studies ( regional centers ) support dod's objective to build the defense capacity of partner nations . the regional centers' activities include education , exchanges , research , and information sharing . dod provides u.s. and foreign participants with a variety of training and educational programs and activities through its five regional centers , its professional military education and advanced degree - conferring institutions , and its professional development institutions . programs and activities administered by the regional centers and other dod professional military education and advanced degree - conferring institutions as well as professional development institutions have similar features in that they all offer curriculum topics intended to help participants enhance knowledge and skills on security and military matters ; target members of the military ; and feature program formats that include in - residence courses ; seminars , conferences , workshops ; distance learning ; and in - country instruction . the regional centers' audience is generally civilian and military officials from other countries . we found that the regional centers , professional military education and advanced degree - conferring institutions , and professional development institutions are similar in that they all offer programs and activities to help a participant understand security and military matters and to enhance his or her knowledge and skills . although the regional centers generally offer shorter - duration courses on a range of security topics , some centers provide participants with opportunities to obtain credit for their attendance . the professional development institutions also generally offer shorter - duration courses . dod has taken some steps to enhance its oversight of the regional centers' plans and activities , but it does not have a sound basis to evaluate their progress in achieving dod priorities because it has not developed an assessment approach that includes measurable goals and objectives with metrics or established a methodology for using the performance information it collects . our prior workhas found that achieving results in government requires a comprehensive oversight framework that includes clear goals , measurable objectives , and metrics for assessing progress , consistent with the framework established in the government performance and results act . for example , the governance body has not identified how it will consider the performance information provided by the regional centers in making decisions or demonstrated how the newly established planning process will integrate the performance information to assess the regional centers' progress towards ousd policy strategic goals and priority objectives . while dod has taken positive steps by establishing a new governance body and updating dod guidance applying to the regional centers for fiscal year 2013 , dod does not yet have a process to assess the regional centers' progress . conducting routine assessments using measurable goals and objectives , with metrics to evaluate progress , and a methodology for using performance information to include defining the role of the governance board , would provide dod a sounder basis for assessing the regional centers' progress in achieving results and better determining the allocation of resources . to enhance dod's ability to determine whether the regional centers are achieving departmental priorities , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for policy to develop an approach to assess the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities , including identifying measurable goals and objectives , metrics , or other indicators of performance , and develop a methodology for using performance information , to include defining the role of the governance board in the process . further , our report describes past and current dod efforts that could be useful toward identifying metrics to assess regional center progress in achieving dod priorities . third , we completed additional research on dod institutions that provide training and education . to address all of our objectives , we collected information by interviewing or communicating with officials in ( 1 ) the office of under secretary of defense for policy ( ousd policy ) , specifically the following subordinate offices: a ) b ) principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for partnership strategy and stability operations , principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs , c ) d ) e ) f ) g ) h ) deputy assistant secretary of defense african affairs , principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for russia , ukraine & eurasia , principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for western hemispheres affairs , principal deputy assistant secretary for defense â€” asia pacific security affairs , deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy , and principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations & low - intensity conflict ;
