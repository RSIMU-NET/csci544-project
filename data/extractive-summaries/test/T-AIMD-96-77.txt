as a result , some entities were subject to numerous grant audits each year while others were not audited for long periods . the objectives of the single audit act are to improve the financial management of state and local governments receiving federal financial assistance ; establish uniform requirements for audits of federal financial assistance provided to state and local governments ; promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources ; and ensure that federal departments and agencies , to the extent practicable , rely upon and use audit work done pursuant to the act . if the thresholds were raised , as is proposed in the amendments , audit coverage of 95 percent of federal funds to local governments could be maintained while roughly 4,000 local governments that now have single audits would be exempt in the future . the proposed amendments would require omb to develop a risk - based approach to target audit resources at the higher risk programs as well as focusing on the dollars expended . we support their enactment . the proposed amendments would shorten this to 9 months . presently , the single audit act applies only to state and local governments while nonprofit organizations are administratively required to have single audits under omb circular a - 133 , “audits of institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations.” omb is in the final stages of revising circular a - 133 to parallel the requirements of the proposed amendments to the single audit act . u.s. general accounting office p.o .
