we reviewed reports , including those of the accountability review boards , the overseas presence advisory panel ( opap ) , and a state department - led interagency rightsizing committee,and we discussed overseas staffing issues with officials from the state department , other u.s. agencies operating overseas , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , which is currently implementing the president's management initiative to rightsize u.s. embassies . we can also see ambassadors using this framework to ensure that embassy staffing is in line with security concerns , mission priorities and requirements , and costs to reduce the number of people at risk . one of the buildings is particularly vulnerable and staff face a variety of threats . it is difficult to assess whether 700 people are needed at the embassy because the executive branch has not identified its overall priorities and linked them to resources . we also found that the criteria to locate staff in paris vary significantly by agency . this will allow decision makers to assess the relative cost effectiveness of various program and support functions and to make cost - based decisions when setting mission priorities and staffing levels and when determining the feasibility of alternative business approaches . our work in paris demonstrates that this embassy is operating without fundamental knowledge and use of comprehensive cost data . we have documented the total cost for all agencies operating in france in fiscal year 2001 to be about $100 million . analyses of security , mission , and costs may suggest the assignment of more or fewer staff at an embassy or an adjustment to the overall staff mix . specifically: some functions at the paris embassy could be relocated to the united states . physical security and real estate what are the threat and security profiles ? .
