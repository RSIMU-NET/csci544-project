the 111 th congress passed major health reform legislation , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-152 ) . all references to aca in this report refer to the law as amended . the report provides a brief summary of major aca provisions , implementation and oversight activities , and current legal challenges . for more detailed information on aca's provisions , crs has produced a series of more comprehensive reports , which are available at http: / / www.crs.gov . the information provided in these reports ranges from broad overviews of aca provisions , such as the law's medicare provisions , to more narrowly focused topics , such as dependent coverage for children under age 26 . among its many provisions , aca restructures the private health insurance market , sets minimum standards for health coverage , creates a mandate for most u.s. residents to obtain health insurance coverage , and provides for the establishment by 2014 of state - based insurance exchanges for the purchase of private health insurance . the new law also expands eligibility for medicaid ; amends the medicare program in ways that are intended to reduce the growth in medicare spending ; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums ; and makes numerous other changes to the tax code , medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and many other federal programs . the costs of expanding public and private health insurance coverage and other spending are offset by revenues from new taxes and fees , and by savings from payment and health care delivery system reforms designed to reduce spending on medicare and other federal health care programs . implementation of aca , which began upon the law's enactment in 2010 and will continue to unfold over the next few years , involves all the major health care stakeholders , including the federal and state governments , as well as employers , insurers , and health care providers . following enactment of aca , state attorneys general and others brought a number of lawsuits challenging provisions of the act on constitutional grounds . on june 28 , 2012 , the united states supreme court issued its decision in national federation of independent business v. sebelius , finding that the individual mandate in aca is a constitutional exercise of congress's authority to levy taxes . however , the court held that it was not a valid exercise of congress's power under the commerce clause or the necessary and proper clause . with regard to the medicaid expansion provision , the court , in an opinion written by chief justice roberts , accepted an argument that the scope of the changes imposed by the medicaid expansion transformed the aca requirements into a "new" medicaid benefit program . since it was only the withholding of existing federal medicaid matching funds that was unconstitutional , the chief justice held that severance under the statute could be limited to termination of those funds . it is unclear how many states may now decide not to participate in the medicaid expansion .
