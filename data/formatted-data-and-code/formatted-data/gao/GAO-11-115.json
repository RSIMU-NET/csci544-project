system", "attachment iii", "to develop and implement the new system, va also is following its project management accountability system (pmas) framework which was established in june 2009. pmas requires that the department\u2019s it projects adopt an iterative release schedule in which system features are delivered within firm, 6-month (or less) cycles. consistent with the framework, the department established four release dates for the chapter 33 long-term solution. each release was to deploy incremental capabilities that would expand upon previously developed functionality.", "the following table shows va\u2019s planned schedule for deploying the four releases and the associated functionality.", "while va did not originally estimate the total cost to implement the long-term solution, nor estimate its cost by release, as of july 2010, program officials reported actual and planned obligations of approximately $207.1 million through fiscal year 2011.", "to develop and implement the long-term solution according to the planned release schedule, va is using an agile software development approach, which places an emphasis on collaboration between developers and stakeholders and produces a system in an iterative and incremental fashion. agile software development is recognized as having fundamental differences from traditional methods. for example, it is an iterative process in which each output (which can range between 1 and 8 weeks in duration) provides a segment of system functionality that is developed, tested, and demonstrated to users so that early feedback can be considered. a segment of functionality could be a computer screen to display the amount a beneficiary would be entitled to. however, with a traditional approach, the complete product is often delivered at the end of the development phase of the system lifecycle and is not performed in short iterative segments.", "work as one team. in agile development, project participants view themselves as one team aimed at a common goal. however, while the participants should work together as one whole team, there are specific roles on the team.", "team member. the team member\u2019s role often includes programmers, testers,", "focus on business priorities. agile teams demonstrate customer collaboration and commitment to business priorities in two ways. first, the product owner prioritizes and determines the order in which features will be developed. a release plan is then created that states how much work the team can accomplish by a certain date. second, agile teams focus on completing and delivering user-valued features, usually in the form of user stories, which are a way of expressing software requirements. a user story is a brief description of functionality as viewed by a user or customer of the system. user stories are gathered and documented throughout the development process.", "during the iteration, each piece of functionality or feature worked on should be determined to be of releasable quality, before it is presented as completed work. the criteria for making the determination is the definition of done. only work that is completed should be presented during a review meeting that takes place at the end of an iteration. because a single iteration does not usually provide sufficient time to complete enough new functionality to satisfy user or customer desires, a release, which is typically 2 to 6 months and is comprised of one or more iterations, identifies a desired set of functionality and the projected time frame it will be ready for users and customers.", "inspect and adapt. agile teams demonstrate the value of responding to change by incorporating knowledge gained in the preceding iteration and adapting plans accordingly at the start of the next iteration. this is intended to facilitate continuous process improvement. for example, the accuracy of the release plan may be affected by the team\u2019s discovery that it has overestimated or underestimated its rate of progress in that software development is more time consuming; therefore, the release plan should be revisited and updated regularly. further, it may be the case that based on seeing the software from an earlier iteration, the product owner learns that users would like to see more of one type of feature and that they do not value another feature as much as originally planned. the value of the plan could be increased in this case by moving more of the desired features into the release and postponing some of the lesser-valued features. this recognizes that planning is an ongoing process that takes place during the entire project in order to deliver a valuable solution to the users.", "these practices are important to any agile framework, including the one va has chosen to implement called scrum. scrum emphasizes developing software in increments and producing segments of functionality that are tested and demonstrated to users. in addition, scrum teams are interactive and cross-functional in developing these segments throughout each iteration. see attachment i for a discussion of the specific practices and predefined roles within the scrum framework for managing software development.", "va deployed release 1 of the long-term solution on march 31, 2010, as scheduled, providing a limited set of claims examiners at the four regional processing offices the ability to calculate tuition, housing allowance, books, stipends, and fees for processing original awards of education benefits. however, the release did not provide planned functionality to process claims for amended awards or to convert and transfer beneficiary data from systems that were part of the interim solution to systems for the long-term solution. va officials stated that the processing of amended awards and the data conversion task were found to be more complex than they had originally anticipated and therefore, the functionality was delayed for completion in release 2.", "in addition, despite having delayed the conversion of data from the interim solution to the long-term solution until release 2, this task was not completed. as a result, va created a sub-release, release 2.1, with the intent of completing data conversion and adding selected functionality, such as the 2010 housing rate adjustments, by july 26, 2010; however, program officials stated that release 2.1 was actually deployed on august 23, 2010. with this release, program officials stated that approximately 30,000 out of 550,000", "further, program officials stated that the department has not yet decided how the delay of release 2.1 will affect the interfaces that were to be developed in release 3, which is still planned to be deployed by september 30, 2010. as such, program officials stated that they would decide in september how much of the release 3 functionality could be completed by the scheduled date. in addition, they also stated that they have reduced functionality of the system and the self-service capability will not be included as planned in release 4 when it is deployed in december 31, 2010. however, the department plans to provide this self-service capability after release 4 within the long-term system solution or under a separate initiative. the department is in the process of defining what the self- service capability will include.", "to provide effective management for an agile project, such as the development of the chapter 33 long-term solution, a key component for success is demonstrating effective use of the agile practices: working as one team, focusing on business priorities, delivering functionality in short increments, and inspecting and adapting the project as appropriate. while va has taken an important step to effectively manage its development of the system for processing chapter 33 educational benefits by establishing a cross-functional team, it has not yet fully ensured business priorities are a focus, demonstrated that it is delivering quality functionality in short increments, or provided mechanisms to enable inspection and adaptation of the project. as a result, va does not have the visibility it needs to clearly communicate progress to stakeholders and may not be able to generate feedback necessary for effectively establishing project priorities and continuous process improvements.", "va has established a team of executive level management that fulfills the role of the product owner. for example, the team consists primarily of executives and senior managers from vba and the department\u2019s oi&t, who are members of two decision- making bodies for the initiative: the joint executive board and executive steering committee. they meet weekly to discuss the vision and make decisions on functionality, schedule, and cost issues. va has also established additional workgroups that provide daily leadership, oversight, and operations management for the systems development effort and serve as extensions of the product owner to identify and prioritize requirements. (for detailed information about the responsibilities and leadership", "under an agile methodology, to ensure business priorities are a focus, a project starts with a vision of the system that is communicated to the team by the product owner. this vision should clearly state the purpose and goals of the project; the goals should be measurable; and constraints should be identified and prioritized to establish project parameters related to scope, cost, and schedule. in addition, well-defined and managed requirements are a cornerstone of effective system development. according to recognized guidance, disciplined processes for developing and managing requirements can help reduce the risks of developing a system that does not meet user and operational needs. such processes include establishing policies and plans for managing changes to requirements and maintaining bidirectional requirements traceability. as such, the project vision should be traceable to requirements and functionality developed, which is contained in user stories.", "however, the department has not established metrics for the project\u2019s goals, prioritized project constraints, or ensured that requirements were fully traceable to legislation, policies, and business rules. specifically, the goals that va has established do not have metrics for determining the progress towards achieving the goals. for example, for va\u2019s goal to maximize the user experience, the department has not established a quantifiable, numerical target or other measurable value to facilitate future assessments of whether the goal was achieved. as a result, the department does not have the means to compare the projected performance and actual results of this goal.", "va also did not always ensure that requirements for release 2 were traceable. while the department has established a plan that identifies the process that the team is to follow to transform requirements into user stories and the tools it is to utilize to maintain traceability, our review of selected user stories in release 2 found that traceability between legislation, policy, business rules, and test cases was not always maintained and, therefore, could not be verified. for example, requirements in the 20 user stories we reviewed in release 2 were not traceable to legislation, nor were we able to observe how requirements were traceable to all the test cases that covered the complete requirement.", "further, officials acknowledged that the department\u2019s requirement tool did not have the capability to fully establish software traceability for release 2, but that va has since upgraded its tool. the officials stated the department will be able to provide this level of traceability to test cases in future releases. while program officials acknowledged the importance of traceability and the need to improve their process, they have not identified how the department will effectively establish bidirectional traceability between system requirements and legislation, policy, and business rules. until the department can effectively ensure that requirements are fully traceable to legislation, policies, business rules, and test cases it will continue to have a limited ability to reasonably assure that the chapter 33 requirements will be completely met.", "while the department has defined some criteria for work that is considered \u201cdone\u201d at the release level, va has not defined what it means at the user story, iteration, or project level. we observed multiple cases during release 2 development in which user stories were presented as \u201cdone,\u201d but had varying amounts of work completed. for example, at three iteration review meetings, we observed at least one development team that", "with regard to testing, va has established an incremental testing approach that calls for automated unit and functional testing to be conducted on work completed during iterations. in addition, it has also established user acceptance testing that is performed before a release is delivered. nonetheless, we found that the unit and functional testing performed during release 2 was inadequate. specifically, in reviewing the testing conducted for 20 user stories, we identified the testing to be inadequate for 10 of them. for these 10 user stories, we identified a total of 19 deficiencies covering a range of issues.", "for example, 7 user stories were not fully tested for expected values or boundary conditions specified in their associated requirements documents. these testing deficiencies may hinder va\u2019s ability to identify critical defects. va and contractor system development and testing teams subsequently identified a number of defects during release 2. specifically, program officials stated that 218 of the 423 defects that were to be corrected in release 2 were classified as high priority. for example, user acceptance testing found that an award letter included the incorrect date for a student\u2019s enrollment period. program officials stated that all of the high-priority defects were corrected or closed as invalid and that they are working toward correcting the remaining defects in future iterations.", "program officials also stated that they placed higher priority on user acceptance testing at the end of a release and relied on users to identify defects that were not detected during unit and functional testing. however, as we have noted, relying on subject matter experts to perform user acceptance testing is not a realistic solution because it is difficult for them to remember all the items needed for functionality. further, while program officials stated that many of the defects were closed before release 2 was fully deployed, due to the inadequate testing the potential exists for a significant number of additional defects to be found after deployment, thus requiring system rework which can increase costs and affect schedule. until the department improves testing quality, it risks deploying future releases that contain defects which may require rework and extend the completion date for the project. ultimately, this could increase the risk of delayed functionality that would impede the ability for claims examiners to process claims efficiently.", "in order for projects to be effectively inspected and adapted, management must have tools to provide visibility to communicate progress to stakeholders. under the scrum framework, project visibility is achieved through the use of specific tools. for example, progress and the amount of work remaining across the release is demonstrated by a burn-down chart. specifically, a burn-down chart can depict how factors such as the rate at which work is completed (velocity) and changes in overall product scope affect the project over time. this information can be forecasted to estimate how long a release will take to complete. further, when compared to the project rate of work completion, the chart can provide visibility into the actual project status and can be used for continuous process improvement such as increasing the accuracy of estimating story points for future user stories.", "since the department did not use a burn-down chart to report performance over time, management and stakeholders cannot clearly discern the actual amount of work completed relative to the amount of work that was expected to be completed. without this level of visibility in its reporting, management and the development teams may not have all the information they need to fully understand project status and generate the discussion and feedback necessary for continuous process improvement.", "sprint. each team works in iterations that typically last 2 to 4 weeks; these blocks of time are known as sprints. during a sprint, each scrum team creates a potentially shippable product (for example, working and tested software). these products are developed based on the user stories in the product backlog that are prioritized by the product owner and team. each user story is assigned a level of effort, called story points. story points are used as a relative unit of measure to communicate complexity and progress between the business and development sides of the project. each sprint builds on the previous sprint to generate a working system. after a predetermined number of sprints, a release of the system goes into production.", "sprint review. after each sprint, teams demonstrate completed work and discuss work that was not finished with stakeholders. they also identify any problems that were encountered in completing the work. feedback and priority is solicited from stakeholders so that it can be incorporated into future sprints.",
