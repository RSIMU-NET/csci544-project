gap between the actual and targeted number of activated accounts has grown. as of december 15, 2004, cbpmo reports that 347 accounts have been activated. further, cbpmo officials said that they expect rapid growth in activated accounts as release 4 is deployed. the following figure shows the trend in target versus actual accounts activated.", "cbpmo officials stated that they are currently

release 2 longer than planned. these officials also explained that the additional 2 weeks for release 3 integration testing was due to the aforementioned late delivery of test environments, as well as to last minute design and development changes.", "given that critical defects by definition prevent the system from performing mission- essential operations or jeopardize safety and security, among other things, and severe defects prevent the system from working as intended or produce errors that degrade system performance, using criteria that permit one phase of testing to be concluded and another phase to begin, despite having a large number of such problems, introduces unnecessary risk.", "moreover, using such exit criteria represents a significant change from the practice cbpmo followed on prior ace releases, in which trr could not be passed if any critical defects were present, and production readiness review (prr) could not be passed if any critical or severe defects were present. in effect, this change in readiness review exit criteria creates hidden overlap among test phases, as work to resolve defects from a prior phase of testing occurs at the same time that work is under way to execute a subsequent phase of testing. as we have previously reported, such concurrency among test phases has contributed to a recurring pattern of ace release commitments not being met.", "release 3 sat consisted of 28 test cases, all of which reportedly passed successfully. during the sat test period from may 7 to may 27, 2004, 3 critical, 129 severe, and 19 moderate defects were found.", "the exit criteria for release 3 prr also stipulated that all critical and severe defects either be resolved or have work-off plans identified. at the time of the prr on may 28, 2004, cbp reported that 18 severe defects remained open. according to cbp, because these defects were determined not to pose an unacceptable risk to the system, their closure was intentionally delayed until after prr. however, such defects, according to cbpmo\u2019s own definition, preclude the system from working as intended or produce errors that degrade system performance. this is one reason why guidance on effective test practices generally advocates closing such defects before concluding one phase of testing and beginning the next.", "release 3 uat consisted of cbp and trade users executing 19 and 23 test cases, respectively, and rating the release in several areas, again using a 1 to 5 scale (with 1 indicating \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d and 5 indicating \u201cvery satisfied\u201d). the test areas were to address the major functionality that is new or was significantly changed from release 2.", "similar to the trr and prr exit criteria, the criteria for passing release 3 orr stipulated that all critical and severe defects either be resolved or have work-off plans in place at the time of orr. according to cbpmo, all defects that were open at orr either had an acceptable work-around in place, or cbpmo expected that they would not adversely affect the use of the system. however, by definition, severe defects adversely affect system performance, and if an acceptable work- around exists, they are categorized as moderate defects, not severe defects.", "having current and accurate information on system defect density is necessary to adequately understand system maturity and to make informed decisions about allocation of limited resources in meeting competing priorities. since the release 3 orr, available data show that release 3 is operating with longstanding defects and that new defects have not been closed. for example, the defect data as of november 30, 2004, show that 18 defects that were open at trr were still open (11 moderate and 7 minor); 33 defects open at prr were still open (16 moderate and 17 minor); and 92 defects open at orr were still open (2 severe, 43 moderate, and 47 minor). in addition, the data show that 43 defects opened since orr (23 severe, 8 moderate, and 12 minor) were still open as of november 30, 2004. however, cbpmo officials told us that these data are not reliable because the focus has been on completing release 4 testing and pilot activities, at the expense of keeping release 3 defect data current and accurate. as a result, cbpmo does not currently have a complete picture of the maturity of each of its releases so that it can make internal resource allocation decisions.", "observation 4: release 4 test phases were delayed and overlapped, and revealed a higher than expected volume and significance of defects, raising questions about decisions to pass key milestones and about the state of system maturity.", "as previously discussed, each ace release is subject to sit and sat, which are conducted by ecp. each release also undergoes uat, which is conducted by cbp. generally, the purpose of these tests is to identify defects or problems in either meeting defined system requirements or in satisfying system user needs. defects are documented as ptrs that are classified by severity. the four severity levels are (1) critical, (2) severe, (3) moderate, and (4) minor.", "the following figure depicts the estimated and actual release 4 defects according to their severity level.", "the following figure depicts the total number of expected release 4 defects in comparison to the actual number of defects identified.", "further, the testing schedule planned to have no concurrency between sit and sat. however, sit and sat were actually conducted concurrently, which as we previously reported, increases risk and contributed to past ace cost and schedule problems (see next slide). according to program officials, rather than waiting for sit to be fully completed before starting sat, they began sat on release 4 functionality that successfully completed sit.", "the following graph shows the number of defects open each week during release 4 testing.", "observation 5: performance against the revised cost and schedule estimates for releases 3 and 4 has been mixed.", "the chart on the following slide illustrates the cumulative cost variance on release 3 and 4 since the otb was established.", "as shown below, the release 3 and 4 contract was about $1.8 million under budget in september 2004 and about $1.4 million under budget in october 2004. ecp attributed the recent slip in cost performance to additional resources being needed to complete release 4 testing and to resolve release 4 defects.", "release 3 and 4 cumulative cost variance, april to october 2004", "in contrast, release 3 and 4 contract performance has continued to fall short of the schedule otb (see below).", "release 3 and 4 cumulative schedule variance, april to october 2004", "while cost performance on release 3 and 4 has been positive since the new baseline was established, schedule performance has not. in order to meet release 4 schedule commitments, resources have been held on release 4 longer than planned to complete testing and resolve defects. while this has resulted in an improvement in schedule performance in september and october 2004, it has also contributed to a slip in cost performance in october 2004. continuing to devote extra resources to meet the release 4 schedule could further impact the currently positive cost variance.", "observation 6: the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan does not adequately describe progress against commitments (e.g., ace capabilities, schedule, cost, and benefits) made in previous plans.", "as we have previously reported, to permit meaningful congressional oversight, it is important that expenditure plans describe how well cbp is progressing against the commitments made in prior expenditure plans.1 however, the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan did not adequately describe such progress. in particular, in its fiscal year 2004 expenditure plan, cbpmo committed to, for example,", "defining and designing the ace release (designated release 6 at the time)", "observation 7: some key bases for the commitments made in the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan have changed, raising questions as to the plan\u2019s currency and relevance.", "recent program developments and program changes have altered some key bases (e.g., assumptions, release construct, organizational change management approach, and roles and responsibilities) of the ace program plan, and thus the current expenditure plan. as a result, questions arise as to the extent to which the expenditure plan\u2019s commitments remain current and relevant.", "following the program plan\u2019s approval, initial development of release 5 began (e.g., planning for the release, negotiations to enhance the sap product, development of release initiation documents, conduct of release functionality workshops). however, cbpmo has recently decided not to use sap to provide the multimodal manifest functionality, thus rendering a key assumption in the program plan and the expenditure plan invalid. cbpmo has since suspended all work to develop the multimodal manifest functionality until a new approach to developing it is established. according to ace officials, this change is intended to result in providing the multimodal manifest functionality faster and at lower cost.", "in october, cbpmo defined high-level functional requirements for release 4.1, and it is currently defining more detailed requirements. however, this additional release, including its scope, costs, and schedule, are not reflected in the current ace program plan or the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan. according to program officials, any enhancement releases will not be reflected in the program plan until its next major update (august 2005), which is after cbpmo anticipates having implemented release 4.1, and the first expenditure plan that could recognize it is the fiscal year 2006 plan.", "ace officials also stated that the costs of release 4.1 and any additional releases will be funded by operations and maintenance funds provided for in the expenditure plan.", "on august 10, 2004, a revised organizational change approach was introduced. this new approach introduces new change management activities. as of november 2004, some of these activities are being or are planned to be implemented.", "moreover, because the ace funding request for fiscal year 2005 did not fully reflect the revised approach to managing organizational change, key actions associated with the revised approach are not planned for implementation in fiscal year 2005. for example, one key action was to establish and communicate ace usage targets, which would both encourage ace usage and permit performance to be measured. this is important, according to ecp, because users may continue to rely on acs, which would preclude accrual of full ace benefits. cbpmo officials stated that each of the key actions that will not be implemented introduces risks that must be mitigated. formal program risks and associated mitigation plans are currently under development. the following slide summarizes change management actions in the revised approach that are not planned for implementation and their associated risks.", "according to cbpmo officials, these respective roles and responsibilities are being realigned so that cbpmo and ecp will share ace development duties. that is, cbpmo will be responsible for certain ace development and deployment efforts as well as for oversight of the development efforts for which ecp will retain responsibility. ecp will also provide support to cbpmo\u2019s development efforts.", "nevertheless, this change in approach is significant, and thus it is important that it be managed carefully. as we previously reported, effective management of a large- scale systems modernization program, like ace, requires a clear allocation of the respective roles and responsibilities of the government and the contractor,1 particularly with regard to responsibility for integrating system components developed by different parties. the extent to which these are made explicit and unambiguous will go a long way in ensuring proper accountability for performance.", "additionally, while dhs has taken important actions to help address ace release- by-release cost and schedule overruns that we previously identified, it is unlikely that the effect of these actions will prevent the past pattern of overruns from recurring. this is because dhs has met its recently revised cost and schedule commitments in part by relaxing system quality standards, so that milestones are being passed despite material system defects, and because correcting such defects will ultimately require the program to expend resources, such as people and test environments, at the expense of later system releases (some of which are now under way).", "during the last year, dhs\u2019s accountability for ace has been largely focused on meeting its cost and schedule baselines. this focus is revealed by the absence of information in the latest expenditure plan on progress against all commitments made in prior plans, particularly with regard to measurement and reporting on such things as system capabilities, use, and benefits. it is also shown by the program\u2019s insufficient focus on system quality, as demonstrated by its willingness to pass milestones despite material defects, and by the absence of attention to the current defect profile for release 3 (which is already deployed).", "moreover, the commitments that dhs made in the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan have been overcome by events, which limits the currency and relevance of this plan and its utility to the congress as an accountability mechanism. as a result, the prospects of greater accountability in delivering against its capability, benefit, cost, and schedule commitments are limited. therefore, it is critically important that dhs define for itself and the congress an accountability framework for ace, and that it manage and report in accordance with this framework. if it does not, the effects of the recent rebaselining of the program will be short lived, and the past pattern of ace costing more and taking longer than planned will continue.", "to strengthen accountability for the ace program and better ensure that future ace releases deliver promised capabilities and benefits within budget and on time, we recommend that the dhs secretary, through the under secretary for border and transportation security, direct the commissioner, customs and border protection, to define and implement an ace accountability framework that ensures", "in their oral comments on a draft of this briefing, dhs and
