in 2006 , the united states and canada signed the softwood lumber agreement . the agreement , among other things , imposed export charges and quotas on canadian lumber exports to the united states . to assist in monitoring compliance with the agreement , in 2008 congress passed the softwood lumber act , which imposed several data collection and analysis requirements on the department of homeland security 's u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and required two reports from gao . this report discusses cbp 's processes for meeting the act 's requirements and how these requirements contribute to u.s. efforts to monitor compliance with the 2006 softwood lumber agreement . gao issued a report in june 2009 on u.s. agency efforts to monitor compliance with the 2006 agreement . this report includes an update on these efforts . gao analyzed information from relevant u.s. agencies , interviewed knowledgeable officials , and discussed these issues with u.s. and canadian industry representatives . cbp has developed processes to reconcile and verify data provided by the exporter and importer as required by the act , but officials acknowledge continuing issues with data quality . cbp reconciles aggregated export prices from the u.s. entry forms with aggregated export prices from canadian export permits . to meet the act 's verification requirement that the importer has correctly reported the export price , the tax to be paid by exporters to the canadian government ( the export charge ) , and other information , cbp has created a process within its existing data system to collect these data . however , cbp has acknowledged continuing problems with data quality . for example , cbp port officials manually enter data into this system , which could lead to miscoding . cbp reported that the initial implementation of the act required extensive effort for the agency , but officials stated that ongoing activities need fewer resources . according to cbp , department of commerce , and office of u.s. trade representative officials , the information produced through the reconciliation and verification requirements under the act adds little assurance of compliance with the 2006 softwood lumber agreement . some of the act 's requirements are to ensure the proper operation of international agreements on softwood lumber and enforcement of these obligations . the agreement with canada contains mechanisms for monitoring compliance , and , according to u.s. government officials , the added requirements of the 2008 u.s. legislation do not provide the u.s. government with additional assurance of compliance with the bilateral trade agreement . specifically , cbp officials told gao the requirements under the act do not provide the united states with assurance that the canadian exporter paid the export charge , because the united states does not have access to company - level tax data from canada . while the agreement is scheduled to expire in 2013 , the act does not have an expiration date . cbp officials said they have not yet determined how they will fulfill their requirements under the act when the agreement expires , but they would no longer have the estimated export charge data that are used in implementing the act .
