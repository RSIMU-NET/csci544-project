pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the department of defense 's ( dod ) voluntary disclosure program , focusing on the : extent to which defense contractors participate in the program ; amount of money that has been recovered under the program ; time taken to close disclosure cases ; most common type of disclosures ; and extent of overlap between voluntary disclosures and qui tam actions . gao found that : although 48 of the top 100 defense contractors have made voluntary disclosures , the total number of disclosures under the program has been relatively small and dollar recoveries have been modest ; from its inception in 1986 through september 1994 , dod reported that , of the thousands of defense contractors , 138 contractors made 325 voluntary disclosures of potential procurement fraud ; dod reported recoveries from these disclosures to be $ 290 million , about 17 percent of total reported dod procurement fraud recoveries between fiscal years ( fy ) 1987 and 1994 ; gao 's review indicated that dod 's reported recoveries of $ 290 million were overstated because they included $ 75 million in premature progress payments and amounts from disclosures made prior to the program ; further , dod accepted some disclosures into the program that the justice department believed were triggered by imminent government discovery and thus did not meet the criteria for admission ; voluntary disclosure cases took an average of 2.8 years to close , with about 25 percent taking over 4 years ; open cases are taking longer ; as of september 1994 , dod data showed that open cases averaged 3.5 years , with over half of the cases disclosed in fy 1990 still open ; less than full contractor cooperation with the government and low priority given by dod and other investigative agencies to managing cases expeditiously may be problems in some cases ; most disclosures did not result in significant dollar recoveries for the government ; of 129 closed cases , 81 cases , or about 63 percent , had reported recoveries of less than $ 100,000 , of which 52 cases , or 40 percent , had no dollar recoveries ; forty - eight cases had reported recoveries of $ 100,000 or more , of which 15 cases had reported recoveries of $ 2 million or more ; there is little overlap between voluntary disclosures and qui tam actions ; and of the 129 voluntary disclosure cases closed since the program began , 4 involved qui tam actions .
