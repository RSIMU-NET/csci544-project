under the health center program , hrsa provides grants to eligible health centers . hrsa is responsible for overseeing over 1,100 health center grantees to ensure their compliance with health center program requirements . gao was asked to examine hrsas oversight . this report describes hrsas oversight process and assesses the extent to which the process identifies and addresses noncompliance with what hrsa refers to as the 19 key program requirements . gao reviewed and analyzed hrsas policies and procedures and available programwide data related to hrsa 's oversight of health centers , interviewed hrsa officials , and reviewed documentation of hrsas oversight from 8 selected grantees that varied in their compliance experience , as well as other factors . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) relies on three main methods to oversee grantees compliance with the 19 key program requirements . annual compliance reviews . hrsa project officers review available information , including that submitted by grantees , to determine whether the grantee is in compliance with each of the 19 program requirements . site visits . hrsa and its consultants visit grantees to review documentation , meet with officials , and tour the health center . some of these visits are intended to assess compliance with some or all program requirements . routine communications . project officers communicate with grantees via phone and e - mail to learn about issues that may affect their compliance . when hrsa identifies noncompliance with program requirements , it uses a process , implemented in april 2010 , to address this with a grantee . this process provides a grantee with defined time frames for addressing any identified noncompliance . if a grantee is unable to correct the compliance issue by the end of the process , hrsas policy is to terminate the health centers grant . hrsas ability to identify grantees noncompliance with health center program requirements is insufficient . hrsa does not require project officers to document their basis for determining that a grantee is in compliance with a requirement . when project officers are uncertain about compliance , hrsa instructs them to consider a grantee in compliance and to note the lack of certainty in a text field of their evaluation tool . however , hrsa has no centralized mechanism to ensure this occurs . thus , it is unclear whether project officers ' decisions that a grantee is in compliance with a requirement are because there was sufficient evidence demonstrating compliance or the project officer failed to document that compliance was uncertain . the number of compliance - related visits conducted may be limited . hrsas available data indicates that only 11 percent of grantees had a compliance - related site visit from january through october 2011 ; less than half of which had a visit that assessed compliance with all 19 program requirements . hrsas project officers do not consistently identify and document grantee noncompliance . project officers gao interviewed had different interpretations of what constitutes compliance with some program requirements and therefore when they should cite a grantee for noncompliance . hrsas process for addressing grantee noncompliance with program requirements seems to provide both the agency and grantees with a uniform structure for addressing noncompliance . however , the extent to which this process is adequately resolving grantee noncompliance or terminating grantee funding is unclear because hrsas experience with this process is too recent for gao to make an overall assessment . gao recommends that , among other things , hrsa improve its documentation of compliance decisions , strengthen its ability to consistently identify and cite grantee noncompliance , and periodically assess whether its new process for addressing grantee noncompliance is working as intended . hhs concurred with all of gaos recommendations , and stated that hrsa has already begun implementing many of them . hhs , however , did not concur with what it characterized as certain conclusions drawn from the findings . hhs based its comments on only some of the evidence . gaos analysis of all the evidence and hrsas planned implementation of the recommendations confirm the validity of the findings and conclusions .
