gao reviewed the department of energy 's ( doe ) progress in characterizing its tank waste at its hanford site , focusing on : whether it has met its characterization deadlines ; the impediments to meeting characterization deadlines ; and the impact that continued delays have on the characterization process . gao found that : over the past 10 years , doe has spent over $ 260 million and made little definitive progress in characterizing the tank wastes at hanford ; doe has not been able to meet characterization deadlines for the 54 tanks with known safety problems ; the doe contractor has been unable to characterize any of the 177 tanks as ready for remediation ; doe and its contractor have had problems performing reliable top - to - bottom samples , gathering sampling data , reconciling tank contents , and developing an effective tank characterization management system ; disagreement exists as to what kind and how much information is needed to reliably predict actual waste quantities and build appropriate treatment facilities ; congress , doe , and private contractors need better sampling and characterization information to reliably predict total program costs ; and these uncertainties could undermine the savings doe expects to realize by privatizing the tank waste remediation program .
