the united states has engaged in multiple efforts in afghanistan , iraq , and syria since declaring a global war on terrorism in 2001. currently , in afghanistan , iraq , and syria , u.s. forces are deployed under force management levels set by the administration . force management levels and similar caps limit the number of u.s. military personnel deployed to a given region and have been a factor in military operations at least since the vietnam war . force management levels were also used to shape the drawdowns of operations in afghanistan and iraq . in june 2016 , the president announced that the force management level for afghanistan is 9,800. according to dod , in september 2016 the united states authorized additional troops for iraq and syria , for a total of 5,262. today 's testimony discusses some of the actions dod has taken to maximize military capabilities while operating under force management levels in ongoing operations . in preparing this statement , gao relied on previously published work related to operations in afghanistan , iraq , and syria since 2001. military officials planning for and executing operations under force management levels have taken various actions to maximize military capabilities deployed to countries under those limits , as discussed below : increased engagement with partner nation security forces . the department of defense ( dod ) has increased its engagement with partner nations through advise - and - assist missions that rely on partner nation security forces to conduct operations . while this action helps leverage u.s. resources , it can create complications for u.s. planners in terms of allocating capabilities and resources . in 2011 , gao reported that the army and marine corps have faced challenges in providing the necessary field grade officers and specialized capabilities for advisor teams , as well as challenges regarding the effect on the readiness and training of brigades whose combat teams have been split up to source advisor teams . gao made three recommendations related to advisor teams . dod concurred and implemented two recommendations relating to improving the ability of advisor teams to prepare for and execute their mission . reliance on airpower . dod has relied on u.s. and coalition airpower to provide support to partner nation ground forces in lieu of u.s. ground combat capabilities . for example , since u.s. operations related to the islamic state of iraq and syria ( isis ) began in august 2014 , coalition members have dropped more than 57,000 munitions . air - based intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance systems have also proved critical to commanders by providing them timely and accurate information . while effective , this reliance on air power is not without its costs or challenges . for example , the secretary of defense stated in february 2016 that the intensity of the u.s. air campaign against isis has been depleting u.s. stocks of certain weapons . increased pace of u.s. special operations deployments . dod has increased its use of u.s. special operations forces to increase its operational reach and maximize its capabilities under force management levels . however , the increased use of u.s. special operations forces in operations has resulted in a high pace of deployments which can affect readiness , retention , and morale . gao made 10 recommendations to dod related to u.s. special operations forces . dod concurred or partially concurred and has implemented 7 recommendations relating to security force assistance activities and readiness of u.s. special operations forces . increased use of contractors and personnel on temporary duty . dod relies on contractors to support a wide range of military operations and free up uniformed personnel to directly support mission needs . during operations in afghanistan and iraq contractor personnel played a critical role in supporting u.s. troops and sometimes exceeded the number of deployed military personnel . however , the increased use of contractors and temporary personnel to provide support during operations has its challenges , including oversight of contractors in deployed environments . gao made four recommendations to improve oversight of operational contract support . dod concurred with all four , and has implemented three of them . gao also made a recommendation that dod develop guidance relating to costs of overseas operations , with which dod partially concurred and which remains open . gao made 18 recommendations in prior work cited in this statement . dod has implemented 12 of them . continued attention is needed to ensure that some recommendations are addressed , such as improving visibility in total special operations funding to determine whether opportunities exist to balance deployments across the joint force .
