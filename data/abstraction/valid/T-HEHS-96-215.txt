gao discussed the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) efforts to provide health care quality information to medicare beneficiaries joining health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) . gao noted that : corporate purchasers use accreditation and performance measurement monitoring to ensure that hmo furnish quality health care ; hcfa is starting to use similar methods to ensure hmo quality ; while the use of performance measurement indicators has become popular , such indicators may not be reliable or comparable , and may not be valid measures of quality ; 60 percent of large corporations consider hmo accreditation status by the national committee for quality assurance ( ncqa ) , before contracting with hmo ; ncqa developed a set of standardized information on hmo focusing on provider actions , rather than patient care outcomes ; ncqa recently released in draft form a set of measures based on patient care outcomes ; hcfa has joined with a group of corporate purchasers to develop another set of standardized outcome measures ; hcfa uses a qualification review program similar to accreditation , along with peer review , to assess health care organizations ' quality ; and hcfa does not routinely make quality assessment information available to medicare beneficiaries .
