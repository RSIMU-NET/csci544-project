harmful invasive species -- nonnative plants and animals that are spreading throughout the united states -- have caused billions of dollars in damage to natural areas , businesses , and consumers . in 2001 , the federal government issued a national invasive species management plan to focus attention on invasive species and coordinate a national control effort involving the 20 or so federal agencies that are responsible for managing them . this report discusses the economic impacts of invasive species , implementation of the management plan , and coordination of u.s. and canadian efforts to control invasive species , including those introduced to the great lakes via the ballast water of ships . existing literature on the economic impacts of invasive species is of limited usefulness to decision makers , although it indicates that the effects of invasive species are significant . most economic estimates do not consider all of the relevant effects of nonnative species or the future risks that they pose . new initiatives may prompt more comprehensive analysis that could help decision makers make better resource allocations . while the national invasive species management plan calls for many actions that are likely to contribute to preventing and controlling invasive species in the united states , it does not clearly articulate specific long - term goals toward which the government should strive . in addition , the federal government has made little progress in implementing the actions called for by the plan . even with high levels of compliance , u.s. regulations have not eliminated the introduction of invasive species into the great lakes via the ballast water of ships . the united states and canada are working on strengthening the existing control system , but developing stronger regulations and the technology needed to meet them will take many years . the continued introduction of invasive species could have high economic and ecological costs for the great lakes .
