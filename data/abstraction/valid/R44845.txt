the william d. ford federal direct loan ( direct loan ) program , authorized under title iv , part d of the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ) , is the primary federal student loan program . it makes available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students to help them finance postsecondary education expenses . as of the end of fy2016 , there was approximately $ 949.1 billion in outstanding direct loan program loans . direct loan program administrative expenses totaled approximately $ 771 million in fy2016 . under the direct loan program , the federal government essentially serves as the banker by providing loans to students and their families using federal capital and assuming the risk of loss against borrower default . in addition , the federal government , via the u.s. department of education 's office of federal student aid ( fsa ) , manages the outstanding loan portfolio and is responsible for the program 's administration . fsa is primarily responsible for developing the administrative functions and processes and performing oversight activities for the direct loan program to enable its day - to - day operation . additional parties , including institutions of higher education ( ihes ) , contracted loan servicers , and contracted private collection agencies ( pcas ) , perform many of the routine administrative tasks for the program . the first step in administering a direct loan is processing a student 's free application for federal student aid ( fafsa ) . after a student has completed his or her fafsa , fsa 's automated systems process the application and make an initial determination regarding a student 's eligibility for federal student aid . ihes then receive the processed information and take a variety of steps to award financial aid , including direct loans , to the student . steps taken by the ihe at this point include packaging available aid for the student , originating and disbursing any direct loans the student is eligible for and has accepted , and managing direct loan program funds available to the institution . after a borrower 's direct loan is disbursed , the loan is then assigned to one of multiple loan servicers with which fsa has contracted . functions performed by loan servicers vary depending on the loan 's status ( e.g . , repayment , grace period ) and individual borrower circumstances ; however , there are several tasks loan servicers typically perform . these include providing information to borrowers on loan terms and conditions , collecting and applying loan payments to outstanding balances , processing requests for loan deferment or forbearance , processing applications to consolidate federal student loans into a direct consolidation loan , and providing delinquency and default prevention activities . if a borrower defaults after entering repayment on a direct loan , then a variety of actions may be taken to attempt to reinstate the loan into good standing and recover payment on it . loan servicers provide initial outreach to defaulted borrowers and attempt to enter into repayment or rehabilitation agreements with them . if the loan servicer is unsuccessful , a borrower 's defaulted loan is transferred to fsa and then may also be transferred to one of multiple pcas with which fsa has contracted . fsa and pcas will attempt to enter into voluntary repayment agreements with borrowers ; however , a variety of other debt collection tools may also be used if these attempts are unsuccessful . for instance , a borrower may be determined eligible for administrative wage garnishment or income tax offset . if a borrower successfully brings his or her loan into good standing , the account is transferred back to a loan servicer , which will continue to service it .
