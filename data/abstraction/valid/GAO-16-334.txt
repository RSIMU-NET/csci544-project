in 2013 , about 285,000 individuals age 12 or older were reported victims of sexual assault , according to the bureau of justice statistics . studies have shown that exams performed by sexual assault forensic examiners — medical providers trained in collecting and preserving forensic evidence — may result in better physical and mental health care for victims , better evidence collection , and higher prosecution rates . yet , concerns have been raised about the availability of examiners . the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 authorized funding for doj grant programs that can be used by states and other eligible entities , such as nonprofit organizations , to train and fund examiners . gao was asked to review the availability of examiners nationwide . in this report , gao describes the prevalence and use of federal grants to train or fund sexual assault forensic examiners , what is known about the availability of such examiners nationwide and in selected states , and the challenges selected states face in maintaining a supply of examiners . gao analyzed 2013 doj data on grantees ' use of funding to train or fund examiners — the most recent full year of data available — and reviewed literature , relevant laws and doj documentation . gao also interviewed grantees in six states selected based on several factors including population and geographic location , as well as doj officials , department of health and human services officials , and experts , such as health care association officials . federal funding from three key department of justice ( doj ) grant programs can be used to train or fund sexual assault forensic examiners and for a range of other activities related to sexual assault , domestic violence , dating violence , and stalking . in 2013 , at least one grantee in 49 states used such funds to provide training to examiners and at least one grantee in 26 states funded examiner positions . in 49 states , approximately 227 grantees or subgrantees — referred to collectively as grantees — reported providing training for over 6,000 examiners in 2013. the type of training examiners received ranged from comprehensive examiner training to training on specific topics , such as courtroom testimony . the extent of examiner training efforts supported with funds from the three doj grant programs varied by state . for example , in about half of the states , fewer than 100 examiners received training . in addition , in the states where at least one grantee funded examiner staff positions in 2013 , grantees funded less than one position , on average . approximately 75 grantees in 26 states funded roughly 50 full - time equivalent examiner positions in 2013. on the basis of literature gao reviewed as well as interviews with experts and state officials , data on the number of examiners nationwide and in selected states are limited or unavailable . however , officials in all six selected states told gao that the number of examiners available in their state did not meet the need for exams , especially in rural areas . for example , officials in wisconsin explained that nearly half of all counties in the state do not have any examiners available . in health care facilities where examiners are available , they are typically available in hospitals on an on - call basis , though the number available varies by facility and may not provide enough capacity to offer examiner coverage 24 hours , 7 days a week . there are multiple challenges to maintaining a supply of examiners , according to interviews with officials in six selected states . these include : limited availability of training . officials in five of six selected states reported that the availability of classroom , clinical , and continuing education training opportunities is a challenge to maintaining a supply of trained examiners . weak stakeholder support for examiners . officials in five of six selected states reported that obtaining support from stakeholders , such as hospitals , was a challenge . for example , hospitals may be reluctant to cover the costs of training examiners or paying for examiners to be on - call . low examiner retention rates . the above - mentioned and other challenges , including the emotional and physical demands on examiners , contribute to low examiner retention rates . officials in one state estimated that while the state trained 540 examiners over a two - year period , only 42 of those examiners were still practicing in the state at the end of those 2 years . officials described strategies that can help address these challenges , such as implementing web - based training courses , clinical practice labs , mentorship programs , and multidisciplinary teams that respond to cases of sexual assault . doj provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
