scientific and technological innovation contributes to u.s. economic competitiveness and prosperity . federal agencies support transformational technological advances — those that result in new or significantly enhanced technologies — by , for example , funding research ( nearly $ 70 billion in obligations in fiscal year 2017 ) . gao was asked to examine support for research that could lead to transformational technological advances . this report describes federal agencies ' and nonfederal entities ' support for such research in selected areas , examines federal agencies ' coordination on this research , and describes experts ' views on considerations for maintaining u.s. competitiveness through such advances . gao selected quantum computing and synthetic biology as examples of research areas that could lead to transformational technological advances . gao reviewed agency documents and interviewed federal officials , subject matter experts , and stakeholders . gao also worked with the national academies of sciences , engineering , and medicine to convene a meeting to solicit views from 19 experts selected from government , academia , and industry , among others . multiple federal and nonfederal entities support research for transformational technological advances in the areas of quantum computing — the manipulation of bits of data using the behavior of individual atoms , molecules , or other quantum systems to potentially outperform supercomputers — and synthetic biology — the combination of biology and engineering to create or modify biological systems . gao found that at least 6 agencies support quantum computing research ; at least 10 agencies support synthetic biology research ; and nonfederal entities , such as universities and businesses , support research in both areas . agency officials said they coordinate on quantum computing and synthetic biology through efforts such as conferences and interagency groups , but gao found that certain new efforts have not fully implemented selected leading collaboration practices . the quantum computing group , co - chaired by officials from 4 agencies , and the synthetic biology group , led by the national science foundation , have taken initial steps to implement some leading practices gao identified that can enhance and sustain interagency collaboration . for example , both groups agreed to coordinate their research , and participating agencies documented agreement with the quantum computing group 's purpose through a charter . however , the groups have not fully implemented other practices , such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities and identifying common outcomes , that could help ensure they effectively marshal agencies ' efforts to maintain u.s. competitiveness in quantum computing and synthetic biology . experts identified considerations for maintaining u.s. competitiveness through transformational technological advances . the considerations broadly address federal and nonfederal entities ' roles in supporting such advances and include : developing a strategic approach using consortia or other mechanisms to bring together potential partners ; fostering an environment in which information is shared among researchers while also considering the risks of information sharing ; focusing on technology development and commercialization , for example , by providing support across multiple stages of technology innovation ; and strengthening the science and technology workforce through training , recruiting , and retaining talent . gao recommends that the agencies leading the interagency quantum computing and synthetic biology groups take steps to fully implement leading collaboration practices . the agencies agreed with gao 's recommendations .
