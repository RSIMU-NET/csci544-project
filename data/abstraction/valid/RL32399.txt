the united states now has a unified inspections operation at the borders ; a single inspectoris charged with examining people , animals , plants , goods , and cargo upon entry to the country . thetransfer of these functions to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) marks a significant policyshift for all of these functions , clarifying that -- although there are important commercial , economic , health , humanitarian , and immigration responsibilities -- ensuring the security of our borders is thetop priority . the decision by dhs officials to further integrate the inspection duties so that there is '' one face at the border '' now means that customs and border protection ( cbp ) inspectors areessentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections . a range of legal , administrative , and policy issues have emerged with unified border inspections . legislationimplementing the 9 / 11 commission recommendations -- the national intelligence reform act of2004 ( p.l . 108-458 ) -- had various provisions affecting border inspections . cbp inspectors are charged with enforcing a host of laws . immigration law requires theinspection of all aliens who seek entry into the united states , and every person is inspected todetermine citizenship status and admissibility . all goods being imported into the united states aresubject to a customs inspection , but an actual physical inspection of all goods is not required . therealso are laws that subject animals and plants to border inspections . this report provides a discussionof these various laws and the procedural differences in what constitutes an `` inspection . . border inspections conducted each year number in the hundreds of millions . prior to thecreation of cbp , the department of justice 's immigration inspectors did most passenger inspections -- peaking at 534 million in fy2000 -- since all foreign nationals seeking entry into the united statesmust be inspected . in terms of customs inspections , approximately 22.6 % of rail containers ; 5.2 % of sea containers ; and 15.1 % of trucks entering the united states were physically inspected . unlikecustoms and immigration inspections data , animal and plant health inspections data enumerate onlythose passengers referred to secondary inspections for the purpose of an agricultural inspection . there were 44 million animal and plant inspections in fy2002 . border inspections are funded through a combination of federal discretionary appropriationsand user fees . in fy2004 , cbp was given budget authority of $ 2,496 million for border security , inspections , and trade facilitation at ports of entry . historic funding data for inspections are notcomparable across the `` legacy '' agencies as the budget data often included activities in addition tothe inspection functions . some argue that this reorganization of border inspections has been long needed and isresulting in a more streamlined and efficient set of procedures at the border with a clear , single , chainof command . others warn that the different types of inspections are quite complex in their own rightand that the reorganization is exacerbating the conflicting priorities at the border , ultimately resultingin many more people and goods being sent to secondary inspections . key policy staff : border inspection .
