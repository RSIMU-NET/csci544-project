in a speech on march 14 , 2002 , at the inter - american development bank , president bush outlined a proposal for the united states to increase foreign economic assistance beginning infy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be $ 5 billion higher than three years earlier . thenew funds , which would supplement the roughly $ 16.3 billion economic aid budget for fy2003 , would be placed in a separate fund -- millennium challenge account ( mca ) -- and be availableon a competitive basis to a few countries that have demonstrated a commitment to sounddevelopment policies and where u.s. support is believed to have the best opportunities for achievingthe intended results . these `` best - performers '' would be selected based on their records in three areas -- ruling justly , investing in people , and pursuing sound economic policies . development of a new foreign aid initiative by the bush administration was influenced by a number of factors , including the widely perceived poor track record of past aid programs , recentevidence that the existence of certain policies by aid recipients may be more important for successthan the amount of resources invested , the war on terrorism , and the march 2002 u.n. - sponsoredinternational conference on financing for development in monterrey , mexico . the mca initiative is limited to countries with per capita incomes below $ 2,935 , although in the first two years -- fy2004 and fy2005 -- only countries below the $ 1,415 level would competefor mca resources . participants will be selected based on a transparent evaluation of a country'sperformance on 16 economic and political indicators , divided into three clusters corresponding tothe three policy areas of governance , economic policy , and investment in people . eligible countriesmust score above the median on half of the indicators in each area . one indicator -- control ofcorruption -- is a pass / fail measure : a country must score above the median on this single measureor be excluded from further consideration . the administration proposed to create a new entity -- the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) -- to manage the initiative . the mcc would be supervised by a board of directors chairedby the secretary of state . several other key issues , including the number of participating countriesand monitoring mechanisms , have yet to be determined . congress plays a key role in the policy initiative by considering authorization and funding legislation , and confirming the head of the proposed mcc . a number of issues have been addressedin the congressional debate , including country eligibility criteria , performance indicators used toselect participants , creation of the new mcc , and budget considerations . congress approvedlegislation ( division d of p.l . 108-199 ) authorizing the new program and appropriating $ 994million for the first year . the measure creates a corporation , as proposed , but alters the compositionand size of the board of directors . it further limits the extent to which lower - middle incomecountries in fy2006 and beyond can participate in the mca so that more resources will be availablefor the poorest nations . the legislation creates a roughly 90-day period after the corporation isestablished for consultation and public comment before selecting mca participants for fy2004 . it is expected that the board will name the initial mca eligible countries in may 2004 .
