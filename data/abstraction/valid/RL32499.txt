according to the u.s. state department 2007 international narcotics control strategy report , `` saudi donors and unregulated charities have been a major source of financing to extremist and terrorist groups over the past 25 years . . the september 11 , 2001 attacks fueled criticisms within the united states of alleged saudi involvement in terrorism or of saudi laxity in acting against terrorist groups . the final report released by the bipartisan national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the 9 / 11 commission ) indicates that the commission `` found no evidence that the saudi government as an institution or senior saudi officials individually funded [ al qaeda ] . . the report also states , however , that saudi arabia `` was a place where al qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through charities '' and indicates that `` charities with significant saudi government sponsorship '' may have diverted funding to al qaeda . u.s. officials remain concerned that saudis continue to fund al qaeda and other terrorist groups . in april 2008 , undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence stuart levey told the senate finance committee that the saudi government is `` serious about fighting al qaeda in the kingdom , and they do , '' and argued that saudi officials ' `` seriousness of purpose with respect to the money going out of the kingdom is not as high . . he added , `` saudi arabia today remains the location from which more money is going to terror groups and the taliban — sunni terror groups and the taliban — than from any other place in the world . . saudi officials insist that their counter - terrorist financing efforts are robust and are not limited to targeting domestic threats . in numerous official statements , saudi leaders have said they are committed to cooperating with the united states in fighting terrorist financing , pointing out that saudi arabia has been a victim of terrorism and shares the u.s. interest in combating it . saudi leaders acknowledge providing financial support for islamic and palestinian causes , but maintain that no official saudi support goes to any terrorist organizations , such as hamas . al qaeda affiliated terrorist attacks in saudi arabia from 2003 to 2006 appear to have given added impetus to the saudi leadership in expanding counter - terrorist financing efforts . since mid - 2003 , the saudi government has : set up a joint task force with the united states to investigate terrorist financing in saudi arabia ; shuttered some charitable organizations suspected of terrorist ties ; passed anti - money laundering legislation ; banned cash collections at mosques ; centralized control over some charities ; closed unlicensed money exchanges ; and scrutinized clerics involved in charitable collections . a planned national commission for relief and charity work abroad has not been established . as required by the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( p.l . 108-458 ) and the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act ( p.l . 110-53 ) , president bush has submitted strategies for u.s. - saudi collaboration , with special reference to combating terrorist financing . for more information about saudi arabia , see crs report rl33533 , saudi arabia : background and u.s. relations , by [ author name scrubbed ] . this report will be updated to reflect major developments .
