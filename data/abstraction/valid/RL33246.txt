the reading first program was authorized as part of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) through the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) . the nclba was signed into law on january 8 , 2002 , and will expire at the end of fy2008 ( including the automatic general education provisions act one - year extension ) . it is expected that the 110th congress will consider legislation to reauthorize the esea . reading first was drafted with the intent of incorporating scientifically based reading research ( sbrr ) on what works in teaching reading to improve and expand k - 3 reading programs to address concerns about student reading achievement and to reach children at younger ages . by the end of october 2003 , all states and the district of columbia had received their fy2002 and fy2003 reading first awards . information from the u.s. department of education 's ( ed ) april 2007 report on state performance data ; a february 2007 government accountability office report , and a 2007 center on education policy report , reading first : locally appreciated , nationally troubled , have all provided relatively positive information about states ' and local school district 's opinions of the impact of reading first on student achievement . however , state assessment measures and cut - off scores for determining reading proficiency vary from state to state , making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions on reading first 's performance from these data . there have , however , been criticisms of the program that centered on the perceived `` overprescriptiveness '' of the program as it has been administered , perceptions of insufficient transparency regarding ed 's requirements of states , and allegations of conflicts of interest between consultants to the program and commercial reading and assessment companies . controversies have also arisen regarding the application of the sbrr requirements in the nclba to the reading first program . three groups representing different reading programs filed separate complaints with ed 's office of inspector general ( oig ) , asking that the program be investigated . in september of 2006 , the oig issued a report on reading first 's grant application process . subsequent oig audit reports were issued on ed 's administration of selected aspects of the program , on the rmc research corporation 's reading first contracts , and on several states ' administration of the program . the oig reports were highly critical of ed 's implementation of the reading first program , and essentially validated many of the concerns that had been raised in complaints filed with the oig . in response to the controversy surrounding reading first , the program 's funding was cut from $ 1 billion in fy2007 to $ 393 million in fy2008 . the administration has requested that the program 's funding be restored to $ 1 billion for fy2009 . this report will be updated periodically .
