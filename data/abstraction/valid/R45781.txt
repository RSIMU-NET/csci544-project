this report describes selected health care - related provisions that are scheduled to expire during the first session of the116 th congress ( i.e . , during calendar year [ cy ] 2019 ) . for purposes of this report , expiring provisions are defined as portions of law that are time - limited and will lapse once a statutory deadline is reached absent further legislative action . the expiring provisions included in this report are those related to medicare , medicaid , state children 's health insurance program ( chip ) , and private health insurance programs and activities . the report also includes health care - related provisions that were enacted in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 ) or last extended under the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l . 115-123 ) . in addition , this report describes health care - related provisions within the same scope that expired during the 115 th congress ( i.e . , during cy2017 or cy2018 ) . although the congressional research service ( crs ) has attempted to be comprehensive , it can not guarantee that every relevant provision is included here . this report generally focuses on two types of health care - related provisions within the scope discussed above . the first type of provision provides or controls mandatory spending , meaning that it provides temporary funding , temporary increases or decreases in funding ( e.g . , medicare provider bonus payments ) , or temporary special protections that may result in changes in funding levels ( e.g . , medicare funding provisions that establish a floor ) . the second type of provision defines the authority of government agencies or other entities to act , usually by authorizing a policy , project , or activity . such provisions also may temporarily delay the implementation of a regulation , requirement , or deadline , or establish a moratorium on a particular activity . expiring health care provisions that are predominantly associated with discretionary spending activitiesâsuch as discretionary authorizations of appropriations and authorities for discretionary user feesâare excluded from this report . certain types of provisions with expiration dates that otherwise would meet the criteria set forth above are excluded from this report . some of these provisions are excluded because they are transitional or routine in nature or have been superseded by congressional action that otherwise modifies the intent of the expiring provision . for example , statutorily required medicare payment rate reductions and payment rate re - basings that are implemented over a specified time period are not considered to require legislative attention and are excluded . the report provides tables listing the relevant provisions that are scheduled to expire in 2019 and that expired in 2018 or 2017. the report then describes each listed provision , including a legislative history . an appendix lists relevant demonstration projects and pilot programs that are scheduled to expire in 2019 or that expired in 2018 or 2017 .
