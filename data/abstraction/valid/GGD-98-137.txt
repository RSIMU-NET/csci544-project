pursuant to a congressional request , gao conducted a comparative study of block grants and similar programs that give state or local governments substantial flexibility in determining how funds are to be used , focusing on : examining the design characteristics of these programs that have implications for flexibility , accountability , and programs ' ability to collect information about performance as envisioned in the government performance and results act ; identifying the kinds and sources of performance information that programs with various characteristics have utilized and the strengths and weaknesses of this information ; and providing guidance to legislators and agency officials concerning the information collection options available for programs with various designs . gao noted that : flexible grants are an adaptable policy tool and are found in fields from urban transit to community mental health ; flexible grant programs vary greatly in the kind and degree of flexibility afforded to state or local entities , distribution of accountability across levels of government , and availability of direct measures of program performance ; program variation reflects differences in three key design features : whether national objectives for the grant are primarily performance - oriented or primarily fiscal ; whether the grant funds a distinct program with its own operating structure or contributes to the stream of funds supporting state or local activities ; and whether it supports a single major activity or diverse activities ; flexibility is narrowest , but accountability to the federal level clearest , in programs that focus on a single major activity and pursue national performance objectives through a distinct operating structure ; flexibility is broadest in programs designed with the fiscal objective of adding to the stream of funds supporting diverse state or local activities ; in these broadly flexible programs , the federal agency 's role is limited to providing funds ; program direction and accountability are assigned to the state level ; design features also have implications for the availability of performance information ; although most reported simple activity or client counts , relatively few flexibility programs collected uniform data on the outcomes of state or local service activities ; collecting such data requires conditions that do not exist under many flexible program designs , and even where overall performance of a state or local program can be measured , the amount attributable to federal funding often can not be separated out ; accordingly , flexible programs drew on other sources to obtain an overall picture of performance ; understanding grant design features and their implications can assist policymakers in applying the results act and in designing or redesigning grant programs ; and considering a particular program 's national purpose , the federal agency role , and prospects for measuring performance attributable to the program can help agency officials and policy makers understand what program - generated information on results they can realistically expect and when alternative sources of information will be needed .
