training is key to building readiness — the military 's ability to fight and meet the demands of its missions . through the department of defense ( dod ) budget cycle , the marine corps estimates or programs its funding needs for training and spends funds to accomplish its training mission . questions have been raised about whether the marine corps ' training budget estimates are sufficiently detailed to determine training costs at the unit level or the expected readiness generated by those costs . house report 115-200 included a provision for gao to examine the military services ' budgeting processes to build unit - level training readiness . this report examines the extent to which the marine corps tracks unit - level training funds for ground combat forces through the budget cycle , and links ground combat forces ' unit - level training funds to readiness . gao analyzed budget data and studies conducted by the marine corps and others , examined tools used by units to link training funds with readiness , and interviewed knowledgeable officials at various levels in the marine corps . the marine corps can not fully track all unit - level training funds for ground combat forces through the budget cycle . according to gao 's analysis of data provided by the marine expeditionary forces ( mefs ) , the principal warfighting organization for the marine corps , units can track some , but not all , funds for training exercises from the budget request through use of the funds . the marine corps can not fully track all training funds through the budget cycle , in part , because it has not established the consistent use of fiscal codes . two key fiscal codes that officials identified as relevant to track funds for unit - level training are the marine corps programming code ( mcpc ) and the special interest code ( sic ) . the marine corps uses mcpcs to program funds , but gao found that when the marine corps spends those funds , it uses a different set of fiscal codes . this makes it difficult to link the programmed intent of funds to the execution of those funds . the marine corps uses sics to track funds associated with training exercises , but gao found that units do not use sics consistently . for example , officials at all three mefs told gao that units generate sics for large - scale training exercises , but may not do so for small - scale exercises . the marine corps is taking steps to align fiscal codes across the budget cycle , but this effort is in its early stages and will not include mcpcs , and may not address the inconsistent use of sics . without the ability to track unit - level training funds through the budget cycle , the marine corps lacks readily available data to assess whether funds were obligated consistent with their programmed intent and to adequately forecast and defend budget requests for training . although internal marine corps assessments and guidance state that the marine corps needs an enterprise - wide process to link resources to readiness , the marine corps has made little progress establishing a link between training funds for ground combat forces and readiness . the marine corps identified challenges with linking funds to readiness in a series of reports from fiscal years 2009 through 2014 , citing factors such as stove - piped efforts and limited data availability and quality . guidance directed that the deputy commandant for programs and resources organize quality coordination events with key stakeholders to synchronize activities within major lines of effort , but officials from this office stated that they have not been given the authority to direct the various efforts . therefore , challenges have persisted , in part , because the marine corps has not designated a single entity with authority to oversee and coordinate efforts to link training funds to readiness . in the absence of a single oversight entity , two separate and overlapping tools were developed — the cost to run a mef ( c2ram ) tool and the predictive readiness model ( prm ) . although each tool had its own particular use and design , both were intended to link resources to readiness . moreover , both faced similar challenges , such as data quality limitations , and relied on some of the same data sources . the marine corps recently assessed and discontinued development of prm , however , it has not assessed c2ram and how it could support an enterprise wide performance management process linking resources to readiness . without dedicating a single entity with authority , and conducting an assessment of c2ram , the marine corps is unlikely to make headway in addressing the challenges posed by trying to link resources to readiness . gao recommends that the marine corps tracks training funds through the budget cycle , designates a single entity to oversee establishment of a process that links resources to readiness , and conducts an assessment of c2ram . dod concurred , and based on its comments , gao modified one recommendation .
