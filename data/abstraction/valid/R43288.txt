the united states is the world 's largest advertising market . according to one estimate , domestic advertising revenue totaled $ 219 billion in 2012 , accounting for about 1 % of u.s. gross domestic product ( gdp ) . almost every major medium of information , including the press , entertainment , and online services , depends on advertising revenue . advertising accounts for 60 % - 80 % of total revenue at many newspapers and magazines and for most revenue at search engines and social networking sites . television still remains the main choice for advertisers , with ad revenue at almost $ 76 billion in 2012. however , spurred by the growth of paid search , online video , social networks , and mobile devices , advertising is moving to online platforms . digital advertising revenue is estimated to have reached $ 36 billion , or 16 % of total ad revenue , in 2012. companies can more easily track and measure consumer behavior online , which allows them to develop detailed profiles of their customers . some members of congress have raised concerns about the business practices of online advertisers , particularly since their activities are largely unregulated in the united states . digital publishers favor targeted consumer tracking because it allows them to provide free or low - cost ad - supported content . without it , they argue , their ad - supported businesses could be harmed or possibly destroyed . yet more than two - thirds of americans do not like having their online behavior tracked and analyzed , according to a recent pew research survey . privacy and consumer advocates argue for more expansive federal regulations to protect consumers ' online privacy . because of these concerns , recent congresses , including the 113th , have focused on issues relating to digital advertising . they have held hearings on data privacy and proposed legislation including `` do not track '' to give consumers the online equivalent of a `` do not call '' option . in addition , lawmakers have proposed legislation to protect consumers from unlawful geolocation tracking of mobile devices . congress is also looking at search advertising ( where companies sell ads around consumer - initiated search results on web browsers ) and fraudulent marketing over social networks . the growing use of online and mobile tracking has raised regulatory concerns . the federal trade commission ( ftc ) has published updated `` dot com '' disclosures for online ads ; recommended a voluntary do not track ( dnt ) function ; and released new guidance on mobile advertising . the food and drug administration ( fda ) is studying pharmaceutical marketing in social media , with guidance required by june 2014. since 2012 , the obama administration and the ftc have introduced new privacy frameworks . other countries are debating , and some already have and others might adopt , new privacy laws . in particular , digital advertising in the european market is becoming more challenging as european lawmakers consider much stricter dnt rules , raising ever greater compliance hurdles for u.s. businesses . a patchwork of state regulations , including california 's eraser law , also affects online advertising .
