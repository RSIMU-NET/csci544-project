the united states must generally account for nuclear material it has obtained under nuclear cooperation agreements with foreign partners . the agreements generally impose certain conditions , including that the material be used for peaceful purposes . material subject to such conditions is called “ obligated. ” the united states relies on nmmss to track obligated material and to help demonstrate u.s. compliance with agreements . material not subject to agreement conditions is called “ unobligated. ” some forms of uranium , such as leu , are used to maintain the nuclear weapons in the u.s. stockpile , but the u.s. inventory of unobligated leu is declining . gao was asked to review the practice of obligation exchanges and the reliability of certain nmmss data . this report examines the number of obligation exchanges in the united states since 2003 , and the reasons for them , and how doe and nrc ensure such exchanges are accurately tracked and reported through nmmss . gao analyzed nmmss data and agency documents and interviewed agency officials , doe contractors , and nrc licensees , among other steps . in the united states , from october 1 , 2003 , through november 30 , 2015 , there were 817 exchanges of nuclear material that carried obligations to foreign partners under nuclear cooperation agreements . these exchanges allowed the obligated nuclear material to be transferred between u.s. facilities without physically moving it . for example , if a facility had a certain amount of obligated nuclear material and another facility had at least the same amount and type of unobligated material ( which is not subject to the same conditions as obligated material ) , the facilities could exchange the obligations on their material so that each facility had a portion of both types of material without physically moving it . numbers of exchanges . of the 817 exchanges , 802 were conducted by nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) - licensed facilities — private companies and other entities involved in commercially producing nuclear energy . of the remaining exchanges , 14 were conducted by contractors that run department of energy ( doe ) laboratories and weapons - production sites , and 1 by an nrc licensee that does both commercial and doe work . reasons for exchanges . nrc licensees said they conducted exchanges primarily to meet their utility customer demand , as well as to avoid the high costs and safety risks associated with physically transporting nuclear material . doe contractors said they conducted exchanges primarily to avoid physically moving nuclear material stored at a specific site . doe and nrc have procedures to ensure accurate tracking and reporting of data on obligation exchanges through the nuclear materials management and safeguards system ( nmmss ) . gao tested elements of these procedures and generally found them to be reliable . but , gao identified two issues that may impact the agencies ' ability to effectively monitor nuclear material inventories . first , some facilities have carried negative obligation balances for extended periods . a negative obligation balance occurs when a facility conducts an exchange without having enough of a given material in its physical inventory to cover the exchange . in certain circumstances , negative balances may place the united states at risk of noncompliance with nuclear agreements . negative balances have occurred because doe and nrc have not addressed this issue in documented guidance on when facilities may carry such balances , which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards . second , while unobligated low - enriched uranium ( leu ) could be used to correct any future negative obligation balances , the u.s. inventory of it is declining and nmmss does not have an early - warning monitoring capability to alert doe when the inventory is particularly low . federal internal control standards state that agencies should establish activities to monitor internal control systems and evaluate the results , but doe officials said that the leu inventory is currently sufficient and no early warning capability is needed . without developing such a capability in nmmss , doe officials can not know when the inventory of unobligated leu becomes so low that supplies may not be available to correct negative obligation balances , thereby putting the united states at risk of not complying with its nuclear agreements . gao recommends that doe and nrc clarify in guidance when facilities may carry negative obligation balances and develop an early - warning monitoring capability in nmmss to alert doe when the inventory of unobligated leu is particularly low . doe and nrc neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendations but stated that they have ongoing efforts that may address gao 's recommendations .
