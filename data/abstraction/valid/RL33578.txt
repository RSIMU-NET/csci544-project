historically , u.s. federal energy tax policy promoted the supply of oil and gas . however , the 1970s witnessed ( 1 ) a significant cutback in the oil and gas industry 's tax preferences , ( 2 ) the imposition of new excise taxes on oil , and ( 3 ) the introduction of numerous tax preferences for energy conservation , the development of alternative fuels , and the commercialization of the technologies for producing these fuels ( renewables such as solar , wind , and biomass , and nonconventional fossil fuels such as shale oil and coalbed methane ) . the reagan administration , using a free - market approach , advocated repeal of the windfall profit tax on oil and the repeal or phase - out of most energy tax preferences — for oil and gas , as well as alternative fuels . due to the combined effects of the economic recovery tax act and the energy tax subsidies that had not been repealed , which together created negative effective tax rates in some cases , the actual energy tax policy differed from the stated policy . the george h. w. bush and bill clinton years witnessed a return to a much more activist energy tax policy , with an emphasis on energy conservation and alternative fuels . while the original aim was to reduce demand for imported oil , energy tax policy was also increasingly viewed as a tool for achieving environmental and fiscal objectives . the clinton administration 's energy tax policy emphasized the environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gases and global climate change , but it will also be remembered for its failed proposal to enact a broadly based energy tax on btus ( british thermal units ) and its 1993 across - the - board increase in motor fuels taxes of 4.3¢ / gallon . the 109th congress enacted the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ) , signed by president bush on august 8 , 2005 , provided a net energy tax cut of $ 11.5 billion ( $ 14.5 billion gross energy tax cuts , less $ 3 billion of energy tax increases ) for fossil fuels and electricity , as well as for energy efficiency , and for several types of alternative and renewable resources , such as solar and geothermal . the tax relief and health care act of 2006 ( p.l . 109-432 ) , enacted in december 2006 , provided for one - year extensions of these provisions . the current energy tax structure favors tax incentives for alternative and renewable fuels supply relative to energy from conventional fossil fuels , and this posture was accentuated under the energy policy act of 2005. on october 3 , president bush signed the economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) , which includes $ 17 billion in energy tax incentives , primarily extensions of pre - existing provisions , but also including several new energy tax incentives : $ 10.9 billion in renewable energy tax incentives aimed at clean energy production , $ 2.6 billion in incentives targeted toward cleaner vehicles and fuels , and $ 3.5 billion in tax breaks to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency . the cost of the energy tax extenders legislation is fully financed , or paid for , by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry ( mostly by reducing oil and gas tax breaks ) and by other tax increases . the oil and gas tax increases comprise cutbacks in the irc §199 manufacturing deduction for income attributable to oil and gas production , which will be frozen at 6 % ( rather than increasing to 9 % as scheduled ) , reforming the foreign tax credit provisions , and by increasing the per - barrel tax rate on refinery crude oil under the oil spill liability trust fund provisions .
