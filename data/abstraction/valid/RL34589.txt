on august 2 , 2010 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed a new clean air transport rule to control powerplant emissions of sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) . when finalized , this rule will replace the clean air interstate rule ( cair ) ; cair , which was promulgated in may 2005 , established a regional cap - and - trade program for so2 and nox emissions from electric generating units ( egus ) in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia . on july 11 , 2008 , in north carolina v. epa , the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit vacated cair , saying that it had `` more than several fatal flaws . . the court subsequently modified its decision on december 23 , 2008 , however , reversing itself by allowing cair to remain in effect until a new rule is promulgated by epa . from a policy standpoint , the court 's july 2008 decision seriously undermined epa 's approach to clean air over the previous eight years . cair was the lynchpin that held together the bush administration 's strategy for attainment of the ozone and fine particulate national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) , for achieving reductions in mercury emissions from coal - fired powerplants , for addressing regional haze impacts from powerplants , and for responding to state petitions to control upwind sources of ozone and fine particulates under section 126 of the clean air act . as discussed in this report , the potential impact on communities attempting to achieve naaqs and the impact on mercury emissions without cair or a similar rule would be substantial ; this has prompted some to call for congressional action to address the issue . on february 4 , 2010 , senator carper and 11 bipartisan cosponsors introduced s. 2995 , a multipollutant bill that would have replaced the cair requirements , and required standards for powerplant emissions of mercury . the bill was not acted on . as of may 2011 , legislation addressing cair replacement has not been introduced in the 112th congress . the d.c. circuit 's july 2008 decision strongly suggested that there is no simple `` fix '' that will make cair acceptable to the court . this left epa with three clear long - term options : ( 1 ) starting anew with a new strategy with respect to mitigating transported air pollution based on the decision ; ( 2 ) allowing the states to sort out the issue through section 126 petitions ; and ( 3 ) seeking new legislation providing epa with the statutory authority to implement either cair in some form , or an alternative . the agency is proceeding with the first of these options with its proposed transport rule , but has indicated that it views congressional efforts to address the issue as `` mutually reinforcing . . for congress , the court decision raises several issues : should congress consider providing epa with the authority to implement cair or other cost - based , market - oriented approaches to address naaqs ? . should congress consider multi - pollutant legislation as a supplement or substitute for the current regulatory regime , at least for electric generating units ? . should congress consider a more comprehensive revision to the clean air act to address the full scope of ozone and pm2.5 naaqs non - attainment and related issues , as well as mercury emissions from coal - fired powerplants , and emerging environmental issues such as climate change ? .
