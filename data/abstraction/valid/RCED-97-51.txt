pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) acquisition planning to date , focusing on the extent to which : the schedule estimate for the standard terminal automation replacement system ( stars ) is attainable ; and cost estimates to make stars operational are likely to change . gao noted that : the stars schedule , which calls for implementation of 171 air traffic control facilities between december 1998 and february 2005 , is attainable only if faa is successful in its efforts to mitigate certain risks ; specifically , faa will need to obtain commitment by key stakeholders to the stars schedule , resolve schedule conflicts between stars and other modernization efforts , and overcome difficulties in developing system software that could delay implementing stars ; faa is aware that these issues pose a risk for stars and has begun several risk mitigation initiatives ; while such actions are encouraging , it is too early to tell how effective they will be ; faa 's cost estimate for stars has the potential to increase ; faa 's total cost estimate for stars is $ 2.23 billion ; faa approved this estimate in january 1996 , however , a september 1996 analysis by agency officials pointed to potential cost increases that could drive the total cost estimate to as much as $ 2.76 billion ; this possible increase is attributable to expected higher costs for operating and maintaining stars equipment ; faa officials are continuing to revise the stars cost estimate and now believe that cost increases may be significantly lower ; and at this time , however , faa could not provide gao with an updated estimate .
