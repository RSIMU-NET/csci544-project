pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined a model nutrition monitoring system and potential approaches to incorporating it into the national nutrition monitoring and related research program ( nnmrrp ) . gao found that : a model nutrition program would have a coordinated set of activities , provide data continuously , generate reliable subpopulation and small geographic area , and support state and local monitoring activities ; although nnmrrp has elements of a model program , other strategies may lead to improved nutrition monitoring capabilities ; alternate approaches to coordination may not provide any clear advantages to the current structure ; the current state - based surveillance systems can not meet certain information needs ; alternative approaches to achieving a model program are to attach modules of nutrition - related questions to other ongoing surveys or to field a core set of questions continuously , supplemented periodically by questions of emerging interest ; current approaches to providing information on subpopulations and small geographic areas are to oversample selected groups as part of the national surveys and to collect data on specific high - risk groups through the surveillance systems , which could be complemented by special studies and indirect estimation ; and to support state and local monitoring activities , the department of health and human services provides technical and financial assistance for state - based surveillance systems , but community - based data collection might provide more relevant data to localities .
