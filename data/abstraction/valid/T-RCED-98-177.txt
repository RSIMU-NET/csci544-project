gao discussed certain aspects of the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) management and oversight of its loan insurance program for home improvements under title i of the national housing act , focusing on : the extent to which the information needed to manage the program was available to hud ; the extent to which hud was overseeing program lenders ; and whether hud has any ongoing or planned efforts under way to strengthen its management and oversight . gao noted that : its preliminary analysis shows that hud is not collecting information needed for managing the program ; specifically , gao found that hud collects little information when loans are made on program borrowers , properties , and loan terms , such as the borrower 's income and the address of the property being improved ; moreover , hud does not maintain information on why it denies loan claims or why it subsequently approves some for payment ; hud also provides limited oversight of lenders ' compliance with program regulations , conducting only 2 on - site lender reviews in fiscal year 1997 of the approximately 3,700 program lenders ; regarding the need for oversight of lenders ' compliance , gao found that loan claim files submitted by lenders to hud following loan defaults often do not contain required loan documents , including the original loan applications and certifications signed by the borrower that the property improvement work has been completed ; in addition , some claims were paid by hud even though there were indications that lenders did not comply with required underwriting standards when insuring the loan ; as a result of the management and oversight weaknesses gao has observed , its preliminary work indicates that hud does not know who the program is serving , if lenders are complying with program regulations , and whether certain potential program abuses are occurring , such as violations of the $ 25,000 limitation on the amount of title i loan indebtedness for each property ; hud officials attributed these weaknesses to the program 's being lender - operated , limited staff resources , and hud 's assignment of monitoring priorities ; under the hud 2020 management reform plan and related efforts , hud is making significant changes in all of its single - family housing programs , including the title i property improvement program ; these changes are motivated in part by hud 's goals to downsize the agency and address long - standing agencywide management weaknesses ; and gao is assessing the extent to which these changes may affect the management and oversight weaknesses it identified .
