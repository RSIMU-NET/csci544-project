the united states and other countries have made commitments under the wto 's gpa and ftas that open their government procurement to foreign suppliers . under these commitments , parties agree to a procedural framework for government procurement with provisions on issues such as transparency and nondiscrimination . these commitments have potentially opened an estimated $ 4.4 trillion government procurement market to international firms , providing numerous new opportunities for american businesses in foreign markets and for foreign businesses to compete for u.s. government contracts . as part of your larger request for information on u.s. participation in international procurement agreements , gao reviewed commitments made by the united states and trading partners in selected international procurement agreements . this report provides information on the provisions and the market access schedules of the selected international procurement agreements . gao reviewed the provisions and market access schedules across six agreements involving the largest government procurement markets to identify common features and variations . the agreements are the 1994 gpa and the 2014 revised gpa , nafta , the south korea - fta , the colombia - fta , and the australia - fta . gao analyzed wto and u.s. documents pertaining to the gpa and u.s. ftas and interviewed ustr and the department of commerce agency officials in washington , d.c. gao found that the world trade organization 's ( wto ) agreement on government procurement ( gpa ) and selected u.s. free trade agreements ' ( fta ) government procurement chapters that gao reviewed generally have similarities in text , and commitments , potentially because parties negotiated multiple agreements concurrently ( see fig . ) . each of the agreements outlines the general method for conducting government procurement , including provisions relating to transparency , procurement procedures , and criteria for procurement decisions . however , differences exist , partially because later agreements reflect new technology . the 2014 revised gpa generally provides more comprehensive market access than the selected ftas gao reviewed . partners define the degree to which they will open their procurement markets to suppliers from other countries , known as their market access commitments . these commitments outline the entities covered by the agreements , for example , at the central and subcentral government levels ( for the united states , these include agencies of the federal government and states ) , and for what some agreements term “ other entities ” ( which , for the united states , includes utilities ) . the united states covers 85 central government entities under the revised gpa , but only 53 entities under the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) . similarly , the united states covers 37 states under its gpa commitments and from no states to 30 in the ftas gao reviewed . while all the top five gpa parties gao reviewed cover some subcentral government entities , canada , mexico , and south korea do not have a subcentral government entity coverage schedule in their fta commitments . according to the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , parties have certain procurements that they deem sensitive and do not want to open to foreign suppliers , including for social or policy reason . in the agreements gao reviewed , the u.s. 's trading partners often exclude agriculture , military support , and motor vehicles from their market access commitments . gao is not making recommendations in this report .
