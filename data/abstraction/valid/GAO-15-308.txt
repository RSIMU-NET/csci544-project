aerial refueling — when aircraft refuel while airborne — allows the u.s. military to fly farther , stay airborne longer , and transport more weapons , equipment , and supplies . yet the mainstay of the u.s. tanker forces — the kc - 135 stratotanker — is over 50 years old . it is increasingly costly to support and its age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet . as a result , the air force initiated the $ 49 billion kc - 46 program to replace the aerial refueling fleet . the program plans to produce 18 tankers by 2017 and 179 aircraft in total . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 included provisions for gao to annually review the kc - 46 program through 2017. this report addresses progress made in 2014 towards achieving cost and performance goals , meeting schedule targets , and gathering manufacturing knowledge prior to the low - rate production decision . gao analyzed key program documents and discussed development and production plans and results with officials from the kc - 46 program office , other defense offices , and the prime contractor . the kc - 46 acquisition cost estimate has declined by about 5.4 percent from $ 51.7 billion to $ 48.9 billion since february 2011 and the program is on track to meet performance goals . most of the estimated cost decline is due to fewer than expected engineering changes and changes in military construction plans . the air force delayed the production decision two months , to october 2015 , due to wiring problems that boeing experienced that delayed aircraft delivery and testing . for example , boeing completed 3.5 hours of flight testing during a single flight of the 767-2c ( a precursor to the kc - 46 tanker ) in 2014 , compared to nearly 400 flight test hours it planned to conduct . with program office approval , boeing restructured its nearly 2,400 development flight test hour plan to focus on demonstrating key kc - 46 aerial refueling capabilities required for the production decision . significantly less testing will now be conducted prior to the decision and only three test months will be on a kc - 46 , compared to the original plan of 13 months . this testing is intended to demonstrate design maturity and fix design and performance problems before a system enters production . boeing remains at risk of not being able to demonstrate the aerial refueling capabilities in time to meet the new production decision date due to late parts deliveries , software defects , and flight test cycle assumptions , which could result in additional delays . program officials are gathering manufacturing knowledge to support a production decision , such as determining if suppliers can produce military subsystems in a production environment . however , the program office will have less knowledge about the reliability and performance of the kc - 46 than planned because of reduced testing prior to the decision . while this increases the risk of discovering costly problems late in development , contract provisions specify that boeing must correct these at no cost to the government . gao recommends that the air force ensure that key aerial refueling capabilities are demonstrated prior to holding the production decision . the air force concurred with the recommendation .
