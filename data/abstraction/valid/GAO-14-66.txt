of the over $ 82 billion that federal agencies plan to spend on it in fiscal year 2014 , at least $ 59 billion is to be spent on o & m , which consists of legacy systems ( i.e . , steady state ) and systems that are in both development and o & m ( known as mixed life cycle ) . omb calls for agencies to perform annual oas , which are a key method for examining the performance of o & m investments . gao was asked to review it o & m investments and agency use of oas . the objectives of this report were to among other things identify the federal it o & m investments with the largest budgets , including their responsible agencies and how each investment supports its agencys mission ; determine the extent to which these investments have undergone oas ; and assess whether the responsible agencys major it investments are in development , mixed life cycle , or steady state . to do so , gao focused on the 10 it investments with the largest budgets in o & m and their responsible eight agencies , and assessed whether oas were conducted on the investments . in addition , gao evaluated what agencies spent on mixed , development , and o & m investments and whether agencies were using o & m funds for development activities . the 10 federal information technology ( it ) operations and maintenance ( o & m ) investments with the largest budgets in fiscal year 2012and the eight agencies that operate themare identified by gao in the table below . they support agencies by providing , for example , global telecommunications infrastructure and information transport services for the department of defense . of the 10 investments , only the department of homeland security ( dhs ) investment underwent an operational analysis ( oa ) a key performance evaluation and oversight mechanism required by the office of management and budget ( omb ) to ensure o & m investments continue to meet agency needs . dhss oa addressed most factors that omb calls for ; it did not address three factors ( e.g . , comparing current cost and schedule against original estimates ) . dhs officials attributed these factors not being addressed to the department still being in the process of implementing its new oa policy . the remaining agencies did not assess their investments , which accounted for $ 7.4 billion in reported o & m spending . agency officials cited several reasons for not doing so , including relying on budget submission and related management reviews that measure performance ; however , omb has noted that these are not a substitute for oas . until the agencies ensure their operational investments are assessed , there is a risk that they will not know whether these multibillion dollar investments fully meet intended objectives . for the eight agencies in this review , the majority of their 401 major it investments were mixed life cycle ( i.e . , having activities and systems that are in both development and o & m ) with regard to total spending and number of investments . specifically , 193 ( 48 percent ) of the investments were mixed investments , accounting for about $ 18 billion ( 61 percent ) of planned spending . as such , successful oversight of such investments should involve a combination of conducting oas to address operational portions of an investment and establishing it governance and program management disciplines to manage those portions under development . gaos experience at the agencies and this report have identified agency inconsistencies in conducting oas and establishing the capabilities that are key to effectively managing it investments ; accordingly , gao has made prior recommendations to strengthen agency efforts in these areas . gao is recommending that the seven agencies that did not perform oas on their large it o & m investments do so , and that dhs ensure that its oa is complete and addresses all omb factors . of the seven agencies , three agreed with gaos recommendations ; two partially agreed ; and two had no comments . dhs agreed with the gao recommendation to it .
