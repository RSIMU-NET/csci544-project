under federal law , local governments ( usually counties ) are compensated through various programs for reductions to their property tax bases due to the presence of most federally owned land . federal lands can not be taxed but may create a demand for services such as fire protection , police cooperation , or longer roads to skirt the federal property . some compensation programs are run by a specific agency and apply only to that agency 's land . this report addresses only the most widely applicable program , which is called payments in lieu of taxes ( pilt ; 31 u.s.c . §§6901-6907 ) and is administered by the department of the interior ( doi ) ; in fy2016 , there were 2,227 counties with lands eligible for pilt payments . eligible lands consist of those in the national park system ( nps ) , national forest system ( nfs ) , or bureau of land management ( blm ) ; certain lands in the national wildlife refuge system ( nwrs ) ; and several other specified federal lands . congress has repeatedly debated the level of pilt funding . the authorized level of pilt payments is calculated using a complex formula . no precise dollar figure can be given in advance for each year 's pilt authorized level . five factors affect the calculation of a payment to a given county : ( 1 ) the number of acres eligible for pilt payments , ( 2 ) the county 's population , ( 3 ) payments in prior years from other specified federal land payment programs , ( 4 ) state laws directing payments to a particular government purpose , and ( 5 ) the consumer price index as calculated by the bureau of labor statistics . if the appropriation for pilt funding is less than the full authorized amount , each county receives a prorated payment . before 2008 , pilt was funded through the annual appropriations process . from fy2008 to fy2014 , however , congress approved mandatory spending for pilt at the full formula amount . the fy2015 pilt payment was funded through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations , and the fy2016 pilt payment and fy2017 pilt payment were each funded entirely through discretionary appropriations . in all three of those years , the appropriation for the pilt payment was less than the authorized full funding level , so each county received a prorated payment in those years . most recently in fy2017 , each county received a prorated amount ( 99.7 % ) of the full authorized amount . the mechanism for pilt funding thus presents two fundamental options for congress to consider : provide funding through the annual discretionary appropriations process or through mandatory spending for the full formula amount , whether indefinitely or for a specified period . discretionary appropriations are constrained by procedural and statutory spending limits and are subject to annual fluctuations that may or may not result in pilt being fully funded . among other potential impacts , annual appropriations could introduce uncertainty and unpredictability for the counties receiving pilt payments . approval of mandatory spending for pilt at the full formula amount could ensure a consistent and predictable payment for those counties , at least through the duration of the authorization . however , the legislation still would be subject to certain budget rules that generally require such spending be offset . since the creation of pilt in 1976 , various other changes in the law have been proposed . one proposal has been to include additional lands under the pilt program , particularly indian lands . other lands also have been mentioned for inclusion , such as those of the national aeronautics and space administration and the departments of defense and homeland security . some counties would like to revisit the compensation formula to emphasize a payment rate more similar to property tax rates . finally , some have argued that all lands in the nwrs should be eligible for pilt , rather than limiting pilt payments to lands reserved from the public domain while excluding acquired lands from pilt payments .
