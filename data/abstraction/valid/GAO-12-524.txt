the air force expects to invest a total of $ 9.7 billion in f - 22a modernization through 2023. the air force and navy have modernized many of their fighter and attack aircraft over the past several decades . given this historical experience and concerns about the mounting cost of f - 22a modernization , gao was asked to examine the history of the modernization programs of the f - 15 , f - 16 , and f / a - 18 , and compare those legacy programs with the f - 22a modernization program . to identify differences and similarities between the f - 22a modernization program and those of the selected legacy programs , gao reviewed official service history documents and current and historical program documents ; analyzed program cost , schedule , performance , and quantity data ; and spoke with current and former air force , navy , and contractor officials . dod reviewed a draft of this report and had no formal written comments . the f - 22a and legacy modernization programs gao reviewed were rooted in different development strategies . the f - 22a began as a single - step program and did not anticipate the need for future modernization , while the legacy programs each began with the expectation that their aircraft would be incrementally upgraded over time . f - 22a modernization began in reaction to a major shift in the aircrafts basic mission , which required the development of new capabilities that had not been planned for as part of the initial development program . in contrast , the legacy modernization programs made planned incremental improvements to existing mission capabilities . all of the modernization programs began at about the same time in development and procurement . the f - 22a program is developing and retrofitting new capabilities onto a complex stealth aircraft , which is costlycurrently estimated at $ 9.7 billion total . legacy modernization programs were less complex , and thus less costly , and incorporated mature technologies onto new production aircraft . accurately identifying and comparing the total cost of each modernization program is difficult . each of the programs , including the f - 22a , initially managed and funded modernization as a continuation of its baseline program , so modernization costs and funding were not clearly identified in selected acquisition reports or budget documents .
