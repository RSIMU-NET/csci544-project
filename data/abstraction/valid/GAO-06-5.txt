much attention has focused on the `` offshoring '' of services to lower - wage locations abroad . offshoring generally refers to an organization 's purchase of goods or services from abroad that were previously produced domestically . extensive public debate has arisen about both the potential benefits of services offshoring , such as lower consumer prices and higher u.s. productivity , as well as the potential costs , such as increased job displacement for selected u.s. workers . in response to widespread congressional interest , gao conducted work under the comptroller general 's authority to help policy makers better understand the potential impacts and policy implications of services offshoring . this report : provides an overview of experts ' views on the potential impacts of services offshoring , describes the types of policies that have been proposed in response to offshoring , and highlights some key areas where additional research might help advance the debate about offshoring . in its comments , the department of commerce generally agreed with the findings of this report . commerce , treasury , and the office of the united states trade representative also provided technical comments that have been incorporated as appropriate . analysts of the offshoring phenomenon have expressed a range of views about the likely impacts of offshoring on four broad areas . the differing views reflect several factors : the fact that services offshoring is a relatively recent development whose impact is not fully known , the limitations of available data on offshoring , and different theoretical expectations about how services offshoring will impact the u.s. economy . the average u.s. standard of living : traditional economic theory generally predicts that offshoring will benefit u.s. living standards in the long run . however , some economists have argued that offshoring could harm u.s. long - term living standards under certain scenarios , such as if offshoring undermines u.s. technological leadership . employment and job loss : while economic theory generally predicts that offshoring will have little effect on overall u.s. employment levels in the long - run , there is widespread recognition that pockets of workers will lose jobs due to offshoring , though there is disagreement about the expected magnitude of job loss and implications for displaced workers . distribution of income : some economists maintain that offshoring could increase income inequality in the u.s. , while others argue that changes in the income distribution are driven primarily by factors other than offshoring , such as technological change . security and consumer privacy : experts express varying degrees of concern about the impact of services offshoring on the security of our national defense system and critical infrastructure -- such as utilities and communication networks -- as well as the privacy and security of consumers ' financial and medical information . a wide range of policies has been proposed in response to concerns about offshoring and its potential effects . these proposals can be categorized into four areas by the concerns they seek to address : improving u.s. global competitiveness , addressing effects on the u.s. workforce , addressing security concerns , and reducing the extent of offshoring . some analysts have recommended policies in more than one area . determining appropriate policy responses to the offshoring phenomenon is challenging due to the limited state of knowledge about the extent and impacts of offshoring . nonetheless , there are some key areas where additional research might help advance the debate , such as trends in the wages and skill levels of jobs being offshored , reemployment experiences of workers displaced by offshoring , and the extent to which current laws and practices in different sectors of the economy mitigate any increased security - related risks posed by offshoring . in the face of limited federal data , researchers have begun using a variety of approaches to examine such areas .
