in operating nfip , fema spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on contractors that perform critical functions . the biggert - waters flood insurance reform act of 2012 mandates gao to review the three largest contractors used in administering nfip . in prior reports , gao found problems with fema 's oversight of contractors responsible for performing key nfip functions . this report examines fema 's progress in updating its process for monitoring nfip contractors since gao 's prior reports , and the extent to which fema followed its monitoring process for the largest nfip contractors . to address these objectives , gao analyzed fema data on funds obligated to contractors from fiscal years 2008 through to 2012 , reviewed information from fema on contract management policies and procedures , and assessed data covering fiscal years 2011 to 2013 on the implementation of these policies and procedures as they pertained to the three largest contractors . gao also interviewed fema contracting staff and contractors . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has made progress in improving its processes for monitoring nfip contracts since gao last reported on these issues in 2008 and 2011. for example , gao recommended in 2011 that fema complete the development and implementation of its revised acquisition process to be consistent with a department of homeland security ( dhs ) directive . fema updated its contract management guidance and revised its handbook for contracting officer 's representatives to be consistent with dhs directives . the updated handbook also contained many of the elements identified in a federal guide to best practices for contract administration . furthermore , the fema division that manages the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) developed a contract management reference guide that followed fema 's handbook and federal best practices guidance . with some exceptions , fema largely followed its contract monitoring procedures for the three largest nfip contractors gao reviewed . for example , fema ensured that relevant staff overseeing selected contracts received appropriate training . also , fema periodically compared and analyzed actual performance data against goals for each of the three contracts through operating reports , which would allow management to review the status of deliverables and milestones and be aware of inaccuracies or exceptions that could indicate internal control problems . however , fema did not develop a quality assurance surveillance plan for one of the contractors -- a best practice and a key requirement identified in regulations and guidance . in 2010 and 2011 , fema identified persistent issues with the contractor 's deliverables , including quality and timeliness , and faced challenges in resolving those issues , which might have been avoidable if a quality assurance surveillance plan had been developed and used . fema officials stated that they are considering options to ensure that the plans are in place for future contracts , but did not provide specifics on those options or when they plan to implement them . without detailed quality assurance surveillance plans , the expectations of the agency and the contractor can be misaligned during performance evaluations . separately , for two of the contracts fema staff did not enter performance evaluations in the contractor performance assessment reporting system ( cpars ) , a database dhs uses to record assessments of performance of government contractors . federal and dhs regulations and fema contract management guidance require entry of contract performance information in cpars within certain time frames . by not reporting such information , fema disadvantaged the contractors and the government by not providing data that could be used in evaluating the contractors for future contract awards . for instance , receiving a positive cpars assessment can enhance a contractor 's reputation when bidding on future contracts , and as such , the assessments provide an incentive for the contractor to perform as expected . fema officials have acknowledged the issue . by determining the extent to which performance evaluations have not been entered into cpars for its contracts , identifying the reasons why , and addressing those reasons , as needed , fema can help ensure that its -- and other agencies ' -- contracting decisions and management draw on complete , relevant , and timely performance information . to improve monitoring and reporting of contractor performance , we are recommending that fema determine the extent to which quality assurance surveillance plans and cpars assessments have not been prepared , identify the reasons why , and take steps , as needed , to address those reasons . fema concurred with gao 's recommendations .
