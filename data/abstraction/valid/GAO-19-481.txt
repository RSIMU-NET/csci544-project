the epsdt benefit is key to ensuring that medicaid beneficiaries aged 20 and under receive periodic screening services , such as well - child screenings , and diagnostic and treatment services , such as physical therapy and eyeglasses , to correct or ameliorate conditions discovered during a screening . gao was asked to examine the extent to which medicaid beneficiaries aged 20 and under receive health care services under the epsdt benefit . among other things , gao examined what is known about the provision of epsdt services based on cms - required annual state reporting , and cms oversight of the epsdt benefit . to do this , gao analyzed annual state reporting data from fiscal years 2010 through 2017 , the most current year data were available ; cms documentation ; and federal internal control standards . gao also interviewed cms officials and medicaid officials from 16 states selected , in part , on the variation in number of beneficiaries and geographic diversity . approximately half of all medicaid beneficiaries aged 20 and under received screenings and services recommended under the early and periodic screening , diagnostic , and treatment ( epsdt ) benefit in fiscal year 2017 , but nearly as many did not . for example , gao 's analysis of state - reported data found that about 59 percent of all beneficiaries ( 20.2 million ) who should have received at least one recommended well - child screening received one . about 48 percent of beneficiaries aged 1 to 20 ( 18.3 million ) received a preventive dental service in fiscal year 2017. older beneficiaries tended to have lower rates of screening . number of medicaid beneficiaries receiving and not receiving well - child screenings in fiscal year 2017 , by age group the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency that oversees medicaid , including epsdt , has taken steps to improve the quality of information that states report about the provision of epsdt services . cms has also set some epsdt performance measure targets for states ; yet , the agency has not taken other steps to oversee the epsdt benefit , such as collecting the data necessary to evaluate whether states are complying with cms 's policy for beneficiaries to receive a blood lead screening ; taking action , as needed , based on assessments of the appropriateness of some performance measures , such as well - child screening measures ; and using state - reported information to regularly evaluate states against cms 's epsdt targets , or assisting states in planning improvements to meet the targets . absent these steps , cms 's oversight is limited and beneficiaries may not be receiving appropriate epsdt services when they need them . gao is making six recommendations to cms regarding its oversight of the epsdt benefit , including collecting appropriate blood lead screening data ; taking action , if needed , after assessing the appropriateness of performance measures and targets for epsdt ; and evaluating states ' performance in meeting cms 's epsdt targets . cms agreed with three recommendations , but disagreed with three others regarding performance measures and targets . gao maintains that these recommendations are valid , as discussed in this report .
