a fundamental principle of military readiness is that the military must train as it intends to fight , and military training ranges allow the department of defense ( dod ) to accomplish this goal . according to dod officials , heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes has affected the use of its training areas . since 2003 , dod has obtained exemptions from three environmental laws and has sought exemptions from three others . this report discusses the impact , if any , of environmental laws on dod 's training activities and military readiness , dod 's use of statutory exemptions from environmental laws on training activities , dod 's use of statutory exemptions on the environment , and the extent to which dod has demonstrated the need for additional exemptions . to address these objectives , gao visited 17 training locations ; analyzed environmental impact and readiness reports ; and met with officials at service headquarters , the office of the secretary of defense , federal regulatory agencies , and nongovernmental environmental groups . compliance with environmental laws has caused some training activities to be cancelled , postponed , or modified , and dod has used adjustments to training events , referred to as `` workarounds , '' to accomplish some training objectives while meeting environmental requirements . some dod trainers instruct units to pretend restricted training areas are holy grounds , mine fields , or other restricted areas in theater , simulating the need to avoid specific areas and locations when deployed . gao 's review of readiness data for active duty combat units did not confirm that compliance with environmental laws hampers overall military readiness . since 2006 , the navy has twice invoked the marine mammal protection act exemption to continue using mid - frequency active sonar in training exercises that would otherwise have been prevented . dod 's exemption from the migratory bird treaty act , authorizing the taking of migratory birds , eliminated the possibility of having to delay or cancel military training exercises , such as navy live - fire training at the farallon de medinilla target range . the exemption to the endangered species act , which precludes critical habitat designation on dod lands , enables dod to avoid potential training delays by providing greater autonomy in managing its training lands . on the basis of meetings with officials within and outside dod and visits to 17 training ranges , gao found no instances where dod 's use of exemptions from the endangered species act or migratory bird treaty act has adversely affected the environment , but the impact of the marine mammal protection act exemption has not yet been determined . the services employ a variety of measures and conservation activities to mitigate the effects of training activities on the natural resources located on dod lands . additionally , regulatory officials gao spoke to said dod has done an effective job protecting and preserving endangered species and habitats on its installations . however , some nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that the endangered species act exemption allowing dod to avoid critical habitat designations may weaken oversight from the u.s. fish and wildlife service . dod has not presented a sound business case demonstrating the need for the proposed exemptions from the clean air act , the resource conservation and recovery act , and the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act . best practices and prior gao work recommend that agencies develop a business case that includes , among other things , expected benefits , costs , and risks associated with a proposal 's implementation . however , dod has not provided any specific examples showing that training and readiness have been hampered by requirements of these laws . meanwhile some federal , state , and nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that the proposed exemptions , if granted , could harm the environment . until dod develops a business case demonstrating the need for these exemptions , congress will lack a sound basis for assessing whether to enact requested exemptions .
