the house and senate transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies ( thud ) appropriations subcommittees are charged with providing annual appropriations for the department of transportation ( dot ) , department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and related agencies . the hud budget generally accounts for the largest share of discretionary appropriations provided by the subcommittee . however , when mandatory funding is taken into account , dot 's budget is larger than hud 's budget , because it includes funding from transportation trust funds . the house and the senate have considered fy2014 funding with significantly different assumed levels of total funding . following from this , the house and senate thud bills were allocated very different levels of discretionary funding for fy2014 : $ 44.1 billion in the house , and $ 54.0 billion in the senate , a difference of 23 % . comparing funding levels proposed for fy2014 with the amounts provided in fy2013 is complex . in fy2013 , congress funded thud agencies through a full - year continuing resolution , which provided funding generally at the same level as in fy2012 , with some exceptions , and which included a 0.2 % across - the - board rescission . that funding was subsequently reduced by the imposition of a sequester , which cut discretionary funding levels by around 5 % . this reduced thud funding by roughly $ 4.6 billion : around $ 1.6 billion from dot and $ 3 billion from hud . the administration requested $ 76.9 billion for dot for fy2014 . congress enacted $ 71.3 billion for dot in fy2013 ; after the sequester reduction , dot received around $ 70.6 billion . the biggest change in the administration 's request from current funding was a proposal to restructure the federal railroad administration , creating two new programs that would support existing passenger rail service and fund improvements to rail infrastructure . the administration requested $ 6.4 billion for those new programs , an increase of roughly $ 5 billion over the amount currently provided for those purposes . neither the house nor senate bills supported that proposal . the president 's fy2014 budget request for hud included nearly $ 35 billion in net new budget authority . this amount is an increase over fy2013 , as congress enacted $ 33.4 billion for hud in fy2013 , pre - sequester and pre - rescission . accounting for sequestration and the across - the - board rescission , hud was provided with about $ 31.4 billion in fy2013 . the house bill ( h.r . 2610 ) proposed about $ 28 billion in net new budget authority , while the senate bill ( s. 1243 ) proposed about $ 35 billion . congress did not enact any final fy2014 appropriations prior to the start of the fiscal year on october 1 , 2013 , resulting in a funding lapse and partial government shutdown that lasted until a short - term continuing resolution was enacted on october 17 , 2013. under the terms of that cr ( p.l . 113-46 ) , federal departments and agencies , including those typically funded by the thud appropriations bill , are funded at their fy2013 levels , post - rescission and post - sequestration , back - dated from october 1 , 2013 , through january 15 , 2014. the cr contained several thud - related anomalies .
