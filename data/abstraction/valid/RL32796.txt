prior to the july 2005 g8 summit , britain 's prime minister tony blair launched a majordiplomatic effort to marshal the resources he sees as needed to eradicate extreme poverty insub - saharan africa . as summit chair , he focused the meeting , held at gleneagles hotel in scotland , july 6-8 , on this initiative . blair pushed for a substantial aid increase for africa beginning in 2006 , through an `` international finance facility '' ( iff ) , and for 100 % forgiveness of poor country debt tothe international financial institutions . the iff would have issued bonds to finance an additional $ 25billion in annual aid to africa for three to five years , followed by another $ 25 billion boost if africangovernments improved their managerial and administrative capabilities . iff bonds would have beenbacked by a promise from the g7 leading economic powers to repay them after 2015. poor countrydebts to the world bank and the african development bank would have been repaid by the g7 , while debts to the international monetary fund ( imf ) would have been paid by revaluing or sellingimf gold . finally , blair sought the removal of barriers to africa 's exports . blair has long championed a `` marshall plan '' for africa as part of a `` deal '' to help the regionachieve the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , u.n. - endorsed targets for 2015 that includeuniversal primary education and sharp cuts in poverty . in exchange , he expects further governanceand free - market economic reforms in africa . on march 11 , 2005 a high - level commission forafrica appointed by blair issued a comprehensive report elaborating the initiative , which wonsupport from president chirac of france and germany 's chancellor schroeder . the bush administration reacted cooly to the proposed iff on grounds that it lacks a meansof assuring that new aid funds would be well spent . officials also argued that the iff wouldunconstitutionally bind future congresses to appropriations . iff supporters noted that the fundswould be passed through existing aid agencies with their own monitoring mechanisms . some alsoargued that the united states routinely agrees to repay debt in the future . at gleneagles , the iffproposal was dropped , but the participants agreed on a $ 25 billion increase in annual aid to africaby 2010. moreover , the g8 ratified an agreement on debt forgiveness for 18 of the world 's poorestcountries , including 14 in africa . the donors are to compensate the world bank and the africandevelopment bank for the lost repayments . the imf will fund the loss from its own resources , butnot sell gold . participants reiterated that they supported the removal of trade barriers , but no specificactions were taken . many development experts welcomed the summit 's results as an important stepforward ; but several non - governmental organizations argued that the summit had done too little ontrade or to mobilize `` new money . . previous g8 meetings have also focused on africa . there has been much debate overwhether g8 countries have fulfilled past promises -- and over whether the african states have mettheir own promises of reforms . this report will not be updated . for further information see crs report rl32489 ( pdf ) , africa : development issues and policy options , and crs issue brief ib95052 , africa : u.s. foreign assistance issues .
