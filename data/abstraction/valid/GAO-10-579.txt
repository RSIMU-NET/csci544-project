the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides medical care , disability compensation , and vocational rehabilitation to veterans . the veterans health administration ( vha ) -- a component of va -- provides care to over 5 million patients in more than 1,500 facilities . vha relies on an outpatient scheduling system that is over 25 years old . in 2000 , vha began the scheduling replacement project to modernize this system as part of a larger departmentwide modernization effort called healthevet . however , in february 2009 , va terminated a key contract supporting the project . gao was asked to determine the status of the scheduling replacement project , determine the effectiveness of va 's management and oversight of the project , and assess the impact of the project on va 's overall implementation of its healthevet initiative . to do so , gao reviewed project documentation and interviewed va and contractor officials . after spending an estimated $ 127 million over 9 years on its outpatient scheduling system project , va has not implemented any of the planned system 's capabilities and is essentially starting over . of the total amount , $ 62 million was expended for , among other things , project planning , management support , a development environment , and equipment . in addition , the department paid an estimated $ 65 million to the contractor selected to develop the replacement scheduling application . however , the application software had a large number of defects that va and the contractor could not resolve . as a result , the department terminated the contract , determined that the system could not be deployed , and officially ended the scheduling replacement project on september 30 , 2009. va began a new initiative that it refers to as healthevet scheduling on october 1 , 2009. as of april 2010 , the department 's efforts on this new initiative had largely consisted of evaluating whether to buy or custom build a new scheduling application . va 's efforts to successfully complete the scheduling replacement project were hindered by weaknesses in several key project management disciplines and a lack of effective oversight that , if not addressed , could undermine the department 's second effort to replace its scheduling system : va did not adequately plan its acquisition of the scheduling application and did not obtain the benefits of competition . va did not ensure requirements were complete and sufficiently detailed to guide development of the scheduling system . va performed system tests concurrently , increasing the risk that the system would not perform as intended , and did not always follow its own guidance , leading to software passing through the testing process with unaddressed critical defects . va 's project progress and status reports were not reliable , and included data that provided inconsistent views of project performance . va did not effectively identify , mitigate , and communicate project risks due to , among other things , staff members ' reluctance to raise issues to the department 's leadership . va 's various oversight boards had responsibility for overseeing the scheduling replacement project ; however , they did not take corrective actions despite the department becoming aware of significant issues . the impact of the scheduling project on the healthevet initiative can not yet be determined because va has not developed a comprehensive plan for healthevet that , among other things , documents the dependencies among the projects that comprise the initiative . va officials stated that the department plans to document the interdependencies , project milestones , and deliverables in an integrated master schedule as part of a project management plan that is expected to be completed by june 2010. in the absence of such a plan , the impact of the scheduling project 's failure on the healthevet program is uncertain . secretary of veterans affairs direct the chief information officer to take six actions to improve key processes , including acquisition management , system testing , and progress reporting , which are essential to the department 's second outpatient scheduling system effort . in written comments on a draft of this report , va generally concurred with gao 's recommendations and described actions to address them .
