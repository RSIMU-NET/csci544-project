americans spend billions of hours each year providing information to federal agencies by filling out information collections ( forms , surveys , or questionnaires ) . a major aim of the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) is to balance the burden of these collections with their public benefit . under the act , agencies ' chief information officers ( cio ) are responsible for reviewing information collections before they are submitted to the office of management and budget ( omb ) for approval . as part of this review , cios must certify that the collections meet 10 standards set forth in the act . gao was asked to assess , among other things , this review and certification process , including agencies ' efforts to consult with the public . to do this , gao reviewed a governmentwide sample of collections , reviewed processes and collections at four agencies that account for a large proportion of burden , and performed case studies of 12 approved collections . governmentwide , agency cios generally reviewed information collections and certified that they met the standards in the act . however , gao 's analysis of 12 case studies at the internal revenue service ( irs ) and the departments of veterans affairs , housing and urban development , and labor showed that cios certified collections even though support was often missing or partial . for example , in nine of the case studies , agencies did not provide support , as the law requires , for the standard that the collection was developed by an office with a plan and resources to use the information effectively . because omb instructions do not ask explicitly for this support , agencies generally did not address it . further , although the law requires agencies both to publish notices in the federal register and to otherwise consult with the public , agencies governmentwide generally limited consultation to the publication of notices , which generated little public comment . without appropriate support and public consultation , agencies have reduced assurance that collections satisfy the standards in the act . processes outside the pra review process , which are more rigorous and involve greater public outreach , have been set up by irs and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , whose missions involve numerous information collections and whose management is focused on minimizing burden . for example , each year , irs subjects a few forms to highly detailed , in - depth analyses , including extensive outreach to the public affected and the information users . irs reports that this process -- performed on forms that have undergone cio review and received omb approval -- has reduced burden by over 200 million hours since 2002. in contrast , for the 12 case studies , the cio review process did not reduce burden . without rigorous evaluative processes , agencies are unlikely to achieve the pra goal of minimizing burden while maximizing utility .
