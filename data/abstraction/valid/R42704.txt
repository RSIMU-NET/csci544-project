the purple heart is one of the oldest and most recognized american military medals , awarded to servicemembers who were killed or wounded by enemy action . the conflicts 2001 to the present have greatly increased the number of purple hearts awarded to servicemembers . events over the past few years have spurred debate on the eligibility criteria for the purple heart . shootings on u.s. soil and medical conditions such as traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) have prompted changes to the eligibility requirements for the purple heart . some critics believe that these changes may lessen the value of the medal and the sacrifices of past recipients on the battlefield . in the past , efforts to modify the purple heart 's eligibility requirements were contentious , and veterans groups were vocal concerning eligibility changes . while medal requirements are often left to the military and executive branch to decide , congress is involved in purple heart eligibility , utilizing its constitutional power `` to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces '' ( u.s. constitution , article i , section 8 , clause 14 ) . the carl levin and howard p. `` buck '' mckeon national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 ( p.l . 113-291 ) included language that expands eligibility for the purple heart . previous debates have raised several questions about the purple heart . in some respects , how an event is defined can determine eligibility : is a servicemember the victim of a crime or a terrorist attack ? . conversely , arguing that killed or wounded servicemembers `` should '' be eligible for the purple heart can redefine an event : is the servicemember an advisor to a foreign military or a combatant ? . are ptsd and other mental health conditions adequate injuries to warrant the purple heart ? . these are questions that congress might consider if it chooses to act on this issue .
