the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) was established by the national flood insurance act of 1968 ( nfia , 42 u.s.c . ยง4001 et seq . ) , and was most recently reauthorized to may 31 , 2019 , through a series of short - term reauthorizations . the general purpose of the nfip is both to offer primary flood insurance to properties with significant flood risk , and to reduce flood risk through the adoption of floodplain management standards . communities volunteer to participate in the nfip in order to have access to federal flood insurance , and in return are required to adopt minimum standards . the nfip is managed by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , through its subcomponent the federal insurance and mitigation administration ( fima ) . fema manages a risk mapping , assessment and planning ( risk map ) process to produce flood insurance rate maps ( firms ) . depicted on firms are special flood hazard areas ( sfhas ) , which are areas exposed to a 1 % or greater risk of annual flooding . firms vary in age across the country , and are updated on a prioritized basis . the risk map process provides extensive outreach and appeal opportunities for communities . updating a community 's firms can take three to five years or more . participating communities must adopt a flood map and enact minimum floodplain standards to regulate development in the sfha . fema encourages communities to enhance their floodplain standards by offering reduced premium rates through the community rating system ( crs ) . fema also manages a flood mitigation assistance ( fma ) grant program using nfip revenues to further reduce comprehensive flood risk . participating communities that fail to adopt firms or maintain minimum floodplain standards can be put on probation or suspended from the nfip . in communities that do not participate in the nfip , or have been suspended , individuals can not purchase nfip insurance . individuals in these communities also face challenges receiving federal disaster assistance in flood hazard areas , and have difficulties receiving federally backed mortgages . nfip insurance uses one of three types of standard flood insurance policies ( sfips ) . sfips have maximum coverage limits set by law . any federal entity that makes , guarantees , or purchases mortgages must , by law , require property owners in the sfha to purchase flood insurance , generally through the nfip . in moderate risk areas , community members may purchase preferred risk policies ( prps ) that offer less costly insurance . the day - to - day sale , servicing , and claims processing of nfip policies are conducted by private industry partners . most policies are serviced by companies that are reimbursed through the write your own ( wyo ) program . the premium rate for most nfip policies is intended to reflect the true flood risk . however , congress has directed fema to subsidize flood insurance for properties built before the community 's first firm ( i.e . , the pre - firm subsidy ) . in addition , fema `` grandfathers '' properties at their rate from past firms to updated firms through a cross - subsidy . congress has provided appropriations to the nfip for some of the cost of risk map . congress also authorizes the use of premium revenues for other nfip costs , including administration , salaries , and other expenses . nfip premiums also include other charges , such as a federal policy fee , a reserve fund assessment , and a surcharge to help fund the nfip . in october 2017 , congress cancelled $ 16 billion of nfip debt , making it possible for the program to pay claims for hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria . the nfip currently owes $ 20.525 billion to the u.s. treasury , leaving $ 9.9 billion in borrowing authority from a $ 30.425 billion limit in law . this debt is serviced by the nfip and interest is paid through premium revenues . after may 31 , 2019 , key authorities of the nfip , such as the authority to issue new insurance contracts , will expire if they are not reauthorized by congress .
