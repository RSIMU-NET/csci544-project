pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the effects of in - transit disbursements on the navy 's funds control and financial reporting . gao noted that : the navy and the department of defense ( dod ) have not established adequate funds control as required by the antideficiency act ; current policies and procedures permit the navy to delay for about 5 years : the recording of obligations in excess of available budget authority ; the initiation of required antideficiency act investigations ; and any resulting reports of violations to congress and the president ; during this time , the navy 's appropriation balances are unreliable , leaving dod and congress without assurance that budget authority has not been exceeded ; according to navy records , as of september 30 , 1997 , obligations for 9 cancelled and 20 expired appropriations may have exceeded available budget authority by a total of $ 290 million ; in accordance with dod policy , obligations have been recorded in the nine appropriations that have cancelled ; at the time of gao 's review , the navy 's records indicated that these obligations may have exceeded budget authority ; although the navy maintained cuff records ( separately prepared spreadsheets used to track obligations ) that it also would need to record to resolve problem in - transit disbursements in the 20 expired appropriations , these obligations were not recorded in the navy 's accounting system ; if these obligations had been recorded , the obligation records for the 20 expired appropriations would have shown that these appropriations also may have obligations that exceed available budget authority ; navy officials stated that an investigation of these appropriations would show that they are not overobligated ; at the time of gao 's review , the navy had not initiated an antideficiency act investigation of any of the 29 appropriations , although dod policy requires investigations of the 9 cancelled appropriations with recorded obligations in excess of available budget authority ; in addition to the lack of control over funds , these problems have a major effect on the accuracy and reliability of the navy 's financial reporting , including its annual financial statements required under the chief financial officers act ; and until transactions are recorded accurately and in a timely manner , and reflected in these financial statements , the navy and dod will remain unable to achieve the goal of producing reliable financial statements .
