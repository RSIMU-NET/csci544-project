as broadband availability grows , americans — including those in rural areas — increasingly partake in communications and services offered via the internet . some of these internet services have changed how individuals use usps . though many factors influence use of postal services , understanding the relationship between broadband use and the use of postal services is critical to both the future of postal services overall and the communication options available to rural residents . gao was asked to examine the relationship between broadband and postal use , particularly in rural areas . this report addresses the relationship between broadband use and the use of usps 's mail services , package and shipping services , and post offices , particularly in rural areas . to address these objectives , gao reviewed literature on broadband and mail trends , factors associated with postal and broadband use , and the role of post offices in rural america . gao conducted regression analyses using 2007-2014 data , the most recent available , from the usps hds , which collects information from a nationally representative sample of households . gao interviewed local stakeholders , such as officials from post offices and internet service providers , in five rural areas , chosen based on recent deployment of broadband and other factors . gao also interviewed 11 postal experts , chosen based on participation in previous gao work and postal conferences . gao is not making recommendations in this report . usps did not have any comments on the draft report . broadband use has in recent years been associated with reduced use of first - class mail . continued declines as a result of broadband , however , are uncertain . broadband access to various internet services , especially online bill paying , is associated with reduced use of transaction mail , a subset of first - class mail . gao analysis of the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) household diary survey ( hds ) data from 2007-2014 found that households using broadband to access internet services tended to send less transaction mail than other households , controlling for age , income , and education . however , gao found that in recent years broadband use may not have had a statistically significant effect on correspondence mail , a subset of first - class mail that includes letters and greeting cards . experts gao spoke with had mixed views on the future of first - class mail as a result of broadband use , with only 4 of the 11 experts expecting decreases in first - class mail in the short term . several experts and officials suggested that internet privacy and security concerns , as well as many individuals having already changed postal habits in response to the internet , are among the factors that could be contributing to a slowed rate of “ electronic diversion ” from mail . with regard to rural areas , gao analysis of hds data suggests that rural households without broadband tended to send more transaction and correspondence mail than non - rural households without broadband in recent years . the officials in rural areas gao interviewed generally agreed that residents of rural areas value mail and postal services for a variety of reasons , including that they have fewer retail alternatives and trust usps services . despite this relationship , gao found that the subset of rural households with broadband were not statistically different in the volume of correspondence mail sent compared to non - rural households . in rural areas , two groups of businesses that gao spoke with also noted that improved internet access could result in mail volume declines . e - commerce continues to have a strong effect on usps package and shipping volumes . gao analysis of hds data found that broadband use in the home was associated with sending and receiving more packages with usps in recent years . this analysis also found that households in rural areas made greater use of package and shipping services , a view echoed in interviews with officials in rural areas . while research and experts interviewed by gao generally agreed that usps 's package business will grow in the short term , usps is likely to face longer - term challenges , such as increased competition in the delivery market . it is unclear what role broadband use has played in the reduction in post office visits in recent years . gao analysis of hds data found no statistically significant relationship between broadband use and post office visits . however , gao found that rural households tend to visit post offices more regardless of broadband use . local stakeholders gao interviewed said that rural residents may use post offices at higher rates because post offices play a valuable social role in small communities and that alternatives for certain services , such as money orders , are lacking . to balance the benefits of its postal retail network with the high costs of some facilities , usps is undertaking various initiatives . despite these efforts , balancing the benefits of a robust network with the costs of maintaining that network , especially in rural areas , will remain a challenge for usps .
