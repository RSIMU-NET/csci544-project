the settlement reached in cobell v. salazar was authorized by the claims resolution act of 2010 on december 8 , 2010. under the terms of the settlement , the united states government will pay $ 1.4 billion to members of the class who sought to have a historical accounting of their iim accounts ( an abbreviation for individual indian monies ) . an additional $ 2 billion will be provided by the government for the purpose of consolidating fractionated trust and restricted lands . first filed in 1996 , cobell v. salazar involved the department of the interior 's ( doi 's ) management of several money accounts . these money accounts , or iims , as distinguished from tribal trust funds , are monies which the federal government holds for the benefit of individual indians . the conflict in the case traced to the federal government 's trust responsibility with respect to american indians . in the capacity of trustee , the united states holds title to much of indian tribal land and land allotted to individual indians . receipts from leases , timber sales , or mineral royalties are paid to the federal government for disbursement to the appropriate indian property owners . the united states has fiduciary responsibilities to manage indian monies and assets which have been derived from these lands and are held in trust . however , several of the beneficiaries of these trust funds alleged that doi mismanaged these funds and filed suit in order to obtain a proper accounting of these funds and to receive damages if warranted . after more than a decade of litigation over obligations associated with the management of the iim accounts — consisting of over 3,600 documents and over 20 federal district court and court of appeals opinions — the parties ultimately reached a settlement on december 7 , 2009. however , the settlement , which by its terms would create a trust administration fund and a land consolidation fund , required congressional authorization before it could go into effect . a year later , congress authorized the settlement through the claims resolution act of 2010 ( cra ) , which was signed by president obama on december 8 , 2010. the district court approved the settlement on july 27 , 2011. after appeals to the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit and petitions for certiorari to the supreme court were denied , the settlement became final on november 24 , 2012 .
