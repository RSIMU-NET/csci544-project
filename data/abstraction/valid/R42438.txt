the republic of the union of myanmar ( burma ) held parliamentary by - elections on april 1 , 2012. according to the official results announced by union election commission ( uec ) , the national league for democracy ( nld ) won all but two of the 45 seats , including nld chair aung san suu kyi winning a seat in the lower house of burma 's national parliament . depending its assessment of the conduct of the election and the official election results , the obama administration may seek to alter policy towards burma , possibly including the waiver or removal of some current sanctions . such a shift may require congressional action , or may be done using executive authority granted by existing laws . the by - elections originally were to fill 46 vacant seats in burma 's national parliament ( out of a total of 664 seats ) and 2 seats in local parliaments . on march 23 , the uec postponed voting for three seats from the kachin state for security reasons . a total of 17 political parties ran candidates in the by - elections , including the nld and the pro - military union solidarity and development party ( usdp ) . the by - elections are viewed as significant primarily because of the decision by the nld to compete for the vacant seats . the nld and others allege that some burmese officials and the usdp took steps to disrupt the nld 's campaign and possibly win the by - elections by fraudulent means . despite these problems , events at which aung san suu kyi spoke routinely drew tens of thousands of people . in response to international pressure , the union government invited the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) , the european union ( eu ) , the united nations , the united states , and other nations to send election observers . although largely free and fair by - elections would be a significant development , the current political situation in burma remains a source of serious concern for u.s. policy makers . hundreds of political prisoners remain in detention . despite ceasefire talks , fighting between the burmese military and various ethnic militias continues , resulting in a new flow of internally displaced people ( idps ) and refugees into nearby countries . reports of severe human rights abuses by the burmese military against civilians in conflict areas regularly appear in the international press . the response of the obama administration to burma 's by - elections will depend on the conduct of the campaign , the balloting process , the veracity of the official election results , and possibly on how the winners of the elections are treated once they become members of burma 's parliaments . in addition , the assessments of opposition parties ( particularly the nld and its chairperson , aung san suu kyi ) , other nations and the eu to the by - elections may influence the u.s. response . under current law , president barack obama has the authority to waive many — but not all — of the existing sanctions on burma , and he may choose to exercise that authority following the by - elections . alternatively , the white house may ask congress to consider legislation removing or altering some the existing sanctions . for its own part , congress may decide to re - examine u.s. policy toward burma and make whatever changes it deems appropriate . for additional information on burma , see crs report r41971 , u.s. policy towards burma : issues for the 112th congress ; crs report r41336 , u.s. sanctions on burma ; and crs report r42363 , burma 's political prisoners and u.s. sanctions . the report will be updated following the announcement of the official results of the by - elections , and as circumstances warrant .
