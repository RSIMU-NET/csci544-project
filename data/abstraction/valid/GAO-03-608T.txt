according to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , charities are increasingly turning to vehicle donation programs as a fund - raising activity , resulting in increased solicitations for donated vehicles . therefore , to make informed decisions about donating their vehicles , taxpayers should be aware of how vehicle donation programs operate , the role of fund - raisers and charities in the vehicle donation process , and irs rules and regulations regarding allowable tax deductions . due to the increased use of vehicle donation programs , gao was asked to describe the vehicle donation process , the amount of proceeds received by charities and fund - raisers , donor tax deductions , and taxpayer cautions and guidance . revenue from donated vehicles is a welcomed , and sometimes crucial , source of income for a number of charities . donors , by following available guidance and making careful selection of charities for their donations , can provide charity support while benefiting themselves through tax deductions or disposing of unwanted vehicles . taxpayers generally first learn about vehicle donation programs through advertisements . interested donors call the advertised number and either reach a charity that operates its program in - house , or a third - party fund - raiser acting on the charity 's behalf . the charity or fund - raiser asks questions of the potential donor regarding the vehicle , and then collects and sells the vehicle for proceeds . the proceeds a charity receives from a vehicle donation may be less than what a donor expects . two factors contribute to this difference . first , charities often sell vehicles at auto auctions for wholesale prices rather than the prices donors may receive if they sold their vehicles themselves . second , vehicle processing costs -- whether the charity 's or the fund - raiser 's -- - as well as the fund - raiser 's portion of net proceeds further reduces the amount of proceeds a charity receives . of the 129 million individual returns filed for tax year 2000 , an estimated 733,000 returns had tax deductions for vehicle donations that lowered taxpayers ' tax liability by an estimated $ 654 million . no data exist on whether these deductions were appropriately claimed . to assist donors in making decisions regarding vehicle donations , irs and other organizations have issued guidance on steps potential donors should take before making vehicle donations . these steps include verifying that the recipient organization is tax - exempt , asking questions about vehicle donation proceeds , and deducting only the fair market value of the vehicle on tax returns .
