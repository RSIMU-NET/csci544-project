in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , congress and president bush moved to consolidate numerous federal emergency plans into a single , unified national response plan . the end product of these efforts was the national response plan ( nrp ) , which established broad lines of authority for agencies responding to emergencies and major disasters . perceived problems with the implementation of the nrp during hurricane katrina led congress to enact the post - katrina management reform act ( p.l . 109-295 ) to integrate preparedness and response authorities . the legislation directed dhs to issue a successor plan to the nrp entitled the national response framework ( nrf ) . implemented in march 2008 , the nrf establishes a new approach to coordinating federal and nonfederal resources and entities . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) maintains that the nrf is an improvement over the nrp . some , however , assert that the nrf is not an improvement because it does not fully address the problems and challenges associated with the nrp . this report discusses how national response planning documents have evolved over time and describes the authorities that shape the nrf . several issue areas that might be examined for potential lawmaking and oversight concerning the nrf are also highlighted . this report will be updated as significant legislative or administrative changes occur .
