current u.s. energy tax policy is a combination of long - standing provisions and relatively new incentives . provisions supporting the oil and gas sector reflect desires for domestic energy production and energy security , long - standing cornerstones of u.s. energy policy . incentives for renewable energy reflect the desire to have a diverse energy supply , also consistent with a desire for domestic energy security . incentives for energy efficiency are designed to reduce use of energy from all energy sources . incentives for renewable energy , energy efficiency , and alternative technology vehicles reflect environmental concerns related to the production and consumption of energy using fossil - based resources . many energy - related tax provisions are temporary , with a number scheduled to expire at the end of 2016. most recently , expired energy tax incentives were extended as part of the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( p.l . 114-113 ) . most energy - related provisions were extended for two years , through the end of 2016. incentives for wind and solar were given longer - term extensions , with credits scheduled to phase out over a multi - year period in the future . one issue is whether energy - related tax incentives currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 will be further extended . energy - related tax incentives reduce the amount of federal tax revenue collected . between 2015 and 2019 , it is estimated that incentives for fossil fuels will reduce revenues by $ 21.5 billion . for renewables , the cost of energy - related tax incentives is an estimated $ 46.5 billion over the same time period . the cost of tax incentives for energy efficiency is estimated to be $ 3.1 billion in federal revenue loss between 2015 and 2019. these estimates reflect the recent extensions enacted in p.l . 114-113. however , further extensions of energy - related tax provisions currently scheduled to expire would increase the cost of these incentives . the obama administration has also proposed a number of changes to energy tax policy as part of its annual budget proposal . similar to past budgets , the fy2017 proposal suggests repealing a number of existing tax incentives for fossil fuels , while providing new or expanded incentives for carbon sequestration , alternative and advanced technology vehicles , renewable electricity , energy efficiency , and advanced energy manufacturing . the fy2017 budget also proposes a per - barrel fee on oil . energy tax policy involves the use of one of the government 's main fiscal instruments , taxes ( both as an incentive and as a disincentive ) to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and their use . in theory , energy taxes and subsidies , like tax policy instruments in general , are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic ( efficiency , equity , or even macroeconomic ) objective . the economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government 's perceived ability to correct for market failures . to correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options , including taxes , subsidies , and regulation , in an effort to achieve policy goals . in practice , energy tax policy in the united states is made in a political setting , determined by fiscal dictates and the views and interests of the key players in this setting , including policymakers , special interest groups , and academic scholars . as a result , enacted tax policy embodies compromises between economic and political goals , which could either mitigate or compound existing distortions .
