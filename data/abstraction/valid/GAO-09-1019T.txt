the department of defense ( dod ) and other executive agencies increasingly deploy civilians in support of contingency operations in iraq and afghanistan . prior gao reports show that the use of deployed civilians has raised questions about the potential for differences in policies on compensation and medical benefits . when these civilians are deployed and serve side by side , differences in compensation or medical benefits may become more apparent and could adversely impact morale . this statement is based on gao 's june 2009 congressionally requested report , which compared agency policies and identified any issues in policy or implementation regarding compensation , medical benefits , and identification and tracking of deployed civilians . gao reviewed laws , agency policies and guidance ; interviewed responsible officials at the office of personnel management ( opm ) and the six selected agencies , including dod and state ; reviewed workers ' compensation claims filed by deployed civilians with the department of labor from january 1 , 2006 through april 30 , 2008 ; and conducted a survey of deployed civilians . gao made ten recommendations for agencies to take actions such as reviewing compensation laws and policies , establishing medical screening requirements , and creating mechanisms to assist and track deployed civilians . at the time of this testimony , the agencies were in various stages of taking action . while policies concerning compensation for deployed civilians are generally comparable , gao found some issues that affect the amount of compensation -- depending on such things as the pay system -- and the accuracy , timeliness , and completeness of this compensation . for example , two comparable civilian supervisors who deploy under different pay systems may receive different rates of overtime pay because this rate is set by the employee 's pay system and grade / band . while a congressional subcommittee asked opm to develop a benefits package for all civilians deployed to war zones and recommend enabling legislation , at the time of gao 's review , opm had not yet done so . also , implementation of some policies may not always be accurate or timely . for example , gao estimates that about 40 percent of the deployed civilians in its survey reported experiencing problems with compensation , including danger pay . gao recommended , among other things , that opm oversee an agency working group on compensation to address differences and , if necessary , make legislative recommendations . opm generally concurred with this recommendation . although agency policies on medical benefits are similar , gao found some issues with medical care following deployment , workers ' compensation , and post deployment medical screenings that affect the benefits of deployed civilians . specifically , while dod allows its treatment facilities to care for non - dod civilians following deployment in some cases , the circumstances are not clearly defined and some agencies were unaware of dod 's policy . civilians who deploy also may be eligible for benefits through workers ' compensation . gao 's analysis of 188 such claims revealed some significant delays resulting in part from a lack of clarity about the documentation required . without clear information on what documents to submit , applicants may continue to experience delays . further , while dod requires medical screening of civilians before and following deployment , state requires screenings only before deployment . prior gao work found that documenting the medical condition of deployed personnel before and following deployment was critical to identifying conditions that may have resulted from deployment . in june 2009 , gao recommended , among other things , that state establish post - deployment screening requirements and that dod establish procedures to ensure its post - deployment screenings requirements are completed . each agency provided gao with a list of deployed civilians , but none had fully implemented policies to identify and track these civilians . dod , for example , had procedures to identify and track civilians but concluded that its guidance was not consistently implemented . while the other agencies had some ability to identify and track civilians , some had to manually search their systems . thus , agencies may lack critical information on the location and movement of personnel , which may hamper their ability to intervene promptly to address emerging health issues . gao recommended that dod enforce its tracking requirements and the other five agencies establish tracking procedures . dod and four agencies concurred with the recommendations ; one agency did not .
