the affordable care act ( aca ) creates shared responsibilities for both employers and individuals with regard to health insurance coverage . the aca expands federal private health insurance market requirements and requires the creation of health insurance exchanges to provide individuals and small employers with access to insurance . this report examines the new employer responsibilities . to ensure that employers continue to provide some degree of health coverage , the aca includes a `` shared responsibility '' provision . this provision does not require that an employer offer employees health insurance ; however , the aca imposes penalties on a `` large '' employer if at least one of its full - time employees obtains a premium credit through the newly established exchange . as of 2015 , employers with at least 50 full - time equivalent ( fte ) employees are subject to the shared responsibility provisions . however , in 2015 only , employers with between 50 and 100 fte employees were eligible for transition relief if certain criteria were met . the aca sets out a multi - stage process for determining , first , which firms may be subject to the penalty ( i.e . , definition of large ) , and second , which workers within a firm would trigger the penalty . complex calculations and multiple definitions of full - time work have led to confusion among policymakers and employers . this report discusses these definitions and the application to the employer penalty in greater detail . the potential employer penalty applies to all common law employers , including government entities ( such as federal , state , local , or indian tribal government entities ) and nonprofit organizations that are exempt from federal income taxes . if multiple businesses are owned by one individual or entity , employees in each of the franchises must be aggregated to determine the number of both ftes and full - time employees . the actual amount of the penalty varies depending on whether an employer currently offers insurance coverage and the number of full - time employees . employers must provide both affordable and adequate health insurance coverage to avoid paying a penalty . coverage is considered affordable if the employee 's required contribution to the plan does not exceed 9.66 % of the employee 's household income for 2016. however , the internal revenue service ( irs ) allows employers to use the employee 's w - 2 income in lieu of household income for this calculation ( because most employers do not readily have information on an employee 's household income ) . a health plan is considered to provide adequate coverage if the plan 's actuarial value ( i.e . , the share of the total allowed costs that the plan is expected to cover ) is at least 60 % . the total penalty for any applicable large employer is based on its number of full - time employees . the aca specified that working 30 hours or more per week is considered full - time . employers have some flexibility to designate certain measurement or look - back periods ( up to 12 months ) during which they calculate whether a worker is full - time or not . once an employee is determined to be full - time , there is an administrative period to enroll employees in a health plan , if necessary . if an employer penalty is levied under the aca requirements , it applies only for the time period following the administrative period , which is called the stability period . an employer is not penalized if an employee enters the exchange and receives a premium credit during the measurement period . appendix a provides a list of employer reporting requirements . appendix b includes a table of relevant legislation introduced in the 114th congress .
