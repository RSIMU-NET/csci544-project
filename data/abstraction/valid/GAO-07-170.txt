rising oil prices , resulting from growth in energy consumption by rapidly developing asian nations and by most industrialized nations , have increased concern about competition over oil and natural gas resources . in particular , congress expressed interest in how the united states participates in energy cooperation through international forums . gao was asked to review : what are the key international energy forums in which the united states pursues energy cooperation , what are some of the key emerging energy market issues that are important for international energy cooperation , and how is the united states addressing these issues through its participation in these forums . gao 's work is based on contacts with agency officials and energy experts and review of documents . the united states pursues energy cooperation through several international energy forums designed to meet specific cooperative needs . they include a formal institution with binding petroleum reserve obligations , regional associations , and informal gatherings designed to facilitate information exchange . major forums include the international energy agency ( iea ) , the asia pacific economic cooperation energy working group , the north american energy working group , and the international energy forum . gao identified three energy market issues that are important for u.s. efforts in international energy cooperation . first , a tighter energy market with higher , more volatile , prices has developed . this is due to an unanticipated rise in energy demand and constrained supply due to less spare crude oil production capacity and increased political frictions in certain supplier countries . second , market participation of national oil and gas companies , which are majority owned by governments , has led to limitations on access to resources . third , more reliable energy market information is needed to facilitate market stability and plan investment . the u.s. government has addressed these issues through its participation in international energy cooperation forums ; however , the nature of the forums can limit their impact . forums have restricted membership , consensus - based agendas and decisions , and voluntary participation . they generally focus on noncontroversial issues such as energy efficiency and technology . within these constraints , the united states has tried to mitigate effects of tight markets by supporting emergency preparedness . it has not directly addressed the impact of national oil companies , but it has pursued related areas . it has sought to improve energy information , but energy information administration ( eia ) statistical expertise has not been consistently leveraged for purposes beyond data exchange , and u.s. data submissions to the iea have not been timely .
