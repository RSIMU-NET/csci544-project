in 2009 , 46 % of students in grades 9-12 reported that they had experienced sexual intercourse ; about 20 % of female teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant each year . in recognition of the often negative , long - term consequences associated with teenage pregnancy , congress has provided funding for the prevention of teenage and out - of - wedlock pregnancies . this report discusses three programs that exclusively attempt to reduce teenage pregnancy . the adolescent family life ( afl ) demonstration program was enacted in 1981 as title xx of the public health service act , and the abstinence education program was enacted in 1996 as part of the welfare reform legislation . also , since fy2001 , additional funding for community - based abstinence education programs has been included in annual department of health and human services ( hhs ) appropriations . p.l . 111-117 , the consolidated appropriations for fy2010 ( enacted december 16 , 2009 ) , includes a new discretionary teen pregnancy prevention ( tpp ) program , identical to the one proposed in the president 's fy2010 budget , which would provide grants and contracts on a competitive basis to public and private entities to fund `` medically accurate and age appropriate '' programs that reduce teen pregnancy ( much of the money would be used to replicate programs that were proven effective through rigorous evaluation , and some of the money would be used to develop , refine , and test additional models and innovative strategies ) . the new tpp program is funded at $ 110 million for fy2010 . although no abstinence - only education funding was appropriated in p.l . 111-117 ( the consolidated appropriations for fy2010 ; enacted december 16 , 2009 ) , p.l . 111-148 ( the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) ; enacted march 23 , 2010 ) restored funding to the title v abstinence education formula block grant to states at the previous annual level of $ 50 million for each of fy2010-fy2014 ( $ 250 million over five years ) . in addition , p.l . 111-148 established a new state formula grant program and appropriated $ 75 million annually for each of fy2010 â€“ fy2014 to enable states to operate a new personal responsibility education program ( $ 375 million over five years ) . the new personal responsibility education program is a comprehensive approach to teen pregnancy prevention that educates adolescents on both abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases , and it also provides youth with information about several adulthood preparation subjects ( i.e . , healthy relationships , adolescent development , financial literacy , parent - child communication , educational and career success , and healthy life skills ) .
