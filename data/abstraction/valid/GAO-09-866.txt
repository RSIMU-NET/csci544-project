before approving a drug , the food and drug administration ( fda ) assesses a drug 's effectiveness . this assessment may be based on evidence showing that a drug has a positive impact on a surrogate endpoint -- a laboratory measure , such as blood pressure -- instead of more direct clinical evidence , like preventing strokes . after approval , fda often requires or requests a drug sponsor to further study the drug . concerns have been raised about fda 's reliance on surrogate endpoints and its oversight of postmarketing studies . this report provides information on all drug applications approved based on surrogate endpoints in fda 's accelerated approval process , a subset of applications for potentially innovative drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints under fda 's traditional process , and fda 's oversight of postmarketing studies . gao identified drugs approved based on surrogate endpoints , obtained the status of related postmarketing studies , and reviewed fda 's oversight of a sample of 35 studies it required under its accelerated approval process , selected to include studies which were at varying levels of completion . fda approved 90 applications for drugs based on surrogate endpoints through its accelerated approval process from the creation of the process in 1992 through november 20 , 2008 , and about two - thirds of postmarketing studies have been closed . fda created the accelerated approval process to expedite the approval of drugs which are designed to treat serious or life - threatening illnesses and are expected to provide meaningful therapeutic benefits compared to existing treatments . under this process , 79 of the 90 applications were approved for drugs to treat cancer , hiv / aids , and inhalation anthrax . because of the need to expedite approval , fda approves drugs under this process based on surrogate endpoints which are not yet proven substitutes for clinical endpoints , but does require that drug sponsors complete postmarketing studies to confirm the drug 's clinical benefit . fda had required drug sponsors to conduct 144 postmarketing confirmatory studies associated with these 90 applications , and as of december 19 , 2008 , classified 64 percent as closed -- meaning that drug sponsors had met fda 's requirements for these studies or fda determined the studies were no longer needed or feasible . however , several of the remaining studies have been classified by fda as open for an extended period . fda approved 69 applications on the basis of surrogate endpoints for new molecular entities ( nme ) -- potentially innovative drugs containing active chemical substances that have never been approved for marketing in the united states in any form -- through its traditional approval process from january 1998 through june 30 , 2008. these 69 nme drugs accounted for about one - third of the 204 applications for nme drugs which fda approved through its traditional process during this period , many for drugs to treat cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . unlike surrogate endpoints used in the accelerated process , fda considers those used in the traditional process as valid substitutes for demonstrating the clinical benefit of drugs , and thus does not require sponsors to complete postmarketing confirmatory studies . however , fda requested that sponsors complete 175 postmarketing studies to obtain other information on many of these nme drugs , and as of february 13 , 2009 , fda classified about one - half as closed . weaknesses in fda 's monitoring and enforcement process hamper its ability to effectively oversee postmarketing studies . fda has not routinely been reviewing sponsors ' annual submissions on the status of studies in a timely manner . it has little in the way of readily accessible , comprehensive data to monitor studies ' progression and does not consider such oversight a priority . fda is implementing initiatives to improve its oversight , but it is too early to tell if they will be effective . although fda has authority to expedite the withdrawal of a drug from the market if a sponsor does not complete a required confirmatory study with due diligence , or if a study fails to confirm a drug 's clinical benefit , it has not specified the conditions thatwould prompt it to do so . it has never exercised its authority , even when such study requirements have gone unfulfilled for nearly 13 years .
