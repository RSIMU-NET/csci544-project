india 's population is expected to surpass china as the world 's largest by 2022 , reaching approximately 1.4 billion people , creating greater demand for energy . india has the potential to be a much larger producer and consumer of natural gas . competing political and economic factors have limited the government 's effectiveness in changing the country 's energy mix , which is heavily weighted toward coal and oil . continually beset by high - profile environmental issues such as major air pollution and contaminated water supplies due to their reliance on coal and oil , the indian government is now setting policies to increase lower - carbon energy use , but whether the government can overcome the economic and political hurdles remains a question . the portion of natural gas in india 's energy mix , 7 % , remains small compared to that of the united states , though it is comparable to similar emerging economies like brazil , china , and south africa . despite india 's intentions to double the proportion of natural gas consumption by 2022 , achieving this goal would require major upstream , midstream , and downstream investments as well as the continued political will to enact the necessary changes to decrease reliance on coal and oil . india 's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which congress has expressed an interest . those issues include the prospects for u.s. hydrocarbon exports , u.s. energy companies ' investments , indian investments in u.s. natural gas production , india 's ability to meet its international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change , and india 's plans for integrating itself into the growing south asian energy market . in the mid - 2000s , members of both houses of congress expressed interest to formalize closer energy ties between the united states and india , and legislation was introduced . the legislation was not enacted into law ; however , the executive branch has implemented programs to further improve the energy partnership between the two nations . india 's central government manages its energy sector mainly via four ministries : power ; coal ; petroleum and natural gas ; and new and renewable energy ; along with the department of atomic energy . decades ago the government of india created entities designated `` public sector undertakings ( psus ) `` to ensure complete control of the petroleum logistics chain . these psus have become some of india 's largest companies . the oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc ) , gas authority of india limited ( gail ) , and indian oil corporation limited are consistently ranked among the world 's bigger energy companies . the psus are india 's primary international and domestic energy actors , although some private sector companies have become key players as well . however , government control of the energy sector has stymied india 's development of its domestic resources and hindered its efforts internationally . in the past decade , india has incentivized foreign access to its upstream sector as a way to increase domestic production . some of india 's energy companies are also investing more in u.s. energy projects and have signed contracts to import u.s. liquefied natural gas ( lng ) . due to limited drilling activity and available information , how much technically recoverable natural gas exists in india is unclear . however , india 's current assessment of total reserves — resources that are economically and technically viable under existing market conditions — is estimated to represent less than 1 % of the global natural gas total . as india attempts to shift away from coal and oil over the coming decades , natural gas production , especially from offshore resources , is seen as a way to increase domestic supply . combined with improving infrastructure for imported lng , india could become a bigger natural gas consumer in the future .
