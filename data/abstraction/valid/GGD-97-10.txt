pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the operations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's ( noaa ) commissioned corps , focusing on : whether there continues to be a need for a commissioned corps with military - like pay , allowances , and benefits ; and what the costs would be if federal civilian employees performed the corps ' functions . gao found that : the noaa corps carries out civilian , rather than military , functions ; corps officers operate and manage noaa research and survey ships that collect the data needed to support fishery management plans , oceanographic and climate research , and hydrographic surveys ; corps officers ' entitlement to military ranks and military - like compensation was an outgrowth of their temporary assignments to the armed forces during world wars i and ii ; the department of defense 's war mobilization plans envision no role for the corps in the future ; corps officers are not subject to the uniform code of military justice ; the government would realize estimated net savings of $ 661,000 by converting the corps to civilian status ; and a general downsizing in the department of commerce reduced the number of corps officers to 332 as of july 1996 , with a goal of 285 officers by 2000 .
