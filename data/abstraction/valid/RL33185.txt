this report covers developments in liberia , a small , poor west african country . liberia held elections in october 2005 , with a presidential runoff in november , a key step in a peace - building process following its second civil war in a decade . that war began in 1999 , escalated in 2000 , and ended in 2003. it pitted the forces of charles taylor , elected president in 1997 after liberia 's first civil war ( 1989-1997 ) , against two armed anti - taylor rebel groups . the war also destabilized neighboring states , which accepted liberian refugees and , in some cases , hosted anti - taylor forces and became targets of the taylor regime . ellen johnson sirleaf , an economist , won the presidential runoff vote with 59.4 % of votes cast and took office in january 2006 , becoming the first elected female president of an african country . her runoff rival , george weah , a former star soccer player , conceded sirleaf 's win after initially contesting it . most observers viewed the vote as orderly , free , and fair . it fulfilled a key goal of an august 2003 peace accord that had ended the second civil war and led to an ongoing , u.s. - aided post - war transition process , which is bolstered by the multifaceted peacekeeping and development - focused u.n. mission in liberia ( unmil ) . the next election is scheduled for 2011 , and president sirleaf has announced that she will seek reelection . liberia 's security situation is stable but subject to periodic volatility . progress in governance under the interim government that preceded that of president sirleaf was mixed ; widespread corruption within it was widely reported . liberia 's economy and state structures remain devastated by war but , along with humanitarian conditions , are improving . liberia has received extensive u.s. post - war reconstruction and security sector reform assistance . in march 2006 , former president taylor was arrested in nigeria and transferred to the special court for sierra leone ( scsl ) to face war crimes charges . he was later transferred to the hague , the netherlands , where he is on trial by the scsl . in addition to providing substantial support for liberia 's post - war peace and reconstruction processes , congress has maintained a continuing interest in the status of charles taylor and in ensuring funding for the scsl . other legislation proposed in the 109th and 110th congresses centered on immigration , debt , and tax haven issues , and the commendation of liberia for successfully holding elections . liberia - specific legislation introduced or acted upon in the 111th congress has included h.r . 1105 ( obey ) ; h.r . 3288 ( olver ) ; s. 656 ( reed ) ; h.r . 2258 ( kennedy ) ; h.r . 2410 ( berman ) ; h.r . 2475 ( ros - lehtinen ) ; s. 1434 ( leahy ) ; and h.r . 2346 ( obey ) .
