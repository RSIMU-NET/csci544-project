the nsf spends more than $ 400 million of its $ 7 billion annual budget acquiring goods and services in support of its mission to promote science and engineering . much of this spending involves exploration activities in remote locations throughout the world , such as the arctic and antarctic . gao examined the extent to which nsf uses key contracting practices in three phases of the acquisition process : acquisition planning , contract award , and post - award contract monitoring . gao selected and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 11 contracts or orders with at least $ 3 million in funding obligations for fiscal year 2011 , which accounted for about 70 percent of nsf 's total contract obligations for that year . although all 11 contracts and orders received funding during fiscal year 2011 , some were awarded more than 7 years ago . some were awarded more recently . we reviewed each of the 11 contracts to determine the extent to which they reflected the use of key contracting practices based on the federal acquisition regulation , our prior work , and nsf - oig findings . gao also reviewed nsf contracting policies and met with nsf contracting and program officials . for the contracts gao reviewed , the national science foundation ( nsf ) generally used key contracting practices in each of the three phases of the acquisition process , but the agency needs additional guidance on early acquisition planning as well as arrangements for contract audits . the contracts gao reviewed all involved some degree of acquisition planning , but nsf 's guidance does not address appropriate time frames for early planning activities . without such guidance , nsf contract and program officials said they could not convince their colleagues of the need to initiate early planning activities . delays in these activities can lead to further delays later . for example , nsf had to extend one order on a non - competitive basis for more than a year to complete planning tasks for the follow - on order . in another case , the delayed award of an order compressed the data collection period for a report with firm deadlines , which could lead to higher overall costs . further , having sufficient time for early planning may facilitate an increased use of lower risk contracting approaches . contract documentation showed that nsf generally followed key practices in the award phase . an nsf corrective action plan , in response to nsf 's office of inspector general 's ( nsf - oig ) 2009 financial statement audits , clarifies the agency 's procedures for reviewing contractors ' accounting practices and financial disclosure statements to better align with key practices . contract file documentation shows nsf improved in this area , with most of the negotiated contracts having documentation of accounting system reviews . further , nsf generally documents price reasonableness determinations . nsf updated its guidance and took steps to incorporate key contract monitoring practices . nsf - oig 's 2009 financial statement audits recommended that nsf obtain incurred cost submissions and audits for its largest cost - reimbursable contracts to ensure the validity of costs billed to nsf . around the same time , the nsf - oig and the nsf office of the director signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) that provides a process for arranging for contract audits . audits for one of the ocean drilling contracts completed in 2012 resulted in $ 1.5 million in recovered funds . the nsf director and nsf - oig have both identified additional audits of this contract as a top priority . however , despite the terms of the mou , and the agreement between nsf and the nsf - oig on the need for further audits , arrangements have not been made to conduct additional audits of this contract for more recent fiscal years , according to officials . similarly , despite requests from the contracting officer , nsf has not made arrangements for incurred cost audits for another large contract gao reviewed . gao recommends that the director of nsf supplement existing guidance on acquisition planning to address the time needed for the early stages of the process , and arrange for audits to be performed on major contracts , consistent with the terms of the memorandum of understanding with nsf - oig . nsf agreed with the recommendations .
