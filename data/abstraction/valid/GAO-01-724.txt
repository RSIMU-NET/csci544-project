invasive species -- harmful , nonnative plants , animals , and microorganisms -- are widespread throughout the united states , causing billions of dollars of damage annually to crops , rangelands , and waterways . an important part of pest control is quick action to eradicate or contain a potentially damaging invasive species . federal rapid response to invasive species varies : species that threaten agricultural crops or livestock are far more likely to elicit a rapid response than those primarily affecting forestry or other natural areas , including rangelands and water areas . a major obstacle to rapid response is the lack of a national system to address invasive species . other obstacles to rapid response include the need for additional detection systems to identify new species ; improved partnerships among federal , state , and local agencies ; and better technologies to eradicate invasive species . the invasive species council 's management plan makes several recommendations for improving rapid response , including developing a program of coordinated rapid response and pursuing increases in discretionary spending to support the program . a concerted effort to improve the rapid response is clearly needed . if properly implemented , the council 's recommendations will go a long way toward developing a national system to address this pressing need .
