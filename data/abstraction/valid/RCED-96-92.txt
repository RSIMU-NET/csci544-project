pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided an overview of the u.s. agricultural research , education , and extension system , focusing on : how well certain agricultural research users believe the department of agriculture ( usda ) and land grant universities are meeting users ' research needs and disseminating their research results ; and usda approaches to setting research priorities . gao found that : the u.s. agricultural research , education , and extension system is diverse and decentralized and has both governmental and private components ; usda is a key player in that it conducts in - house research and funds in partnership with states activities at 74 land - grant universities and other institutions ; the private sector also conducts and funds research , usually for proprietary purposes ; in fiscal year ( fy ) 1992 , agricultural research expenditures totaled about $ 6.3 billion with the private sector contributing 60 percent , the federal government 25 percent , and states 15 percent ; in fy 1994 , the federal government spent $ 419 million on extension activities while states and counties spent almost $ 1 billion ; most agricultural research users believe that usda and land grant universities ' research and information dissemination is effective in meeting their needs , but many also believe that the research 's level of public funding and dissemination are inadequate ; users , usda , and universities have formed partnerships and collaborative efforts to stretch limited research resources ; usda lacks a departmentwide research agenda , adequate priority - setting and accountability processes , adequate information systems , and the ability to shift resources among priorities to plan and implement research priorities ; and usda is developing actions to address these problems , but it is too soon to determine their effectiveness .
