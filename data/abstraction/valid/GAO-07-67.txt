in february 2006 , the deficit reduction act of 2005 ( dra ) appropriated $ 2 billion for certain health care costs related to hurricane katrina through medicaid and the state children 's health insurance program ( schip ) . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) was charged with allocating the $ 2 billion in funding to states directly affected by the hurricane or that hosted evacuees . gao performed this work under the comptroller general 's statutory authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative . in this report , gao examined : how cms allocated the dra funds to states , the extent to which states have used dra funds , and whether selected states -- alabama , louisiana , mississippi , and texas -- anticipate the need for additional funds after dra funds are expended . to conduct this review , gao reviewed cms 's allocations of dra funds to all eligible states , focusing in particular on the four selected states that had the highest initial allocation ( released by cms on march 29 , 2006 ) . gao obtained data from medicaid offices in the four selected states regarding their experiences enrolling individuals , providing services , and submitting claims ; collected state medicaid enrollment data ; and analyzed dra expenditure data that states submitted to cms . as of september 30 , 2006 , cms allocated $ 1.9 billion of the $ 2 billion in dra funding to states . cms allocated funds to : category i -- the nonfederal share of expenditures for time - limited medicaid and schip services for eligible individuals affected by the hurricane ( 32 states ) ; category ii -- expenditures for time - limited uncompensated care services for individuals without a method of payment or insurance ( 8 of the 32 states ) ; and category iii -- the nonfederal share of expenditures for existing medicaid and schip beneficiaries ( alabama , louisiana , and mississippi ) . cms did not allocate funds to category iv -- for restoration of access to health care . after cms reconciles states ' expenditures with allocations , it will determine how to allocate the unallocated $ 136 million and unexpended funds from the $ 1.9 billion allocated to states . of the $ 1.9 billion in allocated dra funds , almost two - thirds of the 32 states that received these funds submitted claims totaling about $ 1 billion as of october 2 , 2006. claims from alabama , louisiana , and mississippi for category iii accounted for about 85 percent of all claims filed . these initial results are likely to change as states continue to file claims for services . of the four selected states , louisiana and texas raised concerns about their ability to meet future health care needs once the dra funds are expended . louisiana 's concerns involved managing its medicaid program across state borders as those who left the state remain eligible for the program . texas was significantly affected by the number of evacuees seeking services , thus raising concerns among state officials about the state 's future funding needs . cms , alabama , louisiana , and texas commented on a draft of this report . cms suggested the report clarify the dra funding categories , reallocation process , and communication strategy with states , especially louisiana . louisiana and texas commented on their ongoing challenges , and alabama provided technical comments . the report was revised as appropriate .
