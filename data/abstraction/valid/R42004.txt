health related data can be very valuable to researchers , scientists , and other academics . it can be just as valuable to participants in the market for the provision of health care . for example , pharmaceutical manufacturers use a process known as detailing to market prescription drugs . detailing involves sending representatives of the pharmaceutical manufacturers to individual doctors ' offices with information about prescription drugs and their various uses . the more information a detailer has about the doctor ( or medication prescriber ) that he or she is planning to market to , the better targeted , and more effective , the detailing becomes . consequently , information about the past prescribing practices of doctors can be valuable to detailers in designing their marketing strategies . an industry has developed to collect , aggregate , and analyze these prescriber data . these data gatherers sell the information they collect from pharmacies and hospitals about prescriber practices to pharmaceutical manufacturers for use in marketing . they also sell the data to researchers and others that might use the data , but this market is far smaller than the market consisting of pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers . some doctors find better - targeted detailing to be useful . other doctors find the sharing of their prescriber history without their consent , and its subsequent use as a marketing tool , to be an invasion of privacy . three states — maine , new hampshire , and vermont — have enacted statutes to restrict the sale and use of prescriber history data for the purposes of marketing ( though not for any other purpose ) without the consent of the doctor . the states claimed to be protecting the privacy interest of the doctors . also , the states were interested in lowering the costs of health care . because detailing effectively encourages the prescription of more expensive , brand - name drugs , data suggest that health care costs are measurably increased by detailing . the states reasoned that if detailing were less effective , then doctors might be more likely to prescribe generic drugs , which are cheaper than brand - name drugs , and health care costs overall would go down . the companies that collect , analyze , and sell these data challenged the laws , claiming that they were an unconstitutional restriction of their free speech rights under the first amendment . the first circuit court of appeals upheld the laws enacted by maine and new hampshire as restrictions on conduct rather than speech , and further found that even if the laws did restrict speech they were constitutional restrictions on commercial speech . the second circuit court of appeals struck down a functionally identical vermont statute . the second circuit found that the vermont law unconstitutionally restricted commercial speech . in order to resolve this split in the circuits , the supreme court granted certiorari in the second circuit case . a divided court affirmed the decision of the second circuit but applied a slightly different standard than the lower court .
