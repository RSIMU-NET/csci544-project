the federal government holds thousands of properties that agencies no longer need to accomplish their missions . when the government disposes of unneeded properties — through transfer , donation , or sale — it generates savings by eliminating maintenance costs . in addition , when state or local governments , nonprofits , or businesses acquire unneeded federal properties , they may be used to provide services to the public , such as temporary housing , or contribute to economic development . the general services administration ( gsa ) plays a central role in disposing of unneeded property at most federal agencies . the federal real property and administrative services act of 1949 ( property act ) gives gsa the authority to dispose of real property at all federal agencies unless they have independent statutory authority to dispose of their own properties themselves . a number of agencies have independent disposal authority — ranging from limited to broad in scope — including two of the largest federal landholders , the u.s. postal service ( usps ) and the department of defense . when an agency notifies gsa that it has unneeded real property , gsa first offers to transfer the property to another federal agency , which must pay fair market value for it . if no other agency wishes to acquire the property , gsa may then convey it to a state or local government , or a qualified nonprofit , for up to a 100 % discount — provided it is used for an approved public benefit . should a state or local government or qualified nonprofit wish to acquire the property for a use other than one of the approved public benefits , gsa has the option to sell the property to them at fair market value . finally , if the property is not sold to a public or nonprofit entity , it is offered for sale to the public . the disposal of a federal property may be subject to a number of environmental requirements and historic preservation mandates , although which requirements apply depends on a number of site - specific conditions . three principal federal statutes govern the environmental review process , identification and remediation of hazardous substances , and historic preservation : the national environmental protection act ( nepa ) , the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act of 1980 ( cercla ) , and the national historic preservation act ( nhpa ) . among the agencies with independent statutory disposal authority , usps has the greatest autonomy . the postal service has , in essence , been granted the authority to dispose of its properties as it deems appropriate , without the assistance of gsa . dod also has independent statutory disposal authority , but of a more limited scope . dod must use gsa to dispose of all properties that do not otherwise fall under the scope of special , temporary disposal authorities , commonly referred to as base realignment and closure ( brac ) legislation .
