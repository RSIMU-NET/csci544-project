pursuant to a congressional request , gao compared the timber sale programs of the bureau of land management and forest service with those of washington and oregon , focusing on : the major differences between the programs ; and how these differences affect agency and state planning processes . gao found that : the states ' timber sale programs are tailored to generate timber production revenues for funding of schools and counties ; federal legislation requires agencies to manage their lands for the public benefit , regulate timber harvests and protect other resources , and develop detailed management plans ; the states adjust the amount of timber they sell to take advantage of market prices ; the agencies sell a steady amount of timber regardless of market forces ; the states ' timberlands are generally available for timber production , contain only second - growth forests , and have road systems ; national forests are not exclusively available for timber production , contain old - growth and second - growth forests , and have road networks and exclusive wilderness areas ; the states ' timber sales are funded by a legislatively specified percentage of gross timber sale receipts ; federal timber sale programs are funded by annual appropriations ; the states ' long - and short - term planning processes are relatively short and involve generally fewer people than the federal agencies ' ; federal agencies must develop various alternative plans , satisfy conflicting interests , incorporate the public 's input , redevelop or review their plans on a regular basis , and face legal obstacles ; and modifying the agencies ' timber sales programs to resemble the states ' programs would require significant program structural changes and consideration of how to best balance the goals of multiple resource uses .
