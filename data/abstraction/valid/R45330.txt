the period since 2007 has been a time of significant change for labor markets . the great recession of 2007-2009 , the longest and deepest recession since the great depression , caused the unemployment rate to briefly reach 10 % , and labor markets have subsequently experienced a long and gradual recovery . most labor force metrics , including the unemployment rate and various other measures of labor force underutilization , have returned to levels that have historically been consistent with full employment . labor force participation one exception is the labor force participation rate ( the ratio of workers who have a job or are looking for a job to the overall adult population ) , which began declining before the great recession and has only levelled off more recently . the decline in the labor force participation rate is partly attributable to the aging of the population , particularly the retirement of the baby boomers . but even among prime - age workers ( age 25-54 ) , participation is historically low for men and has only just rebounded for women from the recession . participation among young workers also fell sharply during the recession and has not fully rebounded . economists disagree about whether there will be further recovery in the participation rate ; without further recovery , the economy will not be able to continue adding jobs at recent rates . shifts in the types of jobs both the great recession and the continuation of longer - term structural changes have caused employment growth since 2007 to vary significantly by occupation and industry . employment in goods - producing industries ( such as manufacturing and construction ) was hardest hit by the recession and had still not recovered by 2017 , whereas employment has grown in 9 out of 10 service - producing industries over that period . when viewed by occupation , employment growth since 2007 has been concentrated in certain occupations with low median wages ( food preparation and personal care ) and high median wages ( healthcare practitioners , business and financial operations , computer and mathematical , and management ) , while the decline in employment share has been concentrated in certain middle - wage occupations ( production , office and administrative support , and construction ) . this pattern has been referred to as the `` hollowing out '' or `` polarization '' of labor markets , and has been attributed largely to technological change and globalization . outcomes for demographic groups employment outcomes vary widely across demographic groups . employment rates have been persistently lower for young workers , lower - educated workers , and black workers . in addition to changing opportunities for those workers , the great recession hit those groups harder , with some lasting effects . men were more likely than women to participate in the labor force and be employed , but women 's employment rates rose relative to men 's over the 2000 to 2007 period . high unemployment in male - dominated industries ( construction and manufacturing ) and low unemployment in female - dominated industries ( health care and education ) contributed to relatively higher male unemployment during the recession . although unemployment rates for both sexes ultimately recovered , men 's labor force participation rates trended downward over the last 10 years while women 's were largely unchanged . looking forward going forward , policymakers face several labor market challenges , including ( 1 ) accommodating the current tightness in labor markets , while preparing for a return to recession at some point ; ( 2 ) the continuing slowdown in the growth of the labor force ( from 1.4 % between 1980 and 2000 to 0.6 % between 2000 and 2015 ) ; ( 3 ) addressing the labor market impacts of structural changes posed by technological change and globalization ; and ( 4 ) a decline in labor market dynamism ( e.g . , fewer workers switching jobs ) .
