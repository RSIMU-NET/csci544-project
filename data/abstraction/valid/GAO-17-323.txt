the navy envisioned a revolutionary approach for the lcs program : dual ship designs with interchangeable mission packages intended to provide mission flexibility . this approach has fallen short , with significant cost increases , schedule delays , and reduced capabilities — some of which have yet to be demonstrated . the lcs acquisition approach has changed several times . the latest change led to the frigate — a ship that involves minor modifications to an lcs design . the house report 114-537 for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for gao to examine the navy 's plans for the frigate . this report examines the navy 's plans for the frigate acquisition as well as remaining opportunities for oversight . to conduct this work , gao reviewed documentation and interviewed department of defense ( dod ) officials , and leveraged prior gao reports on shipbuilding and acquisition best practices . the navy 's current acquisition approach for its new frigate — a ship based on a littoral combat ship ( lcs ) design with minor modifications — requires congress to make significant program decisions and commitments in 2017 without key cost , design , and capability knowledge . in particular , the navy plans to request authority from congress in 2017 to pursue what the navy calls a block buy of 12 planned frigates and funding for the lead ship , which the navy intends to award in 2018. approval of these plans would effectively represent the final decision for the entire planned buy of 40 lcs and frigates . according to the navy 's approved acquisition strategy , the frigates would still require annual appropriations , so congress would maintain its oversight through its annual appropriation decisions ; however , any decision to reduce or delay the program , should that become warranted , could nevertheless be more difficult as the navy may point to losses in favorable block buy prices , as has been done previously with lcs . the navy 's impending request presents a key opportunity for congress to affect the way forward for the frigate program by ensuring the navy possesses sufficient knowledge on cost , design , and capability before authorizing an investment of a potential $ 9 billion for a program that • has no current formal cost estimate — independent or otherwise , • will not begin key detail design activities until late fiscal year 2018 , • has significant unknowns in regards to operational performance of the ship upon which its design will be based , and • based on the existing and planned shipyard workloads , has no industrial base imperative to begin construction in the navy 's planned time frame . the navy 's previous frigate acquisition plans included achieving a higher degree of ship design knowledge before awarding the lead ship in fiscal year 2019 , as the plans included significant detail design activities prior to contract award . as gao has previously found , such an approach — which has been supported by shipbuilders — offers greater confidence in the understanding of design changes and how they will affect ship construction costs . further , as gao 's work on best practices for program cost estimates suggests , the navy 's prior plans for frigate design efforts and an award in fiscal year 2019 would have provided more information on which to base a decision , including a better understanding of risks and costs . the previous plans also better aligned with lcs test plans to improve the department 's understanding of the operational capability and limitations for each ship variant . this knowledge could then be used to inform the navy 's decision on which lcs - based design for the frigate it will pursue . in addition to the valuable knowledge to be gained by not pursuing the frigate in the planned 2018 time frame , the existing and planned lcs construction workload for both shipyards is another important factor to consider . specifically , each shipyard has lcs construction demands that extend into 2021 , suggesting no imperative for the navy to award the frigate in 2018. delaying the frigate award until at least fiscal year 2019 — when more is known about cost , design , and capabilities — would enable better - informed decisions and oversight for this potential $ 9 billion taxpayer investment . congress should consider not enacting authority pursuant to the navy 's request for a block buy of 12 frigates in fiscal year 2018 and delaying funding of the lead frigate until at least fiscal year 2019 , when more information is available on the ship 's cost , design , and capabilities . gao also recommends that dod delay its procurement plans until sufficient knowledge is attained . dod partially concurred with the recommendation but is not planning to delay frigate procurement . gao continues to believe the recommendation is valid .
