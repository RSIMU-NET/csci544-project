on march 6 , 2009 , growth energy ( on behalf of 52 u.s. ethanol producers ) applied to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) for a waiver from the clean air act ( caa ) limitation on ethanol content in gasoline . ethanol content in gasoline for all uses had been capped at 10 % ( e10 ) ; the application requested an increase in the maximum concentration to 15 % ( e15 ) . a broad waiver would allow the use of more ethanol in gasoline than is currently permitted . on october 13 , 2010 , epa issued a partial waiver for the use of e15 in model year ( my ) 2007 and later passenger cars and light trucks . at the same time epa denied the waiver request for the use of e15 in my2000 and older vehicles , and in motorcycles , heavy trucks , and non - road applications , citing a lack of sufficient data to alleviate concerns about potential emissions increases from these engines . epa deferred a decision on my2001-my2006 cars and light trucks until january 2011 , when the agency expanded the waiver for those vehicles after analyzing final testing data from the department of energy ( doe ) . concerned about potential damage by e15 to equipment not designed for its use , a group of vehicle and engine manufacturers has challenged the partial waiver in court . of key concern before the waiver decision was made is the fact that a 10 % limitation on ethanol content leads to an upper bound of roughly 15 billion gallons of ethanol in all u.s. gasoline . this `` blend wall '' will likely limit the fuel industry 's ability to meet an energy independence and security act ( eisa , p.l . 110-140 ) requirement to use increasing amounts of renewable fuels ( including ethanol ) in transportation . to meet the high volumes mandated by eisa , epa recognized in a november 2009 letter to growth energy that `` it is clear that ethanol will need to be blended into gasoline at levels greater than the current limit of 10 percent . . the partial waiver for my2001 and later vehicles — roughly two - thirds of the cars and light trucks on the road in 2011 — will allow the use of more ethanol going forward , assuming other conditions are met . to receive a waiver , the petitioner must establish to epa that the increased ethanol content will not `` cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system '' to meet emissions standards . in addition to the emissions concerns , other factors affecting consideration of the blend wall include vehicle and engine warranties and the effects on infrastructure . currently , no automaker warrants its vehicles to use gasoline with higher than 10 % ethanol . small engine manufacturers similarly limit the allowable level of ethanol . in addition , most gasoline distribution systems ( e.g . , retail pumps and tanks ) are designed to dispense up to e10 . while some of these systems may be able to operate effectively on e15 or higher , their warranties / certifications would likely need to be modified . further , many current state laws prohibit the use of blends higher than e10 . questions have been raised whether fuel suppliers would be willing to sell e15 alongside or in lieu of e10 . as epa 's waiver only applies to newer vehicles , a key question is how fuel pumps might be labeled to keep owners from using e15 in older vehicles and other equipment . along with the waiver decision , epa proposed new rules , including pump labeling , to prevent misfueling of e15 in vehicles not approved for its use . epa finalized those rules in june 2011. epa also sought comment ( through december 17 , 2010 ) on how to update guidance for underground storage tank ( ust ) owners , who must demonstrate compatibility of ust components with e15 before they may sell the fuel . further , for epa to allow the sale of e15 , a fuel supplier would still need to register e15 with epa and submit health effects testing for epa to review — a process that had not been started as of late june 2011 .
