cras collect , maintain , and sell to third parties large amounts of sensitive data about consumers , including social security numbers and credit card numbers . businesses and other entities commonly use these data to determine eligibility for credit , employment , and insurance . in 2017 , equifax , one of the largest cras , experienced a breach that compromised the records of at least 145.5 million consumers . gao was asked to examine issues related to federal oversight of cras . among other things , this report discusses measures ftc has taken to enforce cra compliance with requirements to protect consumer information , measures cfpb has taken to ensure cra protection of consumer information , and actions consumers can take after a breach . gao reviewed relevant laws , documentation related to cra examinations , and policies and practices of selected cras ; and interviewed representatives of regulatory agencies , cras , consumer and industry groups , and attorneys general from four states with consumer reporting requirements . since 2008 , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) has settled 34 enforcement actions against various entities related to consumer reporting violations of the fair credit reporting act ( fcra ) , including 17 actions against consumer reporting agencies ( cra ) . some of these settlements included civil penalties — fines for wrongdoing that do not require proof of harm — for fcra violations or violations of consent orders . however , ftc does not have civil penalty authority for violations of requirements under the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) , which , unlike fcra , includes a provision directing federal regulators and ftc to establish standards for financial institutions to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of customer records . to obtain monetary redress for these violations , ftc must identify affected consumers and any monetary harm they may have experienced . however , harm resulting from privacy and security violations can be difficult to measure and can occur years in the future , making it difficult to trace a particular harm to a specific breach . as a result , ftc lacks a practical enforcement tool for imposing civil money penalties that could help to deter companies , including cras , from violating data security provisions of glba and its implementing regulations . since 2015 , the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) has had five public settlements with cras . four of these settlements included alleged violations of fcra ; and three included alleged violations of unfair , deceptive , or abusive practices provisions . cfpb is also responsible for supervising larger cras ( those with more than $ 7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting ) but lacks the data needed to ensure identification of all cras that meet this threshold . identifying additional sources of information on these cras , such as by requiring them to register with the agency through a rulemaking or leveraging state registration information , could help cfpb ensure that it can comprehensively carry out its supervisory responsibilities . according to cfpb staff , the bureau does not have authority to examine for or enforce the glba 's safeguards provisions . after the equifax breach , however , cfpb used its existing supervisory authority to examine the data security of certain cras . cfpb 's process for prioritizing which cras to examine does not routinely include an assessment of companies ' data security risks , but doing so could help cfpb better detect such risks and prevent the further exposure or compromise of consumer information . if a cra experiences a data breach , affected consumers can take actions to mitigate the risk of identity theft — such as implementing a fraud alert or credit freeze — and can file a complaint with ftc or cfpb . however , consumers are limited in the direct actions they can take against the cra . consumers generally can not exercise choice in the consumer reporting market — such as by choosing which cras maintain their information — if they are dissatisfied with a cra 's privacy or security practices . in addition , according to cfpb , consumers can not remove themselves from the consumer reporting market entirely because they do not have a legal right to delete their records with cras . this limited control by consumers , coupled with the large amount and sensitive nature of the information cras possess , underscores the importance of appropriate federal oversight of cras ' data security . gao recommends that congress consider giving ftc civil penalty authority to enforce glba 's safeguarding provisions . gao also recommends that cfpb identify additional sources of information on larger cras , and reassess its prioritization of examinations to address cra data security . cfpb neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendations .
