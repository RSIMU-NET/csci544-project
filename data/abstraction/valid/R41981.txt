the principles of disaster management assume a leadership role by the local , state , and tribal governments affected by the incident . the federal government provides coordinated supplemental resources and assistance , only if requested and approved . the immediate response to a disaster is guided by the national response framework ( nrf ) , which details roles and responsibilities at various levels of government , along with cooperation from the private and nonprofit sectors , for differing incidents and support functions . a possible declaration of a major disaster or emergency under the authority of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act ( the stafford act , p.l . 93-288 , as amended ) must , in almost all cases , be requested by the governor of a state or the chief executive of an affected indian tribal government , who at that point has declared that the situation is beyond the capacity of the state or tribe to respond . the governor / chief also determines for which parts of the state / tribal territory assistance will be requested , and suggests the types of assistance programs that may be needed . the president considers the request , in consultation with officials of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and makes the initial decisions on the areas to be included as well as the programs that are implemented . the majority of federal financial disaster assistance is made available from fema under the authority of the stafford act . in addition to that assistance , other disaster aid may be available through programs of the small business administration , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , the u.s. army corps of engineers , the department of transportation ( dot ) , and the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , among other federal programs . while the disaster response and recovery process is fundamentally a relationship between the federal government and the requesting state or tribal government , there are roles for congressional offices . for instance , congressional offices may help provide information to survivors on available federal and nonfederal assistance , oversee the coordination of federal efforts in their respective states and districts , and consider legislation to provide supplemental disaster assistance or authorities . congressional offices also serve as a valuable source of accurate and timely information to their constituents on response and relief efforts .
