pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed small business employers ' participation in federal training programs , focusing on : the extent of their participation ; barriers that limit their participation ; and options for overcoming those barriers . gao found that : small businesses are less likely to use training programs than larger employers because of the prohibitive costs associated with training programs , the time needed to comply with administrative requirements , the reduced productivity of workers during training , and high attrition rates associated with newly trained employees ; training programs ' institutional requirements may discourage or disqualify small employers from participation ; small employers ' limited knowledge of the training programs and their needs may further prevent their participation ; while a reduction of institutional barriers may require fundamental changes to training programs , alliances among small employers have helped to reduce economic and informational barriers to their participation ; and technical assistance from training programs helped reduce economic barriers to participation for small employers that did not want to become involved with alliances or had no access to alliances .
