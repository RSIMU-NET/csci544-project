burma is to hold its first parliamentary elections in 20 years on november 7 , 2010. the polls raise questions about u.s. policy towards the burmese regime , coming in the context of two decades of largely isolationist u.s. policy towards burma . some argue that these elections , even if far from free and fair , offer a limited opportunity for political change , even if evolutionary . others believe that the ruling junta 's restrictions on electoral activity thus far demonstrate that it has little interest in democracy or in loosening its repressive policies . these considerations weigh deeply in policy debates over sanctions and engagement with the regime — debates in which congress has had a strong voice over the past two decades . in 1990 , the last time nationwide parliamentary elections were held in burma , the national league for democracy ( nld ) , led by prominent opposition leader aung san suu kyi , won a stunning and unexpected victory . the junta 's subsequent refusal to seat the newly elected parliament and its arrest of aung san suu kyi were widely condemned internationally , and led to the imposition of numerous u.s. and international sanctions against the regime . this time , the circumstances surrounding the elections have been controversial from the start . the obama administration has repeatedly stated that it does not foresee the elections being free and fair , and the outcome will not be a genuine reflection of the will of the people of burma . some members of congress have also expressed skepticism that burma 's impending elections will be a true expression of democracy . most observers feel that by various means and methods , the ruling military junta , the state peace and development council ( spdc ) and the union election commission ( uec ) are conspiring to ensure that the pro - junta political parties will win most of the 1,163 seats at stake . preliminary information on the number of proposed candidates submitted by each of the political parties indicate that it would take a virtual election sweep by their candidates for the opposition parties to win a majority . the opposition parties are particularly weak in many of the state and regional parliamentary elections ; an exception is in states where ethnic minorities are a large percentage of the population . thus , it is more likely that the pro - junta parties will win a majority of the seats on november 7. the uec has approved 37 parties to participate in the elections , but on september 14 it announced that several political parties — including aung san suu kyi 's nld — were officially dissolved . the formal campaign period for the parliamentary elections began on september 24 , 2010. there have been accusations of irregularities in the campaign process , including decisions by the uec to reject the broadcasting of some party statements , undue restrictions on campaign rallies , and intimidation of opposition party members . the spdc has also arrested buddhist monks and students advocating boycotting the elections . the obama administration reportedly is considering the imposition of additional sanctions on burma , in part because of the manner in which the spdc is conducting the election . the administration is also backing calls for the creation of a u.n. commission of inquiry into crimes against humanity and war crimes in burma . ten other nations have also backed the creation of the u.n. commission . under current federal law , president obama has the authority to impose certain types of financial sanctions without seeking approval from congress . however , he must inform congress if and when he imposes new sanctions .
