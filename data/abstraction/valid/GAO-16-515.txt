every year , more than 600,000 people are reported missing , and hundreds of human remains go unidentified . two primary federal databases supported by doj — ncic and namus — contain data related to missing and unidentified persons to help solve these cases . ncic contains criminal justice information accessed by authorized agencies to assist with daily investigations . namus information can be used by law enforcement , medical examiners , coroners , and the general public to help with long - term missing and unidentified persons cases . senate report 113-181 ( accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 ) includes a provision for gao to review ncic and namus . this report describes the access to and use of missing and unidentified persons information contained in ncic and namus , and the extent to which there are opportunities to improve the use of this information . gao reviewed ncic and namus data , and relevant state and federal statutes . gao also conducted nongeneralizeable interviews with stakeholders in three states , selected in part on state laws . the federal bureau of investigation 's ( fbi ) national crime information center ( ncic ) database includes criminal justice agency information and access to such data is restricted to authorized users . in contrast , the department of justice 's ( doj ) national institute of justice ( nij ) funds and oversees the national missing and unidentified persons system ( namus ) , a database for which the public may register to access published case information . because many users of namus are not authorized to access ncic , there are no direct links between the systems . as a result , while both ncic and namus contain information on long - term missing and unidentified persons , they remain separate systems . doj could facilitate more efficient sharing of information on missing persons and unidentified remains ( referred to as missing and unidentified persons cases ) contained in these systems . gao found , in part , that the following three key characteristics of ncic and namus are fragmented or overlapping , creating the risk of duplication . database records : ncic and namus contain fragmented information associated with long - term missing and unidentified persons ( cases open for more than 30 days ) . for example , in fiscal year 2015 , 3,170 long - term missing persons cases were reported to namus while 84,401 missing persons records reported to ncic became long - term cases . namus also accepts and maintains records of missing and unidentified persons cases that may not be found in ncic because , for example , they have not yet been filed with law enforcement . as a result , users relying on only one system may miss information that could be instrumental in solving these types of cases . registered users : the ncic user base is significantly larger than the namus user base , and the types of users vary , which may contribute to the discrepancies in each system 's data . for instance , almost all law enforcement agencies use ncic , with only a small fraction registered to use namus . additionally , members of the public do not have access to ncic , but can report missing persons cases to namus . data validation efforts : in part to minimize fragmentation , namus uses a case validation process and other ad hoc efforts to help ensure that data on missing and unidentified persons contained in ncic is captured by namus . however , these processes introduce additional inefficiencies because they require officials to manually review and enter case data into both systems , resulting in duplicative data entry . inefficiencies exist in the use of information on missing and unidentified persons primarily because there is no mechanism to share information between the systems , such as a notifier to inform ncic users if related case data were present in namus . according to fbi officials , federal law precludes full integration of ncic and namus ; however , opportunities to share information may exist within the legal framework to address fragmentation and overlap without full system integration . by evaluating the technical and legal feasibility of options to share information , documenting the results , and implementing feasible options , doj could better inform those who are helping solve missing and unidentified persons cases and increase the efficiency of solving such cases . to allow for more efficient use of missing and unidentified persons information , gao recommends that doj evaluate options to share information between ncic and namus . doj disagreed because it believes it lacks the necessary legal authority . gao believes doj can study options for sharing information within the confines of its legal framework , and therefore believes the recommendation remains valid .
