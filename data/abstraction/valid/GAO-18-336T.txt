misuse of prescription opioids can lead to overdose and death . in 2016 , over 14 million medicare part d beneficiaries received opioid prescriptions , and spending for opioids was almost $ 4.1 billion . gao and others have reported on inappropriate activities and risks associated with these prescriptions . this statement is based on gao 's october 2017 report ( gao - 18-15 ) and discusses cms oversight of beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions under part d , and cms oversight of providers who prescribe opioids to medicare part d beneficiaries . for the october 2017 report , gao reviewed cms opioid utilization and prescriber data , cms guidance for plan sponsors , and cms 's strategy to prevent opioid misuse . gao also interviewed cms officials , the six largest part d plan sponsors , and 12 national associations selected to represent insurance plans , pharmacy benefit managers , physicians , patients , and regulatory and law enforcement authorities . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides guidance on the monitoring of medicare beneficiaries who receive opioid prescriptions to plan sponsors — private organizations that implement the medicare drug benefit , part d — but lacks information on most beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioid use . cms provides guidance to plan sponsors on how they should monitor opioid overutilization among medicare part d beneficiaries , and requires them to implement drug utilization review systems that use criteria similar to cms 's . cms 's criteria focused on beneficiaries who do all the following : receive prescriptions of high doses of opioids , receive prescriptions from four or more providers , and fill prescriptions at four or more pharmacies . according to cms , this approach focused actions on beneficiaries the agency determined to have the highest risk of harm . cms 's criteria , including recent revisions , do not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at - risk beneficiaries . cms estimates that while 33,223 beneficiaries would have met the revised criteria in 2015 , 727,016 would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies . in 2016 , cms began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use . this approach misses some who could be at risk of harm , based on centers for disease control and prevention guidelines . as a result , cms is limited in its ability to assess progress toward meeting the broader goals of its opioid misuse strategy for the medicare and medicaid programs , which includes activities to reduce the risk of harm to beneficiaries from opioid use . cms oversees the prescribing of drugs at high risk of abuse through a variety of projects , but does not analyze data specifically on opioids . according to cms officials , cms and plan sponsors identify providers who prescribe large amounts of drugs with a high risk of abuse , and those suspected of fraud or abuse may be referred to law enforcement . however , gao found that cms does not identify providers who may be inappropriately prescribing large amounts of opioids separately from other drugs , and does not require plan sponsors to report actions they take when they identify such providers . as a result , cms is lacking information that it could use to assess how opioid prescribing patterns are changing over time , and whether its efforts to reduce harm are effective . in the october 2017 report , gao made three recommendations that cms gather information on the full number of at - risk beneficiaries receiving high doses of opioids , identify providers who prescribe high amounts of opioids , and require plan sponsors to report to cms on actions related to providers who inappropriately prescribe opioids . hhs concurred with the first two recommendations , but not with the third . gao continues to believe the recommendation is valid , as discussed in the report and in this statement .
