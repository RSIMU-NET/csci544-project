many of our nation 's military and civilian personnel depend on department of defense ( dod ) schools to meet their children 's educational needs . these schools provide a range of educational services including programs for students with disabilities and those who struggle to read , some of whom may have a condition referred to as dyslexia . to determine how dod supports students with dyslexia and how it used $ 3.2 million in funds designated to support them , gao was asked to examine : what professional development dod provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal year 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for this purpose were used , what identification and instructional services dod provides to students who may have dyslexia , and how dod assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including dyslexia . to address these objectives , gao conducted a survey of all school principals and interviewed agency officials , school personnel , and parents in six school districts . dod provides a mix of online and classroom training to teachers who work with students who struggle to read , and dod used 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for professional development on dyslexia , in particular , to supplement these efforts . most of the online and classroom professional development prepares teachers and specialists to assess student literacy and provides them with strategies to teach students who have particular difficulties . for the 2004-to - 2006 funding for professional development on dyslexia , dod supplemented its existing training with online courses that include specific modules on dyslexia and tools to assess students ' literacy skills . dod identifies students who struggle to read -- some of who may have dyslexia -- through standardized tests and provides them with supplemental reading instruction . dod uses standardized tests to screen its students and identify those who need additional reading instruction , but these schools do not generally label them as dyslexic . to teach students they identify as struggling readers , dod schools primarily employ an intensive multimedia reading program that is highly regarded by the principals , teachers , and parents gao interviewed . those students whose performance does not improve through their enrollment in supplemental reading programs or who have profound reading difficulties may be eligible to receive special education services . dod is subject to many of the requirements of the individuals with disabilities education improvement act of 2004 on the education of students with disabilities . students with dyslexia may qualify for these services , but they must meet program eligibility requirements . dod uses the same standardized tests it uses for all students to assess the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including those who may have dyslexia , but does not report specifically on the outcomes for students with disabilities . a primary goal of dod 's strategic plan is for all students to meet or exceed challenging academic standards . to measure progress towards this goal , dod assesses all students ' academic achievement and school performance by comparing test scores to a national norm or to a national proficiency level . overall , students perform well in reading compared to u.s. public school students . dod disaggregates test scores for students with disabilities but does not report such information publicly . in contrast , u.s. public school systems under the no child left behind act of 2001 must report such data . without this information , it is difficult for parents , policy makers , and others to measure the academic achievement of students with disabilities relative to all other students in the dod school system .
