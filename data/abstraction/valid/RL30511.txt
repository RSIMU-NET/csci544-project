the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews the u.s. foreign aid budget and influences executive branch foreign policymaking generally . it contains the largest share -- over two - thirds -- of total u.s. internationalaffairs spending . president clinton asked congress initially to appropriate $ 15.1 billion for fy2001 foreign operations , plus $ 1.25 billion in fy2000 supplemental funds . congress approved some of thesupplemental spending in p.l . 106-246 , but in october 2000 reconsidered and approved as fy2001emergency appropriations portions of the fy2000 supplemental rejected earlier . consequently , thecombined fy2000 supplemental / fy2001 regular foreign operations request , as it stood whencongress debated the fy2001 foreign operations conference report in october , totaled $ 15.45billion . the largest program increases for fy2001 were those for the export - import bank ( +26 % ) , usaid development aid ( +18 % ) , nonproliferation , terrorism , and demining ( +44 % ) , voluntarycontributions to international organizations ( +45 % ) , and multilateral development bank contributions ( +24 % ) . s. 2522 , as approved by the senate on june 22 , provided $ 13.4 billion for fy2001 foreign operations appropriations . the measure was about $ 65 million less than fy2000 enactedand about $ 1.7 billion , or 11 % , below the president 's initial fy2001 request . a major new initiativein s. 2522 was the creation of a global health account ( $ 691 million ) . population aidwould have increased by $ 110 million and a new set of conditions on family planning programswould have effectively eliminated the fy2000 abortion - related restrictions . h.r . 4811 , as approved by the house on july 13 , provided $ 13.3 billion , about $ 200 million less than the fy2000 enacted , and 13 % less than the president 's original request . thebill maintained the fy2000 funding level and abortion - related restrictions for family planningprograms . at $ 238 million , the bill provided most of the administration 's fy2001 request for debtrelief , but still fell well short of the combined fy2000 / 2001 debt reduction request of $ 472 million . on october 25 , congress approved the conference report on h.r . 4811 ( h.rept . 106-997 ) , increasing fy2001 foreign operations spending to $ 14.9 billion , well above levels passedearlier by either the house or senate . the enacted legislation ( p.l . 106-429 ) falls about $ 550million , or 3.5 % below the president 's combined fy2000 supplemental / fy2001 requests , but fullyfunds several top administration priorities , including international debt relief and global healthprograms . for international family planning , congress increased spending to $ 425 million , butrestricted the obligation of funds until after february 15 , 2001. prior to the release of these funds , president bush reimposed the so - called `` mexico city '' abortion restrictions that apply to fy2001and future u.s. family planning appropriation .
