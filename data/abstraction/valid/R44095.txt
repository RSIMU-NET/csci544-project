the government of puerto rico faces severe fiscal challenges . a federal district court judge in late march 2016 held that the island 's government was insolvent and unable to pay its obligations on time . emergency legislation ( act 21 of 2016 ) enacted on april 6 , 2016 , stated that the puerto rican government 's fiscal condition `` is more dire than at any other point in its history '' and that `` depleted resources and strained liquidity threaten to bind the commonwealth to a choice between honoring its commitments to bondholders or continuing to provide the residents of puerto rico with essential services . . on april 8 , 2016 , the puerto rican governor invoked emergency authorities to maintain essential public services . the puerto rican government has been facing serious liquidity challenges and has lost normal access to credit markets despite measures taken by the island 's government to reduce spending , increase revenues , and restructure its obligations . much of the island 's liquidity challenges stem from substantial debt service costs facing the central government and its public corporations . in august 2015 , debt service on public finance corporation bonds was not paid in full . the puerto rico infrastructure financing authority ( prifa ) did pay interest in full on certain bonds due on january 1 , 2016. on may 1 , 2016 , governor alejandro garcía padilla declared a moratorium on certain debt payments by the government development bank ( gdb ) , the government 's fiscal agent , due on that date . the commonwealth government doubts that it can make a larger debt service payment on july 1 , 2016. on june 29 , 2015 , governor garcía padilla stated during a televised address that `` the debt is not payable . . on the same day , a report commissioned from three former international monetary fund economists was released , which described severe short - term funding challenges as well as long - standing issues with key parts of the puerto rican economy and public sector . on september 9 , 2015 , a working group appointed by the governor released a plan that outlined its strategy . puerto rico 's financing gap over the coming five years , according to the plan , is nearly $ 28 billion . the plan 's proposals , along with hoped - for improvement in economic growth , were said to halve that gap . the precarious state of puerto rico 's public finances stems in part from prolonged economic weakness . economic growth was sluggish even before the 2007-2009 recession , and projections suggest that the economy is contracting . past analyses noted low employment and labor participation rates , high rates of outmigration leading to a decline in population , an economic structure shaped more by tax advantages than comparative advantages , and intensified global competition , among other factors . others point to weaknesses in fiscal and operational controls . in october 2015 , the u.s. department of the treasury set out a reform framework and called on congress to pass legislation to aid puerto rico . resident commissioner pierluisi introduced h.r . 870 on march 16 , 2015 ; the bill would restore the island 's access to chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code . senator blumenthal introduced a similar measure ( s. 1774 ) on july 15 , 2015. on december 9 , 2015 , representative sean duffy introduced h.r . 4199 , a measure to provide fiscal oversight and a debt restructuring process . senator hatch introduced a similar measure ( s. 2381 ) on the same day . on december 18 , 2015 , representative pelosi introduced h.r . 4290 and senator warren introduced s. 2436 , both measures to stay debt - related litigation . on march 14 , 2016 , senator menendez introduced two bills ( s. 2675 , s. 2676 ) that would allow adjustments of puerto rico 's debt . the house natural resources committee issued a discussion draft on march 29 , 2016. representative duffy introduced the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act ( h.r . 4900 ) on april 12 , 2016 , and a revised version ( h.r . 5278 ) on may 18 , 2016 , which would set up an oversight board for puerto rico and create a process to restructure the island 's debts , among other provisions .
