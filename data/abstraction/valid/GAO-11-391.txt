department of veterans affairs ( va ) clinicians use expendable medical supplies -- disposable items that are generally used one time -- and reusable medical equipment ( rme ) , which is designed to be reused for multiple patients . va has policies that va medical centers ( vamc ) must follow when purchasing such supplies and equipment , tracking these items at vamcs , and reprocessing -- that is , cleaning , disinfecting , and sterilizing -- rme . gao was asked to evaluate purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements in va policies and va 's oversight of vamcs ' compliance with these requirements . gao reviewed va policies and selected two purchasing requirements , two tracking requirements , and two reprocessing requirements . at the six vamcs gao visited , gao interviewed officials and reviewed documents to examine the adequacy of the selected requirements to help ensure veterans ' safety . gao also interviewed officials from va headquarters and from six veterans integrated service networks ( visn ) , which oversee vamcs , and obtained and reviewed documents regarding va 's oversight . gao found that the va tracking and reprocessing requirements selected for review are inadequate to help ensure the safety of veterans who receive care at vamcs . gao did not identify inadequacies in selected va purchasing requirements that may create potential risks to veterans ' safety . gao found the following : tracking requirements . because va does not require vamcs to enter information about certain expendable medical supplies and rme in their facilities into va 's inventory management systems , vamcs may have incomplete inventories of these items . this , in turn , creates potential risks to veterans ' safety . for example , in the event of a manufacturer recall involving these items , vamcs may be unable to readily determine whether the items are in their facilities and should be removed and not used when providing care to veterans . reprocessing requirements . although va requires vamcs to develop device - specific training for staff on how to correctly reprocess rme , va has not specified the types of rme for which this training is required . va has also provided conflicting guidance to vamcs on how to develop this training . this lack of clarity may have contributed to delays in developing the required training . without appropriate training on reprocessing , vamc staff may not be reprocessing rme correctly , which poses potential risks to the safety of veterans . va headquarters officials told gao that va has plans to develop training for certain rme , but va lacks a timeline for developing this training . gao also found weaknesses in va 's oversight of vamcs ' compliance with the selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements . these weaknesses render va unable to systematically identify and address noncompliance with the requirements , which poses potential risks to the safety of veterans . gao did not identify weaknesses in va 's oversight of vamcs ' compliance with the selected tracking requirements . gao found the following : oversight over purchasing requirements . in general , va does not oversee vamcs ' compliance with the selected purchasing requirements . while va intends to improve oversight over these requirements , it has not yet developed a plan for doing so . oversight over reprocessing requirements . although va headquarters receives information from the visns on any noncompliance they identify as well as vamcs ' corrective action plans to address this noncompliance , va headquarters does not analyze this information to inform its oversight . according to va headquarters officials , va intends to develop a plan for analyzing this information to systematically identify areas of noncompliance that occur frequently , pose high risks to veterans ' safety , or have not been addressed across all vamcs . gao is making several recommendations for va to address the inadequacies identified in selected tracking and reprocessing requirements and the weaknesses in its oversight over selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements . va concurred with these recommendations .
