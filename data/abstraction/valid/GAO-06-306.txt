the trilogy project -- initiated in 2001- - is the federal bureau of investigation 's ( fbi ) largest information technology ( it ) upgrade to date . while ultimately successful in providing updated it infrastructure and systems , trilogy was not a success with regard to upgrading fbi 's investigative applications . further , the project was plagued with missed milestones and escalating costs , which eventually totaled nearly $ 537 million . in light of these events , congress asked gao to determine whether internal controls provided reasonable assurance that improper payment of unallowable contractor costs would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business , payments to contractors were properly supported as a valid use of government funds , and fbi maintained proper accountability for assets purchased with trilogy project funds . fbi 's review and approval process for trilogy contractor invoices , which included a review role for the general services administration ( gsa ) as contracting agency , did not provide an adequate basis to verify that goods and services billed were actually received and that the amounts billed were appropriate , leaving fbi highly vulnerable to payments of unallowable costs . this vulnerability is demonstrated by fbi 's payment of about $ 10.1 million in questionable contractor costs we identified using data mining , document analysis , and other forensic auditing techniques . these costs included first - class travel and other excessive airfare costs , incorrect charges for overtime hours , potentially overcharged labor rates , and charges for which the contractors could not provide adequate supporting documentation to substantiate the costs purportedly incurred . fbi also failed to establish controls to maintain accountability over equipment purchased for the trilogy project . these control lapses resulted in more than 1,200 missing pieces of equipment valued at approximately $ 7.6 million that gao identified as part of its review . in addition , in its own inventory counts , fbi identified 37 pieces of trilogy equipment valued at approximately $ 167,000 that had been lost or stolen .
