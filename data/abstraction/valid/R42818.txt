u.s. wind power generation has experienced rapid growth in the last 20 years as total installed capacity has increased from 1,500 megawatts ( mw ) in 1992 to more than 50,000 mw in august of 2012. according to the energy information administration ( eia ) , wind power provided approximately 3 % of total u.s. electricity generation in 2011. two primary policies provide market and financial incentives that support the wind industry and have contributed to u.s. wind power growth : ( 1 ) production tax credit ( ptc ) — a federal tax incentive of 2.2 cents for each kilowatt - hour ( kwh ) of electricity produced by a qualified wind project ( set to expire for new projects at the end of 2012 ) , and ( 2 ) renewable portfolio standards ( rps ) — state - level policies that encourage renewable power by requiring that either a certain percentage of electricity be generated by renewable energy sources or a certain amount of qualified renewable electricity capacity be installed . the concentration of wind power projects within competitive power markets managed by regional transmission operators ( rtos ) , the focus of this report , has resulted in several concerns expressed by power generators and other market participants . three specific concerns explored in this report include : ( 1 ) how might wind power affect wholesale market clearing prices ? . ( 2 ) does wind power contribute to negative wholesale power price events ? . and ( 3 ) does wind power impact electric system reliability ? . these concerns might be considered during congressional debate about the future of wind ptc incentives . when considering the potential impacts of wind power on electric power markets , it is important to recognize that wholesale power markets are both complex and multi - dimensional . wholesale power markets are influenced by a number of factors , including weather , electricity demand , natural gas prices , transmission constraints , and location . therefore , determining the direct impact of a single variable , in this case wind power , on the financial economics of power generators can be difficult . in 2012 , wholesale electric power prices were down from recent highs in 2008 , and lower price trends can result in financial pressure for power generators in rto markets . arguably , however , the two primary contributors to this decline are low natural gas prices and low electricity demand . wind power generation can potentially reduce wholesale electricity prices , in certain locations and during certain seasons and times of day , since wind typically bids a zero ( $ 0.00 ) price into wholesale power markets . additionally , independent market monitor reports for three different rtos each indicate that wind generators will sometimes bid a negative wholesale price in order to ensure electricity dispatch . the ability of wind generators to bid negatively priced power is generally attributed to value associated with ptc incentives and the ability to sell renewable energy credits ( rec ) . however , wholesale power price reductions and negative electricity prices associated with wind generation need to be considered in context with other dimensions of organized power markets . for example , other revenue sources ( i.e . , capacity markets ) may be available to generators in certain rto market areas . also , generators oftentimes enter into bilateral power purchase agreements that can provide a hedge against power price volatility . therefore , the absolute impact of wind electricity on the economics of power generators is difficult to determine due to the many variables and dimensions that influence wholesale power markets . with regard to how wind power might impact electricity system reliability , two aspects of reliability are typically discussed : ( 1 ) impacts to system operations — the ability of the power system to manage the variable and sometimes unpredictable nature of wind power production , and ( 2 ) resource adequacy and capacity margins — the potential for wind power generation to either influence power plant retirements or contribute to market conditions that do not support investment in new capacity resources . rtos are currently implementing various initiatives ( i.e . , dispatchable resource programs , renewable energy transmission projects ) to address the variable generation characteristics of wind power . furthermore , each rto market is designed to provide the economic signals necessary to stimulate capacity additions in order to ensure resource adequacy and maintain capacity margins . however , should wind power generation continue to grow , it is uncertain if current rto market designs will provide the signals needed to encourage specific types of generation capacity ( e.g . , operating and spinning reserves ) necessary to manage the variable nature of wind power .
