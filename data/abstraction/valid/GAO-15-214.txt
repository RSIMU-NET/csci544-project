research shows that spending on health care varies by geographic area and that higher spending in an area is not always associated with better quality of care . while a substantial body of research exists on geographic variation in spending in medicare , less research has been done on variation in private sector health care spending , although this spending accounts for about a third of overall health care spending . as u.s. health expenditures continue to rise , policymakers and others have expressed interest in better understanding spending variation and how health care systems can operate efficiently — that is , providing equivalent or higher quality care while maintaining or lowering current spending levels . gao was asked to examine geographic variation in private sector health care spending . gao examined how spending per episode of care for certain high - cost procedures varies across geographic areas for private payers , and how the mix of service types , and the volume , intensity , and price of services contribute to variation in episode spending across geographic areas for private payers . using a large private sector claims database for 2009 and 2010 , gao examined spending by msa for episodes of care for three commonly performed inpatient procedures and examined spending by hospital inpatient , hospital outpatient , postdischarge , professional , and ancillary service categories . for inpatient and professional services , gao examined the volume , intensity , and price of services . gao 's findings may not be generalizable to all private insurers due to data limitations . spending for an episode of care in the private sector varied across metropolitan statistical areas ( msa ) for coronary stent placement , laparoscopic appendectomy , and total hip replacement , even after gao adjusted for geographic differences in the cost of doing business and differences in enrollee demographics and health status . msas in the highest - spending quintile had average adjusted episode spending that was 74 to 94 percent higher than msas in the lowest - spending quintile , depending on the procedure . msas with higher spending on one procedure generally had higher spending on the other two procedures . high - or low - spending msas were not concentrated in particular regions of the nation . the price of the initial hospital inpatient admission accounted for 91 percent or more of the difference in episode spending between msas in the lowest - and highest - spending quintiles . the price of the initial admission was the largest contributor to the difference for two reasons . first , it represented the largest percentage of adjusted episode spending . for example , for total hip replacement , the average price of the initial admission was $ 17,134 , representing 76 percent of the $ 22,463 in total episode spending for msas in the lowest - spending quintile and $ 30,332 , representing 82 percent of the $ 36,969 in total episode spending for msas in the highest - spending quintile . second , the price of the initial admission varied considerably across msas . for msas in the highest - spending quintile , the average price of the initial admission for total hip replacement was 77 percent higher than for msas in the lowest - spending quintile . professional services — office visits and other services provided by a physician or other health professional — were the second largest contributor to geographic differences in episode spending , but accounted for 7 percent or less of the difference in episode spending between msas in the lowest - and highest - spending quintiles . ( see table . ) . msas in the highest - spending quintile had higher average prices and intensity ( a measure of the resources needed to provide a service ) but fewer services ( volume ) than msas in the lowest - spending quintile for all three procedures . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which were incorporated as appropriate .
