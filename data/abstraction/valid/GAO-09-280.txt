the united states has invested more than $ 6.2 billion in the afghan ministry of interior ( moi ) and afghan national police ( anp ) . the department of defense 's ( defense ) combined security transition command - afghanistan ( cstc - a ) , with the department of state ( state ) , leads u.s. efforts to enhance moi and anp organizational structures , leadership abilities , and pay systems . this report assesses the status of u.s. efforts to help afghanistan restructure moi and anp , retrain anp units , screen moi and anp personnel , and enhance moi and anp pay systems . gao reviewed defense , state , and united nations ( un ) data and met with officials in the united states and afghanistan . u.s. agencies and afghanistan have achieved their goals of restructuring and reducing a top - heavy and oversized moi and anp officer corps , modifying police wages , and planning a reorganization of moi headquarters . these efforts are intended to help ensure that the moi and anp are directed by professional staff that can manage a national police force . u.s. agencies and moi cut the officer corps from about 17,800 to about 9,000 , reduced the percentage of high - ranking officers , and increased pay for all ranks . moi is scheduled to implement a u.s. - supported headquarters reorganization . cstc - a has begun retraining anp units through its focused district development ( fdd ) program , which is intended to address district - level corruption that impeded previous efforts to retrain individual police . fdd is achieving promising results , according to defense status reports . in february 2009 , defense assessed 19 percent of fdd - retrained units as capable of conducting missions , 25 percent as capable of doing so with outside support , 31 percent as capable of partially doing so with outside support , and 25 percent as not capable . however , a lack of military personnel is constraining cstc - a 's plans to expand fdd and similar programs into the rest of afghanistan by the end of 2010. defense has identified a shortage of about 1,500 military personnel needed to expand fdd and similar police development programs . cstc - a has previously obtained military personnel for anp training by redirecting personnel from its afghan army training program . however , the army program 's demand for personnel is likely to increase as the afghan army grows from 80,000 to 134,000 personnel . moi and anp officers were screened by defense and state , but the full extent of the screening is unclear because state did not systematically compile records of its efforts . the screening effort was intended to improve the professionalism and integrity of the officer corps through testing by cstc - a and background checks by state . at least 9,797 ( 55 percent ) of the nearly 17,800 officers who took the tests passed , according to cstc - a . state was unable to provide us with statistics concerning the results of background checks because it did not systematically compile its records . u.s. - supported pay system efforts are intended to validate moi and anp personnel rosters and ensure that wages are distributed reliably . despite progress , these efforts face challenges that include limited anp cooperation and a shortage of banks . u.s. contractors have validated almost 47,400 moi and anp personnel but have been unable to validate almost 29,400 personnel -- who were paid in part by $ 230 million in u.s. contributions to a un trust fund -- because of a lack of cooperation from some anp commanders . as of january 2009 , 97 percent of all reported moi and anp personnel had enrolled in an electronic payroll system and 58 percent had enrolled to have their salaries deposited directly into their bank accounts . however , growth of the direct deposit system may be constrained because almost 40 percent of anp personnel lack ready access to banks .
