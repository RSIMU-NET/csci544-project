the 2017 hurricanes ( harvey , irma , and maria ) caused an estimated $ 265 billion in damage , primarily in texas , florida , puerto rico , and the u.s. virgin islands . as of february 2019 , congress had provided over $ 35 billion to hud for cdbg - dr grants to help communities recover . communities may use these funds to address unmet needs for housing , infrastructure , and economic revitalization . gao was asked to evaluate the federal government 's response to the 2017 hurricanes . in this initial review of cdbg - dr , gao examined , among other things , the status of the 2017 grants , hud 's review of the initial steps grantees have taken and its plans for future monitoring , and challenges hud and grantees face in administering grants . gao reviewed documentation from the four largest 2017 cdbg - dr grantees and hud . gao also reviewed prior work on cdbg - dr and interviewed officials from hud and the four grantees . as of september 2018 , the four states and territories that received the most 2017 community development block grant disaster recovery ( cdbg - dr ) funds had signed grant agreements with the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) . before signing the agreements , hud certified the grantees ' financial processes and procedures . it also approved the grantees ' assessments of their capacity to carry out the recovery and of unmet needs ( losses not met with insurance or other forms of assistance ) . before funding begins to reach disaster victims , the grantees need to take additional steps , such as finalizing plans for individual activities . as of january 2019 , texas had drawn down about $ 18 million ( of $ 5 billion ) for administration and planning only , and florida had drawn down about $ 1 million ( of $ 616 million ) for administration , planning , and housing activities . puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands had not drawn down any of the $ 1.5 billion and $ 243 million , respectively , they had been allocated . hud lacks adequate guidance for staff reviewing the quality of grantees ' financial processes and procedures and assessments of capacity and unmet needs , and has not completed monitoring or workforce plans . the checklists used to review grantees ' financial processes and procedures and assessments ask the reviewer to determine if the grantee included certain information , such as its procurement processes , but not to evaluate the adequacy of that information . in addition , the checklists , which include a series of “ yes ” or “ no ” questions , do not include guidance that the hud reviewer must consider . hud also does not have a monitoring plan that identifies the risk factors for each grantee and outlines the scope of monitoring . further , hud has not developed a workforce plan that identifies the critical skills and competencies hud needs and includes strategies to address any staffing gaps . adequate review guidance , a monitoring plan , and strategic workforce planning would improve hud 's ability to oversee cdbg - dr grants . without permanent statutory authority and regulations such as those that govern other disaster assistance programs , cdbg - dr appropriations require hud to customize grant requirements for each disaster in federal register notices — a time - consuming process that has delayed the disbursement of funds . in a july 2018 report , the hud office of inspector general found that as of september 2017 , hud used 61 notices to oversee 112 active cdbg - dr grants . officials from one of the 2017 grantees told us that it was challenging to manage the multiple cdbg - dr grants it has received over the years because of the different rules . cdbg - dr grantees have faced additional challenges such as the need to coordinate the use of cdbg - dr funds with other disaster recovery programs that are initiated at different times and administered by other agencies . hud officials said that permanently authorizing cdbg - dr would allow hud to issue permanent regulations for disaster recovery . permanent statutory authority could help address the challenges grantees face in meeting customized grant requirements for each disaster , such as funding lags , varying requirements , and coordination with multiple programs . the expected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events underscores the need for a permanent program to address unmet disaster needs . congress should consider permanently authorizing a disaster assistance program that meets unmet needs in a timely manner . gao also makes five recommendations to hud , which include developing guidance for hud staff to use in assessing grantees , developing a monitoring plan , and conducting workforce planning . hud generally agreed with three recommendations and partially agreed with two , which gao clarified to address hud 's comments .
