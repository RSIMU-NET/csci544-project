the dodd - frank act requires or authorizes various federal agencies to issue hundreds of rules to implement reforms intended to strengthen the financial services industry . gao is required to annually study financial services regulations . this report examines the regulatory analyses federal agencies performed for rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; how the agencies consulted with each other in implementing the final rules to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and what is known about the impact of the dodd - frank act rules . gao identified 66 final dodd - frank act rules in effect between july 21 , 2011 , and july 23 , 2012. gao examined the regulatory analyses for the 54 regulations that were substantive and thus required regulatory analyses ; conducted case studies on the regulatory analyses for 4 of the 19 major rules ; conducted case studies on interagency coordination for 3 other rules ; and developed indicators to assess the impact of the acts systemic risk provisions and regulations . federal agencies conducted the regulatory analyses required by various federal statutes for all 54 regulations issued pursuant to the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) that gao reviewed . as part of their analyses , the agencies generally considered , but typically did not quantify or monetize , the benefits and costs of these rules . most of the federal financial regulators , as independent regulatory agencies , are not subject to executive orders that require comprehensive benefit - cost analysis in accordance with guidance issued by the office of management and budget ( omb ) . although most financial regulators are not required to follow omb 's guidance , they told gao that they attempt to follow it in principle or spirit . gao 's review of selected rules found that regulators did not consistently follow key elements of the omb guidance in their regulatory analyses . for example , while some regulators identified the benefits and costs of their chosen regulatory approach in proposed rules , they did not evaluate their chosen approach compared to the benefits and costs of alternative approaches . gao previously recommended that regulators more fully incorporate the omb guidance into their rulemaking policies , and the office of comptroller of the currency and the securities and exchange commission have done so . by not more closely following omb 's guidance , other financial regulators continue to miss an opportunity to improve their analyses . federal financial agencies continue to coordinate on rulemakings informally in order to reduce duplication and overlap in regulations and for other purposes , but interagency coordination does not necessarily eliminate the potential for differences in related rules . agencies coordinated on 19 of the 54 substantive regulations that gao reviewed . for most of the 19 regulations , the dodd - frank act required the agencies to coordinate , but agencies also voluntarily coordinated with other u.s. and international regulators on some of their rulemakings . according to the regulators , most interagency coordination is informal and conducted at the staff level . gao 's review of selected rules shows that differences between related rules may remain even when coordination occurs . according to regulators , such differences may result from differences in their jurisdictions or the markets . finally , the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) has not yet implemented gao 's previous recommendation to work with regulators to establish formal interagency coordination policies . most dodd - frank act regulations have not been finalized or in place for sufficient time for their full impacts to materialize . recognizing these and other limitations , gao took a multipronged approach to assess the impact of some of the act 's provisions and rules , with an initial focus on the act 's systemic risk goals . first , gao developed indicators to monitor changes in certain characteristics of u.s. bank holding companies subject to enhanced prudential regulation under the dodd - frank act ( u.s. bank sifis ) . although the indicators do not identify causal links between their changes and the act -- and many other factors can affect sifis -- some indicators suggest that since 2010 u.s. bank sifis , on average , have decreased their leverage and enhanced their liquidity . second , empirical results of gao 's regression analysis suggest that , to date , the act may have had little effect on u.s. bank sifis ' funding costs but may have helped improve their safety and soundness . gao plans to update its analyses in future reports , including adding indicators for other dodd - frank act provisions and regulations . gao is not making new recommendations in this report but reiterates its 2011 recommendations that the federal financial regulators more fully incorporate ombs guidance into their rulemaking policies and that fsoc work with federal financial regulators to establish formal interagency coordination policies for rulemaking . the agencies provided written and technical comments on a draft of this report , and neither agreed nor disagreed with the reports findings .
