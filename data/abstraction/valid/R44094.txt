bangladesh ( the former east pakistan ) is a muslim - majority nation in south asia , bordering india , burma , and the bay of bengal . it is the world 's eighth most populous country with nearly 160 million people living in a land area about the size of iowa . it is an economically poor nation , and it suffers from high levels of corruption . in recent years , its democratic system has faced an array of challenges , including political violence , weak governance , poverty , demographic and environmental strains , and islamist militancy . the united states has a long - standing and supportive relationship with bangladesh , and it views bangladesh as a moderate voice in the islamic world . in relations with dhaka , bangladesh 's capital , the u.s. government , along with members of congress , has focused on a range of issues , especially those relating to economic development , humanitarian concerns , labor rights , human rights , good governance , and counterterrorism . the awami league ( al ) and the bangladesh nationalist party ( bnp ) dominate bangladeshi politics . when in opposition , both parties have at times sought to regain control of the government through demonstrations , labor strikes , and transport blockades , as well as at the ballot box . prime minister sheikh hasina has been in office since 2009 , and her al party was reelected in january 2014 with an overwhelming majority in parliament — in part because the bnp , led by khaleda zia , boycotted the vote . the bnp has called for new elections , and in recent years , it has organized a series of blockades and strikes . the al also has moved forward with a war crimes tribunal to prosecute atrocities committed during bangladesh 's war of independence from pakistan in 1971. many of the accused have been political opponents of the al government . there is little optimism among observers that the al and the bnp will find a compromise over their political differences , and some analysts are concerned that the political crisis could increase the influence of islamist extremists and further destabilize the country . bangladeshi authorities have pursued islamist militants — with some apparent success — but there have been reports of arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings . several militant groups have re - formed after government operations against them , and some allegedly have developed links with international terrorist organizations , such as the islamic state ( is ) and al qaeda in the indian subcontinent ( aqis ) . also , islamist extremists increasingly have targeted religious and ethnic minorities — as well as foreigners — in bangladesh . bangladesh likely will face a range of other challenges , particularly related to its population growth , population density , and environmental degradation — which many experts believe likely will be exacerbated by climate change . some experts project that millions could be displaced by climate change in the future . in recent years , rohingya refugees from burma have fled to bangladesh to escape persecution . this movement escalated dramatically between august and september 2017 when violence in burma 's rakhine state led to a new surge of over half a million rohingya refugees crossing the border into bangladesh . much international attention has focused on working conditions in bangladesh . the country plays a significant role in the global textile - industry supply chain . in 2016 , bangladesh 's garment sector accounted for over 80 % ( or about $ 25 billion ) of the country 's exports . about $ 5.3 billion of those exports went to the united states . however , the industry has come under increased scrutiny , particularly following the 2013 rana plaza factory collapse , which killed over 1,000 workers .
