for nearly a century , congress has contemplated how to help businesses repair and rebuild after a disaster . congress has also expressed interest in helping businesses use mitigation measures to protect their investments from future incidents . mitigation activities entail identifying risks and hazards and taking measures to either substantially reduce or eliminate the impact of an incident . as described in this report , mitigation measures primarily take place during the recovery phase of a disaster . currently , only damaged businesses in declared disaster areas are eligible for disaster loans . businesses seeking mitigation assistance before a disaster strikes , however , must look to other sources for the assistance . congress experimented with business pre - disaster mitigation ( pdm ) through a pilot program operated by the small business administration ( sba ) from fy2000 to fy2006 . though congress authorized appropriations of $ 15 million each fiscal year to carry out the sba pdm pilot program , four businesses obtained pre - disaster mitigation loans , totaling just over $ 100,000 . although the federal government has traditionally favored a post - disaster approach to mitigation , there are indications suggesting congressional interest in pre - disaster mitigation has increased in recent years , partly as a result of recent and recurring large - scale disasters , including hurricanes katrina , harvey , irma , maria , and michael . this is evidenced by enactment of the disaster recovery reform act of 2018 ( drra , division d of p.l . 115-254 ) , which made substantial reforms to pre - disaster mitigation . the renewed focus on pre - disaster mitigation has also led to discussions about reauthorizing the sba pdm pilot program . this report describes the underlying rationale for post - disaster and pre - disaster mitigation and provides an overview of the sba pdm loan pilot program , including its past performance and potential reasons why so few businesses participated in the pilot program . these potential reasons include ( 1 ) the fact that the pilot program was tied to fema programs , which delayed the program 's implementation ; ( 2 ) limitations on business eligibility for sba pdm loans ; and ( 3 ) the fact that businesses may not have been aware that the sba was offering pre - disaster mitigation loans . this report also provides an overview of various policy options should congress decide to reauthorize the sba pdm pilot program , including considerations that may help increase business participation . these policy options include decoupling the sba pdm disaster loan pilot program from fema programs and examining the most effective forms of outreach and advertising . congress could also consider restructuring the current sba disaster loan program to allow businesses to apply a greater percentage of their disaster loan towards mitigation , and may consider investigating ways to help businesses develop continuity and disaster response plans . congress could also consider providing pdm loans to homeowners so they can protect their homes before a disaster strikes .
