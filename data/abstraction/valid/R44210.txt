the world trade organization 's ( wto ) agreement on technical barriers to trade ( tbt agreement ) contains obligations that wto members must adhere to when they impose requirements on a product 's characteristics . countries typically implement such requirements in order to protect human health or the environment , prevent deceptive practices , or further other legitimate policy goals . however , these measures can be trade - distorting , and sometimes countries implement such regulations solely to protect domestic markets . to that end , the tbt agreement is intended to balance the need to protect members ' regulatory autonomy with the need to prevent unnecessary obstacles to international trade . to date , relatively few wto disputes have been raised challenging member compliance with the tbt agreement 's provisions . however , in recent years , the united states has faced claims alleging its failure to abide by the terms of the tbt agreement . in two of these cases , u.s. – cool and u.s. – tuna ii , the wto found that the united states violated the nondiscrimination obligations contained in article 2.1 of the tbt agreement because the measures treated foreign products less favorably than domestic products . the appellate body reports from these two disputes provide insight into how the wto applies these nondiscrimination provisions , and can provide guidance to congress when it enacts future programs that regulate product characteristics . first , to provide a basic understanding of the objectives and requirements of the tbt agreement , this report provides a general overview of that instrument . next , it briefly describes the regulatory programs at issue in these two wto disputes before analyzing how the wto 's appellate body applied article 2.1 of the tbt agreement in u.s. – cool and u.s. – tuna ii . the report takes an in - depth look at the test established by the appellate body for determining whether a measure is impermissibly discriminatory . finally , the report provides a brief description of how the united states amended these programs in response to the wto decisions , and explains why subsequent wto rulings found that the amended programs still failed to comply with international trade obligations .
