nrc issues rais to obtain information in licensing requests to ensure that officials can make a fully informed , technically correct , and legally defensible regulatory decision . rais are necessary when the information was not included in an applicant 's initial submission , is not contained in any other docketed correspondence , or can not reasonably be inferred from the information available to agency staff . nrc 's use of rais has come under scrutiny in the past . for example , nrc 's inspector general , in a 2015 report , cited concerns about rais , including the amount of time it took to complete the rai process and the resources required to do so . gao was asked to review how nrc uses rais . this report examines nrc 's guidance for developing and issuing rais and how it differs across offices ; how many rais nrc has issued over the past 5 years and the kinds of activities that elicit rais ; and strengths and weaknesses of nrc 's processes to develop rais identified by nrc and licensees and the actions nrc is taking to address concerns . gao examined agency guidance documents and selected licensing actions containing rais . gao interviewed nrc officials and selected licensees . gao randomly selected licensing actions and licensees from a sample of recent licensing actions that included cases from each of nrc 's rai - issuing offices . at the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , individual offices that issue requests for additional information ( rai ) each have their own guidance that is generally the same across the offices . nrc offices have some efforts underway to update their guidance . these efforts are intended to improve oversight of rais and include an increased focus on oversight of rais and on staff compliance through managerial review . for example , one of the offices that issues rais calls for management to discuss the need to send a licensee additional questions on the same topic before doing so . nrc offices that issue rais do not specifically track the number of rais that they have issued and do not have a comprehensive accounting for the last 5 years , although one office has a system capable of tracking the number of rais . information from nrc officials and licensees gao interviewed suggests that certain activities and circumstances often elicit rais . there is no legal requirement for the agency to track the number of rais ; however , offices are updating their internal tracking systems in order to improve information on their licensing activities . receiving rais is not unusual , particularly for certain activities such as complex licensing actions and activities for which regulations are unclear , according to officials . in such cases , increased coordination between nrc and the licensee may be required to resolve certain issues . licensees gao interviewed were generally satisfied with the rai process , identifying strengths and two common weaknesses , and nrc has made recent efforts intended to address these weaknesses . some licensees noted that they see rais as a natural part of interacting with a regulator and identified nrc 's openness to communication and engagement as a strength of the rai process . two common weaknesses that licensees cited are a gap between nrc 's expectations and licensees ' understanding of what to include in their applications , and staff departure from guidance . nrc offices have made recent efforts to address these issues . for example , to address inconsistencies between nrc 's expectations and licensees ' understanding , nrc offices are emphasizing greater communication between review staff and licensees . gao is not making any recommendations . nrc generally agreed with gao 's findings .
