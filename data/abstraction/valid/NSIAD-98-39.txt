pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed interagency processes intended to ensure the efficient allocation of funding and resources for the federal government 's efforts to combat terrorism , focusing on : federal funding for unclassified programs and activities to combat terrorism ; whether any agency or entity has been designated to coordinate budget proposals , establish priorities , manage funding requirements , and help ensure the efficient allocation of federal resources for combating terrorism across federal agencies ; opportunities for agencies to expand coordination of terrorism - related programs and activities under the government performance and results act ( gpra ) principles and framework ; and issues concerning the reimbursement of support provided to agencies with lead counterterrorism responsibilities . gao noted that : the amount of federal funds being spent on combating terrorism is unknown and difficult to determine ; identifying and tracking terrorism - related governmentwide spending with precision is difficult for several reasons ; information from key agencies involved in combating terrorism shows that nearly $ 7 billion was spent for unclassified terrorism - related programs and activities during fiscal year ( fy ) 1997 ; the department of defense budgeted about $ 3.7 billion in fy 1997 , or about 55 percent of the estimated spending ; although the national security council ( nsc ) is to coordinate counterterrorism policy issues and the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to assess competing funding demands , neither agency is required to regularly collect , aggregate , and review funding and spending data relative to combating terrorism on a crosscutting , governmentwide basis ; neither agency establishes funding priorities for terrorism - related programs across agencies ' budgets or ensures that individual agencies ' stated requirements have been validated against threat and risk criteria before budget requests are submitted to congress ; because governmentwide priorities for combating terrorism have not been established and funding requirements have not necessarily been validated based on an analytically sound assessment of the threat and risk of a terrorist attack , there is no basis to have reasonable assurance that : agencies ' requests are funded through a coordinated and focused approach to implement national policy and strategy ; the highest priority requirements are being met ; terrorism - related activities and capabilities are not unnecessarily duplicative or redundant ; and funding gaps or misallocations have not occurred ; gpra principles and framework can provide guidance and opportunities for the many federal agencies involved in the crosscutting program to combat terrorism to develop coordinated goals , objectives and performance measures , and to enhance the management of individual agency and overall federal efforts ; presidential decision directive ( pdd ) 39 directs that agencies will provide support for terrorism - related activities at their own expense unless the president directs otherwise ; the economy act generally requires reimbursement for goods and services provided to another agency ; and the difference between pdd 39 and the economy act concerning reimbursement has caused disagreements between agencies in some cases .
