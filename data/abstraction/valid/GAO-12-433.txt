since 2006 , usps has accumulated losses of $ 25 billion and projects a $ 14.1 billion net loss for fiscal year 2012. in september 2011 , the postmaster general testified that usps needed to reduce its annual costs by $ 20 billion , or 27 percent of its projected expenses . one effort to reduce costs includes restructuring , or optimizing , the size of uspss retail network and workforce . the network includes approximately 32,000 usps - operated facilities , such as traditional post offices , as well as alternative non - usps - operated locations that sell its products and services . to optimize this network , usps plans to evaluate and locate its retail facilities to maximize revenue and minimize costs while still providing access to services . as requested , this report discusses key actions usps has taken over thepast 5 years to restructure its retail network , concerns raised by stakeholders , and the challenges usps faces in changing its retail network . gao analyzed usps documents , interviewed usps officials and stakeholders , and observed public meetings on retail facility closures . over the past 5 years , the u.s. postal service ( usps ) has taken several actions to restructure its retail network through reducing its workforce and its footprint while expanding retail alternatives . usps officials estimated that it had saved about $ 800 million from reducing the number of work hours dedicated to retail operations . usps also closed 631 of its post offices , but it did not have cost - savings estimates for these closures . most of the facilities closed were in response to a postmaster vacancy or the suspension of operations due to an expired lease or irreparable damage following a natural disaster . fewer closures have resulted from nationwide reviews that usps initiated in 2009 and 2011. usps has also restructured its retail network by expanding alternatives through self - service options as well as partnerships with other retailers . members of congress , the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) , the usps office of inspector general ( oig ) , customers , employee associations , and some community residents have raised concerns about uspss retail restructuring initiatives . the concerns include access to postal services , including community residents ability to obtain retail services , the adequacy of retail alternatives , and changes to delivery services ; the impact of facility closures on communities ; the adequacy of usps analysis of facilities facing closure and the reliability of usps data , particularly the accuracy of usps cost savings estimates ; · the transparency and equity of usps closure decisions ; the fairness of uspss facility closure procedures ; and changes in who can manage a post office . prc , usps oig , and gao have recommended improvements to address some of these issues . in particular , gao has recommended that usps develop a plan that addresses both traditional post offices and retail alternatives and ensures that usps has a viable strategy for effectively adapting its networks to changing mail use and maintaining adequate service as it reduces costs . usps officials have said they are in the process of addressing these recommendations . usps faces challenges , such as legal restrictions and resistance from some members of congress and the public , that have limited its ability to change its retail network . for example , usps is supposed to be self - financing , but it is also restricted by law from making decisions that businesses would commonly make , such as closing unprofitable units . additionally , some members of congress and the public have challenged uspss plans to close retail facilities in their districts or communities . certain policy issues remain unresolved related to what level of retail services usps should provide , how the cost of these services should be paid , and how usps should optimize its retail network . pending legislation takes differing approaches to addressing these policy issues . if congress prefers to retain the current level of retail service and associated network , decisions will need to be made about how usps will pay for these services , including through additional cost reductions or revenue sources . gao makes no recommendations in this report , as it has previously reported on the urgency for congress to allow usps to adapt its retail network to changing customer behavior and reduce costs . usps agreed with gaos draft report , noting limitations it faces to retailrestructuring . it also observed that maintaining the same level of retail services will require solutions to cover the costs of those services .
