american samoa is the only populated u.s. insular area that does not have a federal court . congress has granted the local high court federal jurisdiction for certain federal matters , such as specific areas of maritime law . gao was asked to conduct a study of american samoa 's system for addressing matters of federal law . this testimony discusses : the current system for adjudicating matters of federal law in american samoa and how it compares to those in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) , guam , and the u.s. virgin islands ( usvi ) ; the reasons offered for or against changing the current system for adjudicating matters of federal law in american samoa ; potential scenarios and issues associated with establishing a federal court in american samoa or expanding the federal jurisdiction of the local court ; and the potential cost elements and funding sources associated with implementing those different scenarios . this testimony is based on gao work performed from april 2007 to june 2008. because american samoa does not have a federal court like the cnmi , guam , or usvi , matters of federal law arising in american samoa have generally been adjudicated in u.s. district courts in hawaii or the district of columbia . reasons offered for changing the existing system focus primarily on the difficulties of adjudicating matters of federal law arising in american samoa , principally based on american samoa 's remote location , and the desire to provide american samoans more direct access to justice . reasons offered against any changes focus primarily on concerns about the effects of an increased federal presence on samoan culture and traditions and concerns about juries ' impartiality given close family ties . during the mid - 1990s , several proposals were studied and many of the issues discussed then , such as the protection of local culture , were also raised during the gao study . based on previous studies and information gathered for its june 2008 report , gao identified three potential scenarios , if changes were to be made : establish a federal court in american samoa under article iv of the u.s. constitution , establish a district court in american samoa as a division of the district of hawaii , or expand the federal jurisdiction of the high court of american samoa . each scenario would present unique issues to be addressed , such as what jurisdiction to grant the court . the potential cost elements for establishing a federal court in american samoa include agency rental costs , personnel costs , and operational costs , most of which would be funded by congressional appropriations . exact details of the costs to be incurred would have to be determined when , and if , any of the scenarios were adopted . the controversy surrounding whether and how to create a venue for adjudicating matters of federal law in american samoa is not principally focused on an analysis of cost effectiveness , but other policy considerations , such as equity , justice , and cultural preservation .
