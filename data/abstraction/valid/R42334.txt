senior department of defense ( dod ) leaders have invoked the specter of a `` hollow force '' to describe what could happen to the u.s. armed forces if significant cuts to the defense budget are enacted . while some members and staff might be familiar with the hollow force and its causes , newer members and staff might not have a similar understanding of the conditions that led to the hollow force and what actions were taken to improve the condition of the u.s. armed forces . after several years of rapid growth in defense budgets , measures to reduce federal budget deficits have led to projections of a substantial decline in military spending over the next decade . as a result of limits on discretionary spending in the budget control act of 2011 , dod is considering how to absorb a reduction of $ 450 billion to $ 500 billion in planned programs through fy2021 . senior defense officials have said that such reductions can be managed , but they also warn that that trade - offs among defense programs will require a reassessment of priorities , and that deeper cuts would weaken critical capabilities . a common theme is that , unless reductions are managed prudently , budget cuts of the magnitude required , let alone larger cuts , would risk creating a hollow force the term hollow force refers to military forces that appear mission - ready but , upon examination , suffer from shortages of personnel and equipment and from deficiencies in training . historically , there were two periods — post - vietnam and again in the 1990s — when the term hollow force was used to describe the u.s. armed forces . in the case of post - vietnam , a variety of socioeconomic factors as well as funding decisions played a large role in the overall decline in readiness , particularly the decision to develop new weapon systems rather than funding other requirements . the 1990s hollow force , however , did not suffer from the socioeconomic problems that characterized the post - vietnam force . instead , the military of the early and mid - 1990s was being deployed on a frequent basis for a variety of contingency operations and was viewed by some as being `` overcommitted '' relative to its size and resources . this overcommitment was further exacerbated by recruiting and retention concerns and a lack of funds to finance new weapon systems due to dod decisions to emphasize readiness - related funding . a number of current defense officials have warned about the return to a hollow force if the dod budget is cut significantly . other senior officers instead suggest that in the aftermath of two wars , a reduction in the defense budget and the force is not unprecedented and the services will be able to make the necessary adjustments to ensure readiness . therefore , the question arises if it is fair to suggest that the military could become a hollow force if dod funding was drastically reduced and if force structure and weapon systems programs were cut . some believe this is a mischaracterization , as it is considered unlikely the quality of the force will decline , that pay and benefits will be cut to the point that service in the military becomes unattractive , and public support for the military will erode — all factors that lead to general meyer 's description of the post - vietnam army as a hollow force it is also noted that dod has a great deal of discretion on how its funds are spent and how units are organized , manned , equipped , and trained , which is also a factor that contributes to readiness of the force . as congress will play a major role in shaping the armed forces in terms of size , capabilities , and how it is equipped and trained , a nuanced understanding of how the military once became `` hollow '' could provide a useful context for current and anticipated legislative action .
