the department of veterans affairs ( va ) collects health insurance payments , known as third - party collections , for veterans ' health care conditions it treats that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service . in september 1999 , va adopted a new fee schedule , called `` reasonable charges , '' that it anticipated would increase revenues from third - party collections . in january 2003 , gao reported on va 's third - party collection efforts and problems in collections operations for fiscal year 2002 as well as va 's initiatives to improve collections ( va health care : third - party collections rising as va continues to address problems in its collections operations , ( gao - 03-145 , jan. 31 , 2003 ) ) . gao was asked to discuss its findings and update third - party collection amounts and agency plans to improve collections . va 's fiscal year 2002 third - party collections rose by 32 percent over fiscal year 2001 collections , to $ 687 million , and available data for the first half of fiscal year 2003 show that $ 386 million has been collected so far . the increase in collections reflects va 's improved ability to manage the larger billing volume and more itemized bills required under its new fee schedule . va managers in three regional health care networks attributed billings increases to a reduction of billing backlogs and improved collections processes , such as better medical documentation prepared by physicians , more complete identification of billable care by coders , and more bills prepared per biller . although collections are increasing , operational problems , such as missed billing opportunities , persist and continue to limit the amount va collects . va has been implementing the action items in its revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 that are designed to address operational problems , such as unidentified insurance for some patients , insufficient documentation of services for billing , shortages of billing staff , and insufficient pursuit of accounts receivable . va reported in april 2003 that 10 of 24 action items are complete ; 7 are scheduled for implementation by the end of 2003 ; and the remaining actions will begin in 2004 with full implementation expected in 2005 or 2006. these dates are behind va 's original schedule . in addition , the chief business office , established in may 2002 , has developed a new approach that combines the action items with additional initiatives . given the growing demand for care , especially from higher - income veterans , it is important that va resolve its operational problems and sustain its commitment to maximizing third - party collections . it is also important for va to develop a reliable estimate of uncollected dollars and a complete measure of its collections costs . without this information , va can not evaluate its effectiveness in supplementing its medical care appropriation with third - party dollars .
