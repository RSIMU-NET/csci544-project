prerecorded telephone messages that provide information about political candidates or urge voters to go to the polls are a common campaign tactic . anecdotal accounts suggest that the public often objects to the volume and frequency of these automated political calls ( also called `` auto calls '' or `` robo calls '' ) . despite often negative anecdotal information about automated political calls , they remain an inexpensive , effective way to reach hundreds or thousands of voters quickly . campaigns and groups often rely on automated political calls to respond to last - minute campaign developments . four bills introduced in the 111th congress contain provisions that are particularly relevant for automated political calls . h.r . 116 ( foxx ) would add automated political calls to the federal do not call list . s. 1077 ( feinstein ) would restrict the timing and volume of calls and would require certain information to be disclosed . h.r . 4641 ( lofgren ) proposes similar restrictions . finally , h.r . 4749 ( price , n.c. ) would extend `` stand by your ad '' disclaimer requirements to various political messages , including prerecorded calls . automated political calls received attention in both chambers during the 110th congress . several bills ( h.r . 248 , h.r . 372 , h.r . 479 , h.r . 894 , h.r . 1298 , h.r . 1383 , h.r . 1452 , h.r . 4298 , h.r . 5747 , and s. 2624 ) would have added the calls to the federal do not call list , required additional reporting about the calls , or otherwise regulated the calls . the committee on house administration , subcommittee on elections , held an oversight hearing on automated political calls on december 6 , 2007. the senate rules and administration committee considered s. 2624 at a february 27 , 2008 , hearing . empirical research and data about automated political calls are limited . existing research suggests that the calls are an increasingly common campaign tactic and that various political committees spent millions of dollars on those efforts . despite media reports of strong public disdain for automated political calls , the fec has received few recent formal complaints on the issue . however , fec enforcement data are not necessarily a reliable indicator of public sentiment toward automated political calls . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) reportedly does not track data about complaints it receives on automated political calls . this report provides an overview of how automated political calls are used in federal campaigns . this includes attention to recent spending estimates and polling data about automated political calls . the report also discusses legislation that would affect the calls . policy options discussed in the report include maintaining the status quo , gathering additional data , revising federal disclosure or disclaimer requirements , adding the calls to the federal do not call list , or restricting the number and timing of calls . some of those options would likely involve contentious questions about which organizations and messages should be regulated by campaign finance law . constitutional issues could also affect some of those policy options . the `` first amendment considerations '' section provides a legal analysis . this report will be updated as events warrant .
