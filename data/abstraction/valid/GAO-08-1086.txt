the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) secure border initiative ( sbi ) is a multiyear , multibillion - dollar program to secure the nation 's borders through , among other things , new technology , increased staffing , and new fencing and barriers . the technology component of sbi , which is known as sbinet , involves the acquisition , development , integration , and deployment of surveillance systems and command , control , communications , and intelligence technologies . gao was asked to determine whether dhs has defined the scope and timing of sbinet capabilities and how these capabilities will be developed and deployed , is effectively defining and managing sbinet requirements , and is effectively managing sbinet testing . to do so , gao reviewed key program documentation and interviewed program officials , analyzed a random sample of requirements , and observed operations of a pilot project . important aspects of sbinet remain ambiguous and in a continued state of flux , making it unclear and uncertain what technology capabilities will be delivered , when and where they will be delivered , and how they will be delivered . for example , the scope and timing of planned sbinet deployments and capabilities have continued to change since the program began and , even now , are unclear . further , the program office does not have an approved integrated master schedule to guide the execution of the program , and gao 's assimilation of available information indicates that the schedule has continued to change . this schedule - related risk is exacerbated by the continuous change in and the absence of a clear definition of the approach that is being used to define , develop , acquire , test , and deploy sbinet . the absence of clarity and stability in these key aspects of sbinet impairs the ability of the congress to oversee the program and hold dhs accountable for program results , and it hampers dhs 's ability to measure program progress . sbinet requirements have not been effectively defined and managed . while the program office recently issued guidance that defines key practices associated with effectively developing and managing requirements , such as eliciting user needs and ensuring that different levels of requirements and associated verification methods are properly aligned with one another , the guidance was developed after several key activities had been completed . in the absence of this guidance , the program has not effectively performed key requirements definition and management practices . for example , it has not ensured that different levels of requirements are properly aligned , as evidenced by gao 's analysis of a random probability sample of component requirements showing that a large percentage of them could not be traced to higher - level system and operational requirements . also , some of sbinet 's operational requirements , which are the basis for all lower - level requirements , were found by an independent dhs review to be unaffordable and unverifiable , thus casting doubt on the quality of lower - level requirements that are derived from them . as a result , the risk of sbinet not meeting mission needs and performing as intended is increased , as are the chances of expensive and time - consuming system rework . sbinet testing has not been effectively managed . for example , the program office has not tested the individual system components to be deployed to the initial deployment locations , even though the contractor initiated integration testing of these components with other system components and subsystems in june 2008. further , while a test management strategy was drafted in may 2008 , it has not been finalized and approved , and it does not contain , among other things , a clear definition of testing roles and responsibilities ; a high - level master schedule of sbinet test activities ; or sufficient detail to effectively guide project - specific test planning , such as milestones and metrics for specific project testing . without a structured and disciplined approach to testing , the risk that sbinet will not satisfy user needs and operational requirements , thus requiring system rework , is increased .
