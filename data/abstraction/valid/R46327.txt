congress established the office of technology assessment ( ota ) as a legislative branch agency by the office of technology assessment act of 1972 ( p.l . 92-484 ) . ota was created to provide congress with early indications of the probable beneficial and adverse impacts of technology applications . ota 's work was to be used as a factor in congress ' consideration of legislation , particularly with regard to activities for which the federal government might provide support for , or management or regulation of , technological applications . the agency operated for more than two decades , producing approximately 750 full assessments , background papers , technical memoranda , case studies , and workshop proceedings spanning a wide range of topics . in 1995 , amid broader efforts to reduce the size of government , congress eliminated funding for the agency . although the agency ceased operations , the statute authorizing ota 's establishment , structure , functions , duties , powers , and relationships to other entities ( 2 u.s.c . â§â§471 et seq . ) . was not repealed . since ota 's defunding , there have been several attempts to reestablish ota or to create an ota - like function for congress . during its years of operations , ota was both praised and criticized by some members of congress and outside observers . many found ota 's reports to be comprehensive , balanced , and authoritative ; its assessments helped shaped public debate and laws in national security , energy , the environment , health care and other areas . others identified a variety of shortcomings . some critics asserted that the time it took for ota to define a report , collect information , gather expert opinions , analyze the topic , and issue a report was not consistent with the fast pace of legislative decisionmaking . others asserted that some of ota 's reports exhibited bias and that the agency was responsive only to a narrow constituency in congress , that reports were costly and not timely , that there were insufficient mechanisms for public input , and that the agency was inconsistent in its identification of ethical and social implications of developments in science and technology . in debate leading to ota 's defunding , a central assertion of its critics was that the agency duplicated the work of other federal agencies and organizations . those holding this position asserted that other entities could take on the technology assessment function if directed to do so by congress . among the entities identified for this role were the government accountability office ( then the general accounting office ) , the congressional research service , the national academies , and universities . congress has multiple options for addressing its technology assessment needs . congress could opt to reestablish ota by appropriating funds for the agency 's operation , potentially including guidance for its reestablishment in the form of report language . if it pursues this option , congress would need to reestablish two related statutorily mandated organizations : the technology assessment board ( tab ) , ota 's bipartisan , bicameral oversight body ; and the technology assessment advisory council ( taac ) , ota 's external advisory body . in 2019 , the house included $ 6.0 million for ota in the house - passed version of the legislative branch appropriations act , 2020 ( h.r . 2779 ) ; no funding was provided in the final act . congress might also opt to amend ota 's authorizing statute to address perceived shortcomings ; to revise its mission , organizational structure , or process for initiation of technology assessments ; or to make other modifications or additions . alternatively , congress could choose to create or develop an existing technology assessment capability in another legislative branch agency , such as the government accountability office ( gao ) or congressional research service . since fy2002 , congress has directed gao to bolster its technology assessment capabilities . from 2002 to 2019 , gao produced 16 technology assessments . in 2019 , gao , at the direction of congress , created a new office , science , technology assessment , and analytics ( staa ) , and announced plans to increase the number of staa analysts over time from 49 to 140. in addition , congress could increase its usage of the national academies of science , engineering , and medicine by funding an expanded number of congressionally mandated technology assessments . alternatively , congress could opt to take no action and instead rely on current sources of informationâgovernmental and nongovernmentalâto meet its needs . in 2018 , congress directed crs to contract with the national academy of public administration ( napa ) for a study to `` assess the potential need within the legislative branch to create a separate entity charged with the mission of providing nonpartisan advice on issues of science and technology . furthermore , the study should also address if the creation of such entity duplicates services already available to members of congress . . the napa study recommended bolstering the science and technology policy efforts of crs and gao , as well as the establishment of an office of the congressional science and technology advisor ( ocsta ) and a coordinating council . napa stated that it did not evaluate the option of reestablishing ota due to congress ' efforts since 2002 to build a technology assessment capability within gao .
