in 2017 , approximately 39.7 million people , or 12.3 % of the population , had incomes below the official definition of poverty in the united states . poverty statistics provide a measure of economic hardship . the official definition of poverty for the united states uses dollar amounts called poverty thresholds that vary by family size and the members ' ages . families with incomes below their respective thresholds are considered to be in poverty . the poverty rate ( the percentage that was in poverty ) fell from 12.7 % in 2016. this was the third consecutive year since the most recent recession that the poverty rate has fallen . the poverty rate for female - householder families ( 25.7 % ) was higher in 2017 than that for male - householder families ( 12.4 % ) or married - couple families ( 4.9 % ) . none of these poverty rates registered a discernible change from 2016. among the working - age population ( 18 to 64 year olds ) , the poverty rate fell to 11.2 % in 2017 , down from 11.6 % in 2016. neither children ( people under 18 ) nor the aged ( people ages 65 and older ) had discernible changes to their poverty rates over the period . of the three age groups — children , the working - age population , and the aged — the latter used to have the highest poverty rates but now has the lowest : 28.5 % of the aged population was poor in 1966 , but 9.2 % was poor in 2017. people under 18 , in contrast , have the highest poverty rate of the three age groups : 17.5 % were poor in 2017. poverty is not equally prevalent in all parts of the country . the poverty rate for mississippi ( 19.8 % ) appeared to be the highest but was in a statistical tie with new mexico ( 19.7 % ) , louisiana ( 19.7 % ) , and west virginia ( 19.1 % ) . new hampshire 's poverty rate ( 7.7 % ) was the lowest in 2017. criticisms of the official poverty measure have inspired poverty measurement research and eventually led to the development of the supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) . the spm uses different definitions of needs and resources than the official measure . the spm includes the effects of taxes and in - kind benefits ( such as housing , energy , and food assistance ) on poverty , while the official measure does not . because some types of tax credits are used to assist the poor ( as are other forms of assistance ) , the spm may be of interest to policymakers . the poverty rate under the spm ( 13.9 % ) was about 1.6 percentage points higher in 2017 than the official poverty rate ( 12.3 % ) . under the spm , the profile of the poverty population is slightly different than under the official measure . compared with the official measure , poverty rates under the spm were lower for children ( 15.6 % compared with 17.5 % ) and higher for working - age adults ( 13.2 % compared with 11.2 % ) and the population age 65 and older ( 14.1 % compared with 9.2 % ) . while the spm reflects more current measurement methods , the official measure provides a comparison of the poor population over a longer time period , including some years before many current anti - poverty assistance programs had been developed . in developing poverty - related legislation and conducting oversight on programs that aid the low - income population , policymakers may be interested in these historical trends .
