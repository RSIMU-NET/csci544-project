pursuant to a congressional request , gao reported on the relationship between health insurance and health care access , focusing on : what effect health insurance has on children 's access to health care ; whether expanding publicly funded insurance improves their access ; and barriers besides lack of insurance that might deter children from getting health care . gao noted that : health insurance increased children 's access to health care services in almost all the studies gao analyzed ; most of the evaluations showed that insured children were more likely to have preventive and primary care than uninsured children ; insured children were also more likely to have a relationship with a primary care physician and to receive required preventive services , like well - child checkups , than uninsured children ; differences in access between insured and uninsured children held true even for children who had chronic conditions and special health care needs ; when ill , insured children were more likely to receive a physician 's care for their health problems , such as asthma or acute earache ; in contrast , lack of insurance can inhibit parents from trying to get health care for their children and can lead providers to offer less - intensive services when families seek care ; several studies found evidence that low - income and uninsured children were more likely to be hospitalized for conditions that could have been managed with appropriate outpatient care ; two studies found that uninsured children sometimes received less - intensive hospital care than insured children ; while health insurance benefits differed and some excluded coverage for some basic health care needs , increasing the number of insured children increased the likelihood that more children would receive care ; although health insurance can considerably increase access , it does not guarantee entry into the health care system ; low family income and education levels , limited availability of neighborhood primary health care facilities , lack of transportation , and language differences are among the barriers to obtaining and appropriately using health care services ; both children who have no health insurance and those who have medicaid coverage are more likely than privately insured children to face such barriers ; and to ensure access to high - quality care , public health and clinical experts recommend that children have a stable source of health insurance benefits that cover their health care needs , a relationship with a primary care provider that helps them obtain more complex care as needed , primary care facilities that are conveniently situated , and outreach and education for their families .
