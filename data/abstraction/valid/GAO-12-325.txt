studies have been conducted to better understand the fees 401 plan sponsors and their participants pay . however , these studies focus on larger plans . thus , uncertainty remains about the amounts paid by small and medium - sized plans and the level of knowledge and expertise these sponsors have to assess the fees charged by service providers . gao addressed the following related to small , medium - sized , and large plans : amounts plan sponsors and participants pay for services , challenges sponsors face in understanding how fees are charged , and actions labor has taken to help sponsors better understand and monitor the fees charged by service providers . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and retirement research , and interviewed federal officials and industry experts . gao also conducted a survey of 1,000 401 plans to collect information about fees paid for plan services . the response rate allowed gao to generalize to the population of 401 plans for most of the survey questions . the survey instrument and most results can be viewed at gao - 12-550sp . plan sponsors and participants paid a range of fees for services , though smaller plans typically paid higher fees as a percentage of plan assets . for example , the average amount sponsors of small plans reported paying for recordkeeping and administrative services was 1.33 percent of assets annually , compared with 0.15 percent paid by sponsors of large plans . larger plans were more likely to pass recordkeeping fees along to participants , but when fees were passed along to participants in small plans , those in large plans paid lower fees than those in small plans . participants also paid for investment and plan consulting feesthrough fees deducted from their plan assetsin more instances than sponsors . gaos survey and review of plan documents showed that some sponsors faced challenges in understanding the fees they and their participants were charged . some sponsors did not know if their providers used complex fee arrangements , such as revenue sharing , or if their plans paid certain fees under an insurance contract , such as a group annuity contract . in addition , some sponsors reported knowing about arrangements , but did not fully understand how these fees were charged . for example , one relatively large plan underestimated recordkeeping fees by more than $ 58,000 , because the sponsor did not include the fees charged to participants accounts under its revenue sharing arrangement . the department of labor ( labor ) has taken several actions to help sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers . for example , labor disseminates a number of publications and resources , including a 401 fees checklist that is available to sponsors on its website to help them better understand plan fees . however , according to gaos survey results , more than an estimated 90 percent of sponsors either did not know about or have not used labors resources to compare and assess plan fees . additionally , sponsors have access to the plan information of others , including some fees paid , through the form 5500 , but gaos survey also shows that the information is not being used by sponsors . finally , although labor has recently taken on regulatory initiatives to enhance fee disclosures to sponsors , their effect remains to be seen . for example , labor is in the process of revising a proposed change to the definition of the term fiduciary ,  which may allow labor to oversee a broader range of plan investment advisers . however , labors authority over other types of providers , who have considerable influence over sponsors and may charge sponsors and their plan participants excessive fees , is limited . the department of labor ( labor ) has taken several actions to help sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers . for example , labor disseminates a number of publications and resources , including a 401 fees checklist that is available to sponsors on its website to help them better understand plan fees . however , according to gaos survey results , more than an estimated 90 percent of sponsors either did not know about or have not used labors resources to compare and assess plan fees . additionally , sponsors have access to the plan information of others , including some fees paid , through the form 5500 , but gaos survey also shows that the information is not being used by sponsors . finally , although labor has recently taken on regulatory initiatives to enhance fee disclosures to sponsors , their effect remains to be seen . for example , labor is in the process of revising a proposed change to the definition of the term fiduciary ,  which may allow labor to oversee a broader range of plan investment advisers . however , labors authority over other types of providers , who have considerable influence over sponsors and may charge sponsors and their plan participants excessive fees , is limited . gao recommends that labor develop and implement more proactive approaches to sponsor educational outreach , improve public access to annual form 5500 data , and examine the definition of a fiduciary to determine if it captures the current relationship between sponsors and providers . in response , labor generally agreed with the findings and will explore ways to implement these recommendations .
