pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the medicaid - related actions states have taken in the first year of welfare reform , focusing on : the medicaid related options the welfare reform law gave states and the approaches states have taken ; the implications of these states choices for medicaid eligibles and for the states ' administrative processes ; and steps states have taken or plan to take to educate and enroll medicaid eligibles , in view of their changing eligibility for cash assistance programs . gao noted that : during the first full year of welfare reform , the nine states gao reviewed chose welfare reform options that generally sustained medicaid coverage for their previously eligible populations ; the options provided to states included establishing different income and resource ( asset ) standards for their medicaid and cash assistance programs , administering the two programs separately , imposing medicaid - related penalties for welfare recipients not complying with state work rules , and discontinuing medicaid coverage for aliens ; four of the nine states gao visited had separate income or resource standards for their medicaid and cash assistance programs ; according to officials in these states , eligibility standards had been separated as part of state welfare reform ; consistent with the options offered states by the welfare reform law , these separate standards often provided more generous income or resource limits for medicaid than for welfare recipients , thus protecting eligibility for medical assistance ; to foster administrative efficiencies for states and public assistance applicants , all nine states chose to continue using a common application for their welfare and medicaid programs and eight chose to continue using a single agency at the local level to determine applicant eligibility ; while the welfare reform law offered states the option of witholding medicaid as a sanction for noncompliance with state work rules , as well as discontinuing medicaid coverage for most aliens , none of the nine states chose to do so ; the intial choices that these states made resulted in little structural change in their medicaid programs ; there were initially some concerns that new supplemental security income ( ssi ) eligibility restrictions for certain aliens and disabled children would affect their medicaid eligibility ; however , subsequent legislation modified and reversed , to some extent , the provisions that restricted ssi eligibility for these populations ; welfare reform also poses new challenges for states ' medicaid beneficiary education and enrollment activities ; even prior to welfare reform , significant numbers of children were eligible for medicaid but not enrolled ; and welfare reform increases the number of medicaid eligibles who do not receive cash assistance -- individuals who are often difficult to identify and enroll in medicaid .
