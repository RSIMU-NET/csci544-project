the electric power industry is increasingly incorporating information technology ( it ) systems and networks into its existing infrastructure ( e.g . , electricity networks , including power lines and customer meters ) . this use of it can provide many benefits , such as greater efficiency and lower costs to consumers . however , this increased reliance on it systems and networks also exposes the grid to cybersecurity vulnerabilities , which can be exploited by attackers . moreover , gao has identified protecting systems supporting our nations critical infrastructure ( which includes the electricity grid ) as a governmentwide high - risk area . gao was asked to testify on the status of actions to protect the electricity grid from cyber attacks . accordingly , this statement discusses cyber threats facing cyber - reliant critical infrastructures , which include the electricity grid , and actions taken and challenges remaining to secure the grid against cyber attacks . in preparing this statement , gao relied on previously published work in this area and reviewed reports from other federal agencies , media reports , and other publicly available sources . the threats to systems supporting critical infrastructures are evolving and growing . in testimony , the director of national intelligence noted a dramatic increase in cyber activity targeting u.s. computers and systems , including a more than tripling of the volume of malicious software . varying types of threats from numerous sources can adversely affect computers , software , networks , organizations , entire industries , and the internet itself . these include both unintentional and intentional threats , and may come in the form of targeted or untargeted attacks from criminal groups , hackers , disgruntled employees , nations , or terrorists . the interconnectivity between information systems , the internet , and other infrastructures can amplify the impact of these threats , potentially affecting the operations of critical infrastructures , the security of sensitive information , and the flow of commerce . moreover , the electricity grids reliance on it systems and networks exposes it to potential and known cybersecurity vulnerabilities , which could be exploited by attackers . the potential impact of such attacks has been illustrated by a number of recently reported incidents and can include fraudulent activities , damage to electricity control systems , power outages , and failures in safety equipment . to address such concerns , multiple entities have taken steps to help secure the electricity grid , including the north american electric reliability corporation , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , the federal energy regulatory commission , and the departments of homeland security and energy . these include , in particular , establishing mandatory and voluntary cybersecurity standards and guidance for use by entities in the electricity industry . for example , the north american electric reliability corporation and the federal energy regulatory commission , which have responsibility for regulation and oversight of part of the industry , have developed and approved mandatory cybersecurity standards and additional guidance . in addition , nist has identified cybersecurity standards that support smart grid interoperability and has issued a cybersecurity guideline . the departments of homeland security and energy have also played roles in disseminating guidance on security practices and providing other assistance . as gao previously reported , there were a number of ongoing challenges to securing electricity systems and networks . these include : a lack of a coordinated approach to monitor industry compliance with voluntary standards . aspects of the current regulatory environment made it difficult to ensure the cybersecurity of smart grid systems . a focus by utilities on regulatory compliance instead of comprehensive security . a lack of security features consistently built into smart grid systems . the electricity industry did not have an effective mechanism for sharing information on cybersecurity and other issues . the electricity industry did not have metrics for evaluating cybersecurity . in a prior report , gao has made recommendations related to electricity grid modernization efforts , including developing an approach to monitor compliance with voluntary standards . these recommendations have not yet been implemented .
