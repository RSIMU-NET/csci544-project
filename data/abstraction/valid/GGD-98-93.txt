gao reviewed the effects of reductions in personnel positions at the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , the interior ( doi ) , and veteran affairs ( va ) , focusing on : the activities the agencies have undertaken in restructuring personnel offices and operations ; what performance measures are in place to gauge results of the restructuring efforts ; and issues agencies may commonly encounter when , in restructuring their personnel operations , they consider outsourcing automated personnel or payroll services to another agency or the private sector . gao noted that : although the focus of agencies ' restructuring efforts differed across the four departments , their streamlining plans included reducing the number of employees working in personnel operations and automating paper - based personnel processes to improve the responsiveness and quality of personnel - related services ; the reduction in the number of personnelists at the four departments ranged from 14 to 41 percent between september 1993 and september 1997 ; even with reductions of this magnitude , the personnel servicing ratios for three departments did not change substantially ; the departments sought to boost the efficiency of their personnel offices by automating their largely paper - based operations ; to achieve this increase in efficiency , the departments generally planned to have new equipment and software in place before staff reductions were made ; however , that did not occur , and the departments fell behind their original milestones for implementing new personnel and payroll systems while initial personnel staff reductions occurred ; according to personnel officials , the four departments had few measures in place to gauge the results of their personnel operations before restructuring ; however , officials in all four departments recognized the need for measurement , were developing performance measures to assess future efforts , and , in some cases , were seeking to more fully assess current costs and performance to identify specific targets for improvement ; in addition to providing personnel services to their component agencies , the four departments were developing or purchasing automated personnel systems with the intention of selling payroll or other key personnel services to other agencies ; agency officials suggested that a framework was needed with which agencies could obtain information on the personnel services offered by other federal agencies , the cost of those services , and their performance characteristics , including service - level standards ; agency officials also suggested the need for a standard technical format and a core set of requirements for personnel data that agencies are likely to exchange with each other ; and since april 1997 , the office of personnel management ( opm ) has rechartered the mission of the federal personnel automation council and tasked it to develop a set of core data elements and requirements for personnel information systems .
