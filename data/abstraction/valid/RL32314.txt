president bush and former thai prime minister thaskin on october 19 , 2003 , agreed to negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement ( fta ) . six negotiating rounds took place , the most recent january 10-13 , 2006 in thailand . u.s. trade officials had hoped to conclude the negotiations by early 2006 , but the negotiations were suspended by thailand in february 2006 due to bangkok 's political crisis . after 18 months of negotiations the two sides were wide apart on a number of issues , such as financial services liberalization and a number of other sensitive issues . combined with considerable public opposition to the fta in thailand , the bush administration may be hard pressed to complete the negotiation before trade promotion authority expires in mid - 2007 . while the thai government appointed by the military after thailand 's september 2006 coup remains committed to concluding an fta with the united states , it also plans to submit any agreement to the 242 national legislative assembly ( nla ) for approval â€” a step that deposed prime minister thaskin maintained was not required . at this date , however , there are no plans ( date or venue ) to resume the negotiations . in the notification letter sent to the congressional leadership , then - u.s. trade representative robert zoellick put forth an array of commercial and foreign policy gains that could be derived from the agreement . the letter stated that an fta would be particularly beneficial to u.s. agricultural producers , as well as to u.s. companies exporting goods and services to thailand and investing there . mr. zoellick also alluded to sensitive issues that would need to be addressed : trade in automobiles , protection of intellectual property rights , and labor and environmental standards . thailand has been viewed as a strong candidate for an fta with the united states . its economy has shown relatively healthy growth in recent years , rising by 6.2 % in 2004 and 4.5 % in 2005. yet , thailand maintains relatively high tariff and non - tariff barriers on a number of products and services . secondly , an fta with thailand would allow u.s. exporters to gain access to thai markets similar to that obtained by other countries through bilateral and plurilateral agreements with thailand . third , a u.s. - thailand fta would likely induce other countries to seek a trade liberalization agreement with the united states . countries that form ftas agree at a minimum to phase out or reduce tariff and non - tariff barriers ( ntbs ) on mutual trade in order to enhance market access between the trading partners . the u.s. - thailand fta is expected to be comprehensive , seeking to liberalize trade in goods , agriculture , services , and investment , as well as intellectual property rights . other issues such as government procurement , competition policy , environment and labor standards , and customs procedures are also on the negotiating table . the u.s. - thailand fta negotiations are of interest to congress because ( 1 ) an agreement would require passage of implementing legislation to go into effect ; ( 2 ) an agreement could increase u.s. exports of goods , services , and investment , with particular benefits for agricultural exports ; and ( 3 ) an agreement could increase competition for u.s. import - competing industries such as textiles and apparel and light trucks , thereby raising the issue of job losses . this report will be updated if negotiations are resumed .
