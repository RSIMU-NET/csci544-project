what would happen in 2016 if a candidate for president or vice president were to die or leave the ticket any time between the national party conventions and the november 8 election day ? . what would happen if this occurred during presidential transition , either between election day and the december 19 , 2016 , meeting of the electoral college ; or between december 19 and the inauguration of the president and vice president on january 20 , 2017 ? . procedures to fill these vacancies differ depending on when they occur . during the election campaign â€” between the national party nominating conventions and the election . after the conventions , which are usually held in july or august , and election day , november 8 in 2016 , political party rules apply . for the democrats , the democratic national committee would select a replacement ; for the republicans , the republican national committee would select replacement , or it could reconvene the national convention to perform this task . between the election and the electoral college meeting . on election day , voters choose members of the electoral college , which formally selects the president - and vice president - elect several weeks later ( december 19 in 2016 ) . although the transition has begun , party rules still apply : a replacement candidate would be chosen by the national committees of either party , or by a reassembled republican national convention . between the electoral college meeting and inauguration . the balance of scholarly opinion holds that the president - and vice president - elect are chosen once the electoral votes are cast . the electoral votes are counted and declared by a joint session of congress , held january 6 of the year following the election , although congress occasionally sets a different date for the joint session . during this period , succession is covered by the 20th amendment to the constitution : if the president - elect dies , the vice president - elect becomes president - elect . although the amendment does not specifically address the issues of disability , disqualification , or resignation during this period , its language , `` failure to qualify , '' could arguably be interpreted to cover such contingencies . vacancies in the position of vice president - elect are not mentioned in the 20th amendment ; they would be covered after the inauguration by the 25th amendment . if no person qualifies as president or vice president by inauguration day , then the succession act ( 3 u.s.c . 19 ) applies : the speaker of the house of representatives , the president pro tempore of the senate , and duly confirmed cabinet officers , in that order , would act as president . following the events of september 11 , 2001 , concern about the possibility of terrorist attacks at the inauguration led to proposals to safeguard the line of presidential succession during the swearing - in ceremony , especially during a change of administrations . most involve a `` designated survivor , '' a constitutionally eligible successor who would stay away from the ceremony in order to safeguard continuity in the office of the president . one option would be for an elected official in the line of succession , such as the speaker of the house of representatives or president pro - tempore of the senate , to be absent from the ceremony . during a change of administrations , a cabinet secretary of the new administration could be confirmed by the senate and installed prior to the inauguration , or a cabinet secretary from the outgoing administration could remain in office until after the inauguration . in either case , the designated survivor would be absent from the ceremony . related precautions have been taken since the presidential inauguration of 2009. in that year , defense secretary robert m. gates , a george w. bush appointee who remained in office in the barrack h. obama administration , did not attend the inauguration ceremony . in 2013 , veterans affairs secretary eric shinseki stayed away from the swearing - in .
