groundwater , the water in aquifers accessible by wells , is a critical component of the u.s. water supply . it is important for both domestic and agricultural water needs , among other uses . nearly half of the nation 's population uses groundwater to meet daily needs ; in 2015 , about 149 million people ( 46 % of the nation 's population ) relied on groundwater for their domestic indoor and outdoor water supply . the greatest volume of groundwater used every day is for agriculture , specifically for irrigation . in 2015 , irrigation accounted for 69 % of the total fresh groundwater withdrawals in the united states . for that year , california pumped the most groundwater for irrigation , followed by arkansas , nebraska , idaho , texas , and kansas , in that order . groundwater also is used as a supply for mining , oil and gas development , industrial processes , livestock , and thermoelectric power , among other uses . congress generally has deferred management of u.s. groundwater resources to the states , and there is little indication that this practice will change . for example , several bills introduced in the 115th congress contain provisions that would direct that the federal government recognizes that aspects of groundwater , such as the connection between surface water and groundwater , be consistent with state water laws ( surface water includes streams , rivers , lakes , ponds , and is not groundwater or atmospheric water , such as rain or snow ) . those same bills also would prohibit the federal government from requiring the transfer of water rights to the united states or obtaining a water right in the name of the united states as a condition for receiving , renewing , amending , or extending `` any permit , approval , license , lease , allotment , easement , right - of - way , or other land use or occupancy agreement . . in addition , these bills contain language asserting that the legislation would not alter certain reserved rights associated with federal and tribal lands . congress , various states , and other stakeholders recently have focused on the potential for using surface water to recharge aquifers and the ability to recover stored groundwater when needed . some see aquifer recharge , storage , and recovery as a replacement or complement to surface water reservoirs , and there is interest in how federal agencies can support these efforts . in the congressional context , there is interest in the potential for federal efforts to facilitate state , local , and private groundwater management efforts ( e.g . , management of federal reservoir releases to allow for groundwater recharge by local utilities ) . the two primary federal water resources agencies are the u.s. bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) . no significant federal restrictions apply to reclamation 's authorities to deliver water for purposes of aquifer recharge , storage , and recovery . usace authorities also do not contain restrictions on the nonfederal use for groundwater recharge of water stored or released from usace reservoirs . both agencies acknowledge that some state restrictions affect the use of the delivered or stored waters for groundwater activities . some legislative proposals would provide the agencies with additional directives and mechanisms regarding their authority to support nonfederal groundwater recharge . other federal agencies support activities that inform groundwater management . for example , the u.s. geological survey monitors and reports groundwater conditions across the country , develops groundwater models and software tools for characterizing aquifers , and provides long - and short - term forecasts of changing groundwater conditions as part of local and regional groundwater studies . the national aeronautics and space administration and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration also make observations and collect data that are relevant to groundwater monitoring and assessment . the u.s. department of agriculture collects groundwater data related to irrigation . long - term changes to the climate affecting the united states , particularly rising temperatures and changes in the patterns , quantities , and type of precipitation ( i.e . , rain versus snow ) , could affect the availability of groundwater in the future . other factors , such as changes to land use , irrigation practices , and patterns of water consumption , also may influence groundwater supplies .
