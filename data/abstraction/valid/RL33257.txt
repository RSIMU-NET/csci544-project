health savings accounts ( hsas ) are one way people can pay for unreimbursed medical expenses ( deductibles , copayments , and services not covered by insurance ) on a tax - advantaged basis . hsas can be established and funded by eligible individuals when they have a qualifying high - deductible health plan and no other health plan , with some exceptions . for 2012 , the deductible for self - only coverage must be at least $ 1,200 ( with an annual out - of - pocket limit not exceeding $ 6,050 ) ; the deductible for family coverage must be at least $ 2,400 ( with an annual out - of - pocket limit not exceeding $ 12,100 ) . the annual hsa contribution limit in 2012 for individuals with self - only coverage is $ 3,100 ; for family coverage , it is $ 6,250 . individuals who are at least 55 years of age but not yet enrolled in medicare may contribute an additional $ 1,000 . the tax advantages of hsas can be significant for some people : contributions are deductible ( or excluded from income that is taxable if made by employers ) , withdrawals are not taxed if used for medical expenses , and account earnings are tax - exempt . unused balances may accumulate without limit . hsas and the accompanying high - deductible health plans are one form of what some call `` consumer - driven health plans . . one objective of these plans is to encourage individuals and families to set money aside for their health care expenses . another is to give them a financial incentive for spending health care dollars prudently . still another goal is to give them the means to pay for health care services of their own choosing , without constraint by insurers or employers . since hsas are still relatively new ( they have been authorized for less than six years ) , the extent to which they will further these objectives is not yet known with any assurance , notwithstanding some early data . this report is limited to a summary of the principal rules governing hsas , covering such matters as eligibility , qualifying health insurance , contributions , and withdrawals . the major changes to hsas in 2011 were a result of provisions in the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) . these include changes to the definition of qualified expenses and increases to the penalty for distributions for non - qualified expenses . these are discussed in greater detail in this report . this report will be updated as the rules change , either by legislation or regulatory action .
