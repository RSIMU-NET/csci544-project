on may 10 , 2012 , jp morgan disclosed that it had lost more than $ 2 billion by trading financial derivatives . jamie dimon , ceo and chairman of jp morgan , reported that the bank 's chief investment office ( cio ) executed the trades to hedge the firm 's overall credit exposure as part of the bank 's asset liability management program ( alm ) . the cio operated within the depository subsidiary of jp morgan , although its offices were in london . the funding for the trades came from what jp morgan characterized as excess deposits , which are the difference between deposits held by the bank and its commercial loans . the trading losses resulted from an attempt to unwind a previous hedge investment , although the precise details remain unconfirmed . the losses occurred in part because the cio chose to place a new counter - hedge position , rather than simply unwind the original position . in 2007 and 2008 , jp morgan had bought an index tied to credit default swaps on a broad index of high - grade corporate bonds . in general , this index would tend to protect jp morgan if general economic conditions worsened ( or systemic risk increased ) because the perceived health of high - grade firms would tend to deteriorate with the economy . in 2011 , the cio decided to change the firm 's position by implementing a new counter trade . because this new trade was not identical to the earlier trades , it introduced basis risk and market risk , among other potential problems . it is this second `` hedge on a hedge '' that is responsible for the losses in 2012. several financial regulators are responsible for overseeing elements of the jp morgan trading losses . the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) is the primary prudential regulator of federally chartered depository banks and their alm activities , including the cio of jp morgan , even though it is located in london . the federal reserve is the prudential regulator of jp morgan 's holding company , although it would tend to defer to the primary prudential regulators of the firm 's subsidiaries for significant regulation of those entities . the federal reserve also regulates systemic risk aspects of large financial firms such as jp morgan . the cio must comply with federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) regulations because it is part of the insured depository . the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) oversees jp morgan 's required disclosures to the firm 's stockholders regarding material risks and losses such as the trades . the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) regulates trading in swaps and financial derivatives . the heads of these agencies coordinate through the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) , which is chaired by the secretary of treasury . the trading losses may have implications for a number of financial regulatory issues . for example , should the exemption to the volcker rule for hedging be interpreted broadly enough to encompass general portfolio hedges like the jp morgan trades , or should hedging be limited to more specific risks ? . are current regulations of large financial firms the appropriate balance to address perceptions that some firms are too - big - to - fail ? . the trading losses raise concerns about the calculation and reporting of risk by large financial firms . jp morgan changed its value at risk ( var ) model during the time of the trading losses . some are concerned that var models may not adequately address potential risks . some are concerned that the change in reporting of the var at jp morgan 's cio may not have provided adequate disclosures of the potential risks that jp morgan faced . such disclosures are governed by securities laws .
