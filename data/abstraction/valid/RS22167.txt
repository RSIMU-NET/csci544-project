in gonzales v. raich , the supreme court was presented with a conflict between california 's state law , permitting the medicinal use of marijuana , and the federal controlled substances act ( csa ) . the ninth circuit had found the federal law unconstitutional `` as applied , '' concluding that its enforcement against medicinal users was beyond congress 's enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce . the supreme court reversed , concluding that congress had a rational basis for concluding that leaving home - consumed marijuana outside federal control would substantially affect conditions in the interstate market . the court , in reaching its decision , specifically relied on wickard v. filburn ( 1942 ) , which held that congress could aggregate the impact of individual actors on the interstate market to find a substantial impact on interstate commerce .
