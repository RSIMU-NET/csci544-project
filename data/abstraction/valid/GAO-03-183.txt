this report addresses the relationship between medicare skilled nursing facility ( snf ) payments and the costs of treating medicare patients in freestanding snfs , as well as the effect of medicare snf payments on the financial condition of these facilities , and the relationship between medicare snf payments and the costs of treating patients in hospital - based snfs , as well as the factors that may account for cost differences between hospital - based and freestanding snfs . under the prospective payment system ( pps ) , most freestanding snfs medicare payments substantially exceeded the costs of caring for medicare patients , contributing to facilities ' overall positive financial condition . in 1999 , the first full year under the pps , the median freestanding snf medicare margin -- a measure that compares medicare payments with medicare costs -- was slightly over 8 percent . by 2000 , when the temporary payment increases authorized by the congress started to take effect , the median medicare margin had risen to almost 19 percent . however , nearly one - quarter of snfs in 2000 had medicare margins exceeding 30 percent , while about one - fifth had negative medicare margins ; that is , the payments they received from medicare did not cover their costs of providing care . medicare margins were higher for freestanding snfs affiliated with large , for - profit nursing home chains and for those with high occupancy . the median snf total margin -- which reflects total revenues and costs across all patients -- was 1.3 percent in 1999 and 1.8 percent in 2000. a snf 's total margin tended to be higher when its medicare margin was higher despite the fact that , in most snfs , medicare 's share of patient days was small . the total margins for freestanding snfs tended to be lower when a higher proportion of a snf 's patients had their care paid for by medicaid . unlike freestanding snfs , about 90 percent of hospital - based snfs reported significantly negative medicare margins after medicare 's new snf payment system was launched . the median hospital - based snf medicare margin was -- 53 percent in 1999. under the pps , per diem payments to hospital - based snfs dropped considerably , reflecting the change from payments based on a facility 's own costs to fixed payments based on average costs for all facilities . at the same time , hospital - based snfs reported per diem costs rose from 1997 through 1999. this is in contrast to the experience of freestanding snfs , which had lower per diem medicare costs than hospital - based snfs prior to the pps and reduced their costs further after the shift to the pps . the higher medicare costs reported by hospital - based snfs may stem in part from differences in services provided to patients . the higher costs may also reflect the historical allocation of overhead costs to the snf from the hospital , an accounting practice that , while consistent with the payment incentives under the prior cost - based reimbursement system , means that hospital - based snfs reported costs should be treated cautiously .
