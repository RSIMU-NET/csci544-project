the united states has made great progress in improving working conditions since the construction of the empire state building . yet , since the early 1990s , over 50,000 workers have died from work - related accidents and millions experience work - related injuries or illnesses each year . the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) is the primary federal agency responsible for protecting workplace safety and health . gao was asked to assess how well osha was able to target its enforcement resources on hazardous worksites , measure its accomplishments , and ensure inspection staff quality . osha has taken important steps toward targeting its enforcement resources on hazardous worksites , measure its accomplishments , and enhance the professionalism of its staff . however , these systems could be strengthened by better information and mechanisms that would make targeting efforts more efficient , measurement more precise , and training efforts more effective . osha 's targeting processes have not fully ensured that it identifies hazardous worksites for priority inspection because its worksite - targeting programs lack the necessary data to effectively identify high - hazard worksites or those with hazards under osha 's jurisdiction . also , osha 's measurement efforts did not accurately demonstrate its impact on workplace safety and health because , for example , it used national data on injuries and illnesses to measure its progress in achieving strategic goals even though only 31 states are covered by these goals . finally , osha 's efforts to enhance the quality of its inspection workforce have the potential to improve enforcement , but the anticipated outcomes could be jeopardized by a lack of necessary mechanisms , such as a training directive that reflects current plans , or a comprehensive database that tracks training or skills obtained by inspection staff .
