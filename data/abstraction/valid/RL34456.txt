a presidential transition is a unique time in america and holds the promise of opportunity , as well as a possible risk to the nation 's security interests . the 2008-2009 election marks the first presidential transition in the post - 9 / 11 era , and is of concern to many national security observers . while changes in administration during u.s. involvement in national security related activities are not unique to the 2008-2009 election , many observers suggest that the current security climate and recent acts of terrorism by individuals wishing to influence national elections and change foreign policies portend a time of increased risk to the current presidential transition period . whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm the nation 's security interests during the 2008-2009 election , or the new president experiences a relatively peaceful period during the transition , many foreign and domestic policy and security challenges will await the new administration . how the new president recognizes and responds to these challenges will depend heavily on the planning and learning that occurs prior to the inauguration . actions can be taken by the outgoing president and president - elect that may ameliorate decision - making activities in the new administration . whether an incident of national security significance occurs just before or soon after the presidential transition , the actions or inactions of the outgoing administration may have a long - lasting effect on the new president 's ability to effectively safeguard u.s. interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president . this report discusses historical national - security related presidential transition activities , provides a representative sampling of national security issues the next administration may encounter , and offers considerations and options relevant to each of the five phases of the presidential transition period . each phase has distinct challenges and opportunities for the incoming administration , the outgoing administration , and congress . this report will be updated as needed .
