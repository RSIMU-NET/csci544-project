federal agencies have used time - and - materials ( t & m ) contracts to purchase billions of dollars in services . these contracts are risky because the government bears the risk of cost overruns . effective february 2007 , the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) was revised , pursuant to a statutory change , to allow t & m contracts to be used to acquire commercial services under far part 12 , which uses a streamlined procurement process . certain safeguards were included in far part 12 , including a requirement that contracting officers prepare a detailed determination and findings ( d & f ) that no other contract type is suitable . based on a mandate to review the use of t & m contracts for commercial services , we assessed agencies ' reported use of such contracts and what they acquired , the degree to which agencies complied with the new safeguards , and the applicability of the safeguards to general services administration ( gsa ) schedule contracts . gao reviewed contracts and orders at dod and civilian agencies and spoke with contracting officials . from february 2007 to december 2008 , agencies reported using commercial item procedures under far part 12 to buy a variety of services through t & m contracts ; examples include emergency nursing services on indian reservations and gunsmith services for the fbi . the reported value of these contracts was $ 4.4 billion -- or less than 1 percent of the total federal dollars obligated for services during this period . of the $ 4.4 billion , $ 3.1 billion had gone through gsa 's schedules program . gao identified about another $ 6 billion , in addition to the $ 3.1 billion , in t & m obligations for commercial services under gsa schedule contracts . the reliability of the data reported as t & m contracts using far part 12 procedures is questionable . of the 149 contracts gao reviewed , 28 had been miscoded as acquiring commercial services or as t & m contracts . another issue that indicates a potential underreporting of t & m contracts for commercial services is that contracting officials across the agencies had the mistaken impression that the fixed labor rate in t & m contracts makes these contracts fixed - price . gao raised this issue with officials from the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) -- chair of the federal acquisition regulatory council -- who agreed that clarification on what constitutes a fixed - price versus labor hour contract would be beneficial . further , gao found that contracting officials had different opinions of what generally constitutes a commercial service . some viewed services intended to meet a specific government requirement as noncommercial , while others viewed similar services as commercial . the part 12 d & f was rarely used for the contracts gao reviewed . the d & f must incorporate four elements , such as a description of the market research conducted . of 82 contracts reviewed that were explicitly subject to this d & f requirement , only 5 included all the required elements , and 9 partially met the requirement . of the remaining contracts , 33 had no d & f at all and 35 included the less stringent d & f applicable to noncommercial t & m services . gao found a general lack of awareness of the part 12 d & f requirement at the agencies in this review . agencies ' internal management and legal reviews generally did not detect the failure to include the d & f . ofpp officials expressed concern about the lack of compliance with the d & f requirement . the part 12 d & f requirement has not been applied to the gsa schedules program . gsa officials stated that the gsa administrator has discretion about what procedures apply to the program . in a legal opinion to gao on whether the statutory changes regarding t & m contracts for commercial services apply to the schedules program , gsa concluded that the applicability is uncertain but stated that existing regulations satisfy concerns about use of t & m under the schedules program . gao notes that these regulations do not require the same level of detailed analysis as does the part 12 d & f . further , there is no indication that the statutory requirements can not apply to items or services under the schedules program . gsa officials said they are in the process of developing a part 12 d & f for the entire schedules program , but it is not clear how this d & f will act as a safeguard when t & m orders are used .
