terrorist attacks on u.s. chemical facilities could damage public health and the economy . while the environmental protection agency ( epa ) formerly led federal efforts to ensure chemical facility security , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is now the lead federal agency coordinating efforts to protect these facilities from terrorist attacks . gao reviewed dhs 's actions to develop a strategy to protect the chemical industry , dhs 's actions to assist in the industry 's security efforts and coordinate with epa , industry security initiatives and challenges , and dhs 's authorities and whether additional legislation is needed to ensure chemical plant security . gao interviewed dhs , epa , and industry officials , among others . as part of a national framework for protecting the chemical sector , dhs is developing a chemical sector - specific plan . the plan is intended to , among other things , describe dhs 's ongoing efforts and future plans to coordinate with federal , state , and local agencies and the private sector ; identify chemical facilities to include in the sector , assess their vulnerabilities , and prioritize them ; and develop programs to prevent , deter , mitigate , and recover from attacks on chemical facilities . dhs did not estimate when the plan will be completed . to date , dhs has taken a number of actions aimed at protecting the chemical sector from terrorist attacks . dhs has identified 3,400 facilities that , if attacked , could pose the greatest hazard to human life and health and has initiated programs to assist the industry and local communities in protecting chemical facilities . for example , the buffer zone protection program assists facility owners and local law enforcement with improving the security of areas surrounding plants . dhs also coordinates with the chemical sector coordinating council , an industry - led group that acts as a liaison for the chemical sector , and with epa and other federal agencies . the chemical industry is voluntarily addressing plant security , but faces challenges in preparing against terrorism . some industry associations require member companies to assess plants ' vulnerabilities , develop and implement plans to mitigate vulnerabilities , and have a third party verify that security measures were implemented . other associations have developed security guidelines and other tools to encourage their members to address security . while voluntary efforts are under way , industry officials said that they face challenges in preparing facilities against terrorism , including high costs and limited guidance on how much security is adequate . because existing laws provide dhs with only limited authority to address security at chemical facilities , it has relied primarily on the industry 's voluntary security efforts . however , the extent to which companies are addressing security is unclear . unlike epa , for example , which requires drinking water facilities to improve their security , dhs does not have the authority to require chemical facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and implement security measures . therefore , dhs can not ensure that facilities are taking these actions . dhs has stated that its existing authorities do not permit it to effectively regulate the chemical industry , and that the congress should enact federal requirements for chemical facilities . many stakeholders agreed -- as gao concluded in 2003- - that additional legislation placing federal security requirements on chemical facilities is needed . however , stakeholders had mixed views on the contents of any legislation , such as requirements that plants substitute safer chemicals and processes that potentially could reduce the risks present at these facilities .
