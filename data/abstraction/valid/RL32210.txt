the 108th congress did not complete action on legislation to reauthorize the block grant oftemporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , instead adopting short - term extensions . thelatest extension funds the program through march 31 , 2005. though welfare reauthorization failedto receive final action , a bill ( h.r . 4 ) did pass the house and a substitute measure wasreported from the senate finance committee . the differences in the two bills highlight some of thecontentious issues in the reauthorization debate . the house - passed and senate finance committee bills were very similar in terms of how they would continue funding under the tanf program . both bills would have extended basic tanffunding at current levels ( $ 16.6 billion for the 50 states , the district of columbia , and the territories ) through fy2008 and extended supplemental grants provided to 17 states through fy2007 . both billsalso would have provided new , categorical grants for marriage promotion activities . the majordifference in the funding provisions of the two bills was how they provided extra contingency ( recession - related ) funding to the states . the house bill essentially extended the current law fundthat provides matching grants to states that experience high and increased unemployment rates andfood stamp caseloads . the senate finance committee bill eliminated the requirements that statesexpend additional money to access contingency funds , and instead based extra funding on the costof increased caseloads for states that meet revised unemployment or food stamp caseload criteria . the two bills would have substantially revised tanf work participation standards that states must meet or be subject to a financial penalty . under current law , 50 % of tanf families with anadult or minor household head must participate , though the 50 % rate is reduced by caseloadreductions that have occurred since welfare reform . both versions of h.r . 4 wouldhave raised this standard to 70 % , though under both bills the standard could have been reducedthrough credits ( though the credits differ between the two bills ) . they also both eliminated aseparate 90 % participation rate requirement for two - parent families . both bills would have raisedthe minimum hours required of family members to be considered full participants , though the houseraised them more than did the senate finance committee bill . the bills also differed in the activitiescountable toward the participation standards : the house narrowed the list of activities countable , requiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work , community service , or work experienceprograms except for a short ( usually three month ) period when states may define what counts asactivities themselves . the senate finance committee bill kept all activities on the current law list , and also allowed states to count activities on an expanded list for three months ( six months in somecircumstances ) . both bills included non - tanf provisions relating to child support enforcement , responsible `` fatherhood '' programs , and transitional medical assistance ( not addressed herein ) . this report willnot be updated .
