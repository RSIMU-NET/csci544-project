through its commodity program , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) provides commodity foods at no cost to schools taking part in the national school meals programs . commodities include raw ground beef , cheese , poultry , and fresh produce . like federal food safety agencies , the commodity program has taken steps designed to reduce microbial contamination that can result in severe illness . gao was asked to review the extent to which the program 's purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination differ from federal regulations , the extent to which specifications for raw ground beef differ from those imposed by some other large purchasers , and examples of schools ' practices to help ensure that food is not contaminated . gao compared the program 's purchasing specifications to federal regulations for food sold commercially , gathered information from seven large purchasers of ground beef , and interviewed officials in 18 school districts in five states , selected in part because of their purchasing practices . for 7 of the approximately 180 commodity foods offered to schools , usda 's commodity program has established purchasing specifications with respect to microbial contamination that are more stringent than the federal regulations for the same foods in the commercial marketplace . for example , the commodity program will not purchase ground beef that tests positive for salmonella bacteria , while federal regulations for commercially available ground beef tolerate the presence of a certain amount of salmonella . program officials told gao that more - stringent specifications are needed for certain foods they purchase because they go to populations , such as very young children , at a higher risk for serious complications from foodborne illnesses . however , the program has not developed more - stringent specifications for some pathogens and foods that have been associated with foodborne illness , such as raw , whole chickens cut into eight pieces that the program provides to schools . program officials told gao they selected products for more - stringent specifications based on their views of the safety risk associated with different types of food ; developed these specifications through informal consultation with a variety of groups ; and did not document the process they used . the commodity program 's purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for raw ground beef at various processing stages are generally similar to those of some other large purchasers . the specifications used by both the commodity program and these large purchasers are more stringent than federal regulations . usda 's commodity program has several purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination for raw ground beef production , process oversight , and testing . for example , the program requires beef suppliers to take actions to reduce the level of pathogens at least twice while beef carcasses are processed . some large purchasers of raw ground beef have purchasing specifications similar to the commodity program , although they differ in certain details . for example , of the seven large purchasers that gao interviewed , five said they require their beef suppliers to take between two and seven actions to reduce pathogen levels on beef carcasses . while all school districts must follow certain food safety practices to participate in federally funded school meal programs , school districts that gao interviewed have also implemented a number of additional food safety practices . federal regulations require school districts to develop written food safety plans and to obtain food safety inspections of their schools , among other things . in addition , some of the school districts gao interviewed have established purchasing specifications related to microbial contamination or food safety for food they purchase in the commercial marketplace , among other things . nevertheless , few of the district officials gao interviewed were aware that the commodity program 's purchasing specifications for seven products are more stringent than federal regulatory requirements . officials from half of the districts gao interviewed said that greater knowledge of these differences would affect their future purchasing decisions by enabling them to make more informed choices . gao recommends , among other things , that usda strengthen its oversight of food purchased by its commodity program , by establishing a more systematic and transparent process to determine whether additional specifications should be developed related to microbial contamination . usda generally agreed with gao 's recommendations and provided technical comments .
