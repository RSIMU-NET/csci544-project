the federal government is the world 's largest and most complex entity , with about $ 3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2010 that fund a broad array of programs and operations . gao 's long - term simulations of the federal budget show -- absent policy change -- growing deficits accumulating to an unsustainable increase in debt . while the spending side is driven by rising health care costs and demographics , other areas should also be scrutinized . in addition , there are significant performance and management challenges that the federal government needs to confront . gao was asked to testify on how the provisions of the government performance and results act ( gpra ) modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) could , if effectively implemented , help address these challenges . our statement is based on our past and ongoing work on gpra implementation , as well as our recently issued reports identifying opportunities to reduce potential duplication in government programs , save tax dollars , and enhance revenue ; and updating our list of government operations at high risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement , or the need for broad - based transformation . as required by gprama , gao will periodically evaluate implementation of the act and report to congress on its findings and recommendations . gao 's past and ongoing work illustrates how gprama could help address government challenges in five areas : 1 ) adopting a more coordinated and crosscutting approach to achieving meaningful results . gprama could help inform reexamination or restructuring efforts and lead to more efficient and economical service delivery in overlapping program areas by identifying the various agencies and federal activities -- including spending programs , regulations , and tax expenditures -- that contribute to crosscutting outcomes . these program areas could include multiple employment and training programs or numerous teacher quality initiatives , among others . 2 ) addressing weaknesses in major management functions . agencies need more effective management capabilities to better implement their programs and policies . gprama requires long - term goals to improve management functions in five key areas : financial , human capital , information technology , procurement and acquisition , and real property . gao 's work has highlighted opportunities for improvements in each of these areas and aspects of several of them are on the gao high - risk list . 3 ) ensuring performance information is both useful and used in decision making . agencies need to consider the differing needs of various stakeholders , including congress , to ensure that performance information will be both useful and used . for performance information to be useful , it must be complete , accurate , valid , timely , and easy to use . yet decision makers often do not have the quality performance information they need to improve results . to help address this need , gprama requires disclosure of information about accuracy and validity , data on crosscutting areas , and quarterly reporting on priority goals on a publicly available web site . 4 ) instilling sustained leadership commitment and accountability for achieving results . perhaps the single most important element of successful management improvement initiatives is the demonstrated commitment of top leaders , as shown by their personal involvement in reform efforts . gprama assigns responsibilities to a chief operating officer and performance improvement officer in each agency to improve agency management and performance . 5 ) engaging congress in identifying management and performance issues to address . in order for performance improvement initiatives to be useful to congress for its decision making , garnering congressional buy - in on what to measure and how to present this information is critical . gao has previously noted the importance of considering congress a partner in shaping agency goals at the outset . gprama significantly enhances requirements for agencies to consult with congress .
