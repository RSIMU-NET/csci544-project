in 1996 , congress established the airport privatization pilot program ( appp ; 49 u.s.c . §47134 ; section 149 of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 , p.l . 104-264 ) to increase access to sources of private capital for airport development and to make airports more efficient , competitive , and financially viable . participation in the program has been very limited , in good part because major stakeholders have different , if not contradictory , objectives and interests . only two u.s. commercial service airports have completed the privatization process established under the appp . one of those , stewart international airport in new york state , subsequently reverted to public ownership . luis muñoz marín international airport in san juan , puerto rico , is now the only airport with a private operator under the provisions of the appp . as of august 2017 , there are three active applicants in the appp : hendry county airglades airport in clewiston , fl ; westchester county airport in white plains , ny ; and st. louis lambert international airport in st. louis , mo . increasing interest in airport privatization is likely to require a number of significant policy changes , including the following : making privatization more attractive to public - sector owners by facilitating the use of privatization revenue for non - airport purposes . providing similar tax treatment to bonds issued by public - sector and private - sector airport operators , as public - sector operators now have access to less costly long - term finance than private operators . easing requirements for private owners to comply with assurances previously made by public - sector owners to obtain federal airport improvement program ( aip ) grants . accelerating the application and approval procedures for the appp .
