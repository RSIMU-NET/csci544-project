the u.s. aviation system is one of the safest in the world , but fatal accidents , though rare , continue to occur . as a result of recent accidents and related ntsb findings , faa announced a call to action plan in june 2009 to , among other things , increase air carrier participation in voluntary safety programs . in 2010 , congress passed the airline safety and federal aviation administration extension act , which , in part , called for faa to better manage safety risks . as a result , faa developed a concerted strategy to implement new safety programs , including increasing air carrier use of voluntary safety programs and advancing the use of sms . faa is implementing smsa data - driven , risk - based safety approach that involves establishing the necessary organizational structures , accountabilities , policies , and procedures . the implementation of sms heightens the importance of obtaining and using high - quality aviation safety data . this statement is based on gaos previous work and focuses on how faa uses data to manage safety risks , how faa ensures it has quality data to manage risk , and the challenges faa faces in using data to better manage safety risks . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) uses data reactively and proactively to prevent accidents and manage safety risks . for instance , since 1998 , faa has partnered with the airline industry to identify precursors and contributing factors , and ensure that efforts to improve safety focus on the most prevalent categories of accidents and formulate an intervention strategy designed to reduce recurrences . although faa plans to continue using data reactively to understand the causes of accidents and incidents , as part of its adoption of safety management systems ( sms ) , it is shifting to a proactive approach in which it analyzes data to identify and mitigate risks before they result in accidents . implementing systems and processes that capture accurate and complete data are critical for faa to determine the magnitude of safety issues , assess their potential impacts , identify their root causes , and effectively address and mitigate them . though faa has put in place data quality controls , weaknesses remain in some areas . in particular , several faa databases gao reviewed in 2010 did not have a managerial review process prior to data entryan important control that helps ensure data accuracy and completeness . in response to gaos recommendations , faa is taking steps to address its data weaknesses , but vulnerabilities that remain potentially limit the datas usefulness for safety analysis . faa also continues to experience data - related challenges , including limitations with the analysis it conducts and the data it collects and the absence of data in some areas . for example , faa does not have a process to track or assess runway excursions , which occur when an aircraft veers off or overruns a runway . runway excursions can be as dangerous as runway incursions , which occur when an unauthorized aircraft , vehicle , or person is on a runway , and faa has tracked runway incursions for years . gao previously recommended that faa develop and implement plans to track and assess runway excursions . faa agreed and is currently developing a program to collect and analyze runway excursion data and is drafting an order to set out the definitions and risk assessment processes for categorizing and analyzing the data . however , according to gaos review of faas plans , it will be several years before faa has obtained enough detailed information about these incidents to assess risks . similarly , gao has found that efforts to address the occurrence of safety incidents in ramp areas were hindered by the lack of data on the nature , extent , and cost of such incidents and accidents . faa collects no comprehensive data on incidents in ramp areas , and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) does not routinely collect data on ramp accidents unless they result in serious injury or substantial aircraft damage . faas lack of ramp incident data means that faa is unable to assess the risk of catastrophic accidents in this area . faa agreed with gaos recommendation to extend oversight to ramp areas but noted that it already provides oversight through its oversight of airlines . faa expects to further enhance that oversight through its proposed ruling to require airports with air carrier operations to establish a safety management system . gao has made a number of recommendations to address data quality weaknesses . faa concurred with most of these recommendations and in some cases has taken steps toward addressing them .
