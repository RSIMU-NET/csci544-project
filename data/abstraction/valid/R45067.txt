the children 's hospitals graduate medical education ( chgme ) program provides direct financial support to children 's hospitals to train medical residents and fellows . the program is administered by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and is authorized in section 340e of the public health service act ( phsa ) . chgme receives annual discretionary appropriations , and its funding has increased in recent years . the program was funded at $ 315 million in fy2018 and will receive $ 325 million in fy2019 . hospitals typically receive support for graduate medical education ( gme ) through medicare , and those payments are provided to hospitals based on their medicare patient volume . because the medicare program is used primarily by people who are over the age of 65 , and children 's hospitals treat primarily people below the age of 18 , children 's hospitals have low medicare patient volume and receive few medicare gme payments . prior to the chgme program , advocates argued that the lack of direct federal support for gme in children 's hospitals impeded the development of the pediatric workforce . program proponents argued that children 's hospitals , rather than general hospitals , are more likely to have the patient volume necessary to train pediatric subspecialists . since the program was created in 1999 , the size of the pediatric subspecialty workforce has increased . the chgme program supports the training of nearly half of general pediatricians and more than half of all pediatric subspecialists . in the most recent year for which final training data are available ( academic year 2016-2017 ) , the program provided financial support to more than 7,100 medical residents and fellows . in fy2017 , the program supported training at 58 free - standing children 's hospitals located in 29 states , the district of columbia , and puerto rico . the program 's appropriations were reauthorized in 2018 by p.l . 115-241 , the dr. benjy frances brooks children 's hospital gme support reauthorization act of 2018 , which extended the program 's authorizations of appropriations until fy2023 and increased the amount authorized to $ 325 million . under prior law , the program 's authorization had been set to expire at the end of fy2018 and the amount authorized had been $ 300 million . the reauthorization did not include substantive changes to the program . the president 's budget for fy2019 proposed to eliminate funding for this program ; instead , it proposed that chgme funds be combined with other sources of gme support , which would require new legislation .
