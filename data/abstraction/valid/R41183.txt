the united states witnessed increased attention to sex offender management policy at the federal , state , and local levels beginning in the 1990s . as a result , laws have been enacted which impose a variety of post - incarceration controls on sex offenders , including but not limited to registration and community notification requirements , civil commitment , global positioning system ( gps ) monitoring and tracking , and residency restrictions . two recent u.s. supreme court cases — united states v. carr and united states v. comstock — involved challenges to such controls passed at the federal level . this report provides background information and examines relevant case law , with a particular focus on registration requirements and residency restrictions . legislation enacted to protect the community from sex offenders is not a novel concept . at the federal level , congress has passed a series of laws adopting the use of sex offender registries and community notification for sexually violent offenders and those committing offenses against children . most recently , as part of the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 ( p.l . 109-248 ) , congress passed the sex offender registration and notification act ( sorna ) . the statute categorizes sex offenders into three tiers , with progressively longer and more scrutinizing registration requirements for each tier . proponents argue that post - incarceration restrictions are necessary to reduce a demonstrably high recidivism rate , safeguard potential victims , and assist law enforcement in tracking offenders . opponents question the restrictions ' practical impact on recidivism rates and argue that the controls may be disproportionate to the crimes committed . as some commentators question the efficacy of these controls , courts are assessing their constitutionality . defendants have invoked a myriad of constitutional grounds in challenges to post - conviction restrictions . with some exceptions , federal courts have generally upheld the restrictions . for example , in a 2003 case , smith v. doe , the u.s. supreme court upheld alaska 's sex offender registration requirements against an ex post facto challenge . applying smith , federal courts of appeals have also generally upheld the federal registration law against such challenges . however , as restrictions have increased in both number and severity , questions remain . is it possible that a statute 's purpose or effect is so punitive as to negate a legislature 's apparent non - punitive intent ? . under what circumstances may these restrictions be applied ? . can states and localities apply these restrictions retroactively ? . these are some of the issues likely to emerge in pending and future federal court cases .
