the devastation caused by the gulf coast hurricanes presents the nation with unprecedented challenges as well as opportunities to reexamine shared responsibility among all levels of government . all levels of government , together with the private and nonprofit sectors , will need to play a critical role in the process of choosing what , where , and how to rebuild . agreeing on what the costs are , what federal funds have been provided , and who will bear the costs will be key to the overall rebuilding effort . this testimony places federal assistance provided to date in the context of damage estimates for the gulf coast , and discusses key federal programs that provide rebuilding assistance to the gulf coast states . in doing so , gao highlights aspects of rebuilding likely to place continued demands on federal resources . gao visited the gulf coast region , reviewed state and local documents , and interviewed federal , state , and local officials . gao 's ongoing work on these issues focuses on the use of federal rebuilding funds and administration of federal programs in the gulf coast region . to respond to the gulf coast devastation , the federal government has already committed a historically high level of resources -- more than $ 116 billion -- through an array of grants , loan subsidies , and tax relief and incentives . a substantial portion of this assistance was directed to emergency assistance and meeting short - term needs arising from the hurricanes , leaving a smaller portion for longer - term rebuilding . to understand the long - term financial implications of gulf coast rebuilding , it is helpful to view potential federal assistance within the context of overall estimates of the damages incurred by the region . some estimates put capital losses at a range of $ 70 billion to more than $ 150 billion , while the state of louisiana estimated that the economic effect on its state alone could reach $ 200 billion . these estimates raise questions regarding how much additional assistance may be needed to help the gulf coast continue to rebuild , and who should be responsible for providing the related resources . demands for additional federal resources to rebuild the gulf coast are likely to continue . the bulk of federal rebuilding assistance provided to the gulf coast states funds two key programs -- the federal emergency management agency 's public assistance ( pa ) program and the department of housing and urban development 's community development block grant ( cdbg ) program . in addition to funding pa and cdbg , the federal government 's recovery and rebuilding assistance also includes payouts from the national flood insurance program as well as funds for levee restoration and repair , coastal wetlands and barrier islands restoration , and benefits provided through gulf opportunity zone tax expenditures . as states and localities continue to rebuild , there are difficult policy decisions that will confront congress about the federal government 's continued contribution to the rebuilding effort and the role it might play over the long - term in an era of competing priorities . gao 's ongoing and preliminary work on gulf coast rebuilding suggests the following questions : how much could it ultimately cost to rebuild the gulf coast and how much of this cost should the federal government bear ? . how effective are current funding delivery mechanisms -- such as pa and cdbg -- and should they be modified or supplemented by other mechanisms ? . what options exist to effectively build in federal oversight to accompany the receipt of federal funds , particularly as federal funding has shifted from emergency response to rebuilding ? . how can the federal government further partner with state and local governments and the nonprofit and private sectors to leverage public investment in rebuilding ? . what are the `` lessons learned '' from the gulf coast hurricanes , and what changes need to be made to help ensure a more timely and effective rebuilding effort in the future ? .
