in recent congresses , some members have expressed concern about the lack of information surrounding private fundraising for presidential libraries . those calling for additional regulation argue that more transparency could reduce potential conflicts of interest surrounding library contributions . contributions from foreign sources have also been the subject of debate . federal law and regulation are largely silent on contributions to presidential libraries . contributions to library fundraising organizations may be unlimited and can come from any otherwise lawful source . in addition , although certain aspects of library contributions are similar to campaign contributions , library contributions are not considered to be campaign contributions and are not subject to limits on amounts and funding sources specified in the federal election campaign act ( feca ) . in one of the few relatively recent regulatory changes affecting library contributions , the honest leadership and open government act ( hloga ) , enacted in the 110th congress , requires registered lobbyists to report their contributions to presidential libraries . however , non - lobbyists are not required to report their library contributions . library fundraising organizations must report certain information to the internal revenue service , but those organizations are not required to publicize information about individual donors . library - fundraising issues emerged during senate consideration of hillary clinton 's nomination as secretary of state , amid concerns about fundraising for former president clinton 's library and other initiatives . calls for additional disclosure , however , are not new . during the 110th congress , the house passed h.r . 1254 ( waxman ) , which would have required library fundraising organizations to file quarterly reports itemizing contributions of at least $ 200 and identifying donors . the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs reported an amended version of the bill , but the measure did not receive senate floor consideration . in the 111th congress , the house passed h.r . 36 ( towns ) in january 2009 ; that measure was virtually identical to the house - passed version of h.r . 1254 from the 110th congress . it did not advance in the senate . an additional disclosure measure , h.r . 775 ( duncan ) , which would also require reporting of donations of at least $ 200 , was introduced in the 112th congress , in february 2011. if congress wishes to pursue broader regulation of library fundraising , aspects of campaign finance policy may be a useful model . however , certain aspects of a campaign - finance disclosure model may invite controversy . this report provides an overview of recent policy issues and legislation surrounding library fundraising . it will be updated in the event of significant legislative activity .
