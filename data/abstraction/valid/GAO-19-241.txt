in december 2014 , congress enacted federal it acquisition reform legislation that included provisions related to ongoing federal data center consolidation efforts . omb 's federal chief information officer launched dcoi to build on prior data center consolidation efforts ; improve federal data centers ' performance ; and establish goals for inventory closures , cost savings and avoidances , and optimizing performance . the 2014 legislation included a provision for gao to annually review agencies ' data center inventories and strategies . accordingly , gao 's objectives were to evaluate agencies ' progress and plans for data center closures and cost savings ; assess agencies ' progress against omb 's data center optimization targets ; and identify effective agency practices for achieving data center closures , cost savings , and optimization progress . to do so , gao assessed the 24 dcoi agencies ' data center inventories as of august 2018 ; reviewed their reported cost savings documentation ; evaluated their data center optimization strategic plans ; and assessed their progress against omb 's established optimization targets . gao also solicited practices that selected agencies reported to be effective in meeting dcoi goals . the 24 agencies participating in the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) data center optimization initiative ( dcoi ) reported mixed progress toward achieving omb 's goals for closing data centers and realizing the associated savings by september 2018. as of august 2018 , 13 agencies reported that they had met , or had plans to meet , all of their omb - assigned closure goals by the deadline . however , 11 agencies reported that they did not have plans to meet their goals . further , 16 agencies reported that , as of august 2018 , they had met , or planned to meet , their cost savings targets , for a total of $ 2.36 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. this is about $ 0.38 billion less than omb 's dcoi savings goal of $ 2.7 billion . this shortfall is the result of 5 agencies reporting less in planned cost savings and avoidances in their dcoi strategic plans , as compared to their savings targets established for them by omb . three agencies did not have a cost savings target and did not report any achieved savings . in addition , the 24 agencies reported limited progress against omb 's five data center optimization targets for server utilization and automated monitoring , energy metering , power usage effectiveness , facility utilization , and virtualization . as of august 2018 , the agencies reported that 3 had met three targets , 9 had met one target , and 10 met none of the targets . two agencies did not have a basis to report on progress as they do not own any data centers . further , as of august 2018 , 20 agencies did not plan to meet all of omb 's fiscal year 2018 optimization goals . specifically , only 2 agencies reported plans to meet all applicable targets ; 6 reported that they did not plan to meet any of the targets ( see figure ) . we selected 6 agencies that had demonstrated success towards meeting their dcoi goals and those agencies reported a number of key practices that contributed to their efforts . the officials noted the importance of , among other things , obtaining executive leadership support for consolidation and optimization activities , employing an organization - wide communications plan , and focusing on data center closures . the officials also cited the use of past experience and lessons learned to inform improvements to future consolidation plans and processes . gao is making 36 recommendations to 22 agencies to improve performance against established dcoi goals . eleven agencies agreed with the recommendations , three did not fully agree , one disagreed , and seven neither agreed nor disagreed , as discussed in the report .
