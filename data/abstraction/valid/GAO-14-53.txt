nearly 7 million individuals aged 55 to 64- - more than 18 percent of the pre - medicare population -- lacked health insurance coverage in the first half of 2012. health insurance protects individuals from the risk of financial hardship when they need medical care , and uninsured individuals may refrain from seeking necessary care because of the cost . if they forgo medical care beforehand , these individuals may be in worse health and need costlier medical services after enrolling in medicare compared to those with prior insurance . gao was asked to review the effects of having prior health insurance coverage on medicare beneficiaries . this report examines the health status , program spending , and use of services of medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before medicare enrollment . to examine the effects of beneficiaries ' prior insurance coverage , gao used data from the health and retirement study and medicare claims to conduct two types of multivariate analysis . gao predicted probabilities of beneficiaries ' reporting being in good health or better and values for program spending and beneficiaries ' use of services . in comments on a draft of this report , the department of health and human services highlighted a key finding in gao 's report that beneficiaries with prior insurance used fewer or less costly medical services in medicare compared with those without prior insurance . beneficiaries with continuous health insurance coverage for approximately 6 years before enrolling in medicare were more likely than those without prior continuous insurance to report being in good health or better during the first 6 years in medicare . in particular , having prior continuous insurance raised the predicted probability that a beneficiary reported being in good health or better by nearly 6 percentage points during the first 6 years in medicare . beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had lower total program spending during the first year in medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance . specifically , during the first year in medicare , beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had approximately $ 2,300 , or 35 percent , less in average predicted total spending than those without prior continuous insurance . similarly , beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had lower institutional outpatient spending -- for example , spending for services provided in a hospital outpatient setting -- during the first and second years in medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance . in contrast , physician and other noninstitutional spending -- spending for services provided by physicians , clinical laboratories , free - standing ambulatory surgical centers , and other noninstitutional providers -- were similar during the early years in medicare for beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance . however , during the fourth and fifth years in medicare , beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had physician and other noninstitutional spending that was about 30 percent higher than beneficiaries without prior continuous insurance . beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had more physician office visits during the first 5 years in medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance . specifically , during the first 5 years in medicare , the difference in the average predicted number of physician office visits between beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 , or 23 to 46 percent . this utilization pattern may indicate that , even after medicare enrollment , beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance continued to access medical services differently from those without prior continuous insurance . the number of institutional outpatient visits was similar for beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance for the first 5 years after medicare enrollment . taken together , gao 's results show that , consistent with those of some other researchers , beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance used fewer or less costly medical services compared with beneficiaries without such insurance during the early years in medicare , because they either were in better health or were accustomed to accessing medical services differently . this suggests that the extent to which individuals enroll in private insurance before age 65 has implications for beneficiaries ' health status and medicare spending .
