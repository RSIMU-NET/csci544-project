derivatives are financial instruments that come in several different forms , including futures , options , and swaps . a derivative is a contract that derives its value from some underlying asset at a designated point in time . the derivative may be tied to a physical commodity , a stock index , an interest rate , or some other asset . derivatives played a role in the 2008 financial crisis in a variety of ways . the unmonitored buildup of derivatives positions in the largely unregulated `` over - the - counter '' ( otc ) market led many major financial institutions into large financial losses . possibly the best - known example of such losses was the insurance giant american international group ( aig ) , whose massive losses from selling credit - default swaps ultimately contributed to the need for government assistance . otc derivatives , prior to the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l . 111-203 ) , were traded bilaterally rather than cleared through a clearinghouse , and no reporting trail existed , which created uncertainty during the crisis over the web of exposures to large derivatives losses . the dodd - frank act aimed to address these policy concerns by bringing the swaps market into a regulatory framework based on that of the futures markets , which had long been regulated by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) . security - based swaps tied to equities or narrow - based credit indexes were placed under the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) within a similar framework . broadly , dodd - frank included five major reforms . it required the 1. clearing of certain swaps through a clearinghouse , entailing the posting of margin , or cash , to cover accumulating losses ; 2. trading of certain swaps on an exchange or swap execution facility ( an electronic trading platform ) , with the aim of increasing price transparency ; 3. reporting of all swaps transactions to a swaps data repository ( sdr ) to create an audit trail and more market data for regulators ; 4. registration of swap dealers and major swap participants , subjecting them to regulatory oversight ; and 5. establishment of margin and capital requirements by regulators for swaps that remain uncleared . parallel provisions were enacted for security - based swaps under the sec . in the 114th congress , several bills have been introduced , and two have been enacted as part of other legislation , impacting various aspects of swaps regulation largely stemming from dodd - frank . one of the provisions , originally in h.r . 1847 but enacted in p.l . 114-94 / h.r . 22 , removed a requirement added in dodd - frank that foreign regulators indemnify a u.s. - based sdr and the cftc for any expenses arising from litigation related to a request for market data ( with a parallel sec provision ) . the other provision , originally in h.r . 1317 but enacted in p.l . 114-113 / h.r . 2029 , created an exception for certain corporate affiliates of nonfinancial companies , dubbed `` centralized treasury units , '' to the clearing and exchange - trading requirements . the house has passed legislation , h.r . 2289 , that would reauthorize appropriations to carry out the commodity exchange act ( cea ; 7 u.s.c . §§1 et seq . ) — a process that historically has recurred every five years . the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition and forestry marked up and ordered to be reported s. 2917 which would also reauthorize such appropriations , as well as making other changes to the cea . s. 2917 and h.r . 2289 would each modify the definition of who is a financial entity — relevant for determining who must clear their swaps — but the bills do so in different ways . h.r . 2289 and s. 2917 would — in substantially identical ways — broaden the definition of bona fide hedging to allow anticipated , as well as current , risks to be hedged , likely increasing the number of swaps qualifying as hedges for position limits , registration requirements , and other purposes . h.r . 2289 , s. 2917 and s. 1560 also contain provisions to codify the deadline for brokers to deposit residual interest ( capital from a futures broker that temporarily makes up the difference for insufficient margin in a customer 's account ) as no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the following business day . h.r . 2289 ( but not s. 2917 ) includes measures that would increase required cost - benefit analysis by the cftc in rulemakings . h.r . 2289 ( but not s. 2917 ) would mandate that , starting 18 months from enactment , the swaps regulatory requirements of the eight largest foreign swaps markets must be considered comparable to those of the united states — unless the cftc were to issue a rule finding that any of those foreign jurisdictions ' requirements were not comparable to u.s. requirements .
