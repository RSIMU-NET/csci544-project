in the past several years , high oil and gas prices , instability in many oil - producing countries , and concerns about global climate change have heightened interest in ethanol and other biofuels as alternatives to petroleum products . reducing oil dependency is a goal shared by the united states and many countries in latin america and the caribbean , a region composed primarily of energy - importing countries . in the region , brazil stands out as an example of a country that has become a net exporter of energy , partially by increasing its production and use of sugar - based ethanol . on march 9 , 2007 , the united states and brazil , which together produce almost 70 % of the world 's ethanol , signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to promote greater cooperation on ethanol and other biofuels in the western hemisphere . the countries agreed to ( 1 ) advance research and development bilaterally , ( 2 ) help build domestic biofuels industries in third countries , and ( 3 ) work multilaterally to advance the global development of biofuels . many analysts maintain that the united states would benefit from having more energy producers in the region , while brazil stands to further its goal of developing ethanol into a globally traded commodity . in addition to these economic benefits , some analysts think that an ethanol partnership with brazil could help improve the u.s. image in latin america and lessen the influence of oil - rich venezuela under hugo ch√°vez . however , obstacles to increased u.s. - brazil cooperation on biofuels exist , including current u.s. tariffs on most brazilian ethanol imports . while some members of congress support greater hemispheric cooperation on biofuels development , others are wary of any cooperative efforts that might negatively affect u.s. ethanol producers . the energy diplomacy and security act of 2007 , s. 193 ( lugar ) , approved by the senate foreign relations committee on march 28 , 2007 , would increase hemispheric cooperation on energy . s. 1007 ( lugar ) , the united states - brazil energy cooperation pact of 2007 , calls for the same hemispheric cooperation groups as s. 193 , and directs the secretary of state to work with brazil and other western hemisphere countries to develop biofuels partnerships . h.res . 651 ( engel ) recognizes and supports the importance of the u.s. - brazil mou on biofuels . in the 109th congress , legislation was introduced that would have eliminated current tariffs on foreign ethanol , but in december 2006 , congress voted to extend the ethanol tariffs through december 31 , 2008 ( p.l . 109-432 ) . in the 110th congress , s. 1106 ( thune ) would extend those tariffs through 2011 , and h.r . 196 ( pomeroy ) would make the tariffs permanent . this report discusses the opportunities and barriers related to increasing u.s. cooperation with other countries in the hemisphere on biofuels development , focusing on the u.s. - brazil agreement . this report may be updated . for more information , see crs report rl33290 , fuel ethanol : background and public policy issues , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report rl33693 , latin america : energy supply , political developments , and u.s. policy approaches , by [ author name scrubbed ] , [ author name scrubbed ] , and [ author name scrubbed ] .
