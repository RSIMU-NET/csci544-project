through fiscal year 2010 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) permitted its 21 health care networks to develop their own methodologies for allocating resources to medical centers . these methodologies varied considerably . concerned that network methodologies were not fully transparent to va headquarters , in fiscal year 2011 , va implemented a new single process for all networks to use to determine allocations to medical centers . va headquarters retains overall responsibility for oversight of va 's resources , including ensuring networks do not spend more than the resources available . gao was asked to review how va networks allocate resources and how va oversees these resources once they are allocated . in this report , gao describes va 's new process for networks to use in determining allocations to medical centers , and how va centrally monitors these resources . to do this work , gao reviewed va documents describing the new process and va 's monitoring efforts , in light of federal internal control standards , and interviewed va officials.. va 's new resource allocation process uses a standardized model , but the transparency of networks ' decisions for allocating resources to medical centers is limited . the new process involves three steps . first , va headquarters proposes medical center allocation amounts to networks using a standardized resource allocation model . the model includes a standardized measure of workload that recognizes the varying costs and levels of resource intensity associated with providing care for each patient at each medical center . second , network officials review the proposed amounts and have the flexibility to adjust them if they believe that certain medical centers ' resource needs are not appropriately accounted for in the model . third , networks report final medical center allocation amounts to va headquarters and any adjustments made to the allocation amounts proposed by the model . va headquarters did not ask networks to report reasons for each adjustment made to allocation amounts ; networks reported reasons for some adjustments , but not for others . va officials said that the new network resource allocation process was not intended to be used to question networks ' decision making , but to increase the transparency of networks ' allocation decisions to va headquarters while maintaining network flexibility . however , absent rationales from networks on all adjustments made to medical center allocation amounts , transparency for decisions made through the allocation process is limited . furthermore , understanding why networks make adjustments is key in determining if any modifications to the model are needed for subsequent years . va officials told gao that they intend to conduct annual assessments of the new resource allocation process , including a review of adjustments to the model , to identify areas for improvement . va centrally monitors the resources networks have allocated to medical centers to ensure spending does not exceed allocations , but does not have written policies documenting these practices for monitoring resources . va monitors resources through two primary practices -- automated controls in its financial management system and regular reviews of network spending . specifically , va 's financial management system electronically tracks the amount of resources that networks and medical centers have available -- the resources allocated , less the resources already spent -- and prevents medical centers from spending more than what they have available by rejecting spending requests in excess of available resources . in addition , each month va headquarters officials compare each network 's spending with what the network planned to spend and determine whether spending is on target , and whether any differences from the plan are significant . however , va headquarters does not have written policies documenting the agency 's practices for monitoring resources , which is not consistent with federal internal control standards . these standards state that internal controls should be documented , and all documentation should be properly managed , maintained , and readily available for examination . without written policies , there is an increased risk of inconsistent monitoring of va network and medical center resources . gao recommends that va require networks to provide rationales for all adjustments made to allocations proposed by va 's resource allocation model , and develop written policies to document practices for monitoring resources . va concurred with these recommendations .
