pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on ergonomics programs to reduce work - related musculoskeletal disorders ( msds ) , focusing on : the core elements of effective ergonomics programs and how these elements are operationalized at the facility level ; whether these programs have proven beneficial to the employers and employees that have implemented them ; and the implications of these employers ' experiences for other employers and the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) . gao noted that : experts , research literature , and officials at gao 's case study facilities generally agreed that effective ergonomics programs must have the following core set of elements to ensure that ergonomic hazards are identified and controlled to protect workers : management commitment ; employee involvement ; identification of problem jobs ; development of solutions ( that is , controls ) for problem jobs ; training and education for employees ; and appropriate medical management ; although the ergonomics programs at all of the case study facilities displayed each of these elements , there was often significant variety in how they were implemented ; this variety typically resulted from factors such as differences in the facilities ' industries and product line , corporate culture , and experiences during the programs ' evolution ; the processes used by the case study facilities to identify and control problem jobs were typically informal and simple and generally involved a lower level of effort than was reflected in the literature ; controls did not typically require significant investment or resources and did not drastically change the job or operation ; officials at all the facilities gao visited believed their ergonomics programs yielded benefits , including reductions in workers ' compensation costs associated with msds ; these facilities could also show reductions in overall injuries and illnesses as well as in the number of days injured employees were out of work ; in some cases , however , the number of restricted workdays increased as a result of an increased emphasis on bringing employees back to work ; facility officials also reported improved worker morale , productivity , and product quality , although evidence of this was often anecdotal ; demonstrating overall program performance was complicated by uncertainties associated with determining what types of injuries should be considered msds and analyzing the program 's effect on injuries in light of other complicating factors , such as limited information collected by employers on the costs to implement the programs ; gao 's work revealed that positive results can be achieved through an approach incorporating certain core elements that are implemented in a simple , informal , site - specific manner ; and federal and state - operated osha programs have undertaken a number of initiatives that can provide employers flexibility , consistent with these case study experiences ; however , questions remain as to whether these efforts alone are sufficient to protect employees from ergonomic hazards .
