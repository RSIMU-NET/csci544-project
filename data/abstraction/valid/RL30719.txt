the `` digital divide '' is a term that has been used to characterize a gap between `` information haves and have - nots , '' or in other words , between those americans who use or have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do not . one important subset of the digital divide debate concerns high - speed internet access and advanced telecommunications services , also known as broadband . broadband is provided by a series of technologies ( e.g . , cable , telephone wire , fiber , satellite , mobile and fixed wireless ) that give users the ability to send and receive data at volumes and speeds necessary to support a number of applications including voice communications , entertainment , telemedicine , distance education , telework , ecommerce , civic engagement , public safety , and energy conservation . broadband technologies are currently being deployed primarily by the private sector throughout the united states . while the numbers of new broadband subscribers continue to grow , studies and data suggest that the rate of broadband deployment in urban / suburban and high - income areas is outpacing deployment in rural and low - income areas . some policymakers , believing that disparities in broadband access across american society could have adverse economic and social consequences on those left behind , assert that the federal government should play a more active role to address the `` digital divide '' in broadband access . with the conclusion of the grant and loan awards established by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 ) , there remain two primary ongoing federal vehicles which direct federal money to fund broadband infrastructure : the broadband and telecommunications programs at the rural utilities service ( rus ) of the u.s. department of agriculture and the universal service fund ( usf ) programs under the federal communications commission ( fcc ) . rus broadband programs were reauthorized and modified by the 2018 farm bill . the usf high cost fund is undergoing a major transition to the connect america fund , which is targeted to the deployment , adoption , and utilization of both fixed and mobile broadband . meanwhile , the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) appropriated $ 600 million to rus to conduct a new broadband loan and grant pilot program ( called the reconnect program ) , and appropriated $ 7.5 million to the national telecommunications and information administration to update the national broadband availability map in coordination with the fcc . additionally , p.l . 115-141 contained provisions seeking to facilitate deployment of broadband infrastructure on federal property , as well as making more spectrum available for wireless broadband . to the extent that the 116th congress may consider various options for further encouraging broadband deployment and adoption , a key issue is how to strike a balance between providing federal assistance for unserved and underserved areas where the private sector may not be providing acceptable levels of broadband service , while at the same time minimizing any deleterious effects that government intervention in the marketplace may have on competition and private sector investment .
