gao has documented many problems resulting from the fragmented nature of the federal food safety system and recommended fundamental restructuring to ensure the effective use of scarce government resources . in this report , gao identified overlaps in food safety activities at usda , fda , epa , and nmfs ; analyzed the extent to which the agencies use interagency agreements to leverage resources ; and obtained the views of stakeholders . several statutes give responsibility for different segments of the food supply to different agencies to ensure that the food supply is safe . the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and the food and drug administration ( fda ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) have the primary responsibility for regulating food safety , with the environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) also involved . in carrying out their responsibilities , with respect to both domestic and imported food , these agencies spend resources on a number of overlapping activities , such as inspection / enforcement , training , research , or rulemaking . for example , both usda and fda conduct similar inspections at 1,451 dual jurisdiction establishments -- facilities that produce foods regulated by both agencies . under authority granted by the bioterrorism act of 2002 , fda could authorize usda inspectors to inspect these facilities , but it has not done so . furthermore , usda and fda maintain separate training programs on similar topics for their inspectors that could be shared . ultimately , inspection and training resources could be used more efficiently . gao identified 71 interagency agreements that the agencies entered into to better protect public health and to coordinate their food safety activities . however , the agencies have weak mechanisms for tracking these agreements that , in some cases , lead to ineffective implementation . specifically , usda and fda are not fully implementing an agreement to facilitate the exchange of information about dual jurisdiction establishments , which both agencies inspect . in addition , fda and nmfs are not implementing an agreement designed to enable each agency to discharge its seafood responsibilities effectively . gao spoke with selected industry associations , food companies , consumer groups , and academic experts , and they disagree on the extent of overlap and on how best to improve the food safety system . most of these stakeholders agreed that laws and regulations should be modernized to more effectively and efficiently control food safety hazards , but they differed about whether to consolidate food safety functions into a single agency .
