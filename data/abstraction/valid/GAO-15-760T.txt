for over 60 years , the united states has provided assistance to food - insecure countries primarily in the form of food commodities procured in the united states and transported overseas . in recent years , the united states has joined other major donors in increasingly providing food assistance in the form of cash or vouchers . in fiscal year 2014 , u.s. - funded cash and voucher projects in 28 countries totaled about $ 410 million , the majority of which was for the syria crisis , making the united states the largest single donor of cash - based food assistance . this testimony summarizes gao 's march 2015 report ( gao - 15-328 ) that reviewed usaid 's processes for awarding and modifying cash - based food assistance projects and assessed the extent to which usaid and its implementing partners have implemented financial controls to help ensure appropriate oversight of such projects . gao analyzed program data and documents for selected projects in jordan , kenya , niger , and somalia ; interviewed relevant officials ; and conducted fieldwork in jordan , kenya , and niger . the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) awards new cash - based food assistance grants under its emergency food security program ( efsp ) through a competitive proposal review or an expedited noncompetitive process ; however , usaid lacks formal internal guidance for modifying awards . in its march 2015 review of 22 grant awards , gao found that usaid made 13 through its competitive process , 7 through an abbreviated noncompetitive review , and 2 under authorities allowing an expedited emergency response . according to usaid , the agency follows a similar process for modification requests . partners may propose cost or no - cost modifications for a variety of reasons , such as an increase in the number of beneficiaries or changing market conditions affecting food prices . in its review of 13 grant awards that had been modified , gao found that cost modifications for 8 awards resulted in an increase in funding for the 13 awards from about $ 91 million to $ 626 million . according to usaid , procedures for modifying awards have been updated but gao has yet to verify this information . gao also found that though usaid requires partners to monitor market conditions — a key factor that may trigger an award modification — it did not provide guidance on when and how to respond to changing market conditions . gao concluded that , until usaid institutes formal guidance , it can not hold its staff and implementing partners accountable for taking all necessary steps to justify and document the medication of awards . usaid relies on implementing partners for financial oversight of efsp projects but did not require them to conduct comprehensive risk assessments to plan financial oversight activities , and it provided little related procedural guidance to partners and its own staff . for projects in four case study countries reviewed in its march 2015 report , gao found that neither usaid nor its implementing partners conducted comprehensive risk assessments to identify and mitigate financial vulnerabilities . additionally , although usaid 's partners had generally implemented financial controls over cash and voucher distributions that gao reviewed , some partners ' guidance for financial oversight had weaknesses , such as a lack of information on how to estimate and report losses . in addition , gao found that usaid had limited guidance on financial control activities and provided no information to aid partners in estimating and reporting losses . as a result , partners may neglect to implement appropriate financial controls in areas that are most vulnerable to fraud , diversion , and misuse of efsp funding . gao 's march 2015 report included recommendations to strengthen usaid 's guidance for staff on approving award modifications and guidance for partners on responding to changing market conditions . gao also made recommendations to strengthen financial oversight of cash - based food assistance projects by addressing gaps in usaid 's guidance on risk assessments and mitigation plans and on financial control activities . usaid concurred with the recommendations .
