the internal revenue service ( irs ) is responsible for collecting virtually all of the funds that pay for the federal government . for 2003 , irs expects to process 130 million individual income tax returns , issue 99 million refunds , receive 100 million telephone calls , and assist 4 million taxpayers face - to - face at irs and volunteer offices . most of these interactions with taxpayers occur during the january through april tax filing season . gao was asked by the subcommittee on oversight , house committee on ways and means , to assess the likelihood of irs allocating more resources to a key priority , compliance ; whether proposed spending on computer systems is justified ; and filing season performance . irs is requesting $ 10.4 billion and 101,043 ftes , a dollar increase of about 5 percent over the fiscal year 2003 request . the 2004 budget request , like other recent requests , identifies compliance as one of irs 's top priorities for additional resources . irs intends to fund some program enhancements from the requested budget increase and internal savings . several factors , including lowered savings projections since the budget request was prepared , raise questions about irs 's ability to achieve all the savings and shift resources to compliance as planned . irs 's recent history raises the same questions , in part , because unbudgeted expenses , such as pay raises , have absorbed budget increases . irs is requesting $ 2.1 billion in information technology . this includes $ 429 million for the agency 's multiyear capital account that funds contractor costs for the business systems modernization program , and $ 1.67 billion for information systems , primarily for operations and maintenance . in response to gao 's recommendation last year , irs has begun to implement an information technology management process patterned after its systems modernization program . until the process is fully implemented , irs will have limited ability to develop supportable information systems budget requests . irs 's 2003 filing season performance has improved over last year . for example , irs 's telephone access has improved and the web site has seen increased use . such improvements represent a payoff from irs 's ongoing systems modernization investments and wider management improvements . although irs has not succeeded in reallocating staff to one of its priority needs , compliance , there will likely be increased potential for such reallocation as modernization proceeds . this will present congress , in its oversight and appropriations roles , with significant opportunities to weigh in on irs 's overall strategy for better accomplishing its mission .
