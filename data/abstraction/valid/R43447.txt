the existence of a sizable population of `` dreamers '' in the united states has prompted questions about unauthorized aliens ' eligibility for admission to public institutions of higher education , in - state tuition , and financial aid . the term dreamer is widely used to describe aliens who were brought to the united states as children and raised here but lack legal immigration status . as children , dreamers are entitled to public elementary and secondary education as a result of the supreme court 's 1982 decision in plyler v. doe . there , the court struck down a texas statute that prohibited the use of state funds to provide elementary and secondary education to children who were not `` legally admitted '' to the united states because the state distinguished between these children and other children without a `` substantial '' goal , in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the u.s. constitution . once dreamers complete high school , however , they may have less access to public higher education . plyler 's holding was limited to elementary and secondary education , and the court 's focus on the young age of those whom texas denied a `` basic education '' has generally been taken to mean that measures denying unauthorized aliens access to higher education may be subject to less scrutiny than the texas statute was . thus , several states have adopted laws or practices barring the enrollment of unauthorized aliens at public institutions of higher education . in addition , congress has enacted two statutes that restrict unauthorized aliens ' eligibility for `` public benefits , '' a term which has generally been construed to encompass in - state tuition and financial aid . the first of these statutes , the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora , p.l . 104-193 ) , bars the provision of `` state and local public benefits '' to aliens who are `` not lawfully present in the united states '' unless the state enacts legislation that `` affirmatively provides '' for their eligibility . the second , the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act ( iirira , p.l . 104-208 ) , bars states from providing `` postsecondary education benefits '' to aliens who are `` not lawfully present '' based on their residence in the state unless all u.s. citizens or nationals are eligible for such benefits , regardless of their residence . state measures that variously deny or grant access to public higher education , in - state tuition , or financial aid have been challenged on the grounds that they violate the equal protection clause , like the texas measure at issue in plyler . they have also been alleged to violate the supremacy clause of the u.s. constitution , which establishes that federal law is `` the supreme law of the land '' and may preempt any incompatible provisions of state law . based on the case law to date , it would appear that states do not , as a general matter , violate the equal protection or supremacy clauses by excluding unauthorized aliens from public institutions of higher education . on the other hand , access to public higher education has generally not been construed as a public benefit for purposes of prwora , such that it may only be provided to `` unlawfully present '' aliens if a state enacts legislation that affirmatively provides for their eligibility . in - state tuition and financial aid have generally been seen as public benefits for purposes of prwora . however , courts have rejected the view that state statutes providing in - state tuition to unauthorized aliens are preempted unless they expressly refer to prwora , or to unauthorized aliens being eligible . courts have also found that iirira does not bar states from providing in - state tuition to unauthorized aliens who complete a certain number of years of high school in the state and satisfy other criteria . in one case , the court reached this conclusion because it construed iirira as barring only the provision of in - state tuition based on residence in the state , not based on other factors . in another case , the court found that iirira did not create a private right of action such that individuals may sue to enforce alleged violations .
