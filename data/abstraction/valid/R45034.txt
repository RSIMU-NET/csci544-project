haiti shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican republic ; haiti occupies the western third of the island . since the fall of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 , haiti has struggled to overcome its centuries - long legacy of authoritarianism , extreme poverty , and underdevelopment . although significant progress has been made in improving governance , democratic institutions remain weak . poverty remains massive and deep , and economic disparity is wide . in proximity to the united states , and with a chronically unstable political environment and fragile economy , haiti has been an ongoing policy issue for the united states . many in the u.s. congress view the stability of the nation with great concern and have evidenced a commitment to improving conditions there . haiti returned to constitutional order in february 2017 , with the inauguration of president jovenel moïse , after almost a year without an elected president because of political gridlock and delayed elections . hopes for a more functional and transparent government are tempered by the political newcomer 's lack of experience and ongoing investigations into moïse 's possible involvement in money laundering and irregular loan arrangements , which the president denies . widespread corruption has been an impediment to good governance and respect for human rights throughout much of haiti 's history . the haitian senate 's special commission of investigation released a report in november alleging embezzlement and fraud by current and former haitian officials managing $ 2 billion in loans from venezuela 's petrocaribe discounted oil program . the commission accuses 15 former government officials , including two former prime ministers , and president moïse 's chief of staff of corruption and poor management . haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere . its poverty is massive and deep , exacerbated by chronic political instability and frequent natural disasters . almost 60 % of the country 's 10 million people live in poverty , and almost a quarter of them live in extreme poverty . haiti is still recovering from the devastating earthquake in 2010 , as well as hurricane matthew , which hit the island in 2016. the latter worsened a process begun by a two - year drought , destroying haiti 's food supply and creating a humanitarian disaster . in addition , haiti continues to struggle against a cholera epidemic inadvertently introduced by united nations peacekeepers the same year as the earthquake . nonetheless , according to the state department , haiti is transitioning from a postdisaster era to one of reconstruction and long - term development . the united nations stabilization mission in haiti ( minustah ) was in haiti to help restore order from 2004 until october 2017. the mission helped facilitate elections , combated gangs and drug trafficking with the haitian national police , and responded to natural disasters . minustah was criticized because of sexual abuse by some of its forces and scientific findings that its troops introduced cholera to the country . the u.n. maintains it has diplomatic immunity , but after years of international pressure said that it had a `` moral responsibility '' to the epidemic 's victims . the u.n. announced a new $ 400 million plan to fight cholera in haiti , and its intention to support cholera victims ; neither program has been fully funded or implemented . minustah has been succeeded by a smaller mission , the u.n. mission for justice support in haiti ( minujusth ) , which is to focus on rule of law , development of the haitian national police force , and human rights . the haitian national police now have primary responsibility for domestic security . haiti was a key foreign assistance priority for the obama administration in latin america and the caribbean . according to the state department , the main priorities for current u.s. policy regarding haiti are to strengthen fragile democratic institutions and foster sustainable development . other policy priorities include support for economic growth and poverty reduction , including through bilateral trade and investment to promote job creation ; improved health care and food security ; promoting respect for human rights ; and strengthening the haitian national police . the trump administration 's proposed fy2018 budget of $ 156 million for aid to haiti was a 30 % reduction from the fy2017 request . the administration has also announced that temporary protected status for haitians is to be terminated as of july 22 , 2019 .
