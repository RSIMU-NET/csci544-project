although most federal contracts are awarded through competition , the government also buys unique products and services , including sophisticated weapons systems , for which it can not always rely on competition to get the best prices and values . instead , it uses a single source for its procurements . in these cases , contractors and subcontractors provide the government with cost or pricing data supporting their proposed prices and certify that the data submitted are accurate , complete , and current , as required by the truth in negotiations act . this ensures that the government has the data it needs to effectively negotiate with the contractor and avoid paying inflated prices . the government can waive the requirement for certified data in exceptional cases . in these instances , contracting officers use other techniques to arrive at fair and reasonable prices . using the department of defense 's ( dod ) contract database , gao found 20 waivers , each valued at more than $ 5 million , in fiscal year 2000. the total value of these waivers was $ 4.4 billion . in each case , the contract pricing or waiver documents stated that sufficient information was available to determine the price to be fair and reasonable without the submission of cost or pricing data . there was a wide variety in the quality of the data and analyses being used , from very old to very recent data . despite the range of techniques employed to arrive at a price , dod does not have guidance that would help buying organizations determine acceptable data and analyses and what kinds of outside assistance , such as contracting and pricing experts , should be obtained .
