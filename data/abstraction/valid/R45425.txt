the farm bill is an omnibus , multiyear law that governs an array of agricultural and food programs . the farm bill has typically undergone reauthorization about every five years . the current farm bill — the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-334 ) , often called the `` 2018 farm bill '' — was enacted in december 2018 and expires in 2023. the farm bill provides an opportunity for congress to choose how much support , if any , to provide for various agriculture and nutrition programs and how to allocate it among competing constituencies . under congressional budgeting rules , many programs are assumed to continue beyond the end of a farm bill . from a budgetary perspective , this provides a baseline for comparing future spending reauthorizations , reallocations to other programs , and reductions to projected spending . since 2000 , congressional goals for the farm bill 's budget have varied : the 2002 farm bill increased spending over 10 years , the 2008 farm bill was essentially budget neutral , the 2014 farm bill reduced spending , and the 2018 farm bill is budget neutral , according to the congressional budget office ( cbo ) . the farm bill authorizes programs in two spending categories : mandatory spending and discretionary spending . mandatory spending is not only authorized but also actually provided via budget enforcement rules . discretionary spending may be authorized in a farm bill but is not actually provided until budget decisions are made in a future annual appropriations act . the cbo baseline is a projection at a particular point in time of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law . when a new bill is proposed that would affect mandatory spending , the cost impact ( score ) is measured in relation to the baseline . changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score ; those that decrease spending relative to the baseline have a negative score . federal budget rules such as `` paygo '' may require budgetary offsets to balance new spending so that there is no increase in the federal deficit . the april 2018 cbo baseline was the official benchmark to measure changes made by the 2018 farm bill . the five - year baseline was $ 426 billion over fy2019-fy2023 ( what the 2014 farm bill would have spent had it been continued ) . the budgetary impact of the 2018 farm bill is measured relative to that baseline . among its impacts are these four points : 1. the enacted farm bill increases net outlays in the first five years by $ 1.8 billion , which is offset by the same amount of net reductions in outlays during the second five years . therefore , over 10 years , the net impact is budget neutral . 2. eight titles in the enacted law have increased outlays over the five - year period , including farm commodities , conservation , trade , nutrition , research , energy , horticulture , and miscellaneous . two of those titles — conservation and nutrition — have reductions in the second five years of the budget window that make them budget neutral over 10 years . 3. most of the budget reductions at the title level that provide offsets for the increases above , especially in the 10-year budget window , are from changes in the rural development title . 4. the 2018 farm bill provides continuing funding and , in some cases , permanent baseline , for 23 of the 39 so - called programs without baseline from the 2014 farm bill . projected outlays for the 2018 farm bill at enactment are $ 428 billion over the fy2019-fy2023 five - year life of the act . the nutrition title and its largest program , the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , account for $ 326 billion ( 76 % ) of those projected outlays . the remaining 24 % , $ 102 billion , is for agricultural programs , mostly in crop insurance ( 8.9 % ) , farm commodity programs ( 7.3 % ) , and conservation ( 6.8 % ) . other titles of the farm bill account for 1 % of the mandatory spending , some of which are funded primarily with discretionary spending . historical trends in farm bill spending show increased snap outlays after the 2009 recession , increased crop insurance outlays based on insurable coverage , farm commodity programs outlays that vary inversely with markets , and steadily increasing conservation program outlays that have leveled off in recent years .
