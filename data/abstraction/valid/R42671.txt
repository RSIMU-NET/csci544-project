on june 29 , 2012 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) published a proposal to revise the national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) under the clean air act ( caa ) for particulate matter ( pm ) , in response to a june 6 , 2012 , order issued by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . environmental and public health advocacy groups and 11 states had petitioned the agency , and subsequently filed suit in the d.c. circuit alleging that epa failed to perform its mandated duty to complete the review of the pm naaqs within the statutory deadline . epa has agreed to issue final revised pm naaqs by december 14 , 2012. epa 's review of the pm naaqs has generated considerable debate and oversight in congress . the june 2012 proposal would strengthen the existing ( 2006 ) annual health - based ( `` primary '' ) standard for `` fine '' particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter ( or pm2.5 ) , lowering the allowable average concentration of pm2.5 in the air from the current level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter ( µg / m3 ) , to a range of 12 to 13 µg / m.3 the annual pm2.5 naaqs is set so as to address human health effects from chronic exposures to the pollutants . the existing 24-hour primary standard for pm2.5 that was reduced from 65 µg / m3 to 35 µg / m3 in 2006 would be retained , as would the existing standards for larger , but still inhalable `` coarse '' particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter or pm10 . `` secondary '' standards that provide protection against `` welfare '' ( non - health ) effects , such as ecological effects and material deterioration , would be identical to the primary standards the same as in 2006 , but the june 2012 proposal included two options for a 24-hour pm2.5 standard to improve visibility . in developing the june 2012 proposal , epa reviewed scientific studies available since the agency 's previous review in 2006. epa determined , and the independent scientific advisory committee mandated under the caa ( clean air scientific advisory committee , or casac ) concurred , that evidence continues to show associations between particulates in ambient air and numerous significant health problems , including aggravated asthma , chronic bronchitis , non - fatal heart attacks , and premature death . populations shown to be most at risk include children , older adults , and those with heart and lung disease , and those of lower socioeconomic status . epa expects that the potential benefits of the proposed revisions would range from an estimated low of $ 88.0 million to a high of $ 5.9 billion dependent on the concentration level and other factors , and estimated costs would range from $ 2.9 million to $ 69.0 million . some stakeholders and some members express concerns that the cost impacts will be more significant than epa estimated in those areas unable to comply with the new standards . epa 's establishment of or revisions to the pm naaqs do not directly regulate emissions from specific sources , or compel installation of any pollution control equipment or measures , but indirectly could affect operations at industrial facilities and other sources throughout the united states . final revised pm naaqs will start a process that includes a determination of areas in each state that exceed the standard and must , therefore , reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve it . following the determination of `` nonattainment '' areas ( primarily counties ) based on multiple years of monitoring data and other factors submitted by the states , state and local governments must develop ( or revise ) state implementation plans ( sips ) outlining measures to attain the standard . these often involve promulgation of new regulations by states , leading to the issuance of revised air permits . the process typically takes several years . based on statutory scheduling requirements , designation of areas as nonattainment for any revised pm naaqs would not be determined until the end of 2014 , and states would have until at least 2020 to achieve compliance .
