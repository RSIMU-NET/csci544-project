doe is the only domestic supplier for many of the over 300 different isotopes it sells that are critical to medical , commercial , research , and national security applications . previous shortages of some isotopes , such as helium - 3 , an isotope used to detect radiation at seaports and border crossings , highlight the importance of managing supplies of and demand for critical isotopes . prior reports by gao and others highlighted risks and challenges faced by the isotope program , such as assessing demand for certain isotopes . gao was asked to determine which isotopes are produced , sold , or distributed either by the isotope program or nnsa and how the two agencies make isotopes available for commercial and research applications ; what steps the isotope program takes to provide isotopes for commercial and research applications ; and the extent to which doe is assessing and mitigating risks facing the isotope program . gao reviewed doe and nnsa documents , visited oak ridge national laboratory , and interviewed cognizant agency officials . the department of energys ( doe ) isotope development and production for research and applications program ( isotope program ) provides over 300 different isotopes for commercial and research applications . the isotope program is responsible for 243 stable isotopes that are no longer produced in the united states but are sold from the programs existing inventory and for 55 radioactive isotopes , called radioisotopes , that the program is able to produce at doe facilities . an additional 10 isotopes sold by the isotope program are provided by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a separate agency within doe , as by - products of its nuclear weapons program . the isotope program may be forgoing revenue that could further its mission because of the manner in which it sets prices for commercial isotopes . the isotope program determines demand , coordinates production , and sets prices for commercial isotopes . to set prices for radioisotopes , the program considers the full cost of production , including direct costs ( e.g . , labor costs ) and indirect costs ( e.g . , infrastructure costs ) . for research applications , isotope prices are set to recover direct costs to reduce prices and encourage research . for commercial applications , prices are set at full cost recoveryof both direct and indirect costsor at an isotopes market price when a market price higher than full cost recovery already exists . the program , however , has not fully assessed the pricing of most of these isotopes , as required by its 1990 pricing policy . this policy provides latitude for setting prices and states that prices should be assessed annually . factors that may be considered when establishing prices include the value of an isotope to the customer , demand , and the number of suppliers . the program , however , has not assessed the value of isotopes to customers or defined what factors it will consider when it sets prices for commercial isotopes , including defining under what circumstances it will set prices at or above full cost recovery . as a result , the program does not know if its full - cost - recovery prices are set at appropriate levels so as not to distort the market , and it may be forgoing revenue that could further support its mission . the isotope program has begun taking some actions to identify and manage risks to achieving its mission of producing isotopes , but because it has not established clear , consistent program objectives , the programs risk assessment efforts are not comprehensive . actions the isotope program is taking include , among other things , identifying high - priority isotopes and using its revolving fund to mitigate risks from unforeseen events . for example , the isotope program has identified five lists of high - priority isotopesthose at risk of supply problems because they are already in short supply or are important to users . isotope program officials reported using these lists to set program priorities . the isotope program is taking these actions , however , without first establishing clear , consistent objectives . the federal standards for internal control state that a precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of clear objectives . without clearly defined objectives , the program can not be assured that it is assessing risks from all sources or that its efforts are focusing on the most significant risks to achieving its mission . furthermore , without consolidating the multiple high - priority lists , isotope program managers may not be directing limited resources to the most important isotopes . gao recommends , among other actions , that does isotope program define what factors it considers when setting isotope prices , create clear objectives as a basis for risk assessment , and consolidate the lists of high - priority isotopes . doe stated that it will address gaos recommendations through the isotope programs current efforts to update its pricing policy and develop a strategic plan .
