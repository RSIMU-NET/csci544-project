tax expenditures -- special exemptions and exclusions , credits , deductions , deferrals , and preferential tax rates claimed by corporations , individuals , or both -- support federal policy goals but result in revenue forgone by the federal government . congress and the administration are reexamining tax expenditures used by corporations as part of corporate tax reform . gao was asked to examine issues related to corporate tax expenditures . this report : describes trends in the number of corporate tax expenditures and estimated corporate revenue losses since 1986 ; describes the use of corporate tax expenditures in 2011 ; and compares the size of corporate tax expenditures to federal spending by budget function and , for tax expenditures used only by corporations , identifies spending programs with similar purposes . to address these objectives , gao analyzed department of the treasury estimates of tax expenditure revenue losses from 1986 to 2011 and internal revenue service 2010 data and interviewed agency officials . gao also reviewed the legislative history and relevant studies to determine the reported purpose of corporate - only tax expenditures , and searched federal program lists to identify federal spending programs that appear to share a reported specific purpose similar to corporate - only tax expenditures . the programs identified as related were not reviewed by the agencies responsible for the programs . estimated tax revenue that the federal government forgoes resulting from corporate tax expenditures increased over the past few decades as did the total number of corporate tax expenditures . in 2011 , the department of the treasury estimated 80 tax expenditures resulted in the government forgoing corporate tax revenue totaling more than $ 181 billion . many of these tax expenditures are broadly available to both corporate and individual taxpayers . more than twothirds or 56 of the 80 tax expenditures used by corporations in 2011 were also used by individual taxpayers , such as other types of businesses not organized as corporations . modifying any of these 56 tax expenditures as part of broader corporate tax reform would likely affect both corporate and individual taxpayers to some degree . corporate tax expenditures span a majority of federal mission areas , but their relative size differs across budget functions . the 80 corporate tax expenditures had estimated revenue losses in 12 of the 18 budget functions in 2011. of the $ 181 billion in estimated corporate tax revenue losses , 81 percent was concentrated in the international affairs and housing and commerce budget functions , exceeding federal outlays in those budget functions . the 24 tax expenditures used only by corporations in 2011 provide support intended to encourage certain activities , such as energy production , or provide support for certain entity types , such as credit unions . a corporate tax expenditure may have multiple purposes : one narrowly focused on a specific activity or entity as well as broader or additional purposes pursuing national priorities or other activities . for example , 7 of the 24 corporate - only tax expenditures are aimed at encouraging or supporting specific energy sources and technologies , and these tax expenditures may also have broader national purposes such as promoting domestic energy production and energy security . in examining their narrowly focused reported purposes , one - third of the 24 corporate - only tax expenditures appear to share a similar purpose with at least one federal spending program . gao made no recommendations in this report . treasury provided technical comments that were incorporated , as appropriate ; irs had no comments .
