the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) , the nation 's largest public power provider , is a self - financing , federal electric utility with annual revenues of about $ 11 billion . tva has financed large capital investments mostly by issuing debt and is subject to a $ 30 billion debt ceiling imposed by the tva act . tva is governed by a 9-member board . within an affirmation requirement for the tva board , the tva act recognizes that tva 's broad missions and objectives include being a national leader in technological innovation , low - cost power , and environmental stewardship . gao was asked to examine how tva plans to meet future demand for electricity and how tva 's resource planning and forecasts compare to those from other sources , tva 's efforts to use energy efficiency to meet demand for electricity , and tva 's financial condition and how it affects tva 's ability to meet its operational and financial goals . gao analyzed data from tva and third parties , reviewed agency documents , and interviewed federal and state officials and industry stakeholders . according to its 2010 power supply plan , by 2029 tva plans to meet electricity demand primarily by expanding natural gas - fired generating capacity , adding three nuclear reactors , and expanding energy efficiency programs . tva also plans to retire some coal - fired capacity . these plans are informed by tva 's resource planning forecasts , which gao determined were largely in line with plans and forecasts for the southeastern united states from other sources . for example , tva forecasts that peak demand will grow at an average annual rate of about 1 percent for about the next 20 years , which is within the range of long - term forecasts for the southeast from other sources , including the department of energy and a gao nonprobability sample of five investor - owned utilities . tva also plans to increase its generating capacity and total electricity generation by about 1 percent per year on average , both of which are within the range of plans and forecasts from other sources . while tva plans to expand its energy efficiency efforts to meet future demand for electricity , tva may not be fully considering this alternative . for example , tva 's plans may not reflect the full energy efficiency potential of its service area , since it has not yet completed a study of that potential . as a result , tva can not be sure that its current resource plans reflect the full scope and possible extent of energy efficiency programs or that the plans are realistic . in march 2011 , tva commissioned a study on the energy efficiency potential of its service area , which is scheduled to be completed by october 2011. in addition , tva 's use of energy efficiency is constrained by several factors , including tva 's planning approach , which did not allow for potentially more cost - effective levels of energy efficiency in its planning model . in addition , tva is not subject to certain key mandates and incentives that apply to some other utilities , such as the requirement in california for utilities to consider energy efficiency before other resources . tva 's financial condition may hamper its ability to fund capital improvements . as of september 30 , 2010 , tva 's statutory debt was $ 23.6 billion , and tva plans to spend almost $ 10 billion by fiscal year 2013 for various capital investment projects . given the significant delays and cost overruns that tva has historically experienced , these projects could potentially face similar issues . in addition , under a settlement with the environmental protection agency , tva agreed to invest $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion in the next 10 years on new and upgraded pollution controls on existing power plants . tva also anticipates increases in operating costs . all of these factors could reduce the available funds tva could use for its planned capital investments . tva 's financial condition leaves it with difficult decisions to make in order to meet electricity demand while keeping its debt within the statutory limit . tva does not have a formal capital expenditure management plan that identifies assets to be acquired , their costs , and funding sources . the lack of such a plan may impede tva 's long range financial planning . gao recommends that tva use information from the energy efficiency study it commissioned to inform its future resource planning process and develop a written capital expenditure plan that includes the full costs of the assets tva plans to acquire and the sources of funding for acquiring those assets . tva agreed with gao 's first recommendation and generally agreed with the second recommendation .
