practical and legal hurdles , including the difficulty of locating hidden al qaeda members and the infeasibility of enforcing judgments in terrorism cases , hinder victims ' attempts to establish liability in u.s. courts against , and recover financially from , those they argue are directly responsible for the september 11 terrorist attacks . instead , victims have sued numerous individuals and entities with only indirect ties to the attacks , including defendants who allegedly provided monetary support to al qaeda prior to september 11 , 2001. within the consolidated case in re terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , one such group of defendants was the kingdom of saudi arabia , several saudi princes , a saudi banker , and a saudi charity . plaintiffs argued that these saudi defendants funded groups that , in turn , assisted the attackers . a threshold question in in re terrorist attacks was whether u.s. courts have the power to try these saudi defendants . in august 2008 , the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed dismissals of all claims against the saudi defendants , holding that u.s. courts lack jurisdiction over the claims . specifically , the court of appeals held that in this case , u.s. courts lack ( 1 ) subject matter jurisdiction over the kingdom of saudi arabia , because the kingdom is entitled to immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act ( the fsia ) and no statutory exception to immunity applies ; ( 2 ) subject matter jurisdiction over the saudi charity and saudi princes acting in their official capacities , because they are `` agents or instrumentalities '' of the kingdom and thus , under the fsia , are entitled to immunity to the same extent as the kingdom itself ; and ( 3 ) personal jurisdiction over saudi princes sued in their personal capacities , because the princes had insufficient interactions with the forum to satisfy the `` minimum contacts '' standard for personal jurisdiction under the fifth amendment due process clause . in 2011 , the second circuit reversed itself with respect to the immunity of non - terrorist states , finding that the tort exception under the fsia does not exclude terrorist acts that take place within the united states . in 2013 , the court ordered these claims against saudi arabia and its agencies or instrumentalities be reinstated in the interest of justice to determine whether the tort exception applies . the district court again dismissed the claims in 2015 on the basis that the `` entire tort '' defendants were alleged to have committed did not occur within the united states . this decision has been appealed to the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit . in a separate decision , the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of claims against private saudi banks on the basis that the anti - terrorism act ( ata ) does not permit secondary liability under an aiding - and - abetting theory . it also affirmed the dismissal of claims against these defendants brought under the alien tort statute and the torture victims protection act , as well as claims brought as common law torts . to address some issues related to the interpretation of the fsia , among other related matters , congress is considering the justice against sponsors of terrorism act ( jasta ; s. 2040 , h.r . 3815 ) .this report summarizes the fsia and jurisdiction in cases against foreign defendants , analyzes the court decisions , and reviews legislative efforts to revise the fsia and the ata .
