if constructed , the keystone xl pipeline would transport crude oil derived from oil sands sites in alberta , canada , to u.s. refineries and other destinations . because the pipeline would cross an international border , it requires a presidential permit . although some groups have opposed previous oil pipelines , opposition to the keystone xl proposal has generated substantially more interest . stakeholder concerns vary from local impacts , such as oil spills or extraction impacts in canada , to potential climate change consequences . arguments supporting the pipeline 's construction cover an analogous range . proponents of the keystone xl pipeline , including high - level canadian officials and u.s. and canadian petroleum industry stakeholders , base their arguments supporting the pipeline primarily on increasing the security and diversity of the u.s. petroleum supply and economic benefits , especially jobs . a number of studies have looked into the various environmental impacts of oil sands crude . this report focuses on selected environmental concerns raised in conjunction with the proposed pipeline and the oil sands crude it will transport . greenhouse gas emissions key studies indicate that the average greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions intensity — metric tons of ghg emissions per units of production ( e.g . , barrels ) — of oil sands crude is higher than many other crude oils . however , industry stakeholders point to analyses indicating that ghg emissions from oil sands crude oil are comparable to other heavy crudes , some of which are produced and / or consumed currently in the united states . due to oil sands ' increased emissions intensity , many stakeholders have voiced concern about potential climate change consequences associated with oil sands development . in june 2013 , president obama stated that an evaluation of the `` net effects of the pipeline 's impact on our climate '' would factor into the department of state 's ( dos 's ) national interest determination in order to determine if the project would `` significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution . . thus , dos 's 2014 final environmental impact statement ( feis ) has received considerable attention . among other conclusions , the feis estimated that the incremental ( i.e . , net ) life - cycle ghg emissions associated with the pipeline would be 1.3 million to 27.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year ( 0.02 % - 0.4 % of u.s. annual ghg emissions ) . in addition , the feis stated that the `` approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project , including the proposed project , is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the united states based on expected oil prices , oil - sands supply costs , transport costs , and supply - demand scenarios . . some stakeholders have questioned these conclusions , arguing ( 1 ) that the project may have greater climate change impacts than projected by dos , and ( 2 ) that there is nothing presumed or inevitable about the rate of expansion for the canadian oil sands . other stakeholders support the feis analysis , arguing that as long as there is strong global demand for petroleum products , resources such as the canadian oil sands will be produced and shipped to markets using whatever route necessary . oil spills and other local impacts some groups have argued that both the pipeline 's operating parameters and the material being transported through it impose an increased spill risk . the national academy of sciences national research council examined this issue in a 2013 report , stating that it did not `` find any causes of pipeline failure unique to the transportation of diluted bitumen [ oil sands crude ] . . however , according to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , spills of oil sands crude may result in different impacts than spills of other crude oils . other environmental concerns pertain to the region in which the oil sands resources are extracted . potential impacts include , among others , wildlife and ecosystem disturbance and water resource issues . in general , these local / regional impacts from canadian oil sands development are unlikely to directly affect public health or the environment in the united states . within the context of a presidential permit , the mechanism to consider local canadian impacts is unclear .
