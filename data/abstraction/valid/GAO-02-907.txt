the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) has a staff of 6,426 and collected $ 1.1 billion in patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2001. as the u.s. economy depends increasingly on new innovations , the need to patent or trademark quickly the intellectual property resulting from such innovations becomes more important . expressing concerns about uspto 's plans for the future , congress directed uspto to develop a 5-year plan . in february 2001 , uspto issued its first 5-year plan , called the uspto business plan . because the director of uspto did not believe that the business plan went far enough , in june 2002 , uspto produced another 5-year plan , called the 21st century strategic plan . gao found that patent activity grew substantially from 1990 through 2001. the numbers of patent applications filed and patents granted nearly doubled ; the inventory of patent applications nearly tripled ; patent pendency increased from slightly over 18 months to nearly 25 months , and the number of patent examiners increased by about 80 percent . furthermore , in fiscal year 2001 , both fee collections and agency funding requirements exceeded $ 1 billion for the first time in the agency 's history . although both 5-year plans cover the same period , the assumptions and projected results of the business plan are different in several ways from the strategic plan . the administration 's recent legislative proposal to restructure patent fees to implement the strategic plan would result in higher fees for the majority of patent applications -- large entities -- that receive utility patents and maintain such patents in to the future . consequently , total fees for these applicants would increase by $ 4,100 or 51 percent . also , total fees for most small entities would increase $ 2,700 or 67 percent over current fees .
