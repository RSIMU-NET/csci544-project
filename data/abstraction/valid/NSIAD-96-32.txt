pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the cleanup program at the rocky mountain arsenal , focusing on the : status of cleanup efforts ; completion plans for the cleanup ; and cost - sharing plans between the army and shell oil company , which leased a portion of the arsenal . gao found that : permanent cleanup at rocky mountain arsenal has been delayed for years due to lawsuits and numerous other disputes between the parties involved ; in june 1995 , colorado and five other key parties signed an agreement for a conceptual remedy to address the lawsuits and disputes ; although about $ 300 million of the nearly $ 1 billion spent to date has been for interim actions to mitigate the most urgent environmental threats , the majority has been spent on studies and other management activities ; the june 1995 conceptual agreement resolves the most significant issues and paves the way for a final settlement , or record of decision , in 1996 ; based on the agreement , the army currently estimates the cleanup will cost $ 2.1 billion and take until 2012 ; prior to the agreement , the army had estimated a $ 2.8-billion to $ 3.6-billion cleanup effort to be complete in about 2010 ; although the agreement addresses many of the disputed issues , the final details are yet to be negotiated ; until the cleanup plan is detailed and finalized in the record of decision , the cost and completion estimates will be subject to change ; under a 1989 settlement , the army and shell are sharing cleanup costs , and the costs to correct damages attributable solely to either the army or to shell are to be financed by the responsible party ; however , most contamination was commingled , and these cleanup costs will be shared under a formula requiring each party to pay 50 percent of the first $ 500 million in cleanup costs , with shell 's share decreasing as total costs increase ; although the agreement does not limit total contributions , shell estimated its total costs will be about $ 500 million and so far has contributed $ 274 million ; by the time the final phase of cleanup begins in may 1996 , under an expected record of decision , the army will be responsible for 80 percent of the costs for commingled contamination ; and these costs represent most of the remaining cleanup .
