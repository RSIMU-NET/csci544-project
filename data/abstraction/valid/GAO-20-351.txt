sexual violence – which can include crimes such as rape and other forms of sexual coercion – is widely acknowledged as a problem on college campuses . although education collects some data on sexual violence at colleges that receive federal funding , measuring the prevalence of campus sexual violence has proven difficult , due in part to underreporting of these incidents to law enforcement . while some researchers have used surveys to gather additional information regarding sexual violence on college campuses , estimates from these surveys can vary widely due to factors such as differing methodologies and response rates . this report examines key stakeholders ' views on the strengths and limitations of campus climate surveys on sexual violence , approaches selected colleges have taken to survey their students , and the role federal agencies play in helping colleges develop and implement these surveys . gao reviewed documentation for three widely administered survey instruments , and relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance . gao interviewed 25 stakeholders , including researchers ; education and justice officials ; officials in four states that required or recommended campus climate surveys as of january 1 , 2017 , a date selected to allow time for implementation ; and 10 colleges — including seven that conducted campus climate surveys — selected based on program length ( 2- or 4-year ) , geographic diversity , and other factors . campus climate surveys that examine sexual violence occurring on individual college campuses have several strengths and limitations , according to stakeholders gao interviewed . strengths . nearly all stakeholders said colleges can use these surveys to gather more comprehensive information about incidents of campus sexual violence , such as those not previously reported to the colleges or law enforcement . surveys can also provide information on students ' knowledge of the colleges ' procedures for reporting incidents , among other topics , which can help colleges identify areas for improvement . limitations . most stakeholders said getting students to respond can be challenging . in addition , about half of stakeholders said some colleges may not have the resources to effectively administer these surveys , and results across colleges that use different surveys may not be comparable . the seven selected colleges that conducted surveys reported using various approaches to survey their students about the incidence of campus sexual violence . each college used one of three widely used surveys , but six modified them to some extent . six colleges sent the survey to all undergraduates , and one surveyed a representative sample of students . colleges also reported using multiple outreach strategies to increase participation , including offering incentives , such as gift cards , to students who completed the survey ; using social media ; and involving student leaders ( see figure ) . colleges ' reported response rates ranged from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent . the departments of justice ( justice ) , education ( education ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) have created and disseminated informational resources for colleges interested in conducting campus climate surveys . for example , from 2014 to 2017 , justice made funding available for the development of a campus climate survey instrument for public use , and developed technical assistance materials covering various topics , including how to choose survey respondents and protect their confidentiality . in addition , in 2015 , education issued guidance encouraging colleges to develop ways to survey students about the campus climate . justice and hhs have also funded grant programs that allowed grantees to use some funding to conduct campus climate surveys .
