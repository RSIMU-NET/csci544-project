recognition for one - minute speeches ( commonly called `` one minutes '' ) in the house of representatives is the prerogative of the speaker . a period for one minutes usually takes place at the beginning of the legislative day after the daily prayer , the pledge of allegiance , and approval of the previous day 's journal . during this time , representatives ask unanimous consent to address the house for one minute on a topic of their choice . in addition , one - minute speeches are often permitted after legislative business ends , but before special order speeches begin . the rules of the house do not provide for one - minute speeches . instead , one minutes have evolved as a unanimous consent practice of the chamber . during one - minute speeches , members must abide by the rules of the house , the chamber 's precedents , and the `` speaker 's announced policies , '' in that order . the term speaker 's announced policies refers to the speaker 's policies on certain aspects of house procedure , such as recognition for one minutes . representatives seeking recognition for one minutes sit in the first row on their party 's side of the chamber . from the chair 's vantage point , republican members sit on the left side of the chamber and democratic members on the right side . the chair moves from his right to left in recognizing members on each side of the aisle . when recognized by the chair , individual members ask unanimous consent to address the house for one minute and to revise and extend their remarks . permission is almost always granted . members deliver one - minute speeches from the well of the chamber . they are limited to one minute and can not ask unanimous consent for additional time . instead of delivering a one - minute speech on the house floor , a member may ask unanimous consent to insert the speech in the house section of the congressional record . members need not reserve one - minute speeches in advance through their party 's leadership . nevertheless , the party leadership communication arms — known as the `` democratic message group '' and the `` republican theme team '' — sometimes coordinate party members to deliver one minutes on the issue designated as the party 's daily message . these party members usually receive priority seating for recognition purposes . this report will be updated if rules and procedures change .
