gao examined the environmental cleanup costs of ongoing operations of the department of defense ( dod ) . these include general property , plant , and equipment facilities or other assets that are being operated or are in use at dod installations . gao found that dod has not developed policies , procedures , and methodologies to ensure that cleanup costs required for all of its ongoing and inactive or closed operations are identified , consistently estimated , and appropriately reported . as a result , dod 's financial statements and environmental reports continue to underreport environmental liabilities and related long - term budgetary needs . the military installations gao visited had a total of 221 sites with estimated cleanup costs of $ 259 million . of these , only 45 sites with estimated cleanup costs of $ 61 million were being reported for the defense environmental restoration program annual report to congress , and only that amount was likely included in dod 's financial statements . gao found dod was not reporting 149 sites related to ongoing operations with estimated cleanup costs of $ 91 million and 27 inactive and closed operations with estimated cleanup costs of $ 107 million . the environmental offices at the six installations gao visited had comprehensive records for the installation sites subject to cleanup requirements . although these records were reasonably accurate , the records used to maintain accountability over related land , buildings , and structures were significantly flawed . if properly maintained , the real property records should play a significant role in ensuring the accuracy of environmental site records .
