pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the coast guard 's inventory management system for its fleet of 240 cutters to identify any wasteful or inefficient practices that should be changed , focusing on : whether the coast guard has the systems it needs to effectively manage its inventory of spare and repair parts and supplies ; and initiatives the coast guard has under way to improve its inventory management . gao found that : the coast guard does not have the organizational structure or computer systems necessary to effectively manage its inventory for supporting cutters ; the coast guard does not know the value , type , quantity , and condition of many of the spare and repair parts in its inventory and can not determine whether cutters have a shortage or an excess of parts , or whether the parts are readily available ; coast guard officials believe that the lack of inventory management information has not seriously affected the coast guard 's ability to carry out its missions , although they acknowledge that it has resulted in costly purchases and excess inventory ; the coast guard plans to take actions to improve its inventory control problems by fiscal year 2002 ; and some of the coast guard 's initiatives are already behind schedule , delaying both its short - term actions and its long - term inventory management efforts .
