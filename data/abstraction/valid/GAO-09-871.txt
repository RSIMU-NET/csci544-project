the federal government has increasingly focused on linking affordable housing to transit - oriented developments -- compact , walkable , mixed - use neighborhoods located near transit -- through the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) housing programs and the department of transportation 's ( dot ) federal transit administration 's ( fta ) transit programs . gao was asked to review what is known about how transit - oriented developments affect the availability of affordable housing ; how local , state , and federal agencies have worked to ensure that affordable housing is available in transit - oriented developments ; and the extent to which hud and fta have worked together to ensure that transportation and affordable housing objectives are integrated in transit - oriented developments . to address these issues , gao reviewed relevant literature , conducted site visits , and interviewed agency officials . characteristics of transit - oriented developments can increase nearby land and housing values , however determining transit - oriented development 's effects on the availability of affordable housing in these developments are complicated by a lack of direct research and data . specifically , the presence of transit stations , retail , and other desirable amenities such as schools and parks generally increases land and housing values nearby . however , the extent to which land and housing values increase -- or in the rare case , decrease -- near a transit station depends on a number of characteristics , some of which are commonly found in transit - oriented developments . according to transit and housing stakeholders gao spoke with , higher land and housing values have the potential to limit the availability of affordable housing near transit , but other factors -- such as transit routing decisions and local commitment to affordable housing -- can also affect availability . few local , state , and federal programs are targeted to assisting local housing and transit providers develop affordable housing in transit - oriented developments . the few targeted programs that exist primarily focus on financial incentives that state and local agencies provide to developers if affordable housing is included in residential developments in transit - oriented developments . however , gao found that housing developers who develop affordable housing in transit - oriented developments generally rely on local and state programs and policies that have incentives for developing affordable housing in any location . hud and fta programs allow local and state agencies to promote affordable housing near transit , but rarely provide direct incentives to target affordable housing in transit - oriented developments . since 2005 , hud and fta , and more recently dot , have collaborated on three interagency efforts to promote affordable housing in transit - oriented developments including an interagency agreement , a hud - fta action plan , and a new dot - hud partnership . while these interagency efforts have produced numerous strategies , local housing and transit officials told gao that these strategies had little impact , in part , because they have yet to be implemented . however , the agencies have not yet developed a comprehensive , integrated plan to implement all efforts , and without such a plan , the agencies risk losing momentum . gao has previously identified key practices that could enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies ; when compared to these practices , gao found that hud , fta , and dot have taken some actions consistent with some of these practices -- such as defining a common outcome . however , weaknesses in agency housing data and analytical transportation planning methods will limit these agencies ' ability to effectively monitor , evaluate , and report results -- another key collaboration practice . gao found that other collaboration practices , such as establishing compatible policies and procedures , could be taken to strengthe .
