a debate is underway about how the united states should tax foreign - source , corporate income . currently , the united states allows domestic corporations to defer tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries and also gives credits for foreign taxes paid , while most other developed countries exempt the active earnings of their multinational corporations ' foreign subsidiaries from domestic tax . the debate has focused on economic issues with little attention to tax administration . gao was asked to describe for a group of study countries with exemption systems : the rules for exempting foreign - source income , and the compliance risk and taxpayer compliance burden , such as recordkeeping , of the rules . the study countries , selected to provide a range of exemption systems , are australia , canada , france , germany , and the netherlands . for these countries gao reviewed documents ; interviewed government officials , academic experts , and business representatives ; and compared tax policies , compliance activities and taxpayer reporting requirements . the study countries exempt some corporate income , such as dividends received from foreign subsidiaries , from domestic tax . however , the study countries tax other types of foreign - source income such as royalties . multinational corporations present a compliance risk because they can use subsidiaries to convert taxable income into tax - exempt or lower taxed income , eroding the domestic tax base . although quantitative estimates of noncompliance do not exist , tax experts interviewed by gao identified sources of compliance risk and taxpayer burden in each of the study countries . these issues , particularly the ones below , have also been identified as sources of compliance risk and burden in the united states . transfer prices -- the prices for transactions between related parties -- can be manipulated to shift profits . tax experts in the study countries said the growing importance of intangible property such as trademarks and patents is making international transactions more susceptible to transfer pricing abuse . in response , the study countries have all increased their scrutiny of transfer prices , including increased demands for documentation and more audits , resulting in increased compliance burden for taxpayers . cooperative efforts between taxpayers and tax agencies to reduce audits , such as advanced pricing agreements , received mixed reviews in the study countries . anti - avoidance rules prevent taxpayers from moving passive income ( interest and royalties are often passive income ) to a foreign subsidiary in order to avoid domestic tax . generally , the rules make such passive income , even if moved , taxable . tax agencies and taxpayers reported difficulties in obtaining information from other countries to make complex determinations about whether the anti - avoidance rules apply or not . the united states does not report taxes paid on foreign - source income . treasury officials said it would be feasible to do so . such reporting would make more explicit the role international tax rules play in raising revenues and protecting the domestic tax base . all experts we spoke with on this topic agreed .
