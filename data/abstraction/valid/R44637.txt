congress currently appropriates most foreign affairs funding through annual department of state , foreign operations , and related programs ( sfops ) appropriations . prior to fy2008 , however , congress provided funding for the department of state , international broadcasting , and related programs within the commerce , justice , state , the judiciary , and related agencies appropriations . in those years , congress separately appropriated funding for the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and foreign aid within the foreign operations , export financing , and related programs appropriations . the 110th congress aligned the two foreign affairs appropriations into the sfops legislation . sfops appropriations since fy2001 have included enduring appropriations ( ongoing or base funding ) , emergency supplemental appropriations , and overseas contingency operations ( oco ) appropriations . total sfops funding levels in both current and constant dollars show a general upward trend , with fy2004 as the peak largely as a result of emergency supplemental appropriations for iraq relief and reconstruction funds . when adjusted for inflation , annual foreign affairs appropriations have yet to surpass the fy2004 peak . the budget control act ( bca ) of 2011 and the bipartisan budget acts ( bba ) of 2015 and 2018 appear to have had an impact on both enduring and oco funding levels . the legislative history of sfops appropriations shows that nearly all foreign affairs appropriations measures within the past 25 years were passed within omnibus , consolidated , or full - year continuing resolutions , rather than in stand - alone bills . moreover , many appropriations were passed after the start of the new fiscal year , at times more than half way into the new fiscal year . in many fiscal years , sfops appropriations included emergency supplemental funding or , since fy2012 , oco funding .
