pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed currency activity reports prepared by the los angeles federal reserve bank , focusing on : problems in reporting currency activity for federal reserve system ( frs ) note receipts , payments , and amount on hand ; and corrective actions planned or taken by frs to resolve those problems . gao found that the los angeles bank : incorrectly prepared and filed monthly currency activity reports for october , november , and december 1995 ; did not comply with frs guidance to independently determine cash receipts , since it adjusted the amount reported on the currency activity reports to ensure that it agreed with the daily balance sheet for the end of the month ; has been forcing the amount of receipts reported , which has resulted in significant underreporting of receipts , for some time ; has attempted to revise the reports but has not sent them to the frs board of governors ; uses a cash inventory system to prepare its monthly reports , but system limitations hinder the bank 's ability to track all detailed activities ; and could not timely provide all of the information needed to perform a comprehensive review of internal controls and accounting practices because of information storage and retrieval problems . gao also found that : a limited review of the bank 's currency accounts identified several internal control weaknesses that could affect general ledger entries and reconciliation attempts ; and other federal reserve banks that use the same cash inventory system could also be affected .
