patents and regulatory exclusivities have each been the subject of congressional interest in recent years . patents , which are administered by the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , allow for a uniform 20-year term of protection for a variety of inventions . in contrast , regulatory exclusivities apply to drugs and biologic medicines regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) . federal legislation establishes a complex range of regulatory exclusivities applicable to , among other subjects , new chemical entities , orphan drugs , and generic drugs . in general , these intellectual property rights require the fda to protect an approved drug from competing applications for a set period of time . patents and regulatory exclusivities each create intellectual property rights for their proprietors , but operate through distinct mechanisms . patents must be enforced through litigation in federal court and may be invalidated during judicial proceedings . in contrast , the fda ordinarily maintains regulatory exclusivities through agency procedures , without the intervention of the rights holder . unlike patents , regulatory exclusivities may restrict the sale of public domain medicines . and although patents traditionally provided a longer term of protection , more recently enacted regulatory exclusivities tend to have more comparable durations . the patent system has traditionally served as the primary innovation incentive for new medicines . but recent legislative trends may elevate the regulatory exclusivity from a supplemental protection scheme to the primary driver of innovation within the pharmaceutical industry . for example , the generating antibiotics incentives now ( gain ) act and the biologics price competition and innovation act created regulatory exclusivities of 10 to 12 years , respectively , for certain products . legislation introduced most recently before the 113th congress , the moddern cures act , h.r . 3116 , would have continued to expand the role of regulatory exclusivities . that unenacted legislation would have effectively allowed brand - name pharmaceutical firms , in certain circumstances , to exchange their patents for a 15-year period of regulatory exclusivity . while proponents of the legislation believe it would provide a more certain and effective innovation incentive for the pharmaceutical industry , others assert that it significantly expands intellectual property rights and represents a windfall for the brand - name drug industry . these proposals have been placed before the 114th congress in the form of a discussion draft of the 21st century cures act . congress has several options as it considers the relationship between patents and regulatory exclusivities . if the current situation is deemed satisfactory , then no action need be taken . other options include rationalizing the various terms of protection and scope of rights that regulatory exclusivities provide . congress may also consider providing distinct names for the regulatory exclusivities and ensuring that these rights do not remove safe and effective medicines from the public domain .
