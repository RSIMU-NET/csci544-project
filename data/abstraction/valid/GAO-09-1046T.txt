this testimony discusses u.s. diplomatic readiness , and in particular the staffing and foreign language challenges facing the foreign service . the department of state ( state ) faces an ongoing challenge of ensuring it has the right people , with the right skills , in the right places overseas to carry out the department 's priorities . in particular , state has long had difficulty staffing its hardship posts overseas , which are places like beruit and lagos , where conditions are difficult and sometimes dangerous due to harsh environmental and extreme living conditions that often entail pervasive crime or war , but are nonetheless integral to foreign policy priorities and need a full complement of qualified staff . state has also faced persistent shortages of staff with critical language skills , despite the importance of foreign language proficiency in advancing u.s. foreign policy and economic interests overseas . in recent years gao has issued a number of reports on human capital issues that have hampered state 's ability to carry out the president 's foreign policy objectives . this testimony discusses state 's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts , and state 's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements . despite a number of steps taken over a number of years , the state department continues to face persistent staffing and experience gaps at hardship posts , as well as notable shortfalls in foreign language capabilities . a common element of these problems has been a longstanding staffing and experience deficit , which has both contributed to the gaps at hardship posts and fueled the language shortfall by limiting the number of staff available for language training . state has undertaken several initiatives to address these shortages , including multiple staffing increases intended to fill the gaps . however , the department has not undertaken these initiatives in a comprehensive and strategic manner . as a result , it is unclear when the staffing and skill gaps that put diplomatic readiness at risk will close .
