the trade facilitation agreement ( tfa ) , finalized in december 2013 , is the newest international trade agreement in the world trade organization ( wto ) , having entered into force on february 22 , 2017 , when two - thirds of wto members , including the united states , ratified the multilateral agreement . congress has an interest in the tfa since it may affect u.s. trade flows , the u.s. economy , and international capacity building efforts . trade facilitation measures aim to simplify and streamline international trade procedures to allow the easier flow of trade across borders and thereby reduce the costs of trade . there is no precise definition of trade facilitation , even in the wto agreements . trade facilitation can be defined narrowly as improving administrative procedures at the border or more broadly to also encompass behind - the - border measures and regulations . the tfa aims to address multiple trade barriers confronted by exporters and importers , whether small and medium - sized enterprises engaged in e - commerce or large multinational firms managing complex global supply chains . these barriers include the lack of transparency on process and documentation requirements for exporting to a given country . according to wto estimates , global export gains from full implementation of the tfa could range from $ 750 billion to more than $ 3.6 trillion dollars per year . the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) finds that tfa implementation could lower trade costs as much as 12.5 % - 17.5 % globally . different sets of indicators and indices by various international organizations exist to measure levels of trade facilitation and could be used to monitor tfa effects . the tfa has three sections . the first section is the heart of the agreement , containing the provisions , of which many , but not all , are binding and enforceable . the second section provides for special and differential treatment for developing country members and least - developed country members , allowing them more time and assistance to implement the agreement . the tfa is the first wto agreement in which members determine their own implementation schedules and in which progress in implementation is explicitly linked to technical and financial capacity . the tfa requires that `` donor members , '' including the united states , provide the needed capacity building and support to developing and least - developed members . finally , the third section of the agreement contains the institutional arrangements for administering the tfa . existing and proposed u.s. free trade agreements ( ftas ) include trade facilitation commitments . while the wto tfa and u.s. ftas share common features , there are also differences . u.s. ftas generally include more enforceable provisions and specific time frames , and do not include special and differential treatment for developing country participants . u.s. implementation of the tfa does not require changes from current processes , including planned efforts to update u.s. systems . in the united states , the u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) seeks to balance its overarching objectives of promoting efficient trade flows with enforcing trade laws designed to protect consumers from dangerous and unlawful imports , and collecting customs duties . the cbp uses several instruments to collect information aimed at knowing who is importing and what types of goods are being imported , including the customs - trade partnership against terrorism ( c - tpat ) , the automated commercial environment ( ace ) , and the international trade data system ( itds ) . this report provides an overview of the tfa , its provisions , and the united states ' implementation and role in capacity building , and provides options for congress to consider in relation to the tfa .
