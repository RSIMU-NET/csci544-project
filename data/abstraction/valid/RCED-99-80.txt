pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the experiences of foreign countries that are consolidating their food safety responsibilities , focusing on the : reasons for and approaches taken to consolidation , the costs and savings , if any , associated with consolidation , and efforts to assess the effectiveness of the revised food safety systems ; and lessons that the united states might learn from these countries ' experiences in consolidating their food safety functions . gao noted that : the reasons the four countries have consolidated , or are in the process of consolidating , their organizational responsibilities for food safety activities differed , as did the approaches they took ; however , all four countries had similar views regarding the costs and benefits of consolidation and the need to evaluate their consolidation efforts ; in deciding to consolidate food safety responsibilities , two of the countries -- great britain and ireland -- were responding to public concerns about the safety of their food supplies and chose to consolidate responsibilities in the agencies that report to their ministers of health ; the other two countries -- canada and denmark -- were more concerned about program effectiveness and cost savings and consolidated activities in agencies that report to their ministers of agriculture , who already control most of the food safety resources ; all four countries are incurring short - term start - up costs in establishing their new agencies but are expecting long - term benefits in terms of money saved , more food safety for the money spent , and better assurance of food safety ; none of the countries had developed performance measures and data early in the consolidation process to assess the effectiveness of their new systems ; foreign officials identified several common lessons from their experiences that they believe could be broadly applicable to any u.s. consolidation effort ; in all four countries , a consensus had to be developed on the need to consolidate food safety responsibilities ; certain management initiatives were needed to establish any new agency ; adequate funding for start - up costs was also necessary ; furthermore , to help ensure the new agencies ' early success , critical operational concerns , such as having the flexibility to shift program resources to the highest food safety priorities , establishing a common organizational culture , and ensuring openness in the decisionmaking process , were important factors that had to be addressed ; and evaluation criteria and mechanisms need to be established early in the process in order to assess the new agency 's performance .
