lawmakers incorporated the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( h.r . 1 ) , the economic stimulus bill that the president signed into law on february 17 , 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 ) . the hitech act is intended to promote the widespread adoption of health information technology ( hit ) to support the electronic sharing of clinical data among hospitals , physicians , and other health care stakeholders . hit is widely viewed as a necessary and vital component of health care reform . it encompasses interoperable electronic health records ( ehrs ) — including computerized systems to order tests and medications , and support systems to aid clinical decision making — and the development of a national health information network to permit the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers . the hitech act builds on existing federal efforts to encourage hit adoption and use . it codifies the office of the national coordinator for health information technology ( onchit ) within the department of health and human services . onchit was created by executive order in 2004 and charged with developing and implementing a strategic plan to guide the nationwide implementation of health information technology ( hit ) in the public and private health care sectors . onchit has focused on developing standards necessary to achieve interoperability among varying hit applications ; establishing criteria for certifying that hit products meet those standards ; ensuring the privacy and security of electronic health information ; and helping facilitate the creation of prototype health information networks . the hitech act provides financial incentives for hit use among health care practitioners . it establishes several grant programs to provide funding for investing in hit infrastructure , purchasing certified ehrs , training , and the dissemination of best practices . it also authorizes grants to states for low - interest loans to help providers finance hit . beginning in 2011 , the legislation authorizes medicare incentive payments to encourage doctors and hospitals to adopt and use certified ehrs . those incentive payments are phased out over time and replaced by financial penalties for physicians and hospitals that are not using certified ehrs . the legislation further authorizes a 100 % federal match for payments to certain qualifying medicaid providers who acquire and use certified ehr technology . finally , the hitech act includes a series of privacy and security provisions that expand the current requirements under the health insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) . among other things , the legislation strengthens enforcement of the hipaa privacy rule and creates a right to be notified in the event of a breach of identifiable health information . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that medicare and medicaid spending under the hitech act will total $ 32.7 billion over the 2009-2019 period . cbo anticipates , however , that widespread hit adoption will reduce total spending on health care . through 2019 , cbo estimates that the hitech act will save the medicare and medicaid programs a total of about $ 12.5 billion . under current law , cbo predicts that about 45 % of hospitals and 65 % of physicians will have adopted hit by 2019. cbo estimates that the incentive mechanisms in the hitech act will boost those adoption rates to about 70 % for hospitals and about 90 % for physicians .
