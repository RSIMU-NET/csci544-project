since 1991 , dod has reported transferring more than $ 6 billion worth of its excess controlled and non - controlled personal property to more than 8,600 federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies through the leso program , which is managed by dla . according to dod , about 4 to 7 percent of the total excess property transferred is controlled property , which typically involves sensitive equipment and items that can not be released to the public . the national defense authorization act of 2016 included a provision that gao conduct an assessment of dod 's excess property program . this report addresses the extent to which dla has taken actions to enhance processes , including internal controls , related to its transfers of excess controlled property ; and dla has addressed the statutory requirement to maintain a public internet site that provides transparency about controlled property transfers and about the recipients of such property . gao reviewed dod policies and procedures , interviewed cognizant officials , and conducted independent testing of leso 's application and dla 's transfer process . the defense logistics agency ( dla ) has taken some actions and is planning additional actions to address identified weaknesses in its excess controlled property program . however , internal control deficiencies exist for , among other things , ensuring that only eligible applicants are approved to participate in the law enforcement support office ( leso ) program and receive transfers of excess controlled property . dla is establishing memorandums of understanding with participating federal agencies intended to , among other things , establish general terms and conditions for participation , revise its program application to require additional prospective participant information , and plans to provide additional online training for participating agencies that is expected to begin in late 2017. however , gao created a fictitious federal agency to conduct independent testing of the leso program 's internal controls and dla 's transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies . through the testing , gao gained access to the leso program and obtained over 100 controlled items with an estimated value of $ 1.2 million , including night - vision goggles , simulated rifles , and simulated pipe bombs , which could be potentially lethal items if modified with commercially available items ( see photos ) . gao 's testing identified that dla has deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of federal law enforcement agency applications and in the transfer of controlled property , such as dla personnel not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer . further , gao found that dla has not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the leso program , including the application process . without strengthening dla and leso program internal controls over the approval and transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies , such as reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment , dla lacks reasonable assurance that it has the ability to prevent , detect , and respond to potential fraud and minimize associated security risks . examples of controlled property items obtained dla maintains a public internet site to address statutory requirements to provide information on all property transfers to law enforcement agencies . dla 's public internet site shows all transferred property , and , as of april 2017 , in response to gao 's findings , has included a definition of controlled property to distinguish for the general public what items are considered controlled . gao is making four recommendations to dla , including strengthening internal controls over the approval and transfer of dod excess controlled property to law enforcement agencies , and conducting a fraud risk assessment to institute comprehensive fraud prevention and mitigation measures . dod concurred with all four recommendations and highlighted actions to address each one .
