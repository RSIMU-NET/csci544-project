payments to farmers under federal farm programs have reached an historic high -- over $ 20 billion in fiscal year 2000. nearly half of u.s. farms are receiving payments for income or price support purposes and / or for engaging in activities such as land conservation . these payments , in total , made up almost one - half of net farm income in fiscal year 2000. despite the annual influx of billions of federal dollars to the farm sector , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) reports that the number of farms has been declining about one percent per year , with the most notable declines in small family farms and young farmers . gao reviewed usda 's annual surveys of u.s. farm operations -- called the agricultural resource management study -- and state and crop information from its program payments reporting system to determine the distribution of farm payments over the past decade by farm size , operators ' age , state , and crop and identify the major barriers that make it difficult for young people to enter farming . gao found that in recent years , over 80 percent of farm payments have been made to large - and medium - sized farms , while small farms have received less than 20 percent of the payments . even though small farms substantially outnumber medium and large farms , because payments are generally based on volume of production , the average payment to small farms was much less than the average payment to medium and large farms . the distribution pattern for 1999 was similar to that of the other years during the past decade , but the portion of the payments going to large farms has increased and the portion going to small farms has decreased since 1996. farmers under age 35 received about 6 percent of farm payments while farmers ages 35 through 54 received 56 percent of the payments . farm payments are principally directed at producers of eight major crops : wheat , corn , barley , oats , sorghum , rice , cotton , and oilseeds , . all states received a portion of payments , but six states -- iowa , illinois , texas , kansas , nebraska , and minnesota -- together received almost half of the payments in 1999. the major obstacle facing young people who wish to enter farming is the high cost of acquiring the needed assets , principally farmland and farm machinery . although farm program payments can help beginning farmers once they have started farming , the payments can also present a hurdle because their value is reflected in a higher price to buy or lease the farmland .
