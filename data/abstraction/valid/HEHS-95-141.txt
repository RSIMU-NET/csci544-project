pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the national cancer institute ( nci ) - sponsored clinical trials of the anticancer drug hydrazine sulfate , focusing on : nci protocol design and data management procedures ; how nci and the trials ' investigators dealt with the drug 's potential incompatibility with certain agents ; the extent to which patients received these incompatible agents ; and how the investigators reported the issue . gao found that : the three large nci - sponsored clinical trials showed that the drug did not prolong cancer patients ' survival ; controversy surrounding the trials focused on trial participants ' use of tranquilizers , barbiturates , and alcohol , which were allegedly incompatible with the drug ; clinical trial records showed that participants used tranquilizers under varying circumstances , particularly for relief from vomiting ; the investigators believed that it was unethical to withhold antiemetic medications from patients undergoing chemotherapy ; subsequent analyses of patients ' use of concurrent medications did not invalidate nci conclusions that the drug was ineffective ; the food and drug administration ( fda ) may have contributed to the confusion surrounding the trials due to its more conservative position on how the drug should be administered to some patients ; although fda approved more than 70 applications permitting the use of hydrazine sulfate , it cautioned physicians about their patients ' use of tranquilizing agents while on the drug ; there were lapses in recordkeeping and reporting because nci did not require complete and accurate research records on the patients ' use of tranquilizing agents during the trials ; and nci - sponsored investigators only recently analyzed this issue , since published results did not accurately describe the widespread use of tranquilizers during the trials .
