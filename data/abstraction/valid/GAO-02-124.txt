the department of defense ( dod ) awarded contracts to three companies in 1990 to develop and test exoatmospheric kill vehicles . one of the contractors -- boeing north american -- subcontracted with trw to develop software for the kill vehicle . in 1998 , boeing became the lead system integrator for the national missile defense program , and chose raytheon as the primary kill vehicle developer . boeing and trw reported that the june 1997 flight test achieved its primary objectives , but that some sensor abnormalities were detected . the project office relied on boeing to oversee the performance of trw . boeing and trw reported that deployed target objects displayed distinguishable features when being observed by an infrared sensor . after considerable debate , the program manager reduced the number of decoys planned for intercept flight tests in response to a recommendation by an independent panel . the phase one engineering team , which was responsible for completing an assessment of trw 's software performance within two months using available data , found that although the software had weaknesses , it was well designed and worked properly , with only some changes needed to increase the robustness of the discrimination function . on the basis of that analysis , team members predicted that the software would perform successfully in a future intercept test if target objects deployed as expected .
