recent international negotiations and domestic policy developments have generated interest in current and projected u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emission levels . ghg emissions are generated throughout the united states from millions of discrete sources . of the ghg source categories , carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions from fossil fuel combustion account for the largest percentage ( 77 % ) of total u.s. ghg emissions . the electric power sector contributes the second - largest percentage ( 35 % ) of co2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion ( 1 percentage point behind the transportation sector ) . in december 2015 , delegations from 195 nations , including the united states , adopted an agreement in paris that creates an international structure for nations to pledge to abate their ghg emissions , adapt to climate change , and cooperate to achieve these ends , including financial and other support . pursuant to that agreement , the united states pledged ( in 2015 ) to reduce ghg emissions by 26-28 % by 2025 compared to 2005 levels . at the date of this report , u.s. involvement in the paris agreement remains uncertain . however , some recent reports indicate that president trump is expected to withdraw from the agreement . u.s. ghg levels in 2015 were 11 % below 2005 levels . whether the united states achieves its goals would likely depend , to some degree , on co2 emissions from power plants . in 2015 , under president obama , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) promulgated standards for co2 emissions from existing electric power plants . the rule , known as the clean power plan ( cpp ) , is the subject of ongoing litigation involving a number of entities . on february 9 , 2016 , the supreme court stayed the rule for the duration of the litigation . multiple factors generally impact co2 emission levels from the electric power sector . some factors are listed below in no particular order : economic growth / recession , relative prices of energy sources for electricity â€” particularly natural gas and renewable energy sources , electricity generation portfolio ( i.e . , the ratio of electricity generation from coal , natural gas , and renewable energy sources ) , national and / or state policy developments ( e.g . , cpp implementation ) , and demand - side efficiency improvements ( e.g . , commercial and residential electricity use ) . recent changes in the electric power sector may be informative . between 1975 and 2010 , electricity generation and co2 emissions from the electric power sector generally increased . however , in 2010 , their courses diverged . while electricity generation remained relatively flat after 2010 , co2 emissions from the electric power sector decreased . thus in 2016 , electricity generation was essentially equivalent to generation in 2005 , while co2 emissions were 25 % below 2005 levels . recent changes in the u.s. electricity generation portfolio played a key role in the co2 emission decrease . the electricity portfolio affects co2 emission levels because different sources of electricity generation produce different rates of co2 emissions per unit of electricity ( zero in the case of some renewables ) . for example , between 2005 and 2016 , coal 's contribution to total electricity generation decreased from 50 % to 30 % ; natural gas 's contribution to total electricity generation increased from 19 % to 34 % ; and renewable energy 's contribution to total electricity generation increased from 2 % to 8 % . accurately forecasting future co2 emission levels is a complex and challenging endeavor . a comparison of actual co2 emissions ( from energy use ) between 1990 and 2017 with selected emission projections illustrates this difficulty . in general , actual emissions have remained well below projections . as the future of the cpp is uncertain , some have questioned whether existing policies and trends in electricity generation would continue to lower co2 emissions . modeling results indicate that co2 emissions in the electricity sector are expected to continue declining . however , modeling results indicate that the declines would be substantially greater if the cpp were implemented .
