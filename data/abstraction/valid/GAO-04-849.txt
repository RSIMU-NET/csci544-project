since the passage of the credit union membership access act of 1998 ( cumaa ) , many in the credit union industry have sought legislative changes to the net worth ratio central to prompt corrective action ( pca ) . the current debate centers on the issue of allowing federally insured credit unions to include additional forms of capital within the definition of net worth . in light of the issues surrounding the debate , gao reviewed the underlying concerns that have prompted the credit union industry 's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements , the issues associated with the potential use of secondary capital in all federally insured credit unions , and the issues associated with the potential use of risk - based capital in all federally insured credit unions . the credit union industry 's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements for credit unions appears to be driven by three primary concerns : that restricting the definition of net worth solely to retained earnings could trigger pca actions due to conditions beyond credit unions ' control ; that pca in its present form acts as a restraint on credit union growth ; and that pca tripwires , or triggers for corrective action , are too high given the conservative risk profile of most credit unions . despite these concerns , available indicators suggest that the credit union industry has not been overly constrained as a result of the implementation of pca . as a group , credit unions have maintained capital levels well above the level needed to be considered well - capitalized and have grown at rates exceeding those of other depository institutions during the three calendar years that pca has been in place for credit unions . allowing credit unions to use secondary capital instruments to meet their regulatory net worth requirements would raise a number of issues and concerns , with perhaps the most important issue centering on who would purchase the secondary capital instruments . while outside investors would provide market discipline , this would raise concerns about the potential impact on the member - owned , cooperative structure of credit unions . inside investors , however , could impose less discipline and raise systemic risk concerns if it resulted in a situation where weaker credit unions could bring down stronger credit unions due to secondary capital investments . other issues relate to the specific form of the capital instruments for credit unions . the credit union industry itself appeared divided on the desirability or appropriate structure of secondary capital instruments . conceptually , the use of risk - based capital to address the concerns some in the credit union industry expressed about pca is less controversial . though two risk - based capital proposals were put forward , neither has garnered industry consensus and both lacked details of key components upon which to base any assessment of their merits . risk - based capital is intended to reflect the unique risk profile of individual financial institutions ; however , there are other factors that can affect an institution 's financial condition that are not easily quantified . in recognition of the limitations of risk - based capital systems , bank and thrift regulators use leverage and risk - based capital requirements in tandem . gao is aware that ncua is constructing a more detailed risk - based capital proposal that incorporates both risk - based and leverage requirements ; however due to the lack of formalized details , gao could not perform a meaningful assessment of the proposal .
