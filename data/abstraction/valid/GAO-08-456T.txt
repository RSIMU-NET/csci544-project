transportation security administration ( tsa ) funding for aviation security has totaled about $ 26 billion since fiscal year 2004. this testimony focuses on tsa 's efforts to secure the commercial aviation system through passenger screening , air cargo , and watch - list matching programs , and challenges remaining in these areas . gao 's comments are based on gao products issued between february 2004 and april 2007 , including selected updates in february 2008. this testimony also addresses tsa 's progress in developing the secure flight program , based on work conducted from august 2007 to january 2008. to conduct this work , gao reviewed systems development , privacy , and other documentation , and interviewed department of homeland security ( dhs ) , tsa , and contractor officials . dhs and tsa have undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen the security of the nation 's commercial aviation system , including actions to address many recommendations made by gao . tsa has focused its efforts on , among other things , more efficiently allocating , deploying , and managing the transportation security officer ( tso ) workforce -- formerly known as screeners ; strengthening screening procedures ; developing and deploying more effective and efficient screening technologies ; strengthening domestic air cargo security ; and developing a government operated watch - list matching program , known as secure flight . specifically , tsa developed and implemented a staffing allocation model to determine tso staffing levels at airports that reflect current operating conditions , and proposed and implemented modifications to passenger checkpoint screening procedures based on risk information . however , gao reported that some assumptions in tsa 's staffing allocation model did not accurately reflect airport operating conditions , and that tsa could improve its process for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed procedural changes . in response , tsa developed a plan to review staffing allocation model assumptions and took steps to strengthen its evaluation of proposed procedural changes . tsa has also explored new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to better detect explosives and other threats and has taken steps to strengthen air cargo security , including conducting vulnerability assessments at airports and compliance inspections of air carriers . however , tsa has not developed an inspection plan that included performance goals and measures to determine whether air carriers transporting cargo into the united states were complying with security requirements . in response to gao 's recommendations , tsa has since established a working group to strengthen its compliance activities . finally , tsa has instilled more discipline and rigor into secure flight 's systems development , including preparing key documentation and strengthening privacy protections . while these efforts should be commended , gao has identified several areas that should be addressed to further strengthen aviation security . for example , tsa has made limited progress in developing and deploying checkpoint technologies due to planning and management challenges . further , tsa continues to face some program management challenges in developing secure flight . specifically , tsa has not developed program cost and schedule estimates consistent with best practices ; fully implemented its risk management plan ; planned for system end - to - end testing in test plans ; and ensured that information security requirements are fully implemented . if these challenges are not addressed effectively , the risk of the program not being completed on schedule and within estimated costs is increased , and the chances of it performing as intended are diminished . dhs and tsa lack performance measures to fully evaluate the effectiveness of current processes for passengers who apply for redress due to inconveniences experienced during the check - in and screening process . without such measures , dhs and tsa lack a sound basis to monitor the effectiveness of the redress process .
