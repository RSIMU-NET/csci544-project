the basel iii capital accord , which was produced by the basel committee on banking supervision at the bank for international settlements , is the latest in a series of evolving agreements among central banks and bank supervisory authorities from around the world to establish minimum capital requirements for financial institutions . capital serves as a cushion against sudden financial shocks ( such as an unusually high occurrence of loan defaults ) , which can otherwise lead to insolvency . the basel iii regulatory reform package revises the definition of regulatory capital and increases the amount that must be held by banking organizations . basel iii also recommends holding more assets that can easily be converted to cash to shield against temporary decreases in liquidity . the quantitative requirements and phase - in schedules for basel iii were approved by the 27-member jurisdictions and 44 central banks and supervisory authorities on september 12 , 2010 , and endorsed by the g20 leaders on november 12 , 2010. basel iii requires banks to satisfy all of these enhanced requirements by 2019. in the united states , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ( dodd - frank act ; p.l . 111-203 ) also addressed capital reserve requirements for banks . the collins amendment of the dodd - frank act amends the definition of capital ; establishes minimum capital and leverage requirements for banking subsidiaries , bank holding companies , and systemically important non - bank financial companies ; and establishes an implementation timeline that is shorter than the timeline agreed to in the basel iii accord . in addition , dodd - frank removes the requirement that credit ratings be referenced when evaluating the creditworthiness of financial securities . in other words , bank regulators ( e.g . , the federal reserve , the office of the comptroller of the currency , and the federal deposit insurance corporation ) are required to find other appropriate standards by which to determine the financial risks of bank portfolio holdings while enforcing the mandatory capital requirements . regulators face challenges in their attempt to establish credit rating alternatives , which may delay the implementation of basel iii in the united states . bank lending decisions and strategies , therefore , may also be delayed in anticipation of higher capital reserve requirements stemming from implementation of basel iii and the dodd - frank act . bankers may prefer knowing how much more capital they would need to hold before greatly expanding their lending portfolios with longer - term assets . this report discusses how the basel capital accord framework has been modified as well as subsequent implementation issues in the united states . the report explains how the basel committee on banking supervision incorporates credit ratings into the regulatory framework whereas the dodd - frank act eliminates references to credit ratings in federal financial regulation , and how this may complicate the adoption of subsequent phases of the basel framework , namely basel ii.5 and basel iii . the regulators issued a proposed rule in december 2011 for implementing basel ii.5 , which may help to inform the future contours of basel iii implementation in the united states . the report also summarizes the enhanced capital and liquidity requirements associated with basel iii , related provisions in the dodd - frank act , and some remaining implementation concerns .
