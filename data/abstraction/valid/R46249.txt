this report uses the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) farm income projections ( as of february 5 , 2020 ) to describe the u.s. farm economic outlook for 2020. two major indicators of u.s. farm well - being are net farm income and net cash income . net farm income represents an accrual of the value of all goods and serviced produced on the farm during the yearâsimilar in concept to gross domestic product . in contrast , net cash income uses a cash flow concept to measure farm well - being : only cash transactions for the year are included . thus , crop production is recorded as net farm income immediately after harvest , whereas net cash income records a crop 's value only after it has been sold in the marketplace . according to usda 's economic research service ( ers ) , national net farm income is forecast at $ 96.7 billion in 2020 , up $ 3.1 billion ( +3.3 % ) from 2019. the forecast rise in 2020 net farm income stands in contrast with a projected decline of over $ 10.8 billion in net cash income ( - 9.0 % ) . last year 's ( 2019 ) net cash income forecast included $ 14.7 billion in sales of on - farm crop inventories , which helped to inflate the 2019 net cash income value to $ 120.4 billion . the 2020 net cash income forecast includes a much smaller amount ( $ 0.5 billion ) in sales from on - farm inventories , thus contributing to the decline from 2019. government direct support payments to the agricultural sector are expected to continue to play an important role in farm income projections . usda projects $ 15 billion in farm support outlays for 2020 , including the $ 3.7 billion of 2019 market facilitation program ( mfp ) paymentsâthe third and final tranche of payments under the $ 14.5 billion program . if realized , the 2020 government payments of $ 15 billion would represent a 36.6 % decline from 2019 but would still be the second largest since 2006. the $ 23.6 billion in federal payments in 2019 was the largest taxpayer transfer to the agriculture sector ( in absolute dollars ) since 2005. the surge in federal subsidies in 2019 was driven by large payments ( estimated at $ 14.3 billion ) under the mfp initiated by usda in response to the u.s. - china trade dispute . the administration has not announced a new mfp for 2020. weather conditions and planting prospects for 2020 are unknown this early in the year . commodity prices are under pressure from abundant global supplies and uncertain export prospects . despite the signing of a phase i trade agreement with china on january 15 , 2020 , it is unclear how soonâif at allâthe united states may resume normal trade with china or how international demand may evolve in 2020. farm asset value in 2020 is projected up year - to - year at $ 3.1 trillion ( +1.3 % ) . farm asset values reflect farm investors ' and lenders ' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investments . another critical measure of the farm sector 's well - being is aggregate farm debt , which is projected to be at a record $ 425.3 billion in 2020âup 2.3 % from 2019. both the debt - to - asset and the debt - to - equity ratios have risen for eight consecutive years , potentially suggesting a continued slow erosion of the u.s. farm sector 's financial situation . at the farm household level , average farm household incomes have been well above average u.s. household incomes since the late 1990s . however , this advantage derives primarily from off - farm income as a share of farm household total income . since 2014 , over half of u.s. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations . this report uses the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) farm income projections ( as of february 5 , 2020 ) to describe the u.s. farm economic outlook for 2020. two major indicators of u.s. farm well -
