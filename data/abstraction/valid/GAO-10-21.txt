surface coal mining in the mountainous areas of appalachia -- often called `` mountaintop mining '' -- generates controversy , in part because of its scale and the post - mining appearance of the land . yet there is limited public access to information on the size , location , and life span of these operations , or on how the land can be expected to look afterward . the government accountability office ( gao ) was asked to report on the characteristics of surface coal mining and reclaimed lands that were disturbed by surface coal mining in the mountainous , eastern part of kentucky and in west virginia , where most such mining occurs . federal and state law requires mining operators to obtain permits before mining . among other things , the permits identify the acres under open permit ( the acres subject to mining associated with a permit that has not been closed ) and how the land will be reclaimed -- including the post - mining land use , whether the approximate original contour ( aoc ) of the land will be restored , and the extent to which excess earth , rock , and other materials ( known as `` spoil '' ) are placed in nearby valleys . for this study , gao relied on electronic databases of mining permits maintained by kentucky and west virginia . this report makes no recommendations . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the interior and the two state mining agencies generally agreed with our findings surface coal mining in kentucky and west virginia had the following important characteristics , based on permits issued from january 1990 through july 2008 : the number of acres under open permit increased by an average annual rate of 2.2 percent in kentucky and 1.7 percent in west virginia ; the number of acres under open permit became more geographically concentrated ; the length of time that permits were open varied from less than a year to more than 18 years ; in west virginia , 28 contiguously permitted areas contained nearly half of the permitted acres , as of july 2008. reclaimed lands had the following important characteristics , based on permits issued from january 2000 through july 2008 : the most common type of post - mining land use in kentucky was fish and wildlife habitat and , in west virginia , it was forestlandl ; most permits required operators to reclaim the land to aoc , but there were some exceptions ( called variances ) . most of the variances were for lands where there was insufficient spoil to restore aoc because the land had been previously mined but not reclaimed ; kentucky and west virginia collectively approved nearly 2,000 fills to store at least 4.9 billion cubic yards of excess spoil in nearby valleys .
