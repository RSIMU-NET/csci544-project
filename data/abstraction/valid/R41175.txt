the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) opened for signature in 1992 and soon thereafter was ratified by the united states . the unfccc does not set greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions reduction targets , and during ratification hearings , the george h.w . bush administration represented that any protocol or amendment to the unfccc creating binding ghg emissions targets would be submitted to the senate for its advice and consent . the kyoto protocol ( the protocol ) to the unfccc was intended as a first step towards implementing the unfccc . to that end , it sets quantitative emission reduction targets for the high income countries listed in its annex b. the protocol 's goal is to reduce each parties ' overall emissions by at least 5 % below 1990 levels by 2012. although the united states signed the protocol in 1998 , it did not submit the protocol to the senate . the george w. bush administration announced in 2001 that it would not pursue u.s. accession to the protocol . the obama administration has followed this policy . in 2007 , the un climate change conference in bali adopted a framework for negotiations over the post - 2012 climate regime . it established two tracks for negotiation : ( 1 ) a track by which kyoto protocol parties would pursue an amendment to the protocol for a `` second round '' of emission targets for its annex b parties , and ( 2 ) a track by which unfccc parties would set ghg mitigation targets or actions for all parties . however , consensus under either track proved difficult to achieve at the 2009 copenhagen conference of the parties . the outcome , the copenhagen accord ( the accord ) , is consequently considered a non - binding political agreement . the accord allows each high income party listed in annex i of the unfccc to define its own ghg emissions target level . `` non - annex i '' parties wishing to associate with the accord must identify and commit to undertaking `` nationally appropriate mitigation actions , '' which may receive international support subject to certain international reporting requirements . the labels `` convention , '' `` protocol , '' and `` accord '' are not clear indicators of whether these three climate change agreements are binding internationally and / or domestically . under international law , an agreement is considered binding only if it conveys the intention of its parties to create legally binding relationships and has entered into force . however , some have suggested that enforceability , rather than intentions , should govern whether an agreement is `` legally binding . . under u.s. law , a legally binding international agreement may take the form of a treaty or an executive agreement . in order for the united states to enter a treaty , the agreement must be approved by a two - thirds majority of the senate and subsequently be ratified by the president . an executive agreement does not require the senate 's advice and consent in order to be legally binding . historically , executive agreements have arisen in a limited set of circumstances , and certain subjects , including significant global environmental issues , have traditionally been handled as treaties that require the senate 's approval . of the three agreements discussed , only the unfccc and the kyoto protocol are considered legally binding agreements under international law , and the united states is bound only by the former . the united states has , however , indicated its intent to associate with the copenhagen accord . in doing so , it voluntarily committed to reduce u.s. emissions by 17 % below 2005 levels by 2020. the accord does not implicate the treaty power of congress , which will likely shape the domestic effect of the copenhagen accord through appropriations and lawmaking . the accord does not appear to empower the executive to implement it solely by agency actions .
