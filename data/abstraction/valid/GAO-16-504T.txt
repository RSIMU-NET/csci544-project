high - speed internet service is viewed as a critical component of the nation 's infrastructure and an economic driver , particularly to remote tribal communities . this testimony examines : perspectives of tribes and providers on high - speed internet access and barriers to increasing this access ; the level of interrelation and coordination between federal programs that promote high - speed internet access on tribal lands ; and existing data and performance measures related to high - speed internet on tribal lands . this statement is based on gao 's january 2016 report ( gao - 16-222 ) . for this report , gao visited or interviewed officials from a non - generalizable sample of 21 tribal entities and 6 service providers . gao also reviewed fcc and usda fiscal year 2010 through 2014 program data , funding , and materials and interviewed federal officials . in january 2016 , gao found that , although all 21 tribes gao interviewed have some access to high - speed internet , barriers to increasing access remain . tribal officials and internet providers said that high poverty rates among tribes and the high costs of connecting remote tribal villages to core internet networks limit high - speed internet availability and access . about half of the tribes gao interviewed also said that the lack of sufficient administrative and technical expertise among tribal members limits their efforts to increase high - speed internet access . the federal communications commission 's ( fcc ) universal service fund subsidy programs and the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) rural utilities service grant programs are interrelated . the programs seek to increase high - speed internet access in underserved areas , including tribal lands . gao 's previous work on overlap , duplication , and fragmentation has shown that interagency coordination on interrelated programs can help ensure efficient use of resources and effective programs . however , fcc and usda do not coordinate to develop joint outreach and training , which could result in inefficient use of federal resources and missed opportunities for resource leveraging . for example , usda and fcc held separate training events in the pacific northwest region in 2015 when a joint event could have saved limited training funds and reduced costs . fcc has placed special emphasis on improving internet access on tribal lands following the issuance of the national broadband plan in 2010 , which called for greater efforts to make broadband available on tribal lands . however , fcc has not developed performance goals and measures for improving high - speed internet availability to households on tribal lands . fcc could establish baseline measures to track its progress by using , for example , the national broadband map which includes data on internet availability on tribal lands . fcc also lacks both reliable data on high - speed internet access and performance goals and measures for high - speed internet access by tribal institutions — such as schools and libraries . specifically , fcc 's e - rate program provides funds to ensure that schools and libraries have affordable access to modern broadband technologies , but fcc has neither defined “ tribal ” on its e - rate application nor set any performance goals for the program 's impact on tribal institutions . without these goals and measures fcc can not assess the impact of its efforts . in january 2016 , gao recommended that fcc take the following actions in tribal areas : develop joint training and outreach with usda ; develop performance goals and measures for improving broadband availability to households ; develop performance goals and measures for improving broadband availability to schools and libraries ; and improve the reliability of fcc data related to institutions that receive e - rate funding by defining “ tribal ” on the program application . fcc agreed with the recommendations .
