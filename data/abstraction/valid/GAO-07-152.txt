underground storage tanks that leak hazardous substances can contaminate nearby groundwater and soil . under the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , tank owners and operators are primarily responsible for paying to clean up releases from their tanks . they can demonstrate their financial responsibility by using , among other options , publicly funded state financial assurance funds . such funds function like insurance and are intended to ensure timely cleanup . these funds also pay to clean up releases from tanks without a viable owner , as does the federal leaking underground storage tank ( lust ) trust fund . gao was asked to report on states ' estimates of the public costs to clean up known releases , states ' primary sources of cleanups funding and their viability , and federal sources to address these releases . gao surveyed all states and discussed key issues with epa and selected state officials . states estimated that fully cleaning up about 54,000 of the approximately 117,000 releases ( leaks ) known to them as of september 30 , 2005 , will cost about $ 12 billion in public funds . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) estimates that it costs an average of about $ 125,000 to fully clean up a release . state officials said that tank owners or operators will pay to clean up most of the remaining 63,000 releases . however , an unknown number of releases lack a viable owner , and the full extent of the cost to clean them up is unknown . a tank owner may not be viable because the owner fails to maintain adequate financial responsibility coverage , which is intended to provide some assurance that the owner has access to funds to pay for cleanups . while 16 states require annual proof of coverage , 25 states check owners ' coverage less often or not at all . furthermore , 43 states expect to confirm about 16,700 new releases in the next 5 years that will require at least some public funds for cleanup . states reported that they primarily use financial assurance funds to pay the costs of cleaning up leaks . states reported that they spent an estimated $ 1.032 billion from financial assurance funds to clean up tank releases in 2005. overall , fund revenues totaled about $ 1.4 billion in 2005 , of which about $ 1.3 billion came from state gasoline taxes . the assurance funds in the 39 states for which gao has information held an estimated $ 1.3 billion as of september 30 , 2005 , according to state officials . however , many states also use these funds to clean up releases from sources other than underground tanks . several state assurance funds may lack sufficient resources to ensure timely cleanups . while epa monitors the status of state funds , its method of monitoring the soundness of these funds has limitations . furthermore , there are concerns that , by paying the bulk of the cleanup costs , state financial assurance funds may provide disincentives for tank owners -- who pay only a relatively small deductible -- to prevent releases . in addition to their own funds , states employ resources from the lust trust fund , the primary federal source of funds for cleaning up releases from underground storage tanks . as of september 30 , 2005 , the fund balance was about $ 2.5 billion . for fiscal year 2005 , the congress appropriated about $ 70 million from the fund to help epa and the states clean up releases and to oversee cleanup activities . epa distributed about $ 58 million of this amount to the states to investigate and clean up releases and conduct enforcement efforts , among other actions . to distribute lust trust fund money among the states , epa uses a formula that includes a base amount for each state and factors to recognize states ' needs and past cleanup performance . however , although the lust trust fund provides funds to states to assist in addressing releases from tanks without a viable owner , epa has not incorporated this factor into its formula . furthermore , epa 's information on states ' performance comes from state reports ; however , gao found that some of the information in these reports is inaccurate and inconsistent .
