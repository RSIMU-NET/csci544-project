the united states is a party to numerous security agreements with other nations . the topics covered , along with the significance of the obligations imposed upon agreement parties , may vary . some international security agreements entered by the united states , such as those obliging parties to come to the defense of another in the event of an attack , involve substantial commitments and have traditionally been entered as treaties , ratified with the advice and consent of the senate . other agreements dealing with more technical matters , such as military basing rights or the application of a host country 's laws to u.s. forces stationed within , are entered more routinely and usually take a form other than treaty ( i.e . , as an executive agreement or a nonlegal political commitment ) . occasionally , the substance and form of a proposed security agreement may become a source of dispute between congress and the executive branch . in late 2007 , the bush administration announced its intention to negotiate a long - term security agreement with iraq that would have committed the united states to provide security assurances to iraq and maintain a long - term military presence in that country . this announcement became a source of congressional interest , in part because of statements by administration officials that such an agreement would not be submitted to the legislative branch for approval . congressional concern dissipated when u.s. - iraq negotiations culminated in an agreement that did not contain a long - term security commitment by the united states , but instead called for the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq by december 31 , 2011. on may 2 , 2012 , president barack obama and president hamid karzai signed the enduring strategic partnership agreement between the united states of america and the islamic republic of afghanistan . under the terms of the agreement , the parties pledge to work cooperatively in a number of fields , including to promote shared democratic values , advance long - term security , reinforce regional security , advance social and economic development , and strengthen afghan institutions and governance . additionally , the agreement provides that the united states and afghanistan shall initiate negotiations on a bilateral security agreement ( with the goal of concluding such an agreement within a year ) , which is intended to replace the existing agreement relating to the status of military and civilian personnel currently in afghanistan . it is likely that future disputes will arise between the political branches regarding the entering or implementation of international security agreements . regardless of the form a security arrangement may take , congress has several tools to exercise oversight regarding the negotiation , form , conclusion , and implementation of the agreement by the united states . this report begins by providing a general background on the types of international agreements that are binding upon the united states , as well as considerations affecting whether they take the form of a treaty or an executive agreement . next , the report discusses historical precedents as to the role that security agreements have taken , with specific attention paid to past agreements entered with afghanistan , germany , japan , south korea , the philippines , and iraq . the report discusses the oversight role that congress exercises with respect to entering and implementing international agreements involving the united states .
