gao discussed the possible implications of proposed legislation that would give new personnel flexibility to the internal revenue service ( irs ) . gao noted that : it examined two bills that would give irs new flexibilities in managing its workforce : h.r . 2676 and s. 1174 ; the bills are similar in that both would give irs additional flexibilities relating to performance management , staffing , and the development of demonstration projects ; until the commissioner of irs develops an implementation plan , acting in accordance with both the new legislation and those provisions of title 5 to which irs would remain subject , and has some experience in implementing the new flexibilities , there is no way to predict just how helpful the new flexibilities may be in improving irs ' actual performance ; gao believes that h.r . 2676 appropriately gives irs the opportunity to factor in other measures , such as customer service results and employee behavior ; the proposals for new personnel flexibility at irs are a part of a broader set of proposals to restructure the agency and improve its performance ; gao has recognized that to manage effectively for results , agencies need the flexibility to manage according to their needs and mission ; gao also found that , over the years , title 5 has evolved to give federal agencies more flexibility than they once had -- and often more then they realize -- to tailor their personnel approaches to their missions and needs ; the merit principles and certain other national goals such as veterans ' preference remain generally applicable to employees of all agencies ; both h.r . 2676 and s. 1174 , while giving new personnel flexibilities to irs beyond those already available to it under title 5 , would specifically require that the agency continue to conform to the merit principles and other national goals ; the proposals in h.r . 2676 and s. 1174 have been developed to provide irs exceptions from various title 5 personnel requirements that irs believes impede its ability to accomplish its mission ; the bills ' provisions encouraging irs to align its employees ' performance with irs mission and goals are consistent with other public - and private - sector organizational trends that have been given congressional endorsement through the passage of the government performance and results act ; and these proposals do not make clear the office of personnel management 's role of ensuring irs ' continued compliance with the merit principles .
