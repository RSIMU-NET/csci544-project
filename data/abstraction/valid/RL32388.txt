this report is a companion to crs report rl30795 , general management laws : a compendium ( pdf ) ( hereafter `` compendium '' ) . in combination , these reports have three main objectives : ( 1 ) to identify and describe the major management laws under which the executive branch is required to operate , including their rationale , design , and scope ; ( 2 ) to assist members of congress and their staff in oversight of executive branch management ; and ( 3 ) to help congress when considering potential changes to the management laws , as well as other legislation , including authorization statutes and appropriations . this report focuses on major themes — and possible policy options for congress — that emerge when the general management laws are viewed together , as a whole . the report also describes historical context of the roles that congress and the president play in managing the executive branch , and compares management in the public and private sectors . the themes and policy options address five topics . discretion for the executive branch : congress frequently faces the issue of how much discretion to give the executive branch . congress has options to address delegation situations and balance agency flexibility with accountability . standardization vs. customization : should the management laws under which agencies operate be standardized , with uniform rules ? . or should some agencies have customized , agency - specific laws ? . should there be a mix of the two approaches ? . congress has options when confronted with these decisions . functional silos vs. integrated general management : a functional perspective ( e.g . , looking at agency operations from the perspective of a budget officer or human resources officer ) can boost efficiency . however , if functional orientations become inward - looking , functions can operate in isolation , resulting in coordination problems or missed opportunities . congress has options to use an integrated general management perspective to solve agency management problems . making and measuring progress : many executive branch agencies suffer from persistent , major management problems . often these problems relate to areas the general management laws were intended to address . congress has options for measuring and motivating agency progress in improving management practices . agency `` chief officers '' and interagency councils : statutorily created `` chief officers '' ( e.g . , chief financial officers and chief acquisition officers ) have increased in number in federal agencies . congress also established interagency councils of these officers . congress has options when considering whether additional chief officers should be established and how the councils could be more accountable . the report reflects the status of general management laws at the end of the first session of the 108th congress , and will be updated along with the compendium to reflect actions taken through the close of the 108th congress .
