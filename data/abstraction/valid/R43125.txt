the mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility ( mfff ) in south carolina has been a key component of the current u.s. strategy for disposing of surplus weapons plutonium from the cold war . disposition of surplus plutonium is required by a 1998 agreement , amended in 2010 , between the united states and the russian federation . each country agreed to convert 34 metric tons of surplus weapons - grade plutonium to a form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons , to begin in 2018. russia suspended its participation in the agreement in october 2016 due to what it called `` hostile actions '' by the united states . however , both countries appear to be continuing their plans for surplus plutonium disposition . the u.s. disposition strategy called for the surplus plutonium , in oxide form , to be blended with uranium oxide to make mixed oxide ( mox ) fuel for u.s. commercial nuclear reactors . the plutonium in mox fuel would be mostly destroyed in the reactors by fission ( splitting into other isotopes ) . at the same time , isotopes of plutonium undesirable for weapons would be created , along with highly radioactive fission products . as a result , after several years in a reactor , spent mox fuel would have less total plutonium than when it was freshly loaded , and the remaining plutonium would be degraded for weapons purposes . moreover , the fission products would make the material difficult to handle , in case of future attempts to use the plutonium . because of sharply rising cost estimates for the mox project , the obama administration proposed to terminate the project in its fy2017 budget request . the trump administration in its fy2018 request also proposed replacing the mff with the dilute and dispose option . starting with the fy2015 budget request , the administration proposed placing mfff in `` cold standby '' and studying other plutonium disposition options . however , congress authorized and appropriated $ 345 million for fy2015 to continue construction at a reduced level and required the department of energy ( doe ) to procure an independent cost and schedule estimate for mfff and alternative disposition approaches . pending the results of those analyses , doe requested $ 340 million for fy2016 to continue construction at about the fy2015 level . doe 's fy2017 budget proposed to instead pursue a dilute and dispose ( d & d ) program . the federal plutonium disposition program is run by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semiautonomous agency of doe . nnsa estimated in 2002 that mfff would cost about $ 1 billion to design and build . doe said in its budget justification for fy2014 that the mfff contractor had estimated the project 's total construction cost would rise to $ 7.78 billion , and that construction would not be completed until november 2019. doe 's fy2015 budget justification said the life - cycle cost estimate for the mox program had risen to $ 30 billion . differing sharply from the u.s. mox strategy , russia is planning to use its bn - 600 and bn - 800 fast breeder reactors for plutonium disposition . according to the world nuclear association , the bn - 800 started producing electricity in 2015 , and the reactor is `` capable of burning 1.7 metric tons of plutonium per year from dismantled weapons . . the doe fy2015 through fy2018 budget requests included no funds for support of the russian plutonium disposition program . the debate over u.s. plutonium disposition strategy raises several issues for congress . the administration asserts that the rising cost estimates for mfff are unsustainable in the current budget environment and proposes a different disposal method . the effects of alternative disposal options on doe 's savannah river site in south carolina , where mfff is located , will also be an important element of the debate .
