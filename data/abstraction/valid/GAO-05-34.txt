hubble 's continued operation has been dependent on manned servicing missions using the national aeronautics and space administration 's ( nasa ) shuttle fleet . the fleet was grounded in early 2003 following the loss of the space shuttle columbia , as nasa focused its efforts on responding to recommendations made by the columbia accident investigation board ( caib ) . in january 2004 , nasa announced its decision to cancel the final planned hubble servicing mission , primarily because of safety concerns . without some type of servicing mission , nasa anticipates that hubble will cease to support scientific investigations by the end of the decade . nasa 's decision not to service the hubble prompted debate about potential alternatives to prolong hubble 's mission and the respective costs of these alternatives . this report addresses the basis of nasa 's cost estimates to service hubble using the shuttle and implement recommendations made by the caib . gao is continuing its work on the congressional request that gao examine the potential cost of a robotic servicing mission to the hubble telescope . although a shuttle servicing mission is one of the options for servicing the hubble space telescope , to date , nasa does not have a definitive estimate of the potential cost . at our request , nasa prepared an estimate of the funding needed for a shuttle servicing mission to the hubble . nasa estimates the cost at between $ 1.7 billion to $ 2.4 billion . however , documentary support for portions of the estimate is insufficient . for example , nasa officials told us that the hubble project 's sustaining engineering costs run $ 9 to 10 million per month , but they were unable to produce a calculation or documents to support the estimate because they do not track these costs by servicing mission . additionally , the agency has acknowledged that many uncertainties , such as the lack of a design solution for autonomous inspection and repair of the shuttle , could change the estimate . a t the same time , nasa has yet to develop a definitive cost estimate for implementing all of the caib 's recommendations but has developed a budget estimate for safely returning the shuttle to flight -- a subset of activities recommended by the caib as needed to return the shuttle to full operations . nasa currently estimates return to flight costs will exceed $ 2 billion , but that estimate will likely be refined as the agency continues to define technical concepts . nasa provided support for portions of the estimate , but we found the support to be insufficient -- either because key documents were missing or the estimates lacked sufficient detail . further , nasa cautions that return to flight costs will remain uncertain until the first return to flight shuttle mission , which is scheduled to go to the international space station in spring 2005 .
