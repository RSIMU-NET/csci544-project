the federal government faces a series of challenges in the 21st century that will be difficult , if not impossible , for any single agency to address alone . many issues cut across more than one agency and their actions are not well coordinated . moreover , agencies face a range of barriers when they attempt to work collaboratively . this report identifies key practices that can help enhance and sustain agency collaboration . gao also considered how the government performance and results act ( gpra ) and the office of management and budget ( omb ) address collaboration among agencies . to illustrate these practices , we selected the healthy people , wildland fire management , and departments of veterans affairs and defense 's health resource sharing collaborations . collaboration can be broadly defined as any joint activity that is intended to produce more public value than could be produced when the organizations act alone . agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts by engaging in the eight practices identified below . running throughout these practices are a number of factors such as leadership , trust , and organizational culture that are necessary elements for a collaborative working relationship : define and articulate a common outcome ; establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; identify and address needs by leveraging resources ; agree on roles and responsibilities ; establish compatible policies , procedures , and other means to operate across agency boundaries ; develop mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports ; and reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance management systems . gao has previously reported that gpra , with its focus on strategic planning , the development of long - term goals , and accountability for results , provides a framework congress , omb , and executive branch agencies can use to consider the appropriate mix of long - term strategic goals and strategies needed to identify and address issues that cut across agency boundaries . in addition , to provide a broader perspective on the federal government 's goals and strategies to address issues that cut across agencies , we previously recommended that omb develop a governmentwide performance plan as required by gpra and congress consider amending gpra to require a governmentwide strategic plan . omb , through the president 's management agenda ( pma ) , has emphasized improving government performance through governmentwide and agency - specific initiatives . one of these focuses specifically on improving coordination , but only between the departments of veterans affairs and defense for health programs and systems . however , many other areas that cut across agency boundaries would benefit from greater omb focus and attention , including information sharing for homeland security , which gao recently designated as a high - risk area . omb has also used its program assessment rating tool ( part ) diagnostic tool to determine , among other things , whether individual programs duplicate other efforts and if agencies coordinate and collaborate effectively with related programs . the part tool provides general guidance for assessing effective program coordination and collaboration , but does not discuss practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration , such as those described and illustrated in this report .
