this report provides an overview of statutory inspectors general ( igs ) in the federal government , including their structure , functions , and related issues for congress . statutory igs — established by law rather than administrative directive — are intended to be independent , nonpartisan officials who aim to prevent and detect waste , fraud , and abuse in the federal government . to execute their missions , igs lead offices of inspector general ( oigs ) that conduct various reviews of agency programs and operations — including audits , investigations , inspections , and evaluations — and provide findings and recommendations to improve them . igs possess several authorities to carry out their respective missions , such as the ability to independently hire staff , access relevant agency records and information , and report findings and recommendations directly to congress . statutory igs play a key role in government oversight , and congress plays a key role in establishing the structures and authorities to enable that oversight . the structure and placement of igs in government agencies allows oig personnel to develop the expertise necessary to conduct in - depth assessments of agency programs . further , igs ' dual reporting structure — to both agency heads and congress — positions them to advise agencies on how to improve their programs and policies and to advise congress on how to monitor and facilitate such improvement . congress , therefore , may have an interest in ensuring that statutory igs possess the resources and authorities necessary to fulfill their oversight roles . as the federal government continues to evolve , so too does the role of igs in government oversight . agency programs and operations have increased in terms of breadth , complexity , and interconnectedness . consequently , igs may face increasing demand to complete statutorily mandated reviews of programs and operations that require ( 1 ) a broader focus on program performance and effectiveness in addition to waste , fraud , and abuse ; ( 2 ) analysis of specialty or technical programs , possibly in emerging policy areas ; and ( 3 ) use of more complex analytical methods and tools . congress may wish to consider several options regarding ig structures , functions , and coordination as the role of igs in government oversight evolves .
