the earned income tax credit ( eitc or eic ) began in 1975 as a temporary program to return a portion of the social security taxes paid by lower - income taxpayers , and was made permanent in 1978. in the 1990s , the program was transformed into a major component of federal efforts to reduce poverty , and is now the largest anti - poverty entitlement program . tax year 2009 data show a total eitc amount of $ 59.7 billion for 27.2 million tax returns , yielding an average tax credit of $ 2,195 . most of the eitc ( 87.1 % ) was received as a refund ( eitc exceeded tax liability ) by low - income workers . the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( egtrra ; p.l . 107-116 ) made several changes to the credit , including simplifying the definition of earned income to reflect only compensation included in gross income ; basing the phase - out of the credit on adjusted gross income ( agi ) instead of expanded ( or modified ) gross income ; and eliminating the reduction in the eitc for the alternative minimum tax ( amt ) . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) created the category for families with three or more children , with a credit rate of 45 % , for tax years 2009 and 2010 only . the arra also increased the phase - in amount for married couples filing joint tax returns so that it is $ 5,000 higher than for unmarried taxpayers in tax year 2009 , and $ 5,010 in tax year 2010. the changes to the credit made by egtrra and arra were set to expire on december 31 , 2010. the tax relief , unemployment insurance reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-312 ) extended the egtrra and arra provisions for two years ( through 2012 ) . the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( atra ; p.l . 112-240 ) permanently extended the egtraa provisions , but extended the arra provisions for only five years . the expiration of the arra provisions for the eitc is one of the legislative issues for congress . this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants .
