the audit market for large public companies is an oligopoly , with the largest firms auditing the vast majority of public companies and smaller firms facing significant barriers to entry into the market . mergers among the largest firms in the 1980s and 1990s and the dissolution of arthur andersen in 2002 significantly increased concentration among the largest firms , known as the `` big 4. . these four firms currently audit over 78 percent of all u.s. public companies and 99 percent of all public company sales . this consolidation and the resulting concentration have raised a number of concerns . to address them , the sarbanes - oxley act of 2002 mandated that gao study the factors contributing to the mergers ; the implications of consolidation on competition and client choice , audit fees , audit quality , and auditor independence ; the impact of consolidation on capital formation and securities markets ; and barriers to entry faced by smaller accounting firms in competing with the largest firms for large public company audits . domestically and globally , there are only a few large firms capable of auditing large public companies , which raises potential choice , price , quality , and concentration risk concerns . a common concentration measure used in antitrust analysis , the hirschman - herfindahl index ( hhi ) indicates that the largest firms have the potential for significant market power following mergers among the largest firms and the dissolution of arthur andersen . although gao found no evidence of impaired competition to date , the significant changes that have occurred in the profession may have implications for competition and public company choice , especially in certain industries , in the future . existing research on audit fees did not conclusively identify a direct correlation with consolidation . gao found that fees have started to increase , and most experts expect the trend to continue as the audit environment responds to recent and ongoing changes in the audit market . research on quality and independence did not link audit quality and auditor independence to consolidation and generally was inconclusive . likewise , gao was unable to draw clear linkages between consolidation and capital formation but did observe potential impacts for some smaller companies seeking to raise capital . however , given the unprecedented changes occurring in the audit market , gao observes that past behavior may not be indicative of future behavior , and these potential implications may warrant additional study in the future , including preventing further consolidation and maintaining competition . finally , gao found that smaller accounting firms faced significant barriers to entry -- including lack of staff , industry and technical expertise , capital formation , global reach , and reputation -- into the large public company audit market . as a result , market forces are not likely to result in the expansion of the current big 4. furthermore , certain factors and conditions could cause a further reduction in the number of major accounting firms .
