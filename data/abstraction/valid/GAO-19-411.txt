youth who leave the foster care system at age 18 are often ill - prepared to live on their own and may face challenges as they transition to adulthood , such as difficulties finding stable housing . the fostering connections to success and increasing adoptions act of 2008 allowed states to receive federal reimbursement through title iv - e of the social security act for a portion of the cost of extending care to certain eligible youth up to age 21. the act also allows youth ages 18 up to 21 to live in a supervised setting in which the individual is living independently . one such setting may be an apartment , with monthly check - ins with a case worker ( referred to as supervised independent living arrangements ) . gao was asked to review supervised independent living arrangements and services for older youth . among other things , this report examines the types of supervised independent living arrangements available ; factors states reported considering when placing youth in these living arrangements ; and how selected states prepare youth to live independently . gao surveyed state child welfare agencies in the 26 states approved by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to receive federal funding to support their extended foster care programs ; interviewed state and local child welfare officials and stakeholders in five states selected for factors such as variation in child welfare administration systems ; reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; and interviewed hhs officials . the 26 states that have approval to receive federal funding to support their extended foster care programs for youth ages 18 up to 21 reported providing a range of supervised independent living arrangements . these arrangements include transitional living programs , private residences , and other settings ( see figure ) . officials we spoke with in five selected states said transitional living programs typically involve private child welfare agencies that lease apartments or facilities for youth , either at a single site or scattered across a geographic area , and offer on - site case management and supports to help youth build independent living skills . for private residences , youth may choose where to live , such as a private or shared apartment . in these cases , youth are typically responsible for their own lease , and may receive minimal supervision compared to youth in transitional living programs . for other settings , states reported options such as college dorms and residential employment training programs . nineteen states also reported allowing youth under 18 to live in supervised independent living settings in certain instances , such as when they are pregnant , parents , or attending college , although such placements are generally not eligible for federal funding . factors that most states reported considering when placing youth in supervised independent living arrangements include the youth 's life skills — for example , their ability to budget finances and schedule medical appointments — as well as their education and employment status . officials in selected states also said they consider the availability of housing , which may be limited in certain localities due to a lack of affordable housing options or other factors , and the options available to youth with complex needs , such as those who are pregnant and parents . officials in four selected states said they help prepare youth in extended foster care to live independently by providing targeted trainings and other supports , such as financial literacy training . in all five selected states , youth can also learn independent living skills through services offered more broadly to all older youth in foster care , officials said , including assistance with housing , education , employment , and daily living skills , such as grocery shopping and budgeting .
