gao discussed its recent report on preventive and monitoring services provided to medicare beneficiaries with diabetes , focusing on : the extent to which medicare beneficiaries with diabetes receive recommended levels of preventive and monitoring services ; what medicare health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) are doing to improve delivery of recommended diabetes services ; and the activities that the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) supports to address these service needs for medicare beneficiaries with diabetes . gao noted that : while experts agree that regular use of preventive and monitoring services can help minimize the complications of diabetes , most medicare beneficiaries with diabetes do not receive these services at recommended intervals ; this is true both in traditional fee - for - service medicare , which serves about 90 percent of all beneficiaries , and in managed care delivery ; the efforts of medicare hmos to improve diabetes care have been varied but generally limited , with most plans reporting that they have focused on educating their enrollees with diabetes about self - management and their physicians about the need for preventive and monitoring services ; very few plans have developed comprehensive diabetes management programs ; and at the federal level , hcfa has targeted diabetes for special emphasis and has begun to test preventive care initiatives , but like the hmos , hcfa 's efforts are quite recent and the agency does not yet have results that would allow it to evaluate effectiveness .
