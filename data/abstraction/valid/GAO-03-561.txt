since july 1998 , gao has reported numerous times on nursing home quality - of - care issues and identified significant weaknesses in federal and state oversight . gao was asked to assess the extent of the progress made in improving the quality of care provided by nursing homes to vulnerable elderly and disabled individuals , including trends in measured nursing home quality , state responses to previously identified weaknesses in their survey , complaint , and enforcement activities , and the status of oversight and quality improvement efforts by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) . the proportion of nursing homes with serious quality problems remains unacceptably high , despite a decline in the incidence of such reported problems . actual harm or more serious deficiencies were cited for 20 percent or about 3,500 nursing homes during an 18-month period ending january 2002 , compared to 29 percent for an earlier period . fewer discrepancies between federal and state surveys of the same homes suggests that state surveyors are doing a better job of documenting serious deficiencies and that the decline in serious quality problems is potentially real . despite these improvements , the continuing prevalence of and state surveyor understatement of actual harm deficiencies is disturbing . for example , 39 percent of 76 state surveys from homes with a history of quality - of - care problems -- but whose current survey found no actual harm deficiencies -- had documented problems that should have been classified as actual harm or higher , such as serious , avoidable pressure sores . weaknesses persist in state survey , complaint , and enforcement activities . according to cms and states , several factors contribute to the understatement of serious quality problems , including poor investigation and documentation of deficiencies , limited quality assurance systems , and a large number of inexperienced surveyors in some states . in addition , gao found that about one - third of the most recent state surveys nationwide remained predictable in their timing , allowing homes to conceal problems if they chose to do so . considerable state variation remains regarding the ease of filing a complaint , the appropriateness of the investigation priorities , and the timeliness of investigations . some states attributed timeliness problems to inadequate staff and an increase in the number of complaints . although the agency strengthened enforcement policy by requiring states to refer for immediate sanction homes that had repeatedly harmed residents , gao found that states failed to refer a substantial number of such homes , significantly undermining the policy 's intended deterrent effect . cms oversight of state survey activities has improved but requires continued attention to help ensure compliance with federal requirements . while cms strengthened oversight by initiating annual state performance reviews , officials acknowledged that the reviews ' effectiveness could be improved . for the initial fiscal year 2001 review , officials said they lacked the capability to systematically distinguish between minor lapses and more serious problems that required intervention . cms oversight is also hampered by continuing database limitations , the inability of some cms regions to use available data to monitor state activities , and inadequate oversight in areas such as survey predictability and state referral of homes for enforcement . three key cms initiatives have been significantly delayed -- strengthening the survey methodology , improving surveyor guidance for determining the scope and severity of deficiencies , and producing greater standardization in state complaint processes . these initiatives are critical to reducing the subjectivity evident in current state survey and complaint activities .
