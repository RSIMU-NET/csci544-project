recent operations in afghanistan demonstrated the dangers of providing air support close to troops on the ground . such close air support requires timely , well - practiced procedures and communication between ground and air elements . while most close air support operations in afghanistan were successful , `` friendly fire '' incidents have resulted from mistakes made while conducting the mission . at the request of the ranking minority members of the subcommittees on total force and readiness , house committee on armed services , gao reviewed department of defense ( dod ) efforts to provide adequate close air support training , as well as efforts to enhance the equipment used to support this mission . the department of defense has had limited success in overcoming the barriers that prevent troops from receiving the realistic , standardized close air support training necessary to prepare them for joint operations . this is the result of four interrelated factors : ground and air forces have limited opportunities to train together in a joint environment ; home station training is often restricted and thus does not always provide realistic training to prepare troops to perform the mission ; the services use different training standards and certification requirements for personnel responsible for coordinating close air support ; and within the individual services , joint close air support training is often a lower priority than other missions . while the department recognizes the need to improve the training for the mission , progress has been slow on many of the issues because the services have been unable to agree on joint solutions . in the interim , u.s. troops engaged in joint close air support missions are forced to conduct last - minute training or create ad hoc procedures on the battlefield . efforts to enhance the capabilities of the equipment used to perform the joint close air support mission have not kept pace with precision weapons capabilities and as a result do not achieve dod 's goals for interoperability and cost - effectiveness . advanced systems improve the accuracy of battlefield information and can speed the transmission of information from the troops on the ground to attacking aircraft . however , the services have acquired equipment that is not able to communicate across the services , a key requirement in joint operations . moreover , the services are procuring equipment independently to meet individual service needs , thereby missing opportunities to achieve cost benefits from joint service purchases .
