pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed various aspects of the h - 2a nonimmigrant guestworker program , focusing on the : likelihood of a widespread agricultural labor shortage and its impact on the need for nonimmigrant guestworkers ; and h - 2a program 's ability to meet the needs of agricultural workers , both at present and if a significant number of nonimmigrant guestworkers is needed in the future . gao noted that : a sudden widespread farm labor shortage requiring the importation of large numbers of foreign workers is unlikely to occur in the near future ; there appears to be no national agricultural labor shortage , but localized labor shortages may exist for specific crops or geographical areas ; although many farmworkers -- an estimated 600,000- - are not legally authorized to work in the united states , the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) does not expect its enforcement activities to significantly reduce the aggregate supply of farmworkers ; ins expects limited impact from its enforcement activities because of the prevalence of fraudulently documented farmworkers and ins ' competing enforcement priorities ; in fiscal year ( fy ) 1996 , less than 5 percent of the 4,600 ins worksite enforcement efforts were directed at agricultural workplaces ; ins conducts enforcement efforts largely in response to complaints , and it receives few complaints about agricultural employers ; ins officials in both field and headquarters positions stated unanimously that operational impediments prevented the agency from significantly reducing the number of unauthorized farmworkers ; the prevalence of unauthorized and fraudulently documented farmworkers does , however , leave individual growers vulnerable to sudden labor shortages if ins does target its enforcement efforts on their establishments ; although few agricultural employers seek workers through the h - 2a program , those that do are generally successful in obtaining foreign agricultural workers on both a regular and an emergency basis ; during fy 1996 and the first 9 months of fy 1997 , the department of labor approved 99 percent of all h - 2a applications ; however , both employers and labor officials have difficulty meeting time frames specified by law and regulation ; because labor does not collect key program management information , it is unable to determine the extent and cause of missed time frames ; the multiple agencies and levels of government implementing the program may result in redundant oversight and confusion for both employers and workers ; and while ins enforcement efforts are unlikely to create a significant increase in demand for h - 2a workers , changes in h - 2a program operations could improve the ability of growers to obtain workers when needed -- whether or not a nationwide labor shortage exists -- and better protect the wages and working conditions of both domestic and foreign workers .
