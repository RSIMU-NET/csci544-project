president obama 's budget request for fy2013 included $ 140.820 billion for research and development ( r & d ) , a $ 1.951 billion ( 1.4 % ) increase from the fy2012 estimated funding level of $ 138.869 billion . the fy2013 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( p.l . 113-6 ) , signed into law on march 26 , 2013 , provided year - long appropriations to all agencies for fy2013 . the law included divisions incorporating five of the regular appropriations bills — agriculture , rural development , food and drug administration , and related agencies ; commerce , justice , science , and related agencies ; department of defense ; department of homeland security ; and military construction and veterans affairs , and related agencies — and included continuing appropriations for agencies covered under the other regular appropriations bills . agency appropriations were subject to one or more rescissions as well as sequestration . for several agencies , research and development ( r & d ) funding is included in accounts with non - r & d activities . for such agencies , unless congress provides funding at the full request level as requested , it is not possible to know the agency 's r & d funding level . in such cases , the funding level may not be known until it is included in the president 's fy2015 budget request and / or agency budget justifications . when final appropriations are not resolved until after the president 's next fiscal year budget request is prepared ( as was the case for fy2013 appropriations and the president 's fy2014 request ) funding for agency r & d may not be known until the subsequent year 's budget request . however , some agencies may opt to provide funding estimates , publicly or privately ( for example , in response to a crs inquiry ) . determination of funding levels can be complicated by a number of factors , including rescissions , sequestration , supplemental funding , transfers , and reprogramming . agency analyses in this report use the most current information available at the time this report was published . funding for r & d is highly concentrated in a few departments . under president obama 's fy2013 budget request , seven federal agencies would have received 95.8 % of total federal r & d funding , the largest among them being the department of defense ( 50.6 % ) and the department of health and human services ( 22.3 % , primarily for the national institutes of health ) . among the largest changes proposed in the president 's request , the r & d budget of the department of defense would have fallen by $ 1.535 billion ( 2.1 % ) , while r & d funding for the department of commerce 's national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) would have increased by $ 1.329 billion . the proposed nist growth was fueled by increases in funding for its core research laboratories and by the establishment of two new initiatives : $ 1 billion for the national network for manufacturing innovation , which seeks to promote the development of manufacturing technologies with broad applications , and $ 300 million for a wireless innovation ( win ) fund to help develop cutting - edge technologies for public safety users . president obama also requested increases in the r & d budgets of nist , the national science foundation , and the department of energy 's office of science that were targeted for doubling over 7 years , from their fy2006 levels , by the america competes act , and over 11 years by the america competes reauthorization act of 2010. the funding requested for fy2013 was consistent with a doubling timeframe of 17 years , much longer than authorized by either act . the president 's budget request sought support for three multi - agency r & d initiatives in fy2013 : $ 1.766 billion for the national nanotechnology initiative , an increase of $ 70 million ( 4.1 % ) over fy2012 ; $ 3.807 billion for the networking and information technology research and development program , an increase of $ 69 million ( 1.8 % ) ; and $ 2.633 billion for the u.s. global change research program , an increase of $ 136 million ( 5.6 % ) .
