the u.s. transportation system , comprised of aviation , freight rail , highway , maritime , mass transit and passenger rail , and pipelines , moves billions of passengers and millions of tons of goods each year . disrupted terrorist attacks involving rail and air cargo in 2010 demonstrate the importance of effective information sharing with transportation security stakeholders . the transportation security administration ( tsa ) is the lead agency responsible for communicating security - related information with all modes . in response to the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 , gao assessed 1 ) the satisfaction of transportation stakeholders with the quality of tsa 's transportation security information products , 2 ) satisfaction with mechanisms used to disseminate them , and 3 ) the extent to which tsa 's roles and responsibilities are clearly defined . gao surveyed 335 aviation , rail , and highway stakeholders ( with an 82 percent response rate ) ; reviewed agency planning documents ; and interviewed industry associations , transportation stakeholders , and department of homeland security officials . an electronic supplement to this report -- gao - 12-67sp -- provides survey results . transportation stakeholders who gao surveyed were generally satisfied with tsa 's security - related information products , but identified opportunities to improve the quality and availability of the disseminated information . tsa developed a series of products to share security - related information with transportation stakeholders such as annual modal threat assessments that provide an overview of threats to each transportation mode -- including aviation , rail , and highway -- and related infrastructure . fifty - seven percent of the stakeholders ( 155 of 275 who answered this question ) indicated that they were satisfied with the products they receive . however , stakeholders who receive these products were least satisfied with the actionability of the information -- the degree to which the products enabled stakeholders to adjust their security measures . they noted that they prefer products with more analysis , such as trend analysis of incidents or suggestions for improving security arrangements . further , not all stakeholders received the products . for example , 48 percent ( 128 of 264 ) of the stakeholders reported that they did not receive a security assessment in 2010 , such as tsa 's annual modal threat assessment . improving the analysis and availability of security - related information products would help enhance stakeholders ' ability to position themselves to protect against threats . stakeholders who obtained security - related information through tsa 's web - based mechanisms were generally satisfied , but almost 60 percent ( 158 of 266 ) of stakeholders gao surveyed had never heard of the homeland security information sharing network critical sectors portal ( hsin - cs ) . dhs views hsin as the primary mechanism for sharing security - related information with critical sectors , including transportation stakeholders . forty - three percent of rail stakeholders , 28 percent of highway stakeholders , and 72 percent of aviation stakeholders -- who consider tsa 's aviation web boards as their primary information - sharing mechanism -- had not heard of hsin - cs . among the 55 stakeholders that had logged on to hsin - cs , concerns were raised with the ability to locate information using the mechanism . increasing awareness and functionality of hsin - cs could help ensure that stakeholders receive security information , including tsa products . defining and documenting the roles and responsibilities for information sharing among tsa offices could help strengthen information - sharing efforts . officials from tsa 's office of intelligence consider tsa 's transportation sector network management offices to be key conduits for providing security - related information directly to stakeholders . however , officials from these offices differed in their understanding of their roles . for instance , officials told gao that their role was to communicate policy and regulatory information , rather than threat - related information . while tsa officials look to the current transportation security information sharing plan for guidance , it does not include key elements of the approach that tsa uses to communicate security - related information to stakeholders . for example , it does not describe the roles of tsa 's field intelligence officers , who facilitate the exchange of relevant threat information with local and private entities responsible for transportation security . clearly documenting roles and responsibilities for sharing security - related information with transportation stakeholders could improve the effectiveness of tsa 's efforts and help ensure accountability . gao recommends that tsa , among other actions , address stakeholder needs regarding the quality of analysis in and availability of its products , increase awareness and functionality of its information sharing mechanisms , and define and document tsa 's information sharing roles and responsibilities . dhs concurred with gao 's recommendations .
