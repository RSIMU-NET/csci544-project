medical malpractice and malpractice insurance continue to be issues of great concern tophysicians , consumers , legislators , and others . most of the discussion about rising malpracticeinsurance premiums has centered on limiting the damage awards in malpractice suits , though someattention also has been given to insurance reforms . a third , related area that has received lessconsideration in malpractice discussions is patient safety . patient safety refers to the panoply ofrules , practices , and systems related to the prevention of medical injury . intrinsic to patient safetyefforts are strategies to prevent medical errors . while patient safety and medical errors have generated a great deal of discussion inlegislatures in the past several years , such discussion typically has taken place separately from thedebates concerning malpractice . for example , s. 544 , the patient safety and qualityimprovement act of 2005 , encouraged the voluntary reporting and analysis of medical error data . s. 544 became p.l . 109-41 on july 29 , 2005. however , medical liability issues areaddressed in other legislation -- specifically , h.r . 5 / s. 354 , the helpefficient , accessible , low - cost , timely healthcare ( health ) act of 2005 , s. 22 , themedical care access protection act of 2006 , and s. 23 , the healthy mothers andhealthy babies access to care act . the separation of patient safety concerns from medical malpractice issues has not alwaysbeen the case . several states have passed legislation that included provisions that addressed bothmalpractice and patient safety issues . research studies have explored the links between the twoissues , and a few bills introduced during the 109th congress , such as s. 1337 and s. 1784 , address those links . therefore , it is appropriate and timely to reconsider theseissues collectively , and revisit the role patient safety initiatives could play in the prevention of bothmedical errors and medical malpractice . strategies to enhance patient safety differ according to the specific provider type targeted . for instance , physician education includes providing clinical guidelines about appropriate treatmentsfor specific medical conditions , while hospital education involves performance feedback from anexternal organization . at the same time , general approaches may apply to both physicians andhospitals . for example , medical error reporting is a key component for patient safety enhancement , regardless of the provider focus . the impact of patient safety initiatives on the quality of care provided continues to be anopen question . individual initiatives have resulted in promising outcomes , but the overall impactof these efforts has been mixed . to some degree , this is the case because implementation has notbeen as pervasive as initial intentions suggested , and also because not enough research has been doneto identify , enumerate , and assess patient safety efforts . this report will be updated periodically .
