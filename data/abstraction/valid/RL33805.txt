federal support for child care and education comes in many forms , ranging from grant programs to tax provisions . some programs serve as specifically dedicated funding sources for child care services ( e.g . , the child care and development block grant , or ccdbg ) or education programs ( e.g . , elementary and secondary education act , title i , part a ; early reading first ; even start ; the 21st century community learning centers program ; the early childhood educator professional development program ; and the individuals with disabilities education act â€” preschool grants program and infants and toddlers program ) , while for others ( e.g . , temporary assistance for needy families , or tanf ) , child care is just one of many purposes for which funds may be used . in many cases , federal programs target low - income families in need of child care , but in the case of certain tax provisions , the benefits reach middle - and upper - income families as well . this report provides an overview of federal child care , early education , and related programs , and their funding status . funding for many child care , early education , and related programs is provided each year as part of the annual appropriations process for the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , and education ( ed ) . fiscal year ( fy ) 2007 appropriations bills for those departments did not receive floor action in the house or senate during the 109th congress , despite the 2007 fiscal year beginning on october 1 , 2006. after three continuing resolutions ( crs ) provided temporary funding for government operations , a fourth cr , providing funding through the end of fy2007 , was ultimately signed into law ( p.l . 110-5 ) on february 15 , 2007 , shortly after the president 's budget request for fy2008 was released . for several but not all of the programs covered by this report , the fy2007 funding levels mirrored those included in the fy2006 appropriations ( p.l . 109-149 ) . funding for head start was increased , as was that for early reading first . even start funding was cut , but not eliminated as had been proposed by the president . the fy2008 appropriations process , which included a series of continuing resolutions that provided temporary funding ( at fy2007 levels ) and a vetoed conference agreement ( h.rept . 110-424 ) , ultimately culminated in the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 ( h.r . 2764 ) being signed into law ( p.l . 110-161 ) by the president on december 26 , 2007. the legislation includes an across - the - board cut ( 1.747 % ) to the program funding level amounts contained in the act 's language . ( the levels included in this report reflect the across - the - board reduction . ) . on february 4 , 2008 , the president released his budget request for fy2009 . the 110th congress has not addressed all of the expired ( or soon expiring ) reauthorizations in the area of early childhood education and care . the ccdbg ( expired with fy2002 ) remains funded without authorization . no child left behind was granted an automatic one - year extension ( through fy2008 ) under the general education provisions act . head start reauthorization legislation ( h.r . 1429 ) was approved by this congress in november 2007 , and signed into law ( p.l . 110-134 ) by the president on december 12 , 2007 .
