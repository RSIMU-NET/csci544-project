on november 7 , 2007 , a container ship collided with a tower of the san francisco - oakland bay bridge , spilling 58,000 gallons of the ship 's bunker fuel into the bay . the incident has raised questions about the role of maritime pilots and vessel traffic services ( vtss ) in preventing accidents in u.s. harbors , such as : is there a need for further independent oversight of pilot performance ? . could vtss operate more like air traffic control centers ? . should the pilot and ship captain be required to agree on a passage plan before transiting a harbor ? . because of the additional challenges of navigating large ships through the constricted waters of a harbor , most u.s. ports require shipping lines to hire a maritime pilot . maritime pilots , through a lengthy apprenticeship process and many years of experience , have gained intimate knowledge of the navigational requirements of a particular harbor . despite the federal government 's prominent role in regulating interstate commerce , congress has largely left it to the various coastal states to regulate pilotage . pilots are licensed by the state for ships engaged in foreign trade ( `` registered '' vessels carrying international cargo ) , which accounts for the vast majority of port calls . typically a state pilot board oversees the hiring , training , and performance of pilots , as well as setting pilotage rates charged to the shipping lines . the u.s. coast guard has jurisdiction only over pilots of ships engaged in domestic trade and the courts have ruled that the coast guard does not have the authority to suspend or revoke the license of pilots for violations while piloting a foreign - trade ship . to assist pilots , the busiest u.s. ports have established vts stations to monitor ship traffic and provide relevant information to pilots , such as the location of other ships . while often compared to an air traffic control tower , a vts is not directly involved in the movement of vessels and is more accurately described as an advisory service than a traffic control center . ever - larger ships , difficult or challenging slow - speed handling characteristics of some of these ships , and rising port traffic that is predominantly foreign - flagged have led to proposals concerning pilotage , vtss , and other safety - related navigation services in u.s. ports . given the federal interest in marine environmental protection and the coast guard 's mission to ensure the safety of shipping in u.s. waters , some experts have advocated stronger federal oversight of pilots . they recommend that the coast guard or a national commission establish national standards for pilot training and proficiency or that the coast guard be given disciplinary authority over state - licensed pilots . state pilots resist greater federal oversight , arguing that the unique geography and navigational requirements of each port justifies local oversight . whether vtss should exert more direct control over vessel movement is also raised as a safety measure , but most acknowledge that an experienced on - board mariner is probably in the best position to direct a vessel 's movement . requiring that a pilot and ship captain first agree on a harbor passage plan , investigating language difficulties between pilots and foreign crews , and coast guard rotational staffing practices , are other issues policymakers may examine in assessing the safety of ship navigation in u.s. harbors .
