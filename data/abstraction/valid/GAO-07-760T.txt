weather - related events in the united states have caused tens of billions of dollars in damages annually over the past decade . a major portion of these losses is borne by private insurers and by two federal insurance programs -- the federal emergency management agency 's national flood insurance program ( nfip ) , which insures properties against flooding , and the department of agriculture 's federal crop insurance corporation ( fcic ) , which insures crops against drought or other weather disasters . in this testimony , gao describes how climate change may affect future weather - related losses , provides information on past insured weather - related losses , and determines what major private insurers and federal insurers are doing to prepare for potential increases in such losses . this testimony is based on a report entitled climate change : financial risks to federal and private insurers in coming decades are potentially significant ( gao - 07-285 ) being released today . key scientific assessments report that the effects of climate change on weather - related events and , subsequently , insured and uninsured losses , could be significant . the global average surface temperature has increased over the past century and climate models predict even more substantial , perhaps accelerating , increases in temperature in the future . assessments by key governmental bodies generally found that rising temperatures are expected to increase the frequency and severity of damaging weather - related events , such as flooding or drought , although the timing and magnitude are as yet undetermined . additional research on the effect of increasing temperatures on weather events is expected in the near future . taken together , private and federal insurers paid more than $ 320 billion in claims on weather - related losses from 1980 to 2005. claims varied significantly from year to year -- largely due to the effects of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes and droughts -- but have generally increased during this period . the growth in population in hazard - prone areas and resulting real estate development have generally increased liabilities for insurers , and have helped to explain the increase in losses . due to these and other factors , federal insurers ' exposure has grown substantially . since 1980 , nfip 's exposure nearly quadrupled to nearly $ 1 trillion in 2005 , and program expansion increased fcic 's exposure 26-fold to $ 44 billion . major private and federal insurers are both exposed to the effects of climate change over coming decades , but are responding differently . many large private insurers are incorporating climate change into their annual risk management practices , and some are addressing it strategically by assessing its potential long - term industry - wide impacts . in contrast , federal insurers have not developed and disseminated comparable information on long - term financial impacts . gao acknowledges that the federal insurance programs are not profit - oriented , like private insurers . nonetheless , a strategic analysis of the potential implications of climate change for the major federal insurance programs would help the congress manage an emerging high - risk area with significant implications for the nation 's growing long - term fiscal imbalance .
