the department of homeland security ( dhs ) was created from a disparate group of agencies with multiple missions , values , and cultures into a cabinet department whose goals are to , among other things , protect u.s. borders and infrastructure , improve intelligence and information sharing , and prevent and respond to potential terrorist attacks . gao designated the implementation and transformation of dhs as a high - risk area in 2003 , and it remains so . while dhs has made progress , it continues to face challenges in transforming into an effective , integrated organization . in response to a request to provide information on diversity in dhs and steps dhs is taking to create and manage a diverse workforce , gao is providing demographic data related to the federal government as a whole and dhs 's workforce . gao obtained these data from the office of personnel management 's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) . gao used its past work on leading diversity management practices ( gao - 05-90 ) and reviewed data from dhs on its diversity management practices . data in opm 's cpdf show that as of september 2007 , the overall percentages of women and minorities have increased in the career ses governmentwide , the highest nonpolitically appointed leaders in the federal workforce , and the ses developmental pool for potential successors since september 2003. as part of gao 's recent analysis of the diversity of the ses and the ses developmental pool , gao reviewed career , or permanent , ses appointments at dhs and dhs 's ses developmental pool . during this 4-year period , the total number of career ses and those in the ses developmental pool for potential successors increased at dhs . the percentage of women in the ses increased , while the percentage of minorities decreased . for the ses developmental pool , the percentage of women and minorities increased . while gao did not analyze the factors that contributed to changes in dhs 's workforce for this period , opm and the equal employment opportunity commission in their oversight roles require federal agencies , including dhs , to analyze their workforces . as part of a strategic human capital planning approach , agencies need to develop long - term strategies for acquiring , developing , motivating , and retaining a diverse workforce . an agency 's human capital planning should address the demographic trends that the agency faces with its workforce , especially retirements , which provide opportunities for agencies to affect the diversity of their workforces . dhs reported taking steps to affect the diversity of its workforce . these steps are consistent with several leading diversity management practices : a diversity strategy as part of its strategic plan , recruitment , employee involvement , and succession planning . for example , dhs cited its use of intern programs for recruiting and its implementation of two leadership development programs for managing succession . gao has not conducted a review of dhs 's diversity management efforts ; therefore , it can not comment on the effectiveness of dhs 's implementation of these practices .
