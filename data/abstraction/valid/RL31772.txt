following the end of the apartheid era in south africa in the early 1990s , the united states sought to increase economic relations with sub - saharan africa ( ssa ) . president clinton instituted several measures that dealt with investment , debt relief , and trade . congress passed legislation that required the president to develop a trade and development policy for africa . between 1960 and 1973 , africa 's economic growth was relatively strong , followed by a period of stagnation and decline for the subsequent two decades in many ssa countries . current perspectives , however , indicate that many of the fastest - growing countries in the world are on the african continent , and the international monetary fund ( imf ) projects that the ssa region will grow in terms of real gdp by 5.3 % in 2012 and 2013. in 2000 , congress approved new u.s. trade and investment legislation for ssa in the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ; title i , p.l . 106-200 ) . according to u.s. trade statistics , u.s. trade with ssa has comprised 1 % to 2 % of u.s. total trade with the world . agoa extends preferential treatment to u.s. imports from eligible countries that are pursuing market reform measures . data show that u.s. imports under agoa are mostly energy products , but imports of other products have grown significantly . agoa mandated that u.s. officials meet regularly with their counterparts in ssa , and 11 of these meetings have been held to date . the 11th agoa forum was held from june 14 to june 15 , 2012 , in washington , dc . agoa also directed the president to provide u.s. government technical assistance and trade capacity support to agoa beneficiary countries . government agencies that have roles in this effort include the u.s. agency for international development , the assistant u.s. trade representative for africa ( established by statute under agoa ) , the overseas private investment corporation , the export - import bank , the u.s. and foreign commercial service , and the trade and development agency . in agoa , congress declared that free - trade agreements should be negotiated , where feasible , with interested ssa countries . related to this provision , negotiations on a free - trade agreement with the southern african customs union ( sacu ) , which includes south africa and four other countries , began in june 2003 , but were suspended in april 2006. the 112th congress enacted legislation to extend through september 2015 an expiring provision in agoa , which allows apparel made in lesser - developed countries to be made of yarns and fabrics from any country and still receive duty - free treatment , subject to a cap ( p.l . 112-163 ) . this amendment to agoa also added south sudan to the list of ssa countries eligible for agoa benefits . eligible countries may become agoa beneficiaries subject to approval by the administration . legislation is pending to further enhance u.s. - ssa trade relations . h.r . 4221 and s. 2215 seek to increase u.s. exports to africa , in part , through strategies aimed at further developing relationships between the united states and african countries on a government - to - government level , fostering private sector u.s. - african ties , and targeting more u.s. export financing toward trade with africa . an amended version of s. 2215 was ordered reported by the senate foreign relations committee in september 2012. h.r . 656 , a separate initiative , would create at the state department a special representative for united states - africa trade , development , and diaspora affairs that would also promote u.s. trade and investment ties with ssa .
