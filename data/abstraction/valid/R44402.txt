rwanda , a small landlocked country in central africa 's great lakes region , has seen rapid development and security gains since about 800,000 people — mostly members of the ethnic tutsi minority — were killed in the 1994 genocide . the ruling rwandan patriotic front ( rpf ) ended the genocide by seizing power in mid - 1994 and has been the dominant force in rwandan politics ever since . the rwandan government has won donor plaudits for its efforts to improve health , boost agricultural output , encourage foreign investment , and promote women 's empowerment . yet , analysts debate whether rwanda 's authoritarian political system — and periodic support for rebel groups in neighboring countries — could jeopardize the country 's stability in the long - run , or undermine the case for donor support . president paul kagame , in office since 2000 , won reelection to another seven - year term in 2017 with nearly 99 % of the vote , after the adoption of a new constitution that effectively exempted him from term limits through 2034. kagame 's overwhelming margin of victory may reflect popular support for his efforts to stabilize and transform rwandan society , as well as a political system that involves constraints on opposition activity and close government scrutiny of citizen behavior . in response to external criticism , kagame has generally denied specific allegations of abusing human rights while asserting that restrictions on civil and political rights are necessary to prevent the return of ethnic violence . the united states and rwanda have cultivated close ties since the mid - 1990s , underpinned by u.s. development aid and support for rwanda 's robust participation in international peacekeeping . congress has helped shape u.s. engagement through its appropriation of foreign aid and other legislative initiatives , along with oversight and direct member outreach to rwandan officials . over the past decade , successive administrations and congress have continued to support u.s. partnership with rwanda on development and peacekeeping , while criticizing the government 's human rights record and periodic role in regional conflicts . congress has notably enacted provisions in aid appropriations legislation restricting u.s. military aid to rwanda if it is found to be supporting rebel groups in neighboring countries . the obama administration temporarily applied such restrictions , along with others pursuant to separate child soldiers legislation , citing rwandan support for rebels in the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) and burundi . there have been fewer reports of rwandan support for rebel groups in recent years . after meeting with president kagame in early 2018 , president trump expressed appreciation for u.s. - rwandan economic ties , rwanda 's contributions to peacekeeping , and kagame 's pursuit of african union institutional reforms . in line with the administration 's proposals to decrease foreign aid worldwide , its fy2020 budget request would provide $ 117 million in bilateral aid to rwanda , a 28 % decrease from fy2018 levels . u.s. peacekeeping - related military assistance for rwanda has drawn on regionally - and centrally - managed funds , and is not reflected in these totals . the administration has also suspended rwanda 's eligibility for trade benefits under the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa , reauthorized under p.l . 114-27 ) , in response to alleged market barriers to u.s. exports of used clothing .
