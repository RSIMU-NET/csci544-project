section 1341 of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) establishes a transitional reinsurance program that is designed to provide payment to non - grandfathered , non - group market health plans ( also known as individual market health plans ) that enroll high - risk enrollees for 2014 through 2016. under the program , the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) collects reinsurance contributions from health insurers and from third - party administrators on behalf of group health plans . the secretary then uses those contributions to make reinsurance payments to health insurers who enroll high - cost enrollees ( statutes required the hhs secretary to determine how high - risk enrollees are identified , and the secretary in turn defined high - risk enrollees as high - cost enrollees ) in their non - group market plans both inside and outside of the exchanges ( also known as the marketplaces ) . contributions are distributive in that they are collected from most non - group and group health insurers , but payments are made only to eligible non - group market health plans . reinsurance is an extension of insurance and further acts as a risk - transfer and risk - spreading mechanism . the availability of reinsurance allows insurers to reduce their risk exposure and can affect the availability and affordability of health insurance coverage . that is , the availability of reinsurance may be one of many factors an insurer considers in assessing potential exposure to loss in a certain market . this may affect whether or not to enter a market , what types of products to offer , and how premiums are set . to mitigate the financial risk and uncertainty insurers may face in the early years of aca implementation as a result of the aca 's private health insurance market reforms , the aca establishes three risk mitigation programs : the transitional reinsurance program , the permanent risk adjustment program , and the temporary risk corridors program . prior to aca implementation , little information was available regarding health care usage and demand for the previously uninsured , as well as any pent - up demand due to the lack of health insurance coverage . accordingly , to limit their risk exposure in offering plans on the non - group market , insurers would likely raise premiums to the extent possible to protect themselves against the potentially high cost associated with delayed care . however , some of the new aca market reforms limit the degree to which insurers may vary premiums . the transitional reinsurance program was designed to mitigate the financial risk associated with individuals who had delayed needed health care while they were uninsured . under the program , the hhs secretary collects reinsurance contributions from most non - group and group health plans and then uses those contributions to make reinsurance payments only to non - group market health plans with high - cost enrollees . the program covers a portion of the claims costs for these enrollees based on payment parameters set by the hhs secretary . this report provides an overview of one of the three risk mitigation programs , the transitional reinsurance program . the program 's aim is to offset the expenditures associated with high - cost individuals . the first section of the report provides background information on reinsurance and the aca risk mitigation programs . the second section describes the components of the transitional reinsurance program , as well as implementation of and experience with the program . the third section discusses questions regarding the scope of hhs 's authority to administer the transitional reinsurance program , including those raised by a 2016 government accountability office report . finally , the report includes a table in the appendix that summarizes key aspects of the transitional reinsurance program .
