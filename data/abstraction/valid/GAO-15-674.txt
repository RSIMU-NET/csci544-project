dod is the single largest consumer of energy in the federal government , spending billions of dollars annually on petroleum fuels to support military operations . one of dod 's strategic operational energy goals is to expand its energy supply options . investing in alternative fuels — liquid fuels , derived from non - petroleum feedstocks , whose use does not necessitate any modifications to platforms and equipment — represents one means of potentially achieving this goal . gao was asked to examine aspects of dod 's investment in alternative fuels . gao reviewed the extent to which dod has purchased alternative fuels , and has demonstrated these fuels can meet its safety , performance , and reliability standards ; has a process for purchasing alternative fuels for military operations that takes into consideration any cost differences between alternative and conventional fuels ; and has used the dpa authorities to promote the development of a domestic biofuel industry . gao reviewed past alternative and conventional petroleum fuel procurements , as well as statutes , regulations , and dod guidance related to fuel purchases . also , gao reviewed various documents on biofuel projects initiated under the dpa authority and interviewed cognizant dod officials involved with purchasing and using fuel and administering the biofuel projects . gao is not making recommendations in this report . dod provided technical comments on the findings , which gao has incorporated where appropriate . the department of defense ( dod ) has purchased small quantities of alternative fuels — jet and naval distillate ( known as f - 76 , to power ships ) — for testing and demonstration purposes , but has not done so yet for military operations . dod 's testing process validates the ability of alternative fuels to meet safety , performance , and reliability standards for military equipment and platforms . from fiscal years 2007 through 2014 , dod purchased about 2.0 million gallons of alternative fuel for testing purposes , at a cost of about $ 58.6 million . over the same period , it purchased about 32.0 billion gallons of petroleum fuel at a cost of about $ 107.2 billion . dod has approved alternative fuels made from two production processes for use in certain items and is continuing to test others . dod is currently required by law to ensure alternative fuel purchases for operational purposes are cost - competitive with conventional fuels and has a standard process to purchase large - scale volumes of all fuels . proposals are evaluated according to technical acceptability and price . to help the navy purchase alternative jet and naval distillate fuels blended with conventional fuels , the department of agriculture plans to provide funding directly to alternative fuel vendors that meet certain requirements and receive awards from dod . these funds are intended to defray some of the alternative fuel producer 's extra costs — such as costs of domestic feedstocks . per dod , no alternative fuel vendors have received awards so none of these funds have been paid out yet . dod has used financial incentives provided for by title iii of the defense production act ( dpa ) to help facilitate the development of commercially viable plants for producing biofuels for the military and commercial sectors . to date , dod has used this authority for two ongoing projects : bio - synthetic paraffinic kerosene and advanced drop - in biofuels production project and the federal government 's cost share for these projects was about $ 234.1 million .
