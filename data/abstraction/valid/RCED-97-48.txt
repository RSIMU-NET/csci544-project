pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on : profiles of three power marketing administrations , including their similarities and differences and how they interact with the agencies that operate federal water projects ; general parameters of the process by which federally owned assets can be sold ; and factors that would have to be addressed in a divestiture of federal hydroelectric assets , such as the relationship between power generation and the other purposes of federal water projects . gao noted that : the southeastern , southwestern , and western power administrations all market the hydropower generated at federal water projects , but they serve different geographical areas and have different assets ; their customers vary in size and in their electric energy purchases ; pmas are not the main source of electricity for most of their customers -- in total the three pmas in gao 's report supply about 7 percent of the electricity requirements of their customers ; the pmas have a close working relationship with the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers -- these interactions are based in part on written agreements and on flexible arrangements that recognize the operating agencies ' role in managing water releases in a way that balances a project 's multiple purposes . gao also noted that : two principal objectives have typically been cited by other nations and by the united states for selling government assets : eliminating or reducing the government 's presence in an activity that some view as best done by the private sector ; and improving the government 's fiscal situation ; and these two objectives will affect many subsequent decisions needed to implement a sale , including : decisions about such concerns as what specific assets to sell , how to group these assets , what conditions and liabilities to transfer to the buyer , and what sales mechanism to employ . finally , if , based on a broad policy evaluation of the pros and cons of privatization , a decision to divest federal hydropower assets is reached , several key issues specifically related to hydropower would need to be addressed , including : balancing how water is used among the multiple purposes of federal water projects ; determining how to repay or otherwise address the federal capital investment in irrigation facilities of the affected projects ; assigning the numerous contractual obligations and liabilities of the bureau , the corps , and the pmas ; handling native americans ' claims to water , property and tribal artifacts ; determining the future responsibility for protecting the environment and endangered species -- a commitment that already constrains the operations of many projects ; deciding the future regulatory treatment of divested hydropower assets ; the potential effects of a divestiture on wholesale and retail electric rates , and the regional economies ; and these impacts , to a large degree , would be determined by the prevailing wholesale electric rates of the local utilities in the region in which power from the pma is sold , the region 's reliance on this power , and the availability of other sources of power .
