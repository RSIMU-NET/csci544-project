the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimates that the federal budget deficit for fy2009 was $ 1,414 billion , triple the $ 459 billion deficit recorded in fy2008 . the cbo expects the deficit for fy2010 to be $ 1,349 billion . the estimate for 2010 is based on current law . the budget deficit in fy2009 was , in dollar terms , unprecedented . compared to the overall economy , the $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit equaled 9.9 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) . in 1943 , the budget deficit reached 30.3 % of gdp . since 1946 and before now , the largest the budget deficit had been , relative to the overall economy , was 6 % of gdp in 1983. over fairly short periods of time , say three or four years , fiscal policy can affect the rate of economic growth by adding to , or subtracting from , aggregate demand . for a time , the effect on the economy may even be larger than the initial change in the budget . these effects , however , tend eventually to diminish because of either higher interest rates or rising prices . there are varying estimates of the total effect on the economy of a change in fiscal policy , but most of them suggest that it reaches a peak somewhere between one and one - and - a - half times the size of the change in the budget . most macroeconomists believe that effect is realized within one or two years of the initial change in policy . one measure economists use to assess fiscal policy is the structural , or standardized - employment , budget . this measure estimates , at a given time , what outlays , receipts , and the surplus or deficit would be if the economy were at full employment . although the actual budget was in surplus beginning in 1998 , the standardized measure first registered a balanced budget in 1999. between 1992 and 2000 , the actual budget surplus increased from - 4.5 % ( a deficit of 4.5 % ) to 2.5 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , a shift of 7.0 percentage points . during the same period , the standardized measure rose from - 3.3 % to 1.1 % of gdp . that suggests that a little more than half of the shift was the result of changes in policy , and a little less than half was attributable to the economic expansion . between 2000 and 2007 , the actual surplus fell from 2.5 % to - 1.2 % of gdp , whereas the standardized measure fell from 0.9 % to - 1.6 % of gdp . that the two measures were so close in 2007 suggests that the economy was then near full employment . that the standardized measure fell between 2000 and 2007 indicates an expansionary fiscal policy over the period . between 2007 and 2009 , the standardized budget deficit increased from 1.2 % to 7.3 % of gdp , indicating a substantially expansionary fiscal policy . in the long run , economic growth is determined primarily by three factors : growth in the labor force , the rate of technological advance , and the amount of capital available to the workforce . of the three , the last one may be the most susceptible to the influence of policymakers . the larger the capital stock , the more productive the labor force tends to be . although it is possible for fiscal policy to have an effect on the rate of technological progress in the way public money is spent , many believe that it has a larger effect on growth through its influence on the size of the domestic stock of capital and the amount of capital available for each worker in the labor force .
