nearly a half - century has passed since poverty emerged as a major policy issue in the united states , taking form as a `` war on poverty . . as precursors , statistical studies sought to define the scope , depth , and breadth of the poverty problem in the united states , as well as the composition of the population affected , and poverty 's social and economic causes and effects . ultimately , the federal government adopted an `` official '' u.s. statistical poverty measure , which was to serve as the official benchmark for evaluating progress towards eliminating poverty in the united states . many experts consider the `` official '' poverty measure currently in use as flawed and outmoded . a national academy of sciences ( nas ) expert panel provided a wide range of specific recommendations to revamp the statistical measure of poverty in its congressionally commissioned 1995 study â€” measuring poverty : a new approach . now , after some 15 years of study , efforts are being undertaken to incorporate nas panel recommendations into a new statistical poverty measure to accompany the current `` official '' measure . house and senate legislative proposals introduced in both the 110th and 111th congress ( h.r . 2909 , s. 1625 ) , if adopted , would instruct the census bureau to create a new `` modern '' poverty measure , following many of the nas panel 's recommendations . more recent developments initiated by the office of management and budget ( omb ) propose that the census bureau , in coordination with the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , develop a new supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) , using nas panel recommendations as a starting point . a nas - based poverty measure , like the current `` official '' measure , would count families ' and unrelated individuals ' incomes against poverty income cutoffs ( i.e . , poverty income thresholds ) in determining whether they , and their members , are considered poor . under a nas - based poverty measure , poverty income thresholds would be higher than under the current measure , and more sources of income ( e.g . , nutrition assistance and refundable tax credits ) would be counted against the thresholds than under the current measure ; and , unlike the current measure , work - related expenses , taxes , and out - of - pocket medical expenses would be subtracted from income . nas - based poverty thresholds , unlike the current `` official '' thresholds , would adjust for changes in the overall basic standard of living in the society over time . in addition , the nas panel recommended that adjusting poverty thresholds for area cost - of - living differences should be considered . all in all , a nas - based poverty measure would be more sensitive than the current poverty measure in assessing the effects of government policy on poverty . estimates of the number and composition of the population that would be counted as poor under a nas - based poverty measure , compared to the current `` official '' measure , in part depend upon the specific details and methodologies used to construct the alternative measure . however , a nas - based poverty measure generally results in a greater number of persons being counted as poor than under the current `` official '' measure . additionally , persons in working families are more likely to be counted as poor than under the current measure ( largely due to the subtraction of taxes and work - related expenses from income ) , as are older persons ( largely due to subtraction of medical expenses from income ) . whereas under the current `` official '' poverty measure , the poverty rate of children is about twice that of persons age 65 and older ( 19.0 % compared to 9.7 % , respectively , in 2008 ) , under a nas - based measure , the age 65 and older poverty rate exceeds the child poverty rate ( 21.0 % compared to 20.2 % , respectively ) . based on current methodologies , geographic adjustments for area cost - of - living differences result in markedly different poverty rates for some states .
