the internal revenue service ( irs ) relies extensively on computerized systems to carry out its demanding responsibilities to collect taxes ( about $ 2.7 trillion in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 ) , process tax returns , and enforce the nation 's tax laws . effective information security controls are essential to protect financial and taxpayer information from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , improper disclosure , or destruction . as part of its audits of irs 's fiscal years 2008 and 2007 financial statements , gao assessed the status of irs 's actions to correct previously reported weaknesses and whether controls were effective in ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information . to do this , gao examined irs information security policies and procedures and other documents ; tested controls over key financial applications ; and interviewed key agency officials . irs has continued to make progress in correcting previously reported information security weaknesses . it has corrected or mitigated 49 of the 115 weaknesses that gao reported as unresolved during its last audit . for example , the agency implemented controls for unauthenticated network access and user ids on the mainframe , encrypted sensitive data going across its network , improved the patching of critical vulnerabilities , and updated contingency plans to document critical business processes . however , most of the previously identified weaknesses remain unresolved . for example , irs continues to , among other things , allow sensitive information , including ids and passwords for mission - critical applications , to be readily available to any user on its internal network , and grant excessive access to individuals who do not need it . according to irs officials , they are continuing to address the uncorrected weaknesses and , subsequent to gao site visits , had completed additional corrective actions . despite irs 's progress , information security control weaknesses continue to jeopardize the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information . irs did not consistently implement controls that were intended to prevent , limit , and detect unauthorized access to its systems and information . for example , irs did not always enforce strong password management for properly identifying and authenticating users ; authorize user access , including access to personally identifiable information , to permit only the access needed to perform job functions ; encrypt certain sensitive data ; effectively monitor changes on its mainframe ; and physically protect its computer resources . a key reason for these weaknesses is that irs has not yet fully implemented its agencywide information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively . specifically , irs did not annually review risk assessments for certain systems , comprehensively test for certain controls , or always validate the effectiveness of remedial actions . until these weaknesses are corrected , the agency remains particularly vulnerable to insider threats and irs is at increased risk of unauthorized access to and disclosure , modification , or destruction of financial and taxpayer information , as well as inadvertent or deliberate disruption of system operations and services .
