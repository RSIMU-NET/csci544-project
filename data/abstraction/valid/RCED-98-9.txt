gao provided information on the : roles of the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) and others in developing and updating the pavement design guide ; and use and potential of a computer analysis method known as nonlinear 3 dimensional - finite element method ( 3d - fem ) for improving the design and analysis of highway pavement structures . gao noted that : fhwa has worked cooperatively with the american association of state highway and transportation officials ( aashto ) in developing and updating the pavement design guide ; the current guide is slated to be updated by the year 2002 to better reflect the changing priority of rehabilitating the nation 's highways rather than building new ones ; in contrast to the current guide , that many transportation experts believe is outdated , the new guide is expected to incorporate the use of analytical methods to predict pavement performance under various loading and climatic conditions ; sponsors believe that a new design approach will more realistically characterize existing highway pavements and improve the reliability of designs ; a promising analytical method to accurately predict pavement response is the nonlinear 3d - fem ; only with accurate response data can one reliably predict pavement performance ; the use of this method has the potential to improve the design of highway pavements , which encompasses highway safety , durability , and cost - effectiveness , because values of stresses , strains , and deflections ( pavement response ) can be calculated accurately from a variety of static , impact , vibratory , and moving mixes in traffic loads ; several state departments of transportation , academicians , and scientists have pioneered the use of the nonlinear 3d - fem and are using it to solve a variety of complex structural engineering problems , including the design and analysis of highway pavement structures ; and while this is a promising method for improving highway pavement design and analysis , gao could find no evidence that it is being considered for inclusion in the current design guide update .
