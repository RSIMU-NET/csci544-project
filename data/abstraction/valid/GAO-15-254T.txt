uass are aircraft that do not carry a pilot aboard , but instead operate on pre - programmed routes or are manually controlled by following commands from pilot - operated ground control stations . the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 put greater emphasis on the need to integrate uass into the national airspace by requiring that faa establish requirements governing them . faa has developed a three - phased approach in its 5-year roadmap to facilitate incremental steps toward seamless integration . however , in the absence of regulations , unauthorized uas operations have , in some instances , compromised safety . this testimony discusses 1 ) progress toward meeting uas requirements from the 2012 act , 2 ) key efforts underway on research and development , and 3 ) how other countries have progressed in developing uas use for commercial purposes . this testimony is based on gao 's prior work and an ongoing study examining issues related to uas integration into the national airspace system for civil and public uas operations . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) has made progress toward implementing the requirements defined in the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 ( the 2012 act ) . as of december 2014 , faa had completed 9 of the 17 requirements in the 2012 act . however , key requirements , such as the final rule for small unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) operations , remain incomplete . faa officials have indicated that they are hoping to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking soon , with a timeline for issuing the final rule in late 2016 or early 2017. faa has established the test sites as required in the act , sites that will provide data on safety and operations to support uas integration . however , some test site operators are uncertain about what research should be done at the site , and believe incentives are needed for industry to use the test sites . as of december 4 , 2014 , faa granted seven commercial exemptions to the filmmaking industry allowing small uas operations in the airspace . however , over 140 applications for exemptions were waiting to be reviewed for other commercial operations such as electric power line monitoring and precision agriculture . previously , gao reported that several federal agencies and private sector stakeholders have research and development efforts under way focusing on technologies to allow safe and routine uas operations . during gao 's ongoing work , faa has cited many accomplishments in research and development in the past fiscal year in areas such as detect and avoid , and command and control . other federal agencies also have extensive research and development efforts supporting safe uas integration , such as a national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) project to provide research that will reduce technical barriers associated with uas integration . academic and private sector companies have researched multiple areas related to uas integration . gao 's ongoing work found that other countries have progressed with uas integration and allow limited commercial use . a 2014 mitre study found that japan , australia , the united kingdom , and canada have progressed further than the united states with regulations that support commercial uas operations . for example , as of december 2014 , australia had issued 180 uas operating certificates to businesses in industries including aerial surveying and photography . in addition , canada recently issued new regulations exempting commercial operations of small uass weighing 25 kilograms ( 55 lbs . ) . or less from receiving special approval .
