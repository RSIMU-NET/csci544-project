autism — a developmental disorder involving communication and social impairment — is an important public health concern . from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 , 12 federal agencies awarded at least $ 1.4 billion to support autism research and other autism - related activities . the combating autism act directed the iacc to coordinate hhs autism activities and monitor all federal autism activities . it also required the iacc to develop and annually update a strategic plan for autism research . this plan is organized into 7 research areas that contain specific objectives . this statement is based on gao 's november 2013 report , gao - 14-16 , with selected updates . it discusses federal autism activities , including the extent to which federal agencies fund potentially duplicative autism research , and the extent to which iacc and agencies coordinate and monitor federal autism activities . gao analyzed agencies ' data and documents , and interviewed federal agency officials . eighty - four percent of the autism research projects funded by federal agencies had the potential to be duplicative . of the 1,206 autism research projects funded by federal agencies from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 , 1,018 projects were potentially duplicative because the projects were categorized to the same objectives in the interagency autism coordinating committee 's ( iacc ) strategic plan . funding similar research on the same topic is sometimes appropriate — for example , for purposes of replicating or corroborating results — but in other instances funding similar research may lead to unnecessary duplication . each agency funded at least 1 autism research project in the same strategic plan objective as another agency and at least 4 agencies funded autism research in the same research area . the iacc and federal agencies may have missed opportunities to coordinate and reduce the risk of duplicating effort and resources . gao found that the iacc is not focused on the prevention of duplication , and its efforts to coordinate the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) autism research and monitor all federal autism activities were hindered by limitations with the data it collects . apart from federal agencies ' participation on the iacc , there were limited instances of agency coordination , and the agencies did not have robust or routine procedures for monitoring federal autism activities . gao recommended in november 2013 that hhs improve iacc data to enhance coordination and monitoring . hhs disagreed and stated its efforts were already adequate . gao also recommended that dod , education , hhs , and nsf improve coordination . the agencies supported improved coordination , but most disputed that duplication occurs . gao continues to believe the recommendations are warranted and actions needed .
