the federal government purchases roughly 57 million megawatt - hours of electricity annually ( based on fy2007 data , the latest information available ) , making it the single largest u.s. energy consumer . the department of defense ( dod ) alone consumes over 29 million megawatt - hours . the federal power marketing administrations ( pmas ) sell electricity at more than twice the volume of federal power purchases , over 127 million megawatt - hours of hydropower annually , and are projected to produce wind - generated energy far in excess of the 2005 energy policy act ( epact ) mandates for increasing federal use of renewable energy . various statutes and regulations authorize federal agencies to enter into contracts for their utility services and designate the general services administration ( gsa ) as the lead federal contracting agency . utility services include electricity , natural gas , water , sewerage , thermal energy , chilled water , hot water , and steam . gsa may enter into `` area - wide contracts '' for up to 10 years with electric utility service suppliers to cover the needs of federal agencies within the supplier 's franchise territory . gsa has delegated certain authority to dod to enter into utility service contracts on behalf of the military departments , and delegated similar authority to other federal agencies . dod can also enter into contracts for up to 30 years for services to operate energy generating facilities on military installations . to meet the epact renewable energy goals , multi - year `` power purchase agreements '' ( upwards of 10 to 20 years ) are proposed with small and merchant renewable power generators . the agreements would fully commit funds up front , contrary to the pay - as - you - go rules of the 1990 budget enforcement act . in addition to utility service contracts , federal agencies can also take advantage of utility sponsored incentive programs for reducing energy demand . demand response and load management programs provide rate incentives and / or cash payments to utility customers in exchange for curtailing their energy demand during peak usage periods . utility energy service contracts ( uescs ) enable federal agencies to enter into contracts with utilities to implement energy and water related improvements at their facilities . agencies may also fund energy - savings improvement projects with appropriations , or the utility may arrange to finance the project 's capital cost up front and recover the investment through its rate charge . energy saving performance contracts ( espcs ) enable federal agencies to install energy efficiency improvements with no upfront capital costs . the 2007 energy independence and security act ( eisa ) authorized federal agencies to combine appropriated funds and energy service companies ' ( esco ) private financing for espcs . the authority expands agencies ' opportunities to install solar energy generation . the 1978 public utilities regulation policies act ( purpa ) defined a new class of small renewable energy generators that produce less than 80 megawatts and required electric utilities to purchase the electricity generated at the utility 's `` avoided cost '' of power production via a state - authorized `` power purchase '' contract ( also referred to as a power purchase agreement ) . however , state laws and regulations vary on the use of the contracts . states are more likely to permit the contracts when the purchaser is a utility , because the utility is responsible for providing firm uninterrupted power to the customer . four pmas market and distribute hydropower in 34 states to public utility districts and cooperatives at cost - based rates . epact directed the pmas to study the economic and engineering feasibility of combining wind - generated energy with hydropower and to conduct a demonstration project that uses wind energy generated by indian tribes . short of amending federal contract authority , federal agencies may have recourse to meet epact mandates by purchasing power through the pmas .
