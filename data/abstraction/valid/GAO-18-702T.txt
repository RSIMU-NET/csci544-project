this testimony summarizes the information contained in gao 's june 2018 report , entitled identity theft : irs needs to strengthen taxpayer authentication efforts ( gao - 18-418 ) . the internal revenue service ( irs ) has identified over 100 interactions requiring taxpayer authentication based on potential risks to irs and individuals . irs authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone , online , in person , and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers . irs 's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel . irs has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication , including developing an authentication strategy with high - level strategic efforts . however , it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them , consistent with program management leading practices . doing so would help irs clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits . further , while irs regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications , it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone , in - person , and correspondence channels , including mechanisms to collect reliable , useful data to monitor authentication outcomes . as a result , irs may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system . irs can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters . while irs has taken preliminary steps to implement national institute of standards and technology 's ( nist ) new guidance for secure digital authentication , it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by june 2018 , as required by the office of management and budget . as a result , irs may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner . further , irs lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies . industry representatives , financial institutions , and government officials told gao that the best authentication approach relies on multiple strategies and sources of information , while giving taxpayers options for actively protecting their identity . evaluating alternatives for taxpayer authentication will help irs avoid missing opportunities for improving authentication .
