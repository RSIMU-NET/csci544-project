pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed states ' interest in establishing state infrastructure banks ( sib ) , focusing on the : extent of states ' interest in the sib pilot program and how states might use sib ; and benefits and barriers to states using sib . gao found that : 15 states applied for the 10 slots in the sib pilot program ; these states generally have large and growing populations that need additional highway construction ; most of the states surveyed indicated that sib would probably be used to help fund less than 10 percent of their state transportation projects in the next 5 years ; officials from 8 states believe that the most important benefit of using sib over the next 5 years would be the expedited completion of state transportation projects ; 8 states believe that the absence of new federal funds to capitalize sib diminished the likelihood that they would participate in the sib pilot program ; the fiscal year 1997 department of transportation ( dot ) appropriation provided $ 150 million for sib , and how the funding is allocated could affect the number of states applying for the pilot program ; although a primary sib benefit is that financing will be repaid and can be recycled to future transportation projects , some states are averse to debt financing and concerned about whether there are enough revenue - generating projects to sustain sib ; some infrastructure financing experts question sib prospects for attracting private - sector involvement ; and states expressed varying degrees of interest in other financing mechanisms provided for primarily in the national highway system designation act of 1995 .
