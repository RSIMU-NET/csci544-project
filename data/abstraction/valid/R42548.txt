u.s. policy makers have closely followed the 2012 elections in mexico , a key ally with whom the united states shares a nearly 2,000-mile border and some $ 460 billion in annual bilateral trade . on july 1 , 2012 , mexico held federal ( presidential and legislative ) elections . turnout reached record levels as 63 % of eligible voters cast their ballots . mexico 's federal electoral institute ( ife ) conducted the elections with the oversight of the federal electoral tribunal ( tepfj ) . some election observers asserted that vote - buying and other irregularities marred the electoral process , while observers from the organization of american states generally praised ife 's handling of the elections . after considering legal challenges to the results , the tepfj found insufficient evidence of vote - buying to warrant an annulment of the vote . the tribunal declared institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) candidate enrique peña nieto , a former governor of the state of mexico , president - elect on august 31 , 2012. peña nieto will take office on december 1 , 2012. the centrist pri that governed mexico from 1929 to 2000 not only retook the presidency after 12 years of rule by the conservative national action party ( pan ) , but also won a plurality in the senate and chamber of deputies . in the presidential contest , enrique peña nieto captured 38.2 % of the vote , followed by andrés manuel lópez obrador of the party of the democratic revolution ( prd ) with 31.6 % , josefina vázquez mota of the pan with 25.4 % , and gabriel quadri of the national alliance party ( panal ) with 2.3 % . the narrow margin of peña nieto 's victory , coupled with the fact that lópez obrador has refused to recognize the election results , could complicate the transition period . and , while pan president felipe calderón has pledged to work with the incoming administration , his party has joined the prd in calling on authorities to investigate whether the pri used any illicit finances to fund peña nieto 's campaign . polls predicted that the pri might also capture a simple majority in one or both chambers of the mexican congress , a feat not accomplished since 1994. the pri and the allied green ecological party ( pvem ) party failed to capture a majority in either house , but could achieve a simple majority in the chamber by aligning with the panal . for legislation to pass the senate , and for any measures to amend the constitution ( which require a two - thirds majority ) , the pri will have to form cross - party coalitions . the pri will most likely find support from the pan , which lost seats in the chamber but retained a powerful bargaining position . the prd - led coalition , which will now have more seats in the chamber than the pan and remains the third - largest force in the senate , could complicate some reform efforts , including those aimed at increasing private participation in the energy sector , a key priority for peña nieto . some members of congress may be concerned that the leadership changes resulting from the july 1 , 2012 , mexican elections will significantly impact u.s. - mexican relations , particularly now that the party controlling the presidency has changed . however , few analysts are predicting that the transition from pan to pri rule will result in seismic shifts in bilateral relations . enrique peña nieto has sought to reassure u.s. policy makers that his administration will continue to combat organized crime , while also striving to reduce violence in mexico . he also aims to increase bilateral and trilateral ( with canada ) economic and energy cooperation . this report provides an overview of the parties and candidates who competed in the mexican federal elections with a focus on the presidential contest , recaps the election results , and discusses some potential implications of the elections for u.s. - mexican security cooperation , north american economic integration , and u.s. energy security .
