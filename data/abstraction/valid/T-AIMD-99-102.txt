pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the bureau of land management 's ( blm ) automated land and mineral record system project , also known as the almrs / modernization , focusing on : the history of the project ; the results of gao 's reviews , including the key reasons for problems ; and where gao believes blm should go from here . gao noted that : blm spent over 15 years and estimates that it invested about $ 411 million planning and developing the almrs / modernization , only to have the major software component -- known as the almrs initial operating capacity ( ioc ) -- fail ; as a result of that failure , the bureau decided not to deploy almrs ioc at this time ; gao has previously reported on the significant problems and risks that blm has encountered ; gao has made many recommendations to reduce those risks ; however , blm has been slow to implement some recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others ; blm now needs to determine whether it can salvage any of the more than $ 67-million reported investment in almrs ioc software , by analyzing the software to determine if it can be cost - beneficially modified to meet blm 's needs ; and in addition , to reduce the risk that future efforts will result in similar failures , blm should assess its information technology investment practices and systems acquisition capabilities .
