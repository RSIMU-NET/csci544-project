gao has designated dod 's support infrastructure management as a high - risk area in part due to challenges in reducing excess infrastructure . dod installations can establish agreements to allow entities such as non - dod federal agencies and private entities to use property on dod installations that are unutilized or underutilized . dod reports that , as of the end of fiscal year 2013 , its real property portfolio consisted of more than 562,000 facilities with an estimated value of $ 850 billion . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision that gao review the potential for relocating federal government tenants onto military installations . this report identifies available options for dod to allow non - dod entities to use unutilized and underutilized space on military installations , and what factors dod considers for each option ; any limitations and benefits of bringing non - dod federal tenants onto military installations , and the extent to which dod and other federal agencies coordinate to do so . gao evaluated dod and military service guidance ; visited selected installations having non - dod tenants , including two that support the arctic mission ; and interviewed cognizant officials . department of defense ( dod ) guidance outlines options for granting the use of unutilized ( vacant ) and underutilized ( partially vacant ) space on military installations to non - dod entities , such as other federal agencies , and installations consider several factors when contemplating such grants . for example , dod and military department guidance identifies the real estate instruments , such as leases and licenses that are to be used to issue grants to non - dod entities . all seven of the installations that gao visited reported using this guidance to select the appropriate instrument based on the type of non - dod entity , type of facility , and proposed use of the asset . for example , installations selected permits as the appropriate real estate instrument when issuing grants to a non - dod federal agency as outlined in dod and military department guidance . prior to granting the use of space to a non - dod entity , officials at installations reported considering several factors , including the availability of space , effect on the mission , and factors unique to the installation . in instances where there are competing interests for space , officials reported considering priorities set forth in dod guidance for assigning available space on the installation . officials also reported considering whether the tenant could potentially have a negative effect on the installation 's ability to comply with any regulations , such as preserving protected habitats . dod faces both limitations and benefits from moving non - dod agencies onto installations . limitations such as the availability of suitable space affect dod 's ability to bring non - dod federal agencies onto military installations . for example , officials at all seven of the installations gao visited reported a lack of vacant space or vacant space that is usable , which limited their ability to accommodate space requests . however , when a match can be made between an installation 's available space and a potential tenant agency 's needs , both parties can benefit . for example , installations can potentially benefit through the avoidance of direct and indirect costs , such as the cost for utilities and maintenance incurred for unused or underutilized space . non - dod federal agencies can save costs on commercial leases because dod charges for use of space by other federal entities on a cost - recovery basis . despite the potential benefits , routine information sharing does not occur between dod and the general services administration ( gsa ) concerning opportunities to move non - dod federal agencies onto military installations . specifically , when gsa is working to satisfy the space needs of its clients , it does not routinely contact dod installations to inquire whether space might be available . dod , on the other hand , waits for non - dod federal agencies to inquire whether space is available and does not generally reach out to gsa or agencies that may be interested in space . without taking actions to share information , gsa offices working with non - dod federal agencies to find them space may risk missing opportunities for their clients to reduce or avoid costs . in addition , both gsa and dod may miss opportunities to leverage resources and enhance utilization of federal real property . gao recommends that dod and gsa collaborate to enhance routine information sharing concerning non - dod federal agencies seeking workspace at military installations . dod and gsa concurred and agreed to take action to help ensure that government - owned assets are used to capacity .
