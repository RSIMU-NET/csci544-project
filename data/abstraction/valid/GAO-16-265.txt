the patient protection and affordable care act required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces in each state to allow consumers to compare , select , and purchase health insurance plans . states establishing their own marketplaces are responsible for securing the supporting information systems to protect sensitive personal information they contain . cms is responsible for overseeing states ' efforts , as well as securing federal systems to which marketplaces connect , including its data hub . gao was asked to review security issues related to the data hub , and cms oversight of state - based marketplaces . its objectives were to describe security and privacy incidents reported for healthcare.gov and related systems , assess the effectiveness of security controls for the data hub , and assess cms oversight of state - based marketplaces and the security of selected state - based marketplaces . gao reviewed incident data , analyzed networks and controls , reviewed policies and procedures , and interviewed cms and marketplace officials . this is a public version of a limited official use only report that gao issued in march 2016. sensitive information on technical issues has been omitted from this version . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) reported 316 security - related incidents , between october 2013 and march 2015 , affecting healthcare.gov — the web portal for the federal health insurance marketplace — and its supporting systems . according to gao 's review of cms records for this period , the majority of these incidents involved such things as electronic probing of cms systems by potential attackers , which did not lead to compromise of any systems , or the physical or electronic mailing of sensitive information to an incorrect recipient . none of the incidents included evidence that an outside attacker had successfully compromised sensitive data , such as personally identifiable information . consistent with federal guidance , cms has taken steps to protect the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by the systems and connections supporting healthcare.gov , including the federal data services hub ( data hub ) . the data hub is a portal for exchanging information between the federal marketplace and cms 's external partners . to protect these systems , cms assigned responsibilities to appropriate officials and documented information security policies and procedures . however , gao identified weaknesses in technical controls protecting the data flowing through the data hub . these included insufficiently restricted administrator privileges for data hub systems , inconsistent application of security patches , and insecure configuration of an administrative network . gao also identified additional weaknesses in technical controls that could place sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure , modification , or loss . in a separate report , with limited distribution , gao recommended 27 actions to mitigate the identified weaknesses . in addition , while cms has taken steps to oversee the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by state - based marketplaces , improvements are needed . for example , cms assigned roles and responsibilities to various oversight entities , met regularly with state officials , and developed a reporting tool to monitor performance . however , it has not defined specific oversight procedures , such as the timing for when each activity should occur , or what follow - up corrective actions should be performed if deficiencies are identified . further , cms does not require sufficiently frequent monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls for state - based marketplaces , only requiring testing once every 3 years . gao identified significant weaknesses in the controls at three selected state - based marketplaces . these included insufficient encryption and inadequately configured firewalls , among others . in september 2015 , gao reported these results to the three states , which generally agreed and have plans in place to address the weaknesses . without well - defined oversight procedures and more frequent monitoring of security controls , cms has less assurance that state - based marketplaces are adequately protected against risks to the sensitive data they collect , process , and maintain . gao is recommending that cms define procedures for overseeing the security of state - based marketplaces and require continuous monitoring of state marketplace security controls . hhs concurred with gao 's recommendations .
