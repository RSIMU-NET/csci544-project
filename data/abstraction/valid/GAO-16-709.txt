levees , which are man - made structures such as earthen embankments or concrete floodwalls , play a vital role in reducing the risk of flooding . their failure can contribute to loss of lives or property , as shown by the devastation of hurricane katrina in 2005. it is estimated that there are over 100,000 miles of levees across the united states , many of which are owned or operated by nonfederal entities . the corps and fema are the two principal federal agencies with authorities related to levee safety . the water resources reform and development act of 2014 requires the corps and fema to take the lead on certain national levee - safety - related activities including developing a national levee inventory , which congress authorized in 2007. the act also includes a provision for gao to report on related issues . this report examines the corps ' and fema 's progress in carrying out key national activities related to levee safety required in the act . gao reviewed pertinent federal laws and executive orders as well as budget , planning , and policy documents from the corps and fema ; compared agency activities with federal internal control standards ; and interviewed corps and fema headquarters officials . the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) and the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) have made little progress in implementing key national levee - safety - related activities required in the water resources reform and development act of 2014. more specifically , the corps has been working to develop a national levee inventory , but the agencies have taken no action on the remaining key national levee - safety - related activities for which they are responsible under the act , as shown in the table below . agency officials identified resource constraints as a primary reason for their lack of progress in implementing such activities , and corps officials said that not implementing these activities could potentially result in safety risks and federal financial risks for disaster relief , among other impacts . however , the agencies have no plan for implementing the remaining activities required by the act . without a plan that includes milestones for accomplishing these activities using existing resources or requesting additional resources as needed , the agencies are unlikely to make progress implementing the activities under the act . gao recommends that the corps and fema develop a plan that includes milestones for implementing the required national levee - safety - related activities using existing resources or requesting additional resources as needed . the agencies generally concurred with gao 's recommendation .
