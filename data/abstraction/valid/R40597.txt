a discussion draft of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was released march 31 , 2009 , by representative waxman , chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce , and representative markey , chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee . the draft legislation , titled the american clean energy and security act of 2009 , proposes a `` cap and trade '' system to control carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have been associated with global climate change . the proposed cap - and - trade system would cover electric utilities and other entities that together are responsible for 85 % of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions . covered entities would need permits ( called allowances ) to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , and unused allowances could be banked for future use or sold . the number of allowances issued each year would be gradually reduced until greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities were cut 83 % below 2005 levels in 2050. to address concerns that greenhouse gas controls could place u.s. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage , the draft bill authorizes compensation to certain industrial sectors . the discussion draft indicates that provisions to assist workers and consumers affected by the cap - and - trade system remain to be written . the draft bill would require retail electricity suppliers to meet a certain percentage of their power load with electricity generated from renewable resources , starting at 6 % in 2012 and gradually rising to 25 % in 2025. a state could meet up to one - fifth of that requirement with energy efficiency measures . deployment of `` smart grid '' technologies would be encouraged , as would technologies to capture and sequester carbon emissions . standards would be required to reduce carbon emissions from motor vehicle fuel , and federal support for building electric vehicles would be authorized . energy efficiency provisions in the draft bill include state incentives for adopting advanced building efficiency codes , codification of appliance efficiency standards , and transportation efficiency goals . several major issues are not addressed by the draft bill and are still under discussion . a key unanswered question is how to allocate emission allowances . industry groups contend that allowances should initially be provided at no cost , to reduce economic disruption . others have proposed that allowances be auctioned to raise revenue for consumer protection , industry rebates , and other transitional programs . substantial controversy is also continuing over the draft bill 's renewable energy mandate on electricity suppliers . regional differences in renewable energy resources have prompted criticism that a national renewable electricity standard would be unworkable , or that the goal of 25 % renewables by 2025 is unrealistic .
