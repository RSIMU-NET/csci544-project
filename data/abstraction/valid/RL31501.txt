the history of child labor in america is long and , in some cases , unsavory . it dates back to the founding of the united states . historically , except for the privileged few , most children worked — either for their parents or for an outside employer . through the years , however , child labor practices have changed . so have the benefits and risks associated with employment of children . in some respects , altered workplace technology has served to make work easier and less hazardous . at the same time , some processes and equipment have rendered the workplace more advanced and dangerous , especially for children and youth . child labor first became a federal legislative issue at least as far back as 1906 with the introduction of the beveridge proposal for regulation of the types of work in which children might be engaged . although the 1906 legislation was not adopted , it led to extended study of the conditions under which children were employed or allowed to work and to a series of legislative proposals — some approved , others defeated or overturned by the courts — culminating in the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) of 1938. the latter statute , amended periodically , remains the primary federal law dealing with the employment of children . generally speaking , work by young persons ( under 18 years of age ) in mines and factories is not allowed . the types of nonfarm work that may be suitable ( or especially hazardous ) for persons under 18 years of age has been left mainly to the discretion of the secretary of labor . some types of work — for example , some newspaper sales and delivery , theatrical ( and related ) employment — are exempt from the flsa child labor requirements . finally , a distinction has been made between employment in nonagricultural occupations and in agricultural occupations and , in the latter case , between work for a parent and commercial employment . this report examines the historical issue of child labor in america and summarizes legislation that has been introduced from the 108th congress to the 113th congress .
