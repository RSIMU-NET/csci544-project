high - level nuclear waste -- one of the nation 's most hazardous substances -- is accumulating at 80 sites in 35 states . the united states has generated 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste and is expected to generate 153,000 metric tons by 2055. the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 , as amended , requires the department of energy ( doe ) to dispose of the waste in a geologic repository at yucca mountain , about 100 miles northwest of las vegas , nevada . however , the repository is more than a decade behind schedule , and the nuclear waste generally remains at the commercial nuclear reactor sites and doe sites where it was generated . this report examines the key attributes , challenges , and costs of the yucca mountain repository and the two principal alternatives to a repository that nuclear waste management experts identified : storing the nuclear waste at two centralized locations and continuing to store the waste on site where it was generated . gao developed models of total cost ranges for each alternative using component cost estimates provided by the nuclear waste management experts . however , gao did not compare these alternatives because of significant differences in their inherent characteristics that could not be quantified . the yucca mountain repository is designed to provide a permanent solution for managing nuclear waste , minimize the uncertainty of future waste safety , and enable doe to begin fulfilling its legal obligation under the nuclear waste policy act to take custody of commercial waste , which began in 1998. however , project delays have led to utility lawsuits that doe estimates are costing taxpayers about $ 12.3 billion in damages through 2020 and could cost $ 500 million per year after 2020 , though the outcome of pending litigation may affect the government 's total liability . also , the administration has announced plans to terminate yucca mountain and seek alternatives . even if doe continues the program , it must obtain a nuclear regulatory commission construction and operations license , a process likely to be delayed by budget shortfalls . gao 's analysis of doe 's cost projections found that a repository to dispose of 153,000 metric tons would cost from $ 41 billion to $ 67 billion ( in 2009 present value ) over a 143-year period until the repository is closed . nuclear power rate payers would pay about 80 percent of these costs , and taxpayers would pay about 20 percent . centralized storage at two locations provides an alternative that could be implemented within 10 to 30 years , allowing more time to consider final disposal options , nuclear waste to be removed from decommissioned reactor sites , and the government to take custody of commercial nuclear waste , saving billions of dollars in liabilities . however , doe 's statutory authority to provide centralized storage is uncertain , and finding a state willing to host a facility could be extremely challenging . in addition , centralized storage does not provide for final waste disposal , so much of the waste would be transported twice to reach its final destination . using cost data from experts , gao estimated the 2009 present value cost of centralized storage of 153,000 metric tons at the end of 100 years to range from $ 15 billion to $ 29 billion but increasing to between $ 23 billion and $ 81 billion with final geologic disposal . on - site storage would provide an alternative requiring little change from the status quo , but would face increasing challenges over time . it would also allow time for consideration of final disposal options . the additional time in on - site storage would make the waste safer to handle , reducing risks when waste is transported for final disposal . however , the government is unlikely to take custody of the waste , especially at operating nuclear reactor sites , which could result in significant financial liabilities that would increase over time . not taking custody could also intensify public opposition to spent fuel storage site renewals and reactor license extensions , particularly with no plan in place for final waste disposition . in addition , extended on - site storage could introduce possible risks to the safety and security of the waste as the storage systems degrade and the waste decays , potentially requiring new maintenance and security measures . using cost data from experts , gao estimated the 2009 present value cost of on - site storage of 153,000 metric tons at the end of 100 years to range from $ 13 billion to $ 34 billion but increasing to between $ 20 billion to $ 97 billion with final geologic disposal .
