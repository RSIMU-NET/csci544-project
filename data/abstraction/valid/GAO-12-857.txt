the recovery act increased the federal share of medicaid funding . federal law does not prohibit providers with tax debt from enrolling in medicaid , but gaos prior work found that thousands of medicaid providers do have unpaid federal taxes . since any provider who received medicaid reimbursements during 2009 received recovery act funds , gao was asked to determine the magnitude of unpaid federal taxes owed by medicaid providers reimbursed during 2009 in selected states ; provide examples of medicaid providers who have sizeable unpaid federal taxes ; and evaluate opportunities and challenges related to collecting unpaid federal taxes through a levy process designed to offset medicaid reimbursements . gao compared medicaid reimbursement information from three states to known irs tax debts as of september 30 , 2009. these states were among those that received the largest portion of recovery act medicaid funding . to provide examples of medicaid providers who have sizeable unpaid federal taxes , gao conducted a detailed review of 40 medicaid providers from the three states that had over $ 100,000 of federal tax debt . gaos sample of three states and 40 cases can not be generalized to all states and all medicaid providers . gao also reviewed relevant laws and reports and interviewed federal and state officials . about 7,000 medicaid providers in three selected states ( florida , new york , and texas ) had approximately $ 791 million in unpaid federal taxes from calendar year 2009 or earlier . this represents about 5.6 percent of the medicaid providers reimbursed by the selected states during 2009. these 7,000 medicaid providers with unpaid federal taxes received a total of about $ 6.6 billion in medicaid reimbursements during 2009 ( including american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 [ recovery act ] funds ) . the amount of unpaid federal taxes gao identified is likely understated because internal revenue service ( irs ) taxpayer data reflect only the amount of unpaid taxes either reported on a tax return or assessed by irs through enforcement ; it does not include entities that did not file tax returns or underreported their income . the 40 medicaid providers gao reviewed received a total of $ 235 million in medicaid reimbursements ( including recovery act funds ) in 2009 and had unpaid federal taxes of about $ 26 million through 2010. the amount of unpaid federal taxes ranged from approximately $ 100,000 to over $ 6 million . in addition , irs records indicate that providers in two of gaos cases are currently , or have previously been , under criminal investigation . for example , in one case a provider was caught participating in a medical billing fraud . irs may levy , or seize , a taxpayers property to satisfy a tax debt and , in some instances , is authorized to use an automated process to continuously levy federal payments made to delinquent taxpayers . medicaid reimbursements have never been continuously levied using this provision of the law because the irs determined that these reimbursements do not qualify as federal payments . however , if such a process could be used , gao estimates that irs could have collected between $ 22 million and $ 330 million in the selected states in 2009. states we spoke to expressed concerns about implementing continuous levies , given the challenges they encounter with processing onetime irs levies . for example , states have had difficulty reaching irs revenue officers and problems with irs sending levies to the wrong address . gao recommends that irs explore opportunities to enhance collection of unpaid taxes from medicaid providers , including the use of continuous levies . irs agreed with our recommendation .
