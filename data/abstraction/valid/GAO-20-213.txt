many of dhs 's major it acquisition programs have taken longer than expected to develop or failed to deliver the desired value . in april 2016 , to help improve the department 's it acquisition and management , dhs identified agile software development as the preferred approach for all of its it programs and projects . gao was asked to examine dhs 's adoption of agile software development . the objective of this review was to assess the extent to which dhs has addressed selected leading practices for its transition to the use of agile software development . gao identified leading practices for planning , implementing , and measuring organizational change that apply to dhs 's transition to agile through its review of guidance published by the project management institute and gao . gao also reviewed work it performed to develop leading practices for agile software development adoption . gao analyzed dhs documentation , such as policies , guidance , plans , and working group artifacts and assessed them against the selected leading practices . gao also reviewed the implementation of selected practices within individual it projects . finally , gao interviewed dhs officials to discuss any practices that were not fully implemented . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has taken steps to implement selected leading practices in its transition from waterfall , an approach that historically delivered useable software years after program initiation , to agile software development , which is focused on incremental and rapid delivery of working software in small segments . as shown below , this quick , iterative approach is to deliver results faster and collect user feedback continuously . dhs has fully addressed one of three leading practice areas for organization change management and partially addressed the other two . collectively , these practices advise an organization to plan for , implement , and measure the impact when undertaking a significant change . the department has fully defined plans for transitioning to agile development . dhs has partially addressed implementation â€” the department completed 134 activities but deferred roughly 34 percent of planned activities to a later date . these deferred activities are in progress or have not been started . with respect to the third practice , dhs clarified expected outcomes for the transition , such as reduced risk of large , expensive it failures . however , these outcomes are not tied to target measures . without these , dhs will not know if the transition is achieving its desired results . dhs has also addressed four of the nine leading practices for adopting agile software development . for example , the department has modified its acquisition policies to support agile development methods . however , it needs to take additional steps to , among other things , ensure all staff are appropriately trained and establish expectations for tracking software code quality . by fully addressing leading practices , dhs can reduce the risk of continued problems in developing and acquiring current , as well as , future it systems . gao is making 10 recommendations to dhs to implement selected leading practices for its transition to agile software development . dhs agreed with gao 's recommendations and described actions taken and planned to address them .
