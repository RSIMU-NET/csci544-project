americans spend billions of hours each year providing information to federal agencies by filling out information collections ( forms , surveys , or questionnaires ) . a major aim of the paperwork reduction act ( pra ) is to minimize the burden that these collections impose on the public , while maximizing their public benefit . under the act , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to approve all such collections and to report annually on the agencies ' estimates of the associated burden . in addition , agency chief information officers ( cio ) are to review information collections before they are submitted to omb for approval and certify that the collections meet certain standards set forth in the act . for its testimony , gao was asked to comment on omb 's burden report for 2004 and to discuss its recent study of pra implementation ( gao - 05-424 ) , concentrating on cio review and certification processes and describing alternative processes that two agencies have used to minimize burden . for its study , gao reviewed a governmentwide sample of collections , reviewed processes and collections at four agencies that account for a large proportion of burden , and performed case studies of 12 approved collections . the total paperwork burden imposed by federal information collections shrank slightly in fiscal year 2004 , according to estimates provided in omb 's annual pra report to congress . the estimated total burden was 7.971 billion hours -- a decrease of 1.6 percent ( 128 million burden hours ) from the previous year 's total of about 8.099 billion hours . different types of changes contributed to the overall change in these estimates , according to omb . for example , adjustments to the estimates ( from such factors as changes in estimation methods and estimated number of respondents ) accounted for a decrease of about 156 million hours ( 1.9 percent ) , and agency burden reduction efforts led to a decrease of about 97 million hours ( 1.2 percent ) . these decreases were partially offset by increases in other categories , primarily an increase of 119 million hours ( 1.5 percent ) arising from new statutes . however , because of limitations in the accuracy of burden estimates , the significance of small changes in these estimates is unclear . nonetheless , as the best indicators of paperwork burden available , these estimates can be useful as long as the limitations are clearly understood . among the pra provisions aimed at helping to achieve the goals of minimizing burden while maximizing utility is the requirement for cio review and certification of information collections . gao 's review of 12 case studies showed that cios provided these certifications despite often missing or inadequate support from the program offices sponsoring the collections . further , although the law requires cios to provide support for certifications , agency files contained little evidence that cio reviewers had made efforts to improve the support offered by program offices . numerous factors have contributed to these problems , including a lack of management support and weaknesses in omb guidance . because these reviews were not rigorous , omb , the agency , and the public had reduced assurance that the standards in the act -- such as minimizing burden -- were consistently met . in contrast , the internal revenue service ( irs ) and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) have set up processes outside the cio review process that are specifically focused on reducing burden . these agencies , whose missions involve numerous information collections , have devoted significant resources to targeted burden reduction efforts that involve extensive outreach to stakeholders . according to the two agencies , these efforts led to significant reductions in burden on the public . in contrast , for the 12 case studies , the cio review process did not reduce burden . in its report , gao recommended that omb and the agencies take steps to improve review processes and compliance with the act . gao also suggested that the congress may wish to consider mandating pilot projects to target some collections for rigorous analysis along the lines of the irs and epa approaches . omb and the agencies agreed with most of the recommendations , but disagreed with aspects of gao 's characterization of agencies ' compliance with the act 's requirements .
