u.s. - eu relations have been affected by a number of trade disputes in recent years . while the majority of trade disputes do get resolved , attempts to settle some of the disputes have been met withrefusal or inability by one or another of the parties to comply in a timely manner with the worldtrade organization ( wto ) panel rulings . the 108th congress inherits several of these disputeswhere the wto has ruled that u.s. laws violate trade obligations . absent u.s. compliance throughlegislative action , the eu could in some cases decide to retaliate against u.s. exports this year ornext . in the meantime , the eu remains in non - compliance with its wto obligations to allowimports of beef treated with hormones . beyond raising u.s. - eu trade tensions , non - compliance bya key wto member arguably weakens the credibility and authority of the wto and its disputesettlement process . the initiation and resolution of disputes under wto agreements is carried out under the uruguay round dispute settlement understanding ( dsu ) , considered a cornerstone of the wtosystem . the wto dispute settlement process has a more quasi - judicial orientation than thequasi - diplomatic orientation of the prior gatt system , in which negotiation and conciliationgenerally prevailed over multilateral enforcement of rules . the dsu provides for virtually automaticestablishment of panels , adoption of panel and appellate reports and , where requested , authorizationto impose retaliatory measures ; deadlines are set out for various stages of the process . these featuresensure that complaints are heard and promote implementation of wto rulings , thus makingavailable to all wto members the means to clarify trade rules and redress trade injury . at the sametime , the process continues to retain certain diplomatic elements in that its primary aim is to `` securea positive solution to a dispute , '' with the preferred outcome being a `` solution mutually acceptableto the parties to the dispute and consistent with the covered agreements . . opportunities forsettlement are provided at a number of points in a procedure . u.s. and eu instances of longstanding non - compliance have for the most part not involved routine commercial disputes over trade or customs regulations , but rather tax policy and internalnational regulation , particularly of social and health matters . while ambiguity in wto agreementsmay give rise to disputes in these difficult areas , the automatic features of the dsu also allow partiesto pursue such cases through the full dispute process , even though it may be evident from the outsetthat implementation of an adverse wto ruling may be subject to overwhelming domestic oppositionin the defending country . to deal with the problem of non - compliance in difficult cases , bothwashington and brussels may need to give greater attention to a number of concerns and policyconsiderations , including choice of cases initiated , limitations on panel decisions , role of mediationand conciliation , and adoption of remedies that are trade liberalizing . assuming that some disputesare not well - suited for the dsu process , greater efforts may be needed to settle differences throughbilateral negotiations and political compromises , through mediation , or by agreeing to arbitrationfrom an outside ( i.e . , non - wto ) party . this report will be updated periodically . for more on thewto dispute settlement process and u.s. - eu trade relations , see crs report rs20088 and crs issue brief ib10087 .
