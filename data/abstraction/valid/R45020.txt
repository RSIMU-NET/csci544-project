u.s. immigration policy is governed largely by the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , which was first codified in 1952 and has been amended significantly several times since . at a fundamental level , u.s. immigration policy can be viewed as two sides of a coin . one side emphasizes the faciliation of migration flows into the united states according to principles of admission that are based upon national interest . these broad principles currently include family reunification , labor market contribution , humanitarian assistance , and origin - country diversity . the united states has long distinguished permanent immigration from temporary migration . permanent immigration occurs through family and employer - sponsored categories , the diversity immigrant visa lottery , and refugee and asylee admissions . temporary migration occurs through the admission of visitors for specific purposes and limited periods of time , and encompasses two dozen categories of visitors , including foreign tourists , students , temporary workers , and diplomats . the other side of the immigration policy coin emphasizes the restriction of entry to and removal of persons from the united states who lack authorization to reside in the country , are identified as criminal aliens , or whose presence in the united states is not considered to be in the national interest . such immigration enforcement is broadly divided between border enforcement — at and between ports of entry — and other enforcement tasks including detention , removal , worksite enforcement , and combatting immigration fraud . the dual role of u.s. immigration policy creates challenges for balancing major policy priorities , such as ensuring national security , facilitating trade and commerce , protecting public safety , and fostering international cooperation .
