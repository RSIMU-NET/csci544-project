in the current fiscal environment , policymakers are increasingly concerned with securing the economic health of the united states — including combating those crimes that threaten to undermine the nation 's financial stability . identity theft is one such crime . in 2012 , about 12.6 million americans were reportedly victims of identity fraud , and the average identity fraud victim incurred a mean of $ 365 in costs as a result of the fraud . identity theft is often committed to facilitate other crimes such as credit card fraud , document fraud , or employment fraud , which in turn can affect not only the nation 's economy but its security . consequently , in securing the nation and its economic health , policymakers are also tasked with reducing identity theft and its impact . identity theft has remained the dominant consumer fraud complaint to the federal trade commission ( ftc ) . nevertheless , while the number of overall identity theft complaints generally increased between when the ftc began recording identity theft complaints in 2000 and 2008 , the number of complaints decreased in both 2009 and 2010 before rising in 2011 and 2012. identity theft case filings and convictions peaked in 2007 and 2008 , and have generally declined since . aggravated identity theft case filings and convictions , on the other hand , have largely continued to increase since aggravated identity theft was added as a federal offense in 2004. congress continues to debate the federal government 's role in ( 1 ) preventing identity theft and its related crimes , ( 2 ) mitigating the potential effects of identity theft after it occurs , and ( 3 ) providing the most effective tools to investigate and prosecute identity thieves . with respect to preventing identity theft , one issue concerning policymakers is the prevalence of personally identifiable information — and in particular , the prevalence of social security numbers ( ssns ) — in both the private and public sectors . one policy option to reduce their prevalence may involve restricting the use of ssns on government - issued documents such as medicare identification cards . another option could entail providing federal agencies with increased regulatory authority to curb the prevalence of ssn use in the private sector . in debating policies to mitigate the effects of identity theft , one option congress may consider is whether to strengthen data breach notification requirements . such requirements could affect the notification of relevant law enforcement authorities as well as any individuals whose personally identifiable information may be at risk from the breach . congress may also be interested in assessing the true scope of data breaches , particularly involving government networks . there have already been several legislative and administrative actions aimed at curtailing identity theft . congress enacted legislation naming identity theft as a federal crime in 1998 ( p.l . 105-318 ) and later provided for enhanced penalties for aggravated identity theft ( p.l . 108-275 ) . in april 2007 , the president 's identity theft task force issued recommendations to combat identity theft , including specific legislative recommendations to close identity theft - related gaps in the federal criminal statutes . in a further attempt to curb identity theft , congress directed the ftc to issue an identity theft red flags rule , requiring that creditors and financial institutions with specified account types develop and institute written identity theft prevention programs .
