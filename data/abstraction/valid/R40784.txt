mexico has had a growing commitment to trade integration and liberalization through the formation of free trade agreements ( ftas ) since the 1990s , and its trade policy is among the most open in the world . mexico 's pursuit of ftas with other countries not only provides economic benefits , but could also potentially reduce its economic dependence on the united states . the united states is , by far , mexico 's most significant trading partner . approximately 80 % of mexico 's exports go to the united states , and about 47 % of mexico 's imports are supplied by the united states . in an effort to increase trade with other countries , mexico has a total of 11 free trade agreements involving 46 countries . these include agreements with most countries in the western hemisphere , including the united states and canada under the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , chile , colombia , costa rica , nicaragua , peru , guatemala , el salvador , and honduras . in addition , mexico has negotiated ftas outside of the western hemisphere and entered into agreements with israel , japan , and the european union . economic motivations are generally the major driving force for the formation of free trade agreements among countries , but there are other reasons countries enter into ftas , including political and security factors . one of mexico 's primary motivations for its unilateral trade liberalization efforts of the late 1980s and early 1990s was to improve economic conditions in the country , which policymakers hoped would lead to greater investor confidence , attract more foreign investment , and create jobs . mexico could also have other reasons for entering into ftas , such as expanding market access and decreasing its reliance on the united states as an export market . the slow progress in multilateral trade negotiations may also contribute to the increasing interest throughout the world in bilateral and regional free trade agreements under the world trade organization ( wto ) . some countries may see smaller trade arrangements as `` building blocks '' for multilateral agreements . since mexico began liberalizing trade in the early 1990s , its trade with the world has risen rapidly , with exports increasing more rapidly than imports . mexico 's exports to all countries increased 515 % between 1994 and 2016 , from $ 60.8 billion to $ 373.9 billion . although the 2009 economic downturn resulted in a decline in exports , the value of mexican exports recovered in the years that followed . total imports also increased rapidly , from $ 79.3 billion in 1994 to $ 387.1 billion in 2016 , an increase of 388 % . the trade balance went from a deficit of $ 18.5 billion in 1994 to surpluses of $ 7.1 billion and $ 6.5 billion in 1995 and 1996. since 1998 , mexico 's trade balance has remained a deficit , equaling $ 13.2 billion in 2016. mexico 's top five exports in 2016 were passenger motor vehicles , motor vehicle parts , motor vehicles for the transport of goods , automatic data processing machines , and electrical apparatus for telephones . mexico 's top five imports were motor vehicle parts , refined petroleum oil products , electronic integrated circuits , electric apparatus for telephones , and automatic data processing machines . in the 115th congress , issues of concern related to the trade and economic relationship with mexico may involve a possible renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) and its effects , mexico 's external trade policy with other countries , mexico 's intentions of moving forward with multilateral or bilateral free trade agreements with asia - pacific countries , economic conditions in mexico and the labor market , and the status of mexican migration to the united states . this report provides an overview of mexico 's free trade agreements , its motivations for trade liberalization and entering into free trade agreements , and trade trends with the united states and other countries in the world .
