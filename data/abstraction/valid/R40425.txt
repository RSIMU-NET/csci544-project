medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries . it was established in 1965 under title xviii of the social security act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older , and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. medicare , which consists of four parts ( a - d ) , covers hospitalizations , physician services , prescription drugs , skilled nursing facility care , home health visits , and hospice care , among other services . generally , individuals are eligible for medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in medicare - covered employment , are 65 years old , and are a citizen or permanent resident of the united states . individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who can not work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death , or have end - stage renal disease ( permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant ) . the program is administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and by private entities that contract with cms to provide claims processing , auditing , and quality oversight services . in fy2019 , the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons ( 52 million aged and 9 million disabled ) at a total cost of about $ 772 billion . spending under the program ( except for a portion of administrative costs ) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process . services provided under parts a and b ( also referred to as `` original '' or `` traditional '' medicare ) are generally paid directly by the government on a `` fee - for - service '' basis , using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules . under parts c and d , private insurers are paid a monthly `` capitated '' amount to provide enrollees with required benefits . medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons , so long as specific criteria are met . since 1965 , the medicare program has undergone considerable change . for example , during the 111th congress , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 and p.l . 111-152 ) made numerous changes to the medicare program that modified provider reimbursements , provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care , and enhanced certain medicare benefits . in the 114th congress , the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 ( macra ; p.l . 114-10 ) changed the method for calculating updates to medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future . projections of future medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries . for example , the hospital insurance ( part a ) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. additionally , although the supplementary medical insurance ( parts b and d ) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and can not become insolvent , associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country 's competing spending priorities . as such , medicare is expected to be a high - priority issue in the current congress , and congress may consider a variety of medicare reform options ranging from further modifications of provider payment mechanisms to redesigning the entire program . this report provides a general overview of the medicare program including descriptions of the program 's history , eligibility criteria , covered services , provider payment systems , and program administration and financing . a list of commonly used acronyms , as well as information on beneficiary cost sharing , may be found in the appendixes .
