according to usda 's economic research service ( ers ) , national net farm income — a key indicator of u.s. farm well - being — is forecast at $ 63.4 billion in 2017 , up 3 % from last year . the forecast rise in 2017 net farm income comes after three consecutive years of decline from 2013 's record high of $ 123.8 billion . net farm income is calculated on an accrual basis . net cash income ( calculated on a cash - flow basis ) is also projected to be up in 2017 but by a larger share ( 12.6 % ) , driven largely by sales from previous years ' inventory , to $ 100.4 billion . the 2017 net farm income forecast is substantially below the 10-year average of $ 86.4 billion and would be the second lowest since 2003 in inflation - adjusted dollars . this is primarily the result of the outlook for continued weak prices for corn , soybeans , and cotton . most crops and livestock product prices remain significantly below the average for the period of 2011-2013 , when prices for many major commodities attained record or near - record highs . net farm income is down 49 % since 2013 ; net cash income is down 26 % . farm - sector production expenses have fallen slightly over that period ( - 1 % ) but not nearly as quickly as commodity prices and revenue , thus contributing to lower aggregate income totals . partially offsetting the decline in farm revenues is a rise in government payments since 2013 ( +18 % ) . in 2017 , payments are projected at $ 13.0 billion , down slightly ( - 0.2 % ) from 2016. the price loss coverage ( plc ) and agricultural risk coverage ( arc ) revenue support programs for major field crops are expected to trigger payments of $ 8.4 billion in 2017 , up 2.5 % from 2016. u.s. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 , due to strong commodity prices and agricultural exports . in 2017 agricultural exports are forecast to be up 8 % , at $ 139.8 billion , due largely to an improving economic outlook in several major foreign importing countries — but still well below 2014 's record of $ 152.3 billion . u.s. agricultural exports are projected to account for 33 % of farm sector gross earnings in 2017. in addition to the outlook for slightly higher net farm income in 2017 , farm wealth is also projected to be up 4 % from 2016 , to $ 3,075 billion . farm asset values reflect farm investors ' and lenders ' expectations about long - term profitability of farm sector investments . the outlook for slightly higher farm income has reversed the decline in farmland values experienced in 2016. because they comprise such a significant portion of the u.s. farm sector 's asset base ( 81 % ) , change in farmland values is a critical barometer of the farm sector 's financial performance . at the farm household level , average farm household incomes have been well ahead of average u.s. household incomes since the late 1990s . in 2015 ( the last year for which comparable data were available ) , the average farm household income ( including off - farm income sources ) of $ 119,880 was about 51 % higher than the average u.s. household income of $ 79,263 . the outlook for a slight rise in net farm income and farm wealth suggests that the farm economy has at least temporarily stabilized but with substantial regional variation . relatively weak prices for most major program crops signal continued tough times ahead . heading into 2018 , the financial picture for the agricultural sector as a whole remains dependent on continued growth in domestic and foreign demand sources to sustain prices at current modest levels . improvements in agricultural economic well - being will hinge on crop harvests and prices , as well as both domestic and international macroeconomic factors , including economic growth and consumer demand . this report is an update of the february 2017 version to take account of usda 's august 30 , 2017 , farm income update and the august 29 , 2017 , u.s. agricultural trade outlook update .
