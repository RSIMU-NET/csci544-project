few drugs are currently available to treat certain tropical and rare pediatric diseases and to use as medical countermeasures , given their small market or potentially limited profitability . to help provide incentives for the development of such drugs , congress created three prv programs , which award prvs to drug sponsors that develop drugs for tropical diseases , rare pediatric diseases , and medical countermeasures ( e.g . , drugs to mitigate harm from biological , chemical , radiological , or nuclear agents ) . fda , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , administers these programs . the 21st century cures act included a provision for gao to study the prv programs . gao examined the number of prvs awarded and redeemed and the drugs for which they were awarded or redeemed , and what is known about the extent to which the prvs provide incentives for developing drugs to meet unmet needs . gao analyzed fda data on awarded and redeemed prvs for fiscal years 2009 through 2019 and other publicly available information on their transfers and sales . gao conducted a literature review of peer - reviewed articles published from january 2009 through may 2019 that examined the prv programs and interviewed fda officials . gao also interviewed seven stakeholder groups , seven academic researchers , and seven drug sponsors selected based on factors such as familiarity with prv programs or drug development . hhs provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which were incorporated as appropriate . the food and drug administration ( fda ) awards priority review vouchers ( prv ) to drug sponsors that develop drugs for tropical diseases or rare pediatric diseases or to use as medical countermeasures . the prv — which can be sold to another drug sponsor — may be redeemed later to receive priority review from fda with a targeted review time of 6 months , rather than the 10-month standard review , for a drug application of the prv holder 's choice . the potential for additional revenue from either marketing a drug about 4 months sooner or from selling the prv could provide an incentive for drug sponsors to develop drugs for these diseases or conditions . from fiscal year 2009 , when the first prv was awarded , through fiscal year 2019 , fda awarded 31 prvs , mostly for drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases . of the 31 prvs awarded by fda,17 were sold to another drug sponsor for prices ranging from about $ 67 million to $ 350 million , according to available data . as of september 30 , 2019 , available data show that drug sponsors had redeemed 16 of the 31 prvs to obtain a shorter fda review time for drugs to treat conditions and diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , type 2 diabetes , and different forms of arthritis . these drug applications may not otherwise qualify for priority review . gao found few studies that examined the prv programs , and those that did found the programs had little or no effect on drug development . however , all seven drug sponsors gao spoke with stated that prvs were a factor in drug development decisions — six sponsors said they were one of a number of factors , while one sponsor said they were pivotal in its development of a drug . some academic researchers and stakeholders expressed concerns about the prvs as incentives for drug development , including the potential for the expected revenue from the sale of a prv to decline as more are awarded and available for sale .
