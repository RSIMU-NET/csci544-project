effective cybersecurity for federal information systems is essential to preventing the loss of resources , the compromise of sensitive information , and the disruption of government operations . federal information and systems face an evolving array of cyber - based threats , and recent data breaches at federal agencies highlight the impact that can result from ineffective security controls . since 1997 , gao has designated federal information security as a government - wide high - risk area , and in 2003 expanded this area to include computerized systems supporting the nation 's critical infrastructure . this year , in gao 's high - risk update , the area was further expanded to include protecting the privacy of personal information that is collected , maintained , and shared by both federal and nonfederal entities . this statement summarizes challenges facing federal agencies in securing their systems and information and government - wide initiatives , including those led by dhs , aimed at improving cybersecurity . in preparing this statement , gao relied on its previously published and ongoing work in this area . gao has identified a number of challenges federal agencies face in addressing threats to their cybersecurity , including the following : designing and implementing a risk - based cybersecurity program . enhancing oversight of contractors providing it services . improving security incident response activities . responding to breaches of personal information . implementing cybersecurity programs at small agencies . until federal agencies take actions to address these challenges — including implementing the hundreds of recommendations gao and agency inspectors general have made — federal systems and information , including sensitive personal information , will be at an increased risk of compromise from cyber - based attacks and other threats . in an effort to bolster cybersecurity across the federal government , several government - wide initiatives , spearheaded by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and the office of management and budget ( omb ) , are under way . these include the following : personal identity verification : in 2004 , the president directed the establishment of a government - wide standard for secure and reliable forms of id for federal employees and contractor personnel who access government facilities and systems . subsequently , omb directed agencies to issue personal identity verification credentials to control access to federal facilities and systems . omb recently reported that only 41 percent of user accounts at 23 civilian agencies had required these credentials for accessing agency systems . continuous diagnostics and mitigation : dhs , in collaboration with the general services administration , has established a government - wide contract for agencies to purchase tools that are intended to identify cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis . these tools can support agencies ' efforts to monitor their networks for security vulnerabilities and generate prioritized alerts to enable agency staff to mitigate the most critical weaknesses . the department of state adopted a continuous monitoring program , and in 2011 gao reported on the benefits of the program and challenges the department faced in implementing its approach . national cybersecurity protection system ( ncps ) : this system , also referred to as einstein , is to include capabilities for monitoring network traffic and detecting and preventing intrusions , among other things . gao has ongoing work reviewing the implementation of ncps , and preliminary observations indicate that implementation of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities may be limited and dhs appears to have not fully defined requirements for future capabilities . while these initiatives are intended to improve security , no single technology or tool is sufficient to protect against all cyber threats . rather , agencies need to employ a multi - layered , “ defense in depth ” approach to security that includes well - trained personnel , effective and consistently applied processes , and appropriate technologies . in previous work , gao and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations to assist agencies in addressing cybersecurity challenges . gao has also made recommendations to improve government - wide initiatives .
