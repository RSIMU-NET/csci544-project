the april 24 , 2013 , collapse of an eight - story garment factory , called rana plaza , in dhaka , bangladesh , resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 workers . it is reportedly now considered the deadliest accident in the history of the apparel industry . congress has had a long - standing interest in supporting internationally recognized worker rights in developing countries , and the building collapse has raised concerns about worker conditions in bangladesh . rana plaza was allegedly structurally unsound and poorly maintained for apparel production . apparel production is generally known as an industry under threat of fire , and one where workers need easy access to rapid escape routes . issues relating to workers ' inability to effectively exercise their rights to organize , bargain collectively , and work in a safe workplace may have contributed to the tragedy . for example , workers reportedly noticed cracks in the building and resisted entering , and were told that if they did not report to their jobs , they would not be paid . the factory collapse brought international focus to those parts of global supply chains that may not meet basic safety and health standards . the u.s. government supports internationally recognized worker rights through various policies and programs . these include u.s. trade preference programs , free trade agreements , foreign assistance , and department of labor initiatives . congressional and u.s. efforts in this regard are part of an international worker rights support structure in place to offer technical assistance and support to countries â€” especially developing countries . other major parts of this structure include international organizations , such as the international labor organization ( ilo ) , founded in 1919 ; and corporate codes of conduct , which have arisen from a broader movement of corporate social responsibility that gained strength in the 1980s and 1990s . early analysis of the causes of the bangladesh tragedy raises questions about what went wrong and about what can be done to help bangladesh to improve working conditions at factories . efforts to make changes in bangladesh are already underway , and developments on this issue are evolving . this report provides an overview of the recent tragedy in bangladesh and the bangladesh economic environment and culture . it also notes the responses to the tragedy , to date , from congress , the administration , the ilo , the bangladesh government , and the private sector . finally , it raises some possible issues for congress .
