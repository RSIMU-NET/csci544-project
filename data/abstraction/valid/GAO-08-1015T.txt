about 43,000 traffic fatalities occur annually , and another 290,000 people are seriously injured on the nation 's roads . to reduce these numbers , the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act : a legacy for users ( safetea - lu ) nearly doubled funding for the federal highway administration 's ( fhwa ) highway safety improvement program ( hsip ) , authorizing $ 5.1 billion for 2006 through 2009. safetea - lu also added requirements for states to develop strategic highway safety plans that cover all aspects of highway safety , including infrastructure , behavioral ( education and enforcement ) , and emergency medical services projects ; develop crash data analysis systems ; and publicly report on the top 5 percent of hazardous locations on all their public roads . safetea - lu also set aside funds for a legacy rail - highway crossing program and a new high - risk rural road program . this testimony provides preliminary information on the implementation of hsip since safetea - lu . it is based on ongoing work that addresses states ' implementation of hsip following safetea - lu , fhwa 's guidance and assistance for states , and results of hsip to date , including for the two set - aside programs . to conduct this study , gao visited 6 states , judgmentally selected based on highway safety attributes , analyzed plans and reports from these 6 states and 19 randomly selected states , and interviewed fhwa and state safety officials . all states submitted strategic highway safety plans and reports listing the top 5 percent of their hazardous locations , according to fhwa . the 25 state plans gao reviewed generally cover all aspects of highway safety , but the 25 states have not fully developed the required crash data analysis systems . fhwa and state safety officials cited the collaboration that occurred among safety stakeholders in developing the plans as a positive influence on state safety planning . many of the 25 states lacked key components of crash data analysis systems , including crash location data , roadway characteristics data , and software for analyzing the data . as a result , most states can not identify and rank hazardous locations on all public roads , determine appropriate remedies , and estimate costs , as required by safetea - lu , and their 5 percent reports often lack required information on remedies and costs . fhwa provided written guidance and training to assist the states , especially in preparing their strategic highway safety plans , and participated in every state 's strategic safety planning process . however , fhwa has not required states to submit schedules for obtaining complete roadway characteristics data , and because states lack complete data , fhwa 's guidance on the 5 percent reports did not specify a methodology . as a result , states ' 5 percent reports vary widely , raising questions about how this report can be used . it is too soon to evaluate the results of hsip as carried out under safetea - lu because states need more time to identify , implement , and evaluate projects they have undertaken since adopting their strategic highway safety plans . however , preliminary evidence indicates that some hsip provisions may not be aligned with states ' safety priorities . first , most states have not taken advantage of a new spending provision that allows states to use some hsip funds for behavioral or emergency medical services projects , partly because a certification requirement -- that all state highway safety infrastructure needs have been met -- may make them reluctant to do so . second , the rail - highway crossing set - aside program does not target the top safety priorities of some states . lastly , states are still in the early stages of implementing the high - risk rural road set - aside program , and data limitations may make it difficult for some of them to identify qualifying projects , especially for locally owned rural roads . fhwa agreed with gao 's findings .
