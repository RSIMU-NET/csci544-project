congress has taken keen interest in u.s. relations with pakistan , especially as related to counterterrorism and u.s. foreign assistance . the terrorist attacks of september 2001 transformed u.s. - pakistan relations virtually overnight . after more than a decade under broad u.s. sanctions for its nuclear proliferation activities , and later for a military coup , pakistan became a key ally in u.s. - led efforts to combat islamist militancy and extremism . pakistan has been a leading recipient of u.s. assistance for nearly 15 years , having received more than $ 20 billion in economic , security , and humanitarian aid , and military reimbursements . the administrations of president george w. bush and president barack obama have sought close engagement with pakistani leaders . vital u.s. interests are seen to be at stake in this engagement related to regional and global terrorism ; efforts to stabilize afghanistan and the broader region ; nuclear weapons proliferation ; links between pakistan and indigenous american terrorism ; pakistan - india tensions and conflict ; democratization and human rights protection ; and economic development . pakistan is a haven for numerous islamist extremist and terrorist groups , and successive pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even supported some of these as proxies in islamabad 's historical tensions and conflicts with neighbors . the may 2011 revelation that al qaeda founder osama bin laden had enjoyed years - long and relatively comfortable refuge inside pakistan led to intensive u.s. government scrutiny of the bilateral relationship , and sparked much congressional questioning of the wisdom of providing significant u.s. foreign aid to a nation that may not have the intention and / or capacity to be an effective u.s. partner . pakistan 's security services are seen by many independent analysts to be too willing to make distinctions between what they consider to be `` good '' and `` bad '' islamist extremist groups , maintaining supportive relations with afghan insurgent and anti - india militant groups operating from pakistani territory . although the u.s. - pakistan relationship has partially recovered from the 2011 nadir , congress has since imposed both broader and more rigorous conditions on the release of foreign assistance to pakistan . such conditionality now applies to all non - humanitarian transfers , including military reimbursements . for the past four years , the administration has exercised authority granted by congress to waive those conditions in the interests of national security . in january 2015 , secretary of state john kerry led a u.s. delegation for the 5th session of the bilateral u.s. - pakistan strategic dialogue to review progress in the existing five working group areas ( economic and finance ; defense ; law enforcement and counterterrorism ; security , strategic stability , and nonproliferation ; and energy ) . in april , the state department approved the possible $ 952 million sale to pakistan of u.s. - built attack helicopters and missiles , suggesting that the administration intends to continue bolstering pakistan 's capacity to combat militants in its rugged and semi - autonomous western regions . see also crs report r43717 , pakistan political unrest : in brief , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report rl34248 , pakistan 's nuclear weapons : proliferation and security issues , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
