on january 3 , 2019 , the house adopted title i of h.res . 6 , the standing rules for the house of representatives for the 116 th congress . in addition to the standing rules , h.res . 6 included a separate order related to the consideration of appropriations bills . this report provides information on changes to both the standing rules and separate orders that might affect the consideration of budgetary legislation in the house of representatives . these include the following : deleting language in rule x added in the 115 th congress providing for committees to include a review of authorizations for programs or agencies within their jurisdiction in their oversight plans . deleting language in rule xiii , previously adopted in the 114 th and 115 th congresses , requiring that any budgetary estimates provided by the congressional budget office ( cbo ) include , to the extent practicable , a macroeconomic impact analysis ( often referred to as `` dynamic scoring '' ) as well as a requirement that any estimate provided to cbo by the joint committee on taxation also include a macroeconomic impact analysis . deleting language added to rule xxi in the 104 th congress requiring the vote of a three - fifths majority to approve a federal income tax rate increase as well as a requirement in rule xx to automatically order the yeas and nays for a vote of the house on such measures . establishing new language as rule xxviii providing for certain measures concerning the debt limit to automatically be engrossed and deemed to have been passed by the house . this measure would suspend the debt limit through the end of the budget year in the concurrent resolution on the budget ( but not through the period covered by any outyears beyond the budget year ) . the engrossed measure would then be transmitted to the senate for further action . this rule is similar to language that was previously part of house rules from the 96 th - 107 th congresses ( known as the `` gephardt rule '' ) . reestablishing a paygo requirement in the house , which had previously been in effect during the 110 th and 111 th congresses . this paygo rule ( rule xxi , clause 10 ) replaces the cutgo rule that was a part of rule xxi between the 112 th and 115 th congresses . the new rule prohibits the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that is projected to increase or cause a deficit in either of two time periods : ( 1 ) the period consisting of the current fiscal year , the budget year , and the four ensuing fiscal years following the budget year or ( 2 ) the 11-year period consisting of the current year , the budget year , and the ensuing nine fiscal years following the budget year . the rule applies to any bill , joint resolution , amendment , motion , or conference report that affects direct spending or revenues . h.res . 6 also included a separate order establishing a limit on advance appropriations , defined as applying to funding provided in fy2019 appropriations acts that are to become available in any fiscal year following fy2019 . in addition , several separate orders from previous congresses are not included in h.res . 6 for the 116 th congress . these include language prohibiting house consideration of measures estimated by cbo as causing a net increase in spending in excess of $ 5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods beginning with the fiscal year 10 years after the current fiscal year , two points of order that previously supplemented the point of order in section 302 ( f ) of the congressional budget act of 1974 as a means for enforcing 302 ( b ) suballocations , language requiring that appropriations bills include a spending reduction account , and language allowing certain legislative amendments in appropriations bills ( known as the `` holman rule '' ) .
