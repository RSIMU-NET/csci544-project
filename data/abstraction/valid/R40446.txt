unauthorized immigration and unauthorized employment continue to be key issues in the ongoing debate over immigration policy . today 's discussions about these issues build on the work of prior congresses . in 1986 , following many years of debate about unauthorized immigration to the united states , congress passed the immigration reform and control act ( irca ) . this law sought to address unauthorized immigration , in part , by requiring all employers to examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work authorization and to complete and retain employment eligibility verification ( i - 9 ) forms . ten years later , in the face of a growing unauthorized population , congress attempted to strengthen the employment verification process by establishing pilot programs for electronic verification , as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) . the basic pilot program ( known today as e - verify ) , the first of the three iirira employment verification pilots to be implemented and the only one still in operation , began in november 1997. originally scheduled to terminate in november 2001 , it has been extended several times . it is currently authorized until september 30 , 2018 , in accordance with the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) . e - verify is administered by the department of homeland security 's ( dhs 's ) u.s. citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) . as of april 2 , 2018 , there were 779,722 employers enrolled in e - verify , representing more than 2.5 million hiring sites . e - verify is a largely voluntary program , but there are some mandatory participation requirements . among them is a rule , which became effective in 2009 , requiring certain federal contracts to contain a new clause committing contractors to use e - verify . under e - verify , participating employers enter information about their new hires ( name , date of birth , social security number , immigration / citizenship status , and alien number , if applicable ) into an online system . this information is automatically compared with information in social security administration and , if necessary , dhs databases to verify identity and employment eligibility . legislation on electronic employment eligibility verification has been considered in recent congresses . in weighing proposals on electronic employment verification , congress may find it useful to evaluate them in terms of their potential impact on a set of related issues : unauthorized employment ; verification system accuracy , efficiency , and capacity ; discrimination ; employer compliance ; privacy ; and verification system usability and employer burden .
