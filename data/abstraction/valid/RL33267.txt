in recent years , the time needed to comply with various environmental laws has been the subject of public scrutiny and debate in congress . as a result , numerous administrative and legislative efforts ( both proposed and enacted ) have intended to expedite or streamline the environmental compliance process . although methods to do so vary , streamlining measures are often proposed or implemented when the participation of multiple local , state , tribal , or federal agencies is necessary to comply with various environmental requirements . streamlining measures may be applied to various environmental compliance processes , such as federal permitting or approvals . a major focus of streamlining efforts has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 ( nepa ; 42 u.s.c . §§ 4321 , et seq . ) , the implementation of which is overseen by the council on environmental quality ( ceq ) . among other provisions , nepa requires federal agencies to analyze environmental impacts and involve the public before proceeding with any major federal action significantly affecting the human environment . many agencies have implemented administrative and legislative streamlining actions , including the department of agriculture ( usda ) , department of transportation ( dot ) , department of the interior ( doi ) , army corps of engineers ( the corps ) , department of energy ( doe ) , and federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) . streamlining efforts vary from agency to agency but usually involve one or more of the following elements : designating a specific agency as the lead agency responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable requirements , directing the lead agency to develop a coordinated environmental review process , specifying certain lead agency authority ( e.g . , to establish project deadlines or develop dispute resolution procedures ) , codifying existing regulations , delegating specific federal authority to states , designating specific activities as being categorically excluded or exempt from certain elements of nepa , and establishing limits on judicial review . streamlining proposals have generated a great deal of controversy . proponents of such measures argue that streamlining efforts are needed to cut through the `` bureaucratic red tape '' often associated with federal project delivery . others counter that such actions are an attempt to weaken environmental protection and lessen public participation in federal decision - making processes . this report discusses elements of nepa relevant to streamlining , issues associated with determining project delays attributed to nepa , common streamlining methods , and recently enacted legislative and administrative streamlining activities .
