with $ 5.6 billion in procurement spending in fiscal year 2011 , dot relies on its acquisition workforceincluding contracting and program management staffto negotiate and administer contracts and manage large - scale acquisition programs . having sufficient numbers of adequately trained acquisition professionals is critical to ensuring maximum value and benefit to the department . in a fiscal year 2012 senate appropriations bill report , gao was directed to assess dots efforts to identify acquisition workforce needs , and the office of the secretary of transportations role in providing oversight and support for acquisition workforce planning and management . gao reviewed dots acquisition workforce plans for 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 along with supporting documentation , and interviewed agency officials on how the data were collected and used . the primary focus was on five oas that accounted for 92 percent of dot procurement spending in fiscal year 2011. the department of transportation ( dot ) lacks sufficient and reliable data to fully identify its acquisition workforce needs and assess progress in addressing shortfalls over time . over the last 3 years , the office of the senior procurement executivethe office within the office of the secretary of transportation responsible for department - wide acquisition workforce managementhas submitted acquisition workforce plans that reported progress in increasing the size of the workforce and the number of personnel certified to meet education , training , and experience requirements . however , gao identified data limitations due to a lack of internal controls to maintain , compare , and reconcile the data compiled from dots 11 operating administrations ( oa ) , and determined that the department - level data were not sufficient to assess progress over time . for example , dot did not maintain the data it used to prepare the 2010 and 2011 plans and in some cases the data were also not available from the oas . by contrast , gao obtained the data dot used to prepare the 2012 plan , compared it with data from the oas , and interviewed oa officials about the sources and methods they used to report the data . gao found inconsistencies in how the oas reported their data that affect the reliability of the departments aggregate data , but determined that the oa - level data were sufficiently reliable to make observations about staffing challenges and certification shortfalls at the individual oas . specifically , gao found that 4 of the 11 oas would need to replace 50 percent or more of their contract specialists by the end of fiscal year 2013 to meet staffing targets . in addition , some oas reported low certification rates for program / project managers and contracting officers representatives , which increases the risk of dot programs not receiving appropriate oversight . dot lacks the strategic focus and oversight needed to ensure that the department can meet its acquisition workforce goals . federal policy requires agencies to conduct strategic planning to identify short - and long - term needs and plans to address them . the office of the senior procurement executive relies on the oas to conduct acquisition workforce planning , but has not provided oversight or support to help ensure that they collect and maintain consistent data or use it to develop strategies to address workforce goals . officials from the senior procurement executives office stated that they do not monitor the oas acquisition workforce data throughout the year and that their capacity to direct planning efforts is limited in part because they do not have the staff needed to perform oversight . instead , officials stated that the office provides a focal point for coordination among the oas , approves certifications , and provides information on training opportunities . according to leading practices identified in prior gao work , agencies should link workforce goals to budget formulation to ensure that requests are adequate to implement workforce strategies . the office of the senior procurement executive has taken steps to align workforce plans with its strategic goals and budget , but given the challenges with maintaining reliable data , lacks a sound baseline for assessing progress or for making a business case for directing resources or management attention to oas that may face the greatest workforce risks . until dot addresses these issues , the department faces substantial risk that the workforce will not have the capacity or skills needed to effectively manage the departments acquisitions . gao recommends that the secretary of transportation take steps to improve dots ability to address workforce needs , such as improving internal controls for acquisition workforce data and providing guidance to ensure that the oas collect and report workforce data consistently . dot acknowledged past data and coordination challenges and generally concurred with our recommendations . dot also stated it now has the management framework needed to effectively monitor and develop the acquisition workforce .
