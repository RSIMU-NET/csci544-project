medicaid is a significant expenditure for the federal government and the states , with total federal outlays of $ 310 billion in fiscal year 2014. cms reported an estimated $ 17.5 billion in potentially improper payments for the medicaid program in 2014. gao was asked to review pharmacy - related program - integrity efforts at selected states . among other reporting objectives , this report identifies and analyzes indicators of potentially fraudulent or abusive prescribing activities in fiscal year 2011 , and examines the extent to which federal and state oversight policies , controls , and processes are in place to prevent and detect instances of prescription - drug fraud and abuse . gao analyzed medicaid claims paid in fiscal year 2011 , the most - recent reliable data available , for four states : arizona , florida , michigan , and new jersey . these states were chosen , in part , because they were among those with the highest medicaid expenditures ; the results are not generalizable to all states . gao performed data matching with various databases to identify indicators of potential fraud , reviewed cms and state medicaid program - integrity policies , and interviewed cms and state officials performing oversight functions . gao found indicators of potential prescription - medication fraud and abuse among thousands of medicaid beneficiaries and hundreds of prescribers during fiscal year 2011 — the most - recent year for which reliable data were available in four selected states : arizona , florida , michigan , and new jersey . these states accounted for about 13 percent of all fiscal year 2011 medicaid payments . specifically , in these four states , gao found the following : more than 16,000 of the 5.4 million beneficiaries potentially engaged in “ doctor shopping , ” by visiting five or more doctors to receive prescriptions for antipsychotics or respiratory medications valued at about $ 33 million . about 700 beneficiaries received more than a 1-year supply of the same drug in 2011 at a cost to medicaid of at least $ 1.6 million . this is an indicator of diversion , which is the redirection of prescription drugs for illegitimate purposes . as required by federal law , the medicaid drug utilization review program is a two - phase review process states use to promote safety while also monitoring prescription - drug activity for fraud . federal law requires each state to report on the operation of its review program , a key monitoring tool that the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) uses to oversee the review process in states , but gao identified additional actions that could improve oversight . in the first phase , states use tools and eligibility screening to promote patient safety and avoid abuse before the drugs are dispensed . the second phase involves ongoing and periodic examination of claims data to identify patterns of fraud , abuse , gross overuse , or medically unnecessary care , and implement corrective action when needed . however , gao identified two potential controls that are not included in cms 's current reporting requirements : lock - in programs for noncontrolled substances . lock - in programs address doctor shopping by restricting beneficiaries who have abused the medicaid program to one health - care provider , one pharmacy , or both , for receiving prescriptions . lock - in programs have typically been used on controlled substances . expanding lock - in programs that currently focus on controlled substances to restrict abusers of noncontrolled substances , such as the human immunodeficiency virus medications atripla and truvada , to a single prescriber or pharmacy may help address potential fraud and abuse . prohibition of automatic refills . pharmacies permitting automatic refills automatically refill prescriptions for certain medications without any customer action . concerns with pharmacy automatic refill include the potential for stockpiling , continued fill of discontinued medications , and increased cost and waste of prescription medications . two states gao reviewed — florida and arizona — have prohibited the practice . cms does not collect information about lock - in programs for noncontrolled substances or automatic refill prohibitions , but doing so would help the agency determine whether additional guidance is needed . gao recommends that cms require states to report information about specific drug - utilization review controls to determine whether additional guidance is needed . the agency concurred with the recommendation and stated that it will consider requiring states to report on these areas .
