justice john paul stevens played a pivotal role in determining the scope of executive - branch power in a post - 9 / 11 world . after 9 / 11 , congress quickly authorized the executive to respond to the terrorist attacks using military force . difficult legal questions emerged from the consequences of the ensuing military actions , particularly as suspected members of al qaeda and the taliban were captured in afghanistan and elsewhere and transferred to the u.s. naval station at guantanamo bay , cuba . key questions included : what legal authorities restrict the executive 's ability to detain and try such persons as it sees fit ? . to what extent do detainees outside of the united states have the right to challenge their detentions in federal courts ? . when may congress remove federal courts ' jurisdiction over habeas cases ? . justice stevens authored majority opinions in two leading cases , rasul v. bush and hamdan v. rumsfeld , in which the court allowed detainees ' habeas petitions to proceed and invalidated the early incarnation of military commissions , thereby rejecting the broader views of executive power articulated shortly after the 9 / 11 attacks . in the cases , his view prevailed over strongly articulated dissenting opinions authored by justice scalia and other justices . for a more in - depth examination of the supreme court 's post - 9 / 11 decisions regarding habeas corpus , see crs report rl33180 , enemy combatant detainees : habeas corpus challenges in federal court , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
