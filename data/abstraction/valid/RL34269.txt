amidst growing media ownership consolidation and a significant decline in minority ownership of telecommunications businesses , there has been renewed interest in programs that foster diversity among telecommunications business owners . one potential avenue under consideration is to revive , in revised fashion , a tax program that would allow current owners who sell their broadcast properties to eligible purchasers to defer taxes on gains from the sale . that program had been available for sales to minority - owned firms , defined as socially and economically disadvantaged businesses ( sdbs ) . it was abolished by congress in 1995 amidst allegations of abuse . in that same year , the supreme court held that all government race - based classifications must meet the most exacting standard of review applied by the court , meaning that all racial classifications must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest . to the extent that legislation or fcc programs seek to increase racial and ethnic minority ownership of broadcast stations , they are likely to be subjected to intense scrutiny if challenged in court . the analysis that may be conducted is discussed in detail in this report .
