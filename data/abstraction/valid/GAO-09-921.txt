federal agencies obligate billions of dollars annually using cost - reimbursement contracts . this type of contract involves high risk for the government because of the potential for cost escalation and because the government pays a contractor 's costs of performance regardless of whether the work is completed . as such , cost - reimbursement contracts are suitable only when the cost of the work to be done can not be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use fixed - price contracts . agencies may use this contract type only if certain conditions are met . at your request , gao assessed the extent of agencies ' obligations under these contracts , the rationales for using this contract type , determinations that contractors ' accounting systems are adequate for determining costs applicable to the contracts , and procedures for monitoring contractor cost controls . gao analyzed federal procurement data and contract files and interviewed contracting and other government officials . the complete picture of the government 's use of cost - reimbursement contracts is unclear . from fiscal years 2003 through 2008 federal obligations under cost - reimbursement contracts were reported to have increased $ 16 billion , to $ 136 billion , which represented a decrease in the total percentage of federal obligations over the 6-year period , from 34 percent to 26 percent . however , the overall downward trend is misleading . a significant increase has been reported for obligations using the `` combination '' contract type , a category that based on gao 's analysis of 2008 data , includes many contracts with cost - reimbursement obligations that are not recorded as such . according to ofpp , a decision was recently made to eliminate the use of `` combination '' as a federal procurement data system - next generation contract type , effective for all new contract awards starting in fiscal year 2010. in addition , gao found billions of dollars for which the contract type had been coded as `` missing '' in fiscal year 2008. agencies ' rationales for using cost - reimbursement contracts were difficult to determine because contracting officers frequently did not document -- even in acquisition plans -- why they chose to use this contract type . the current requirement for such documentation is minimal , but recent legislation ( not yet implemented in the federal acquisition regulation ) requires that acquisition plans address the rationale . of the 92 contracts and orders gao reviewed , about 30 percent did not include any documentation . the supporting documentation gao did find generally did not explain why a cost - reimbursement contract for the specific requirement was selected . gao also found little evidence that agency officials are analyzing contracts ' pricing history and requirements to determine if they can transition to a contract type with firmer pricing , even though experience may provide a basis for doing so . of the 92 contracts and orders gao reviewed , about half had any evidence that , at least within 4 years before contract award , contractors ' accounting systems had been deemed adequate to determine costs applicable to the contract . twenty contract files had no evidence that the contractors ' accounting systems were determined adequate and 20 other contract files contained determinations that had been made either many years before award or after the contract was awarded . inadequate accounting systems , or accounting systems that had not been deemed adequate for many years , may result in the government making improper payments to contractors . gao found a range of procedures for monitoring contractor cost controls at the agencies in its review . procedures at the civilian agencies generally call for program officials to review contractor invoices . at the department of defense , cost surveillance depends on contractor - reported earned value management data , supplemented with audits for the purpose of testing whether invoiced costs are allowable . gao 's prior work has raised concerns about the effectiveness of these audits .
