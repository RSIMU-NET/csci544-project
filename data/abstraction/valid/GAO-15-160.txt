the united states has signed 14 ftas , liberalizing u.s. trade with 20 countries . these ftas include provisions regarding fundamental labor rights in the partner countries . ustr and dol , supported by state , are responsible for monitoring and assisting fta partners ' implementation of these provisions . gao was asked to assess the status of implementation of fta labor provisions in partner countries . gao examined steps that selected partner countries have taken , and u.s. assistance they have received , to implement these provisions and other labor initiatives and the reported results of such steps ; submissions regarding possible violations of fta labor provisions that dol has accepted and any problems related to the submission process ; and the extent to which u.s. agencies monitor and enforce implementation of fta labor provisions and report results to congress . gao selected cafta - dr and the ftas with colombia , oman , and peru as representative of the range of ftas with labor provisions , among other reasons . gao reviewed documentation related to each fta and interviewed u.s. , partner government , and other officials in five of the partner countries . partner countries of free trade agreements ( fta ) that gao selected — the dominican republic - central america - united states free trade agreement ( cafta - dr ) and the ftas with colombia , oman , and peru — have taken steps to implement labor provisions and other initiatives to strengthen labor rights . for example , u.s. and foreign officials said that el salvador and guatemala — both partners to cafta - dr — as well as colombia , oman , and peru have acted to change labor laws , and colombia and guatemala have acted to address violence against union members . since 2001 , u.s. agencies have provided $ 275 million in labor - related technical assistance and capacity - building activities for fta partners , including $ 222 million for the four ftas gao reviewed . however , u.s. agencies reported , and gao found , persistent challenges to labor rights , such as limited enforcement capacity , the use of subcontracting to avoid direct employment , and , in colombia and guatemala , violence against union leaders . since 2008 , the department of labor ( dol ) has accepted five formal complaints — known as submissions — about possible violations of fta labor provisions and has resolved one , regarding peru ( see fig . ) . however , for each submission , dol has exceeded by an average of almost 9 months its 6-month time frame for investigating fta - related labor submissions and issuing public reports , showing the time frame to be unrealistic . also , union representatives and other stakeholders gao interviewed in partner countries often did not understand the submission process , possibly limiting the number of submissions filed . further , stakeholders expressed concerns that delays in resolving the submissions , resulting in part from dol 's exceeding its review time frames , may have contributed to the persistence of conditions that affect workers and are allegedly inconsistent with the ftas . five labor submissions accepted by dol regarding free trade agreements in 2009 , gao found weaknesses in the office of the u.s. trade representative 's ( ustr ) and dol 's monitoring and enforcement of fta labor provisions . in the same year , the agencies pledged to adopt a more proactive , interagency approach . gao 's current review found that although the agencies have taken several steps since 2009 to strengthen their monitoring and enforcement of fta labor provisions , they lack a strategic approach to systematically assess whether partner countries ' conditions and practices are inconsistent with labor provisions in the ftas . despite some proactive steps , they generally rely on labor submissions to begin identifying , investigating , and initiating steps to address possible inconsistencies with fta labor provisions . according to agency officials , resource limitations have prevented more proactive monitoring of all fta labor provisions . as a result , ustr and dol systematically monitor and enforce compliance with fta labor provisions for only a few priority countries . ustr 's annual report to congress about trade agreement programs provides limited details of the results of the agencies ' monitoring and enforcement of compliance with fta labor provisions . dol should reevaluate its submission review time frame and better inform stakeholders about the submission process . ustr and dol should establish a coordinated strategic approach to monitoring and enforcement labor provisions . ustr 's annual report to congress should include more information of ustr 's and dol 's monitoring and enforcement efforts . the agencies generally agreed with the recommendations but disagreed with some findings , including the finding that they lack a systematic approach to monitor and enforce labor provisions in all ftas . gao stands by its findings .
