in fiscal year 2019 , cbp reported apprehending more than 527,000 noncitizen family unit members at or between u.s. ports of entry along the southwest border — a 227 percent increase over fiscal year 2018. in april 2018 , the u.s. attorney general issued a memo on criminal prosecutions of immigration offenses , which dhs officials said led to an increase in family separations . gao was asked to review issues related to dhs 's processing of family units . this report examines cbp data on apprehended family unit members ; the extent to which cbp and ice developed and implemented policies and procedures for processing family units ; and how dhs and hhs share information about uac . gao analyzed record - level dhs and hhs data and documents ; interviewed dhs and hhs officials ; and visited dhs locations in california and texas where cbp apprehensions of family units increased in 2017. data from the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) indicate that apprehensions of family unit members ( noncitizen children under 18 and their parents or legal guardians ) grew from about 22 percent of total southwest border apprehensions in fiscal year 2016 to about 51 percent of such apprehensions during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2019 — the most current data available . during this period , cbp data indicated that most apprehensions of family units — about 76 percent — occurred between ports of entry by the u.s. border patrol ( border patrol ) . with regard to family separations , from april 2018 through march 2019 , cbp data indicate it separated at least 2,700 children from their parents , processing them as unaccompanied alien children ( uac ) and transferring them to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . cbp developed some policies and procedures for processing family units but does not have sufficient controls to ensure effective implementation . for example , cbp policy requires that border patrol agents and officers track apprehended family unit members and , if applicable , subsequent family separations in agency data systems . gao 's analysis of border patrol documents and data indicates that its agents have not accurately and consistently recorded family units and separations . specifically , gao examined a nongeneralizable sample of 40 hhs records for children involved in family separations between june 2018 and march 2019 and matched them to border patrol apprehensions data for these children . gao found border patrol did not initially record 14 of the 40 children as a member of a family unit ( linked to a parent 's record ) per border patrol policy , and thus did not record their subsequent family separation . gao found an additional 10 children among the 40 whose family separations were not documented in border patrol 's data system as required by cbp policy during this period . border patrol officials were unsure of the extent of these problems , and stated that , among other things , data - entry errors may have arisen due to demands on agents as the number of family unit apprehensions increased . thus , it is unclear the extent to which border patrol has accurate records of separated family unit members in its data system . further , border patrol agents inconsistently recorded information about the reasons for and circumstances surrounding family separations on required forms . developing and implementing additional controls would help border patrol maintain complete and accurate information on all family separations . dhs 's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) is , among other things , responsible for detaining and removing those family units apprehended by cbp . ice officers are to determine whether to accept or deny a referral of a family unit from cbp for detention in one of ice 's family residential centers , release family unit members into the interior of the united states , or remove family unit members ( who are subject to final orders of removal ) from the united states . ice has procedures for processing and releasing family units from ice custody . however , with regard to family unit separations , ice relies on a manual process to track separations that occur in ice custody ( generally at one of ice 's family residential centers ) and does not systematically record this information in its data system . without a mechanism to do so , ice does not have reasonable assurance that parents whom ice separated from their children and are subject to removal are able to make arrangements for their children , including being removed with them , as provided in ice 's policy for detained parents . in 2018 , dhs and hhs developed written interagency agreements regarding uac . however , dhs and hhs officials stated they have not resolved long - standing differences in opinion about how and what information agencies are to share related to the care and placement of those children , including those referred to hhs after a family separation . gao found that dhs has not consistently provided information and documents to hhs as specified in interagency agreements . hhs officials also identified additional information they need from dhs , about those adults apprehended with children and later separated , to inform their decisions about placing children with sponsors and reunifying separated families , when necessary . increased collaboration between dhs and hhs about information sharing would better position hhs to make informed and timely decisions for uac . gao is making eight recommendations to dhs and one to hhs . among them , cbp should develop and implement additional controls to ensure that border patrol agents accurately record family unit separations in data systems . gao also recommends that ice systematically track in its data system the family units ice separates . further , dhs and hhs should collaborate about information sharing for uac . dhs and hhs concurred with the recommendations .
