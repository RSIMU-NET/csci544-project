the united states and almost 200 other countries are negotiating under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) to address climate change cooperatively beyond the year 2012. parties agreed to complete the negotiations by the 15th meeting of the conference of the parties ( cop - 15 ) from december 7-18 , 2009 , in copenhagen . however , some nations ' leaders have indicated that the copenhagen outcome is likely to be a political agreement providing a mandate for a later legally binding , comprehensive agreement . the negotiations are intended to decide the next steps toward meeting the objective of the unfccc , to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . most parties conclude the objective requires avoiding a 2ocelsius increase of global mean temperature from pre - industrial values and reducing global greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions by 50 % by 2050 from 1990 levels , with industrialized countries ' share to be an 80-95 % reduction . the unfccc principle of common but differentiated responsibilities among parties permeates debate about obligations of different forms , levels of effort , and verifiability . key disagreements remain among parties : ghg mitigation : some countries , including the united states , seek ghg actions by all parties ; many developing countries argue that differentiation should exclude them from quantified and verifiable ghg limitations . many vulnerable countries are alarmed that ghg targets proposed by wealthy countries are inadequate to avoid 2oc of temperature increase and associated serious risks . adaptation to climate change : many countries , including the united states , wish to use bilateral and existing international institutions , with incremental financial assistance , targeted at the most vulnerable populations ; many developing countries seek a fully financed , systemic , and country - determined effort to avoid damages of climate change , to which they have contributed little . financial assistance to developing countries : many wealthy countries , including the united states , propose private sector mechanisms , such as ghg trading , along with investment - friendly economies , as the main sources of financing , with a minor share from public funds ; many developing countries argue for predictable flows of unconditioned public monies , with direct access to an international fund under the authority of the conference of the parties . technology : many countries , including the united states , maintain that private sector mechanisms are most effective at developing and deploying the needed advanced technologies , enabled by balanced trade and intellectual property protection ; some countries seek new institutional arrangements and creative mechanisms to share technologies to facilitate more effective technology transfer . negotiators face a complex array of proposals . many delegations , including the united states , approach copenhagen with unresolved climate agendas at home . president obama has announced an intention to offer a `` provisional '' ghg target for the united states in the range of 17 % below 2005 levels by 2020 , ultimately to be brought `` in line '' with energy and climate legislation . the u.s. delegation negotiates without clear signals as to what the congress would support . u.s. influence in the negotiations may also be impaired by having signed but not ratified the kyoto protocol , and by being almost $ 170 million in arrears in contributions to the multilateral global environment facility .
