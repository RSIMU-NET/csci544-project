the share of employers offering health coverage has generally declined in the last decade . researchers believe that certain provisions of ppaca could affect employers future willingness to offer health coverage , such as the availability of subsidized coverage through new health insurance marketplaces called exchanges and an individual mandate ,  which will require most people to obtain health coverage or pay a tax penalty . certain ppaca provisions are scheduled to take effect in 2014. researchers have provided various estimates of the effect ppaca may have on employer - sponsored coverage . gao was asked to review the research on this topic . gao examined estimates of the effect of ppaca on the extent of employer - sponsored coverage ; factors that may contribute to the variation in estimates ; and how estimates of coverage vary by the types of employers and employees that may be affected , as well as other changes employers may be considering to the health benefits they offer . gao reviewed studies published from january 1 , 2009 , through march 30 , 2012 containing an original numerical estimate of the prevalence of employer - sponsored coverage at the national level . these included 5 microsimulation models and 19 employer surveys . microsimulation models can systematically estimate the combined effects of multiple ppaca provisions in terms of both gains and losses of coverage ; their results are based on multiple data sets and assumptions . surveys reflect employer perspectives ; they have limits as a predictive tool in part based on varied survey methodologies and respondent knowledge of ppaca . the five studies gao reviewed that used microsimulation models to estimate the effects of the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) on employer - sponsored coverage generally predicted little change in prevalence in the near term , while results of employer surveys varied more widely . the five microsimulation study estimates ranged from a net decrease of 2.5 percent to a net increase of 2.7 percent in the total number of individuals with employer - sponsored coverage within the first 2 years of implementation of key ppaca provisions , affecting up to about 4 million individuals . two of these studies also indicated that the majority of individuals losing employer - sponsored coverage would transition to other sources of coverage . in contrast to the microsimulation studies , which estimate the net effect on individuals , most employer surveys measure the percentage of employers that may drop coverage in response to ppaca . among the 19 surveys , 16 reported estimates of employers dropping coverage for all employee types . among these 16 , 11 indicated that 10 percent or fewer employers were likely to drop coverage in the near term , but estimates ranged from 2 to 20 percent . most surveys were of employers currently offering coverage and therefore did not also address whether other employers may begin to offer coverage in response to ppaca ; however , 3 that did found that between 1 and 28 percent would begin offering coverage as a result of ppaca . longer - term predictions of prevalence of employer - sponsored coverage were fewer and more uncertain , and four microsimulation studies estimated that from about 2 million to 6 million fewer individuals would have employer - sponsored coverage in the absence of the individual mandate compared to with the mandate . differences in key assumptions and consideration of ppaca provisions likely contributed to some variation among estimates from the five microsimulation studies and the 16 employer surveys . variation among the microsimulation studies may have stemmed from differences in assumptions about employer and employee decision making , the time frames of the estimates , and assessments of potential compliance with the individual mandate . variation among the employer surveys may be related to differences in survey sampling techniques , the number and types of employer respondents , and the framing of survey questions . for example , some surveys used a random sampling methodology , allowing their results to be generalized across all employers , while others did not . also , some referred to specific ppaca provisions or provided specific information about provisions to respondents , while others did not . some of the 19 employer surveys indicated that ppaca may have a larger effect on small employers and certain populations and may prompt some employers to change benefit designs . for example , 4 surveys found that smaller employers were more likely than other employers to stop offering health coverage in response to ppaca , and 5 found that employers in general were more likely to drop coverage for retirees than for all employees . nine surveys also indicated that employers are considering key changes to benefit design , some of which may result in greater employee cost for health coverage . gao provided a draft of this report to two researchers with expertise in employee health benefits issues . the experts agreed with gaos report and provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate .
