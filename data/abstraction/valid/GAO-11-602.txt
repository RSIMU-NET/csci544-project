since 2000 , the annual number of new international parental child abduction cases reported to the department of state -- many of which likely involved air travel -- has nearly tripled . such abductions occur when a parent , family member , or person acting on behalf thereof , takes a child to another country in violation of the custodial parent 's or guardian 's rights . once a child is abducted , the laws , policies , and procedures of the foreign country determine the child 's return . thus , preventing such abductions can help keep parents and children from being separated for a long period or indefinitely . as requested , this report addresses the policies and measures airlines , federal agencies , and others have to prevent international parental child abductions on airline flights and options federal agencies , airlines , and others could consider for helping prevent such abductions on airline flights , as well as the advantages and limitations of those options . to perform this work , gao reviewed applicable laws and policies , interviewed government officials , and surveyed airlines and nonprofit associations . as private sector entities , airlines do not have the authority to verify or enforce court and custody orders in an effort to prevent international parental child abductions and thus , upon request , work in cooperation with law enforcement . the department of state has measures such as a dual - signature passport requirement and a passport notification program that are focused on preventing abductions before abductors reach an airport . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has measures that are focused on prevention when abductors reach the airport , such as a prevent departure list which prevents non - u.s. citizens from departing on an international flight with a child of concern , if certain criteria are met . dhs also checks the national crime information center missing persons file and has partnered with other agencies to distribute amber alerts at airports if child abductions meet certain criteria . two options -- a parental - consent letter requirement and a high - risk abductor list -- were cited by stakeholders ( federal agency , airline , and nongovernmental organization officials ) as having potential to prevent abductions , but consent letters may be impractical to adopt while a high - risk list may help prevent some abductions . a consent letter policy could require that children traveling alone , or without both parents , have a note of consent from the nonaccompanying parents authorizing the child to travel . stakeholders gao met with and surveyed noted that such consent letters may be effective in deterring some abductions , but the relative ease in forging a letter along with other significant issues indicate that such a requirement is not a practical option . a high - risk abductor list program could operate similarly to the prevent departure list program but would apply to u.s. citizens . while stakeholders pointed out certain limitations to such a high - risk abductor list -- such as the relatively difficult and time - consuming steps needed to place a child and potential abductor on this list -- such a list may be helpful in preventing abductions on airline flights . gao recommends that dhs consider creating a program similar to the child abduction component of its prevent departure program that would apply to u.s. citizens . dhs concurred with the recommendation , but cited challenges toward implementing it , such as potential constitutional , operational , privacy , and resource issues .
