the federal excise tax on alcoholic beverages is imposed at the manufacturer and importer level , based on the per unit production or importation of alcoholic beverages ( e.g . , distilled spirits , wine , and beer ) for sale in the u.s. market . when converted to standard drink measures liquor drinks are generally subjected to a federal excise tax of approximately 13 cents per 1.5 ounce shot , wine is taxed at 4 cents per 5 ounce glass , and beer is taxed at 5 cents per 12 ounce can or bottle . alcohol excise tax collections totaled $ 10.4 billion in fy2015 , with collections from distilled spirits comprising 55.1 % of that amount . congressional interest in alcohol excise taxes is broad , given a variety of policy motivations and the industry 's wide geographic distribution . since their inception in 1791 , federal excise taxes on alcohol have been imposed or increased throughout history primarily to fund emergency spending during wartime or in response to concerns over the growth of budget deficits . today , three main approaches drive interest in alcohol taxes : ( 1 ) tax rates could be decreased to benefit firms in the industry , ( 2 ) excise tax rates could be increased for deficit reduction , or ( 3 ) excise tax rates could be increased to discourage the negative spillover effects of alcohol consumption ( e.g . , drunk driving fatalities , property damage , domestic violence ) . this report provides a brief historical overview of alcohol excise tax policy and a description of current law . next , the report analyzes alcohol excise tax rates based on some of the standard criteria for tax evaluation : revenue , economic efficiency , and equity . lastly , this report discusses bills introduced in the 114th congress that would reduce current excise tax rates as well as possible approaches to raising alcohol excise tax rates . despite three tax rate increases since 1951 ( with the last increase in 1991 ) , alcohol excise taxes have declined in inflation - adjusted value over time . excise tax reductions would reduce excise tax collections , reduce some of the regressivity in the federal tax code , and provide owners of the affected alcohol producers with a temporary increase in their profits ( due to lower tax rates ) . economists typically justify imposing excise taxes on alcohol consumption to better reflect the costs of an individual 's consumption of alcohol to society . while there is much debate surrounding the technical measurement of these linkages , most researchers argue that alcohol excise tax rates are set below the economically efficient level to compensate for social costs . one estimate finds the combined federal , state , and local taxes between 25 cents and 29 cents ( in 2013 dollars ) per ounce of pure alcohol compared with the external cost of $ 1.02 per ounce . analysis suggests that excise tax increases are usually passed forward to consumers through higher prices and are not borne by the owners of alcoholic beverage manufacturers or importers . excise taxes are generally regressive , alcohol included . lower income households tend to spend a higher share of their pre - tax income on alcoholic beverages , but this distribution is not as uneven as spending on non - alcoholic beverages or food . consumers also pay different amounts of federal excise tax on the same amount of alcohol content , based on the type of alcoholic beverages they purchase . at current rates , the federal tax per ounce of pure alcoholic content for spirits , wine , and beer is 21 cents , 10 cents , and 8 cents , respectively .
