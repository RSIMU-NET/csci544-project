pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the events surrounding a fire at a food storage warehouse in kansas , focusing on the : disposition of food salvaged from the facility ; and lessons learned from the incident that could be used to improve regulation of the food salvaging industry . gao found that : over half of the affected food was destroyed and the remaining 102 million pounds of food was released to the public after kansas determined its salvageability ; about 3.7 million pounds of food was shipped to a salvager on the basis of laboratory results furnished by a consultant who was under investigation by the food and drug administration ( fda ) ; although no illnesses were attributed to the food salvaged from the kansas fire , potential public health risks were increased by shortcomings in fda regulation of salvaged food ; fda did not share important information with kansas regarding its past problems with the consultant and his laboratories ; and fda did not provide kansas with guidance on food sampling controls that would have been useful in its oversight of the salvaging .
