abusive tax schemes contribute to the tax gap and threaten the tax system 's integrity . when abusive tax schemes involve tax - exempt entities , they also can erode the public 's confidence in the charitable sector . gao was asked to review what is known about abusive transactions involving tax - exempt entities and how irs addresses them . this report , among other things , describes ways in which taxpayers have abused an entity 's tax - exempt status ; examines trends in irs 's compliance efforts ; and assesses how irs identifies emerging abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities . gao reviewed research on tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities , and interviewed relevant professionals and researchers about tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities ; compiled statistics from irs audit and disclosure data ; and compared documentation and testimony from irs officials on irs programs and guidance from its operating divisions with certain internal control and gao fraud framework criteria . taxpayers have used a variety of abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities . in some schemes , the tax - exempt entity is complicit in the scheme , while in others it is not . for example , an abusive tax scheme could involve multiple donors grossly overvaluing charitable contributions , where the tax - exempt entity is not part of the scheme . conversely , some patient assistance programs — which can help patients obtain medical care or medications — have been used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to make charitable donations that can be viewed as furthering private interests . internal revenue service ( irs ) audits of abusive tax schemes are trending downward , as the figure below shows audits by irs 's large business and international division . this trend has occurred amid generally declining irs resources and corresponds with an overall decrease in audit activity by irs over recent years . irs has a variety of programs working collectively to identify abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities , but some internal control weaknesses exist in its approach . for example , gao found three ways that irs data or programs were inconsistent with internal control standards for using quality information . first , database project codes used for identifying data on abusive tax schemes are not linked across irs 's audit divisions and do not consistently identify whether a tax - exempt entity was involved . second , irs has not leveraged a database with cross - divisional information to facilitate its analysis and monitoring of audit data across divisions . finally , irs has not used existing analytic tools to mine the narrative fields of tax forms . doing so could provide audit leads on abusive schemes involving tax - exempt entities . these deficiencies inhibit irs 's ability to identify abusive tax schemes and develop responses to those schemes . gao is making five recommendations to irs to strengthen its internal controls , including that it link data across operating divisions , test the ability of a database to facilitate analysis of audit data , and use existing analytic tools to further mine information on tax forms . in commenting on a draft of this report , irs agreed with all of gao 's recommendations .
