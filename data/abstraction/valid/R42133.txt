within the past two decades , prominent foreign policy organizations and foreign policy experts have perceived serious deficiencies in the authorities , organizations , and personnel used to conduct interagency missions that prevent the united states from exercising its power to full advantage . for the 112th congress , proposals to address these problems may be of interest for their perceived potential not only to enhance performance , but also to save money by streamlining processes , encouraging interagency cooperation , and reducing duplication . these proposals also provide context for current and recent legislation , including the interagency personnel rotation act of 2011 ( s. 1268 and h.r . 2314 ) and the contingency operations oversight and interagency enhancement act of 2011 ( h.r . 3660 ) , as well as the new global security contingency fund contained in the fy2012 national defense authorization act ( ndaa , section 1207 , h.r . 1540 , p.l . 112-81 , signed into law december 31 , 2011 ) . the fy2012 ndaa requires the president to submit to congress a `` whole - of - government '' implementation plan . despite a growing perception during the 1990s that reforms were needed to foster interagency cooperation in missions abroad , it was not until the terrorist attacks on the united states of september 11 , 2001 , during the presidency of george w. bush , and subsequent u.s. military interventions that the need became urgent enough to result in significant changes . the earlier first steps of the clinton administration toward interagency reform were in short order embraced and then expanded by the bush administration , which also implemented reforms of its own . the barack h. obama administration has endorsed these changes and undertaken some of its own . three problems with the current interagency cooperation system are most commonly cited . these are ( 1 ) a government - wide lack of strategic planning and interagency operational planning capabilities among civilian agencies ; ( 2 ) a variety of structural deficiencies in the u.s. government for conducting missions abroad that lead to a tendency for `` stove - piping '' responses , with each agency operating independently , and to civilian agencies ' reluctance to divert scarce resources , including personnel , from their core missions to interagency missions ; and ( 3 ) personnel who are not trained for interagency missions and often unfamiliar with the missions , capabilities , and cultures of other agencies . this report draws on over three dozen studies with recommendations to improve the current national security system . the studies surveyed include three prepared by the project on national security reform , with comprehensive recommendations , four prepared or co - sponsored by the center for strategic and international studies ( csis ) , and two by rand in conjunction with the american academy of diplomats , as well as reports by the council on foreign relations , the defense science board , the national defense university , and others . this report draws from these studies , as well as a few articles , for recommendations to improve strategy - making , planning , and budgeting ; to improve institutional authorities , structures , and arrangements ; and to create interagency personnel policies and mechanisms . as the breadth and variety of the recommendations indicate , there is no consensus on how to fix the perceived problems . nor is there agreement among policymakers on a number of overarching questions : whether interagency reform is necessary for missions abroad , which proposals are considered highest priority , whether reforms would save money , and whether reform of congressional organization or procedures must accompany other national security reform measures .
