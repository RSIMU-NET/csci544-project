the merit systems protection board ( mspb or board ) is a quasi - judicial independent agency in the executive branch charged with protecting federal employees against improper employment - related actions . the board works to ensure , for example , that federal agencies avoid taking arbitrary action against employees , exhibiting favoritism , or engaging in reprisals against whistleblowers . the mspb also aims to promote an effective federal workforce free of certain types of discrimination and other prohibited personnel practices . while the board mainly carries out its mission through adjudication of federal employment - related disputes , it also performs specified oversight functions related to federal employment , including conducting special studies of the civil service and other executive branch merit systems . established by the civil service reform act of 1978 , the mspb consists of three board members , appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate . not more than two board members may be adherents of the same political party . the term of office of each board member is seven years , and terms are nonrenewable . board members may be removed by the president only for inefficiency , neglect of duty , or malfeasance in office . the board operates concurrently with the office of special counsel , an independent , prosecutorial federal agency . the special counsel receives and investigates complaints related to certain kinds of federal agency misconduct and may petition the board for corrective action . the mspb operates like a tribunal and maintains procedures for conducting hearings , examining evidence , and rendering decisions . most cases the board reviews are federal employee appeals of adverse actions , including those related to removal or suspension of employment . when the mspb determines that a federal employee has been subject to an improper adverse action , the board can issue orders that compel agencies to reverse these actions and , depending upon the particular agency action in question , may order relief , including reinstatement , backpay , and attorney 's fees . the board also maintains original jurisdiction over certain types of cases in which it hears and decides the case initially rather than reviews an agency decision . for example , the mspb may adjudicate cases brought by the office of special counsel related to a prohibited personnel practice . the special counsel may , among other things , petition the board for a stay of an adverse employment action in relation to this practice . some of the board 's adjudicatory functions , including appeals of adverse action decisions , typically are carried out by `` administrative judges '' employed by the board , while administrative law judges ( aljs ) may examine matters coming under the board 's original jurisdiction . federal employees or applicants for employment who are adversely affected by a final order or decision of the mspb may obtain judicial review . the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit ( federal circuit ) is generally the proper judicial forum for these cases . federal law compels the federal circuit to examine these cases under a standard of review that is deferential to the mspb 's determination . consequently , the federal circuit typically upholds board decisions . but a special jurisdictional rule exists for so - called `` mixed cases '' involving an alleged violation of federal antidiscrimination laws in connection with an improper adverse personnel action . following the mspb 's decision in a mixed case , affected employees may seek judicial review in federal district court rather than the federal circuit . district court review is generally preferable for the petitioning federal employee , as district courts typically review these discrimination - related claims under a de novo standard ( i.e . , affording no deference to the determination of the mspb ) . since march 2019 , the board has lacked sitting members . lack of a quorum prevents the board from performing some of its review functions , including issuing final decisions in cases when an initial decision issued by an administrative judge has been appealed to the full board . as a result , a significant case backlog has developed . president trump has submitted nominees to the senate to fill vacancies on the board .
