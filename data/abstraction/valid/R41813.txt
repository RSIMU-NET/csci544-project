in march 2011 , at & t announced an agreement to acquire t - mobile usa ( t - mobile ) from deutsche telekom for $ 25 billion in cash and $ 14 billion in at & t stock , subject to the approval of the department of justice ( doj ) and the federal communications commission ( fcc ) . post - merger , deutsche telekom ( dt ) would own approximately 8 % of at & t 's stock . at & t is the second - largest mobile wireless service provider in the united states ; t - mobile is the fourth - largest . the combined company would be the largest mobile wireless service provider . under the terms of the agreement , if the merger is not consummated at & t would have to pay deutsche telekom and t - mobile a breakup fee of $ 3 billion in cash plus access to roaming and spectrum valued at an additional $ 3 billion . on august 31 , 2011 , doj filed a complaint with the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking to permanently enjoin ( block ) the merger . on november 22 , 2011 , the fcc chairman announced that he would seek to designate the proposed merger for an administrative hearing to determine whether it would be in the public interest . on november 23 , 2011 , at & t and dt filed a letter withdrawing their applications for a transfer of licenses , and on november 29 , 2011 , the fcc granted the request to withdraw `` without prejudice , '' allowing the parties to re - file applications at a later date . the fcc concurrently released a staff report that concluded that the merger would result in significant harm to competition and that at & t and t - mobile had failed to demonstrate countervailing efficiencies and benefits that would result in the merger , on net , being in the public interest . at & t and deutsche telekom have announced that they still plan to pursue the merger , that they `` vigorously contest '' the doj complaint , and that they plan to resubmit applications for the transfer of licenses from deutsche telekom to at & t at a later date , most likely when the doj lawsuit has been resolved . the lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial in february 2012. but on december 12 , 2011 , in response to a request from at & t and dt that was agreed to by doj , the judge overseeing the lawsuit stayed the lawsuit , thereby delaying the proceedings and giving at & t and t - mobile time to sort out their options . on december 19 , 2011 , at & t agreed with dt to end its bid to acquire t - mobile . at & t and t - mobile state that combining their spectrum holdings and networks represents the most efficient way to alleviate each company 's largest strategic challenge — at & t 's `` network spectrum and capacity constraints '' and t - mobile 's lack of a `` clear path '' to deployment of 4g long term evolution ( lte ) network technology , `` the gold standard for advanced mobile broadband services . . they assert that the merger would turn two companies that currently are capacity - constrained into `` an efficient capacity - enhancing combination '' that would have the incentive to increase output , improve quality , and lower prices . at & t claims the merger `` will enable it to deploy lte to more than 97 % of americans — approximately 55 million more americans than under at & t 's current plans '' to build out its lte network to just 80 % of americans . doj claims the merger likely would lessen competition for consumer mobile wireless telecommunications services — from the perspective of consumers , in 97 local markets , and from the perspective of suppliers , in the national market — and also would lessen competition in the national market for enterprise and government wireless telecommunications services . it claims actual and potential competition between at & t and t - mobile would be eliminated ; competition in general likely would be lessened ; prices likely would be higher than otherwise ; the quality and quantity of services likely would be lower than otherwise due to reduced incentives to invest in capacity and technology improvements ; and innovation and product variation likely would be reduced . doj asserts that the merging parties can not demonstrate merger - specific , cognizable efficiencies sufficient to reverse the acquisition 's anticompetitive effects .
