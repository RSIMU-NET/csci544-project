for security and other reasons , the president , vice president , and first lady use military aircraft when they travel . the white house generally categorizes the trips as fulfilling either official or political functions . often , a trip involves both official and political , or unofficial , activities . when a trip is for an official function , the government pays all costs , including per diem ( food and lodging ) , car rentals , and other incidental expenses . when a trip is for political or unofficial purposes , those involved must pay for their own food and lodging and other related expenses , and they must also reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have paid had they used a commercial airline . when a trip involves both official and political activities , a formula determines the amount to be reimbursed for that part of the trip involving political activities . whether a trip is for official or political purposes , the air force pays all operational and other costs incurred by the use of the aircraft . while the travel policies of specific administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly available , it appears that policy guidelines developed by the reagan white house have served as a basis for the travel policies of subsequent administrations . this report will be updated as new information becomes available .
