the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) provides benefits to low - income , eligible households on an electronic benefit transfer ( ebt ) card ; benefits can then be exchanged for foods at authorized retailers . snap reaches a large share of low - income households . in fy2018 , a monthly average of 40.3 million persons in 20.1 million households participated in snap . federal snap law provides two basic pathways for financial eligibility to the program : ( 1 ) meeting program - specific federal eligibility requirements ; or ( 2 ) being automatically or `` categorically '' eligible for snap based on being eligible for or receiving benefits from other specified low - income assistance programs . categorical eligibility eliminated the requirement that households who already met financial eligibility rules in one specified low - income program go through another financial eligibility determination in snap . in its traditional form , categorical eligibility conveys snap eligibility based on household receipt of cash assistance from supplemental security income ( ssi ) , the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , or state - run general assistance ( ga ) programs . however , since the 1996 welfare reform law , states have been able to expand categorical eligibility beyond its traditional bounds . that law created tanf to replace the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program , which was a traditional cash assistance program . tanf is a broad - purpose block grant that finances a wide range of social and human services . tanf gives states flexibility in meeting its goals , resulting in a wide variation of benefits and services offered among the states . snap allows states to convey categorical eligibility based on receipt of a tanf `` benefit , '' not just tanf cash welfare . this provides states with the ability to convey categorical eligibility based on a wide range of benefits and services . tanf benefits other than cash assistance typically are available to a broader range of households and at higher levels of income than are tanf cash assistance benefits . as of october 2018 , 43 jurisdictions have implemented what the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) has called `` broad - based '' categorical eligibility . these jurisdictions generally make all households with incomes below a state - determined income threshold eligible for snap . states do this by providing households with a low - cost tanf - funded benefit or service such as a brochure or referral to a telephone hotline . there are varying income eligibility thresholds within states that convey `` broad - based '' categorical eligibility , though no state has a gross income limit above 200 % of the federal poverty guidelines . in all but six of these jurisdictions , there is no asset test required for snap eligibility . categorically eligible families bypass the regular snap asset limits . however , their net incomes ( income after deductions for expenses ) must still be low enough to qualify for a snap benefit . that is , it is possible to be categorically eligible for snap but have net income too high to actually receive a benefit . the exception to this is one - or two - person households that would still receive the minimum benefit . neither the agriculture act of 2014 ( `` 2014 farm bill , '' p.l . 113-79 ) nor the agriculture improvement act of 2018 ( `` 2018 farm bill , '' p.l . 115-334 ) made changes to snap categorical eligibility rules . in the 113th congress , the house - passed version of the 2014 law would have eliminated broad - based categorical eligibility , but that change was not included in the conference agreement . in the 115th congress , the house - passed version of the 2018 law would have made changes to limit but not eliminate broad - based categorical eligibility ; these changes were not included in the conference agreement . in the fall 2018 unified agenda , the trump administration included plans to publish a proposed rule that would amend snap categorical eligibility rules . as of the date this report , this proposed rule has not yet been published .
