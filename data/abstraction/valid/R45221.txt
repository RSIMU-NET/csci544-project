u.s. capital markets are the largest and considered to be the most efficient in the world . companies rely heavily on capital access to fund growth and create jobs . as the principal regulator of u.s. capital markets , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) requires that offers and sales of securities either be registered with the sec or be undertaken with an exemption from registration . registered securities offerings , often called public offerings , are available to all types of investors and have more rigorous disclosure requirements . by contrast , securities offerings that are exempt from sec registration are referred to as private offerings and are mainly available to more sophisticated investors . some policymakers have concluded that changes in market trends require updated regulations governing capital access . specifically , the number of publicly listed u.s. companies has declined by half over the last two decades , and small - to medium - sized companies are said to have more difficulty accessing capital relative to larger companies . additionally , new capital access tools not previously part of the sec regulatory regime , such as crowdfunding and initial coin offerings , have emerged . these new tools are especially helpful for small businesses and startups . the bipartisan jumpstart our business startups act of 2012 ( jobs act ; p.l . 112-106 ) scaled regulation for smaller companies and reduced regulations in general for certain types of capital formation . it established a number of new options to expand capital access through both public and private offerings , including a new provision for crowdfunding . parts of the fixing america 's surface transportation act ( jobs act 2.0 ; p.l . 114-94 ) provided additional relief . following the jobs act , the public and private offering dichotomy has started to blur , and securities regulation has become increasingly tailored to suit companies of different sizes and with different needs . however , concerns over capital formation have persisted , given that the number of ipos remained at far below long - term average levels post - jobs act and smaller businesses continue to face capital access pressure . to address these concerns , congress has considered numerous legislative proposals to further expand the scaled approach , with some proposals building on existing jobs act provisions . the most notable of these proposals is s. 488 , a capital formation package referred to as jobs act 3.0. originally a relatively narrow bill , s. 488 was passed by the senate and then was amended significantly and passed by the house in a 406-4 vote on july 17 , 2018. the package includes 32 titles , many of which have previously passed the house with bipartisan support as standalone bills . the policy debate surrounding capital formation proposals often focuses on expanding capital access and protecting investors , two of the sec 's core missions . expanding capital access promotes capital formation and allows for greater access of investment opportunities for more investors . investor protection is considered to be important for healthy and efficient capital markets because many investors would be more willing to provide capital , and even at a lower cost , if they could expect enforceable contracts for their investments through a transparent process . at times , expanding capital access can come at the expense of investor protection . for example , proposals that reduce the registration and disclosures that a company must make can decrease the company 's compliance costs and increase the speed and efficiency of capital formation . but the reduced disclosures may expose a company 's investors to additional risks if they are not receiving information that is important to making informed investment decisions . this report analyzes legislative proposals that would generally affect the terms and amounts of capital provided to companies by investors . it analyzes a number of current legislative proposals and agency actions to expand both public and private securities offerings through amendments to program design , investor access , and disclosure requirements , among other provisions .
