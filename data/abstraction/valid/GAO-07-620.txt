special operations command 's ( socom ) duties have greatly increased since the attacks of september 11 , 2001. today , special operations forces are at work in afghanistan and iraq , and socom has been assigned to lead u.s. efforts in the global war on terrorism . socom 's acquisitions budget has also greatly increased in this period -- more than doubling from $ 788 million in 2001 to approximately $ 1.91 billion in 2006. in light of socom 's expanded duties , congress requested that gao review socom 's management of its acquisition programs . gao 's evaluation includes an assessment of : the types of acquisition programs socom has undertaken since 2001 and whether the programs are consistent with its mission ; the extent to which socom 's programs have progressed as planned ; and the challenges socom faces in managing its acquisition programs . socom has undertaken a diverse set of acquisition programs that are consistent with the command 's mission to provide equipment that addresses the unique needs of the special operations forces . socom has committed to spend about $ 6 billion on these programs . about 88 percent of the programs are relatively small , have short acquisition cycles , and use modified commercial off - the - shelf and nondevelopmental items or modify existing service equipment and assets . socom 's acquisition plans -- as reflected in its current 5-year plan -- continue to focus on relatively small - scale , short - cycle programs with modest development efforts . overall , socom 's acquisition program performance has been mixed . about 60 percent of the acquisition programs socom has undertaken since 2001 have progressed as planned , staying within the original cost and schedule estimates . included in this grouping are programs that had cost increases because of the need to buy additional quantities of equipment for ongoing combat operations . the other 40 percent of socom 's acquisition programs have not progressed as planned and experienced modest to , in a small number of cases , significant cost increases and schedule delays because of a range of technical and programmatic issues . although fewer in number , the programs that experienced problems comprise about 50 percent of acquisition funding because they tend to be the larger and costlier , platform - based programs that socom is acquiring and those where socom depends on one of the military departments for equipment and program management support . socom faces management and workforce challenges to ensure its acquisition programs are consistently completed on time and within budget . urgent requirements to support socom 's ongoing combat missions have and will continue to challenge socom 's ability to balance near - and long - term needs against available funding resources . in addition , socom has difficulty tracking progress on programs where it has delegated management authority to one of the military departments and has not consistently applied a knowledge - based acquisition approach in executing programs , particularly the larger and more complex programs . furthermore , socom has encountered challenges ensuring it has the workforce size and composition to carry out its acquisition work .
