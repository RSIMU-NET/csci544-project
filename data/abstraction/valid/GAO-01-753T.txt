federal agencies spend billions of tax dollars each year to buy services -- from clerical support to information technology assistance to the management of national laboratories . the federal government spent more than $ 87 billion in services -- a 24 percent increase in real terms from fiscal year 1990. some service procurements are not being done efficiently , putting taxpayer dollars at risk . in particular , agencies are not clearly defining their requirements , fully considering alternative solutions , performing vigorous price analyses , and adequately overseeing contractor performance . this testimony describes service contracting trends and the changing acquisition environment , discusses the challenges confronting the government in acquiring services , and highlights some efforts underway to address these challenges . gao found that purchases of services now account for about 43 percent of federal contracting expenses -- the largest single spending category . the growth of services has been driven largely by the government 's increased purchases of information technology services and professional , administrative , and management support services . poor contract management has undermined the government 's ability to obtain good value for the money and continues to be a major problem for the two biggest service purchasers - the departments of defense and energy . performance - based service contracts and the integration of strategic human capital management into agency planning are two ways to address some of the contract management and human capital challenges .
