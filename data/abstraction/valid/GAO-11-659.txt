the children 's television act of 1990 ( cta ) and related federal communications commission ( fcc ) rules restrict advertising during children 's programs , whether aired by broadcast stations , cable operators , or satellite providers , and encourage broadcasters to air at least 3 hours per week of educational and informational programming for children ( known as `` core children 's programming '' ) . broadcasters that certify in their license renewal application that they aired the minimum amount of core children 's programming are eligible for expedited review . as requested , this report discusses trends in children 's programming , fcc efforts to enforce the act , and the extent to which parents value and use core children 's programming . gao analyzed fcc data , interviewed fcc and broadcast station officials , and conducted focus groups with parents . broadcasters aired significantly more core children 's programming in 2010 than in 1998 , primarily because there are more broadcast channels and stations than there were then . an important source is multicasting , or the multiple channels aired by broadcasters since the digital television transition . moreover , households increasingly rely on cable and satellite providers -- to which core children 's programming requirements do not apply -- increasing the number of channels specifically targeted to children , but also increasing the impact of cta and fcc 's rules on advertising , which limit the duration of commercials and require their separation from children 's programming on broadcast , cable , and satellite . other media platforms , such as the internet and mp3 players , are outside cta 's reach . fcc 's reliance on broadcasters to self - report violations of cta when they renew their operating licenses has resulted in about 7,000 violations of the advertising or public file rules resulting in fines of almost $ 3 million . the vast majority of violations were for exceeding advertising time limits . fcc has no comparable self - reporting enforcement approach to oversee cable operators ' or satellite providers ' compliance with these same advertising limits . instead , fcc 's oversight efforts have identified only seven violations by cable and satellite providers even though they televise much more children 's programming than broadcasters . fcc has avoided developing specific standards for core children 's programming or judging program content , due to free speech concerns , relying instead on a broad definition and oversight by the public . a lack of widely accepted standards to assess such programming makes it difficult for parents and broadcasters to evaluate the educational content of core children 's programming , potentially leading to wide variation in its quality . in the past , fcc and the media industry have collaborated to resolve concerns about program content in other areas . parent focus groups were largely unaware of cta 's requirements despite fcc 's public education efforts . once informed about the act and core children 's programming , focus group parents believed requirements governing such programming should be more stringent than current rules . core children 's programming is designated as such by broadcast stations , but focus group parents believed independent standards or assessments of programming should be required , and parents in all focus groups perceived broadcast station involvement in the process to be a potential conflict of interest . parents in our focus groups stated that important aspects of children 's programming were that it be educational , age appropriate , and entertaining . focus group parents had differing views on the importance and definition of educational television , but generally agreed that child - dedicated cable networks are more trustworthy for children 's programming than broadcast stations and that a gap exists in appropriate programming for school - age children . gao recommends that fcc implement a strategy to oversee cable operators ' and satellite providers ' compliance , work with industry to develop voluntary guidelines for assessing core children 's programming , and implement and assess the effectiveness of additional mechanisms to inform parents about core children 's programming . fcc generally concurred with gao 's recommendations and discussed planned and ongoing actions to address them .
