since the 1991 persian gulf war , national guard and reserve personnel have been deployed to a number of contingency operations . since september 2001 , about 300,000 reservists have been called to active duty , and the pace of reserve operations is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future . house report 107-436 accompanying the fiscal year 2003 national defense authorization act ( p.l . 107-314 ) directed gao to review compensation programs for reservists serving on active duty . gao evaluated information on income change reported by reservists when activated ; reserve families ' readiness for call - ups and their awareness and use of family support programs , focusing on personal financial management ; and a legislative proposal for the department of defense ( dod ) to offer tricare , the military 's health care program , to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty . dod lacks sufficient information on the magnitude , the causes , and the effects of income change to determine the need for compensation programs targeting reservists who fill critical wartime specialties , experience high degrees of income loss when on extended periods of active duty , and demonstrate that income loss is a significant factor in their retention decisions . such data are critical for assessing the full nature and scope of income change problems and in developing cost - effective solutions . dod self - reported survey data from past and current military operations indicate that activated reservists have experienced widely varying degrees of income change . while many reservists lost income , more than half of reservists had either no change or a gain in income . however , survey data are questionable primarily because it is unclear what survey respondents considered as income loss or gain in determining their financial status . dod has placed greater emphasis on preparing reservists ' families for potential call - ups , yet survey data show that one - third of spouses do not feel prepared , over half of reservists are not aware of family support programs , and more than 90 percent of spouses do not use these programs . personal financial management , one of dod 's core family support programs , illustrates the continuing challenges dod faces in providing outreach to reservists . the 2000 survey data showed that 61 percent of reservists did not know whether personal financial management services were available . the survey also showed that reservists have financial problems similar to their active duty counterparts . dod is taking steps to improve personal financial management , but it has not assessed the financial well - being of reserve families , assessed the impact of reservists ' financial problems on mission readiness , or determined how to tailor its programs to reservists . available dod data do not identify a need to offer tricare to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty . estimates from dod 's 2000 survey showed that nearly 80 percent of reservists had health care coverage when they were not on active duty . this rate is similar to that of comparable groups within the overall u.s. population . dod has expressed concern over the estimated costs of this proposal . cost estimates range up to $ 5.1 billion a year . however , dod has not fully assessed the ramifications of this proposed legislation , including the impact on recruiting and retention , the effects on active duty personnel , the extent reservists and their families might participate in such a program , or the impact on the tricare system . in addition , a high percentage of reservists ' civilian employers who currently pay some or all of health care premiums for reservists during activations could discontinue providing such assistance . a number of recent improvements have been made to reservists and their families ' health care when members are activated . however , dod lacks data on problems reservists and their families have experienced with health care since the mobilizations following september 11 , 2001 ; the causes of these problems ; and their effects on readiness , recruiting , and retention .
