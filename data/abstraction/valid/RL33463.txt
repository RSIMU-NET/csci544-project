the bush administration has made bilateral and regional free - trade agreements ( ftas ) an important element of u.s. trade policy , a strategy known as `` competitive liberalization . . this strategy , it argues , will push forward trade liberalization simultaneously on bilateral , regional , and multilateral fronts . it is meant to spur trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join ftas , and to pressure other countries to negotiate multilaterally . critics contend , however , that the accent on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the multilateral forum and increases the risk of trade diversion away from competitive countries not in the trade bloc . on may 10 , 2007 , congressional leaders and the bush administration announced a conceptual agreement on changes to currently notified free trade agreements ( fta ) . negotiations have been concluded with peru , colombia , panama , and south korea in time to be considered by congress under u.s. trade promotion authority . legislation to implement the peru fta was approved by congress and signed into law by the president on december 14 , 2007 ( p.l . 110-138 ) . legislation to implement the colombia fta was introduced in each chamber under tpa rules on april 8 , 2008 ( h.r . 5724 , s. 2830 ) . on april 10 , the house voted to suspend tpa rules with regard to this agreement ( h.res . 1092 ) . several other trade initiatives are under discussion , including a u.s. - middle east fta and negotiations with countries in the ' p - 4 ' group ( chile , new zealand , singapore , brunei ) . legislation to implement the central american - dominican republic free trade agreement ( cafta - dr ) and ftas with bahrain and oman were approved by the 109th congress . the broadest trade initiative being negotiated is the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations in the world trade organization ( wto ) . in november 2001 , trade ministers from wto member countries agreed to launch a new round of trade talks covering market access , trade remedies , and developing - country issues . nearly seven years of negotiations have occurred since then without a breakthrough on 'modalities , ' the methods and formulas by which negotiations are conducted , with the recent geneva negotiating ministerial conducted between july 21 and 29 likewise failing to reach agreement . in september 2008 , the united states entered into negotiations with the trans - pacific strategic economic partnership ( p - 4 ) countries of brunei , chile , singapore , and new zealand for a common fta . u.s. trade promotion authority ( tpa ) expired on july 1 , 2007. potential agreements resulting from current trade negotiations ( colombia , panama , and south korea ) may be considered by congress under tpa legislation enacted in 2002. under the legislation , if the president meets notification requirements and other conditions , congress will consider a bill to implement a trade agreement under an expedited procedure ( no amendment , deadlines for votes ) . the notification requirements include minimum 90-day notices before starting negotiations and before signing a trade agreement . however , tpa governs internal rules of each chamber and may be altered by each chamber at any time .
