the department of defense 's ( dod ) spending on goods and services has grown significantly since fiscal year 2000 to well over $ 250 billion annually . prudence with taxpayer funds , widening deficits , and growing long - range fiscal challenges demand that dod maximize its return on investment , while providing warfighters with the needed capabilities at the best value for the taxpayer . dod needs to ensure that its funds are spent wisely , and that it is buying the right things , the right way . in this testimony , gao discusses recent trends in dod contracting activity and the environment in which this activity takes place , and practices which undermine its ability to establish sound business arrangements , particularly those involving the selection and oversight of dod 's contractors and incentivizing their performance . this statement is based on work gao has completed over the past 6 years covering a range of dod acquisition and contracting issues . some of these issues are long - standing . gao has identified dod contract management as a high - risk area for more than decade . with awards to contractors large and growing , dod will continue to be vulnerable to contracting fraud , waste or misuse of taxpayer dollars , and abuse . dod obligated nearly $ 270 billion on contracts for goods and services in fiscal year 2005 , an 88 percent increase over the amount obligated in fiscal year 2000. all indications are that this upward trend will continue . aside from growth in dollar value there have also been changes in what dod is buying . dod 's new weapons system programs are expected to be the most expensive and complex ever and will consume an increasingly large share of its budget . in the last 5 years dod has doubled its commitment to major weapon systems from $ 700 billion to $ 1.4 trillion , and dod is counting on these efforts to fundamentally transform military operations . as overall obligations have increased so has its reliance on the private sector to provide services to fulfill dod 's missions and support its operations . additionally , in recent years dod has increased its use of existing contracts awarded by other agencies ( i.e . interagency contracts ) . while this approach provides a number of benefits , our work , and that of some agency inspector generals , revealed instances of improper use , including issuing orders that were outside the scope of the underlying contract as well as failing to establish clear lines of accountability and responsibility . while the amount , nature , and complexity of dod contract activity have increased , its acquisition workforce has remained relatively unchanged in size . at the same time , the acquisition workforce faces certain skills gaps and serious succession planning challenges . there are a number of dod practices which undermine its ability to establish sound business arrangements . for example , with regard to competition and pricing , we recently found that the army acquired guard services under authorized sole - source contracts at 46 of 57 army installations , despite the army 's recognition that it was paying about 25 percent more for its sole - source contracts than for those it previously awarded competitively . another element of a sound business arrangement is the fee mechanism used to incentivize excellent contractor performance . in december 2005 , we reported that dod gives its contractors the opportunity to collectively earn billions of dollars through monetary incentives . unfortunately , we found dod programs routinely engaged in practices that failed to hold contractors accountable for achieving desired outcomes and undermined efforts to motivate results - based contractor performance . as a result , dod paid out an estimated $ 8 billion in award fees on contracts in our study population , regardless of whether acquisition outcomes fell short of , met , or exceeded dod 's expectations . dod also increased its risk of poor acquisition outcomes by not assuring that another element of a sound business arrangement , contractor oversight , was sufficient . for example , in 2005 we reported that dod 's oversight on nearly a third of 90 service contracts reviewed was insufficient , in part because dod failed to assign performance monitors .
