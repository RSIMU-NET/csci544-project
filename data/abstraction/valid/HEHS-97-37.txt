pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the factors affecting medicare risk health maintenance organization ( hmo ) enrollment , focusing on : the patterns in hmo enrollment and medicare payment rates ; selected geographical areas with higher enrollment , lower payment rates and areas with lower enrollment , higher payment rates ; and how the presence or absence of certain factors could affect enrollment . gao noted that : medicare payment rates to hmos are often considered to be the primary influence on medicare hmo enrollment ; however , gao 's analysis suggest that several other factors also play a key , and sometimes , dominant role ; these factors include hmo presence , number of medicare beneficiaries , and employers ' policies toward retiree health benefits , and their relative importance varies across the country ; moreover , in markets such as detroit and portland , the influence of medicare payment rates is not decisive ; enrollment in risk hmos was virtually nonexistent in most counties with lower medicare payment rates , but these lower rates were one of a constellation of factors that make such counties unattractive business propositions for medicare hmos ; gao 's analysis showed that these counties typically had few or no hmos in their health care markets ; lower enrollment counties were primarily rural , only 16 percent fell within a metropolitan statistical area ( msa ) , and had fewer people overall and , in particular , averaged a small number of medicare beneficiaries ; lower enrollment in risk hmos did not occur in every county with lower payment rates ; risk hmos enrolled large numbers of beneficiaries in 92 lower payment counties in which factors other than payment rates were more favorable ; these counties were mostly in the west , where hmos are more prevalent and many consumers have embraced this form of health care delivery ; in contrast , higher payment rates were no guarantee that risk hmo enrollment would also be high ; about one - third of the 100 counties with the highest medicare hmo payment rates in 1995 had risk hmo enrollments that were slight or nonexistent ; most of these higher payment / lower enrollment counties were in the south , where the presence of hmos was limited ; however , several of these counties were in three michigan urban areas ; although the presence of hmos in the health care market was generally greater in the michigan msas than in the south , employers ' provision of richer retiree health benefits made the risk hmo option less attractive to medicare beneficiaries in michigan ; in addition to population density and other factors external to hmos , hmos ' individual business strategies for the medicare market are likely to affect the future direction of risk hmo enrollment ; and all these strategies are likely to boost risk enrollment and , sometimes , to change the market dynamics in certain areas .
