supporting efforts to promote democracy has been a foreign policy priority for the u.s. government . in recent years , usaid and state have allocated about $ 2 billion per year toward democracy assistance overseas . congress required usaid and state to each establish guidelines for and report on the use of contracts , grants , and cooperative agreements for certain democracy programs . gao was asked to review u.s. democracy assistance . this report examines funding usaid , ned , and state obligated for democracy assistance primarily through contracts , grants , and cooperative agreements and evaluates documentation of usaid award - type decisions , among other objectives . gao analyzed usaid , ned , and state democracy assistance award data for fiscal years 2012 – 2016 . gao also reviewed relevant regulation and agency policies and analyzed documentation for a nongeneralizable sample of usaid awards selected based on factors such as award type , program area , and country . in fiscal years 2012 – 2016 , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) obligated $ 5.5 billion and the national endowment for democracy ( ned ) obligated $ 610.2 million in democracy assistance funding . the total funding the department of state ( state ) obligated for democracy assistance could not be reliably determined . one - third of all usaid obligations were provided through public international organizations ( pios ) , which under usaid guidance are composed principally of countries or other organizations designated by usaid ; 94 percent of pio obligations were provided to the world bank for democracy assistance projects in afghanistan . the remaining two - thirds of usaid obligations were provided through contracts , grants ( excluding pios ) , and cooperative agreements . of the 10 state bureaus providing democracy assistance , 3 were unable to provide reliable funding data for fiscal years 2012 – 2016 . data from these bureaus were incomplete , nonstandard , or inaccurate . federal internal control standards call for agencies to use quality information from reliable sources to achieve intended objectives and to monitor activities . without such data , state can not effectively monitor its democracy assistance programming and report reliable data externally . for the awards gao sampled , usaid generally did not document decisions about whether to award a contract , grant , or cooperative agreement ( known as award - type decisions ) in a complete and timely manner . according to applicable usaid guidance , agency officials were required to document the final award - type decision with their written determination , including a rationale based on the requirements of the federal grant and cooperative agreement act , and complete this documentation before award solicitation occurs or , for noncompetitive awards , before usaid initiated communications with a potential sole - source awardee . however , usaid provided both complete and timely documentation of the award - type decision for 5 of the 41 awards gao sampled . for the remaining 36 awards , the documentation was either incomplete , not timely or timeliness was indeterminate , or both ( see table ) . while usaid has taken steps to improve documentation for award - type decisions by updating its guidance and templates , it has not assessed whether these updates have resulted in complete and timely documentation . it is important that usaid document these decisions in advance of solicitation because the selection of an award type may affect requirements for administering the award , including competition and oversight requirements and whether or not profit is permissible . state should improve the reliability and completeness of its democracy assistance funding data , and usaid should assess whether steps taken are resulting in complete and timely documentation of democracy assistance award - type decisions . state and usaid concurred with gao 's recommendations and described actions planned or under way to address them .
