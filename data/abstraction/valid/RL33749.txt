most programs of federal aid to k - 12 education are authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) . the esea was most recently amended and reauthorized by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ) . the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 , although esea programs continue to operate as long as appropriations are provided , and the 111th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea . debates over reauthorization of the esea have thus far focused on the following overarching issues : ( 1 ) what has been the impact of the substantial expansion of standards - based assessments of pupil achievement required under the esea , and should these requirements be expanded further to include additional subjects or grade levels ? . ( 2 ) are adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) requirements appropriately focused on improving education for disadvantaged pupil groups and identifying low - performing schools ? . ( 3 ) have the program improvement , corrective actions , and restructuring required under the esea for schools and local educational agencies ( leas ) that fail to meet ayp standards for two consecutive years or more been effectively implemented , and have they significantly improved achievement levels among pupils in the affected schools ? . ( 4 ) what has been the impact of the requirements that all public school teachers ( and many paraprofessionals ) be highly qualified and that well - qualified teachers be equitably distributed across schools and leas ? . ( 5 ) should esea programs be funded at levels closer to the maximum authorized amounts , and at what levels , if any , should authorizations be set for years beyond fy2008 ? . ( 6 ) should the esea place greater emphasis on enhancing the nation 's international competitiveness in science , mathematics , and foreign language achievement ? . ( 7 ) the nclb , with its numerous new or substantially expanded requirements for participating states and leas , initiated a major increase in federal involvement in basic aspects of public k - 12 education . should the active federal role in k - 12 education embodied in the nclb be maintained ? . this report will be updated regularly .
