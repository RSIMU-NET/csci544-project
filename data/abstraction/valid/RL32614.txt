continuing appropriations acts ( commonly known as continuing resolutions or crs ) , which provide interim funding in the event that regular appropriations have not been enacted , have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades . whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for a fiscal year is incomplete , an issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used . continuing resolutions may have a relatively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks . alternatively , continuing resolutions may have a longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections , or through the beginning of the next congressional session . finally , a continuing resolution may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year . the duration of a continuing resolution refers to the period for which budget authority is provided for covered projects and activities . the period ends either upon enactment of the applicable regular appropriations act or on an expiration date specified in the continuing resolution , whichever occurs first . based upon their duration , continuing resolutions may be classified as either interim or full - year measures . interim ( or temporary ) continuing resolutions provide funding for periods usually measured in days or weeks ( but sometimes months ) , while full - year continuing resolutions provide funding through september 30 , the last day of the fiscal year . over the past half century , the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts have varied considerably , but tardy enactment has been a recurring problem . during the 24-year period covering fy1952-fy1976 , when the fiscal year began on july 1 , at least one regular appropriations bill was enacted after the start of the fiscal year . continuing resolutions were used in all fiscal years during this period except fy1953 , despite the fact that only one regular appropriations bills was enacted before the start of that fiscal year . from fy1977 to fy2011 , after the start of the fiscal year was moved to october 1 , all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances ( fy1977 , fy1989 , fy1995 , and fy1997 ) . no continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years , but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose funding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts . full - year continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year . while congress has employed full - year continuing resolutions on many occasions , it has not done so consistently over time . for each of the 11 fiscal years covering fy1978-fy1988 , congress enacted a full - year continuing resolution to provide funding for programs and activities covered by at least one regular appropriations act . three years later , congress enacted another full - year continuing resolution , for fy1992 . most recently , congress enacted a full - year continuing resolution for fy2011 . during the past 15 fiscal years ( fy1998-fy2012 ) , congress provided funding under continuing resolutions for an average of over four months ( 126.6 days ) . the period for which continuing appropriations were provided in these 15 years ranged from 21 days to 365 days . on average , each of the 92 continuing resolutions enacted during this period lasted for about 29 ( 28.8 ) days ; 45 of these were for 7 days or less .
