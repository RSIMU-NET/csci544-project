each year , criminal organizations transport hundreds of tons of illegal drugs from south america to the united states through a 6 million square mile `` transit zone '' including central america , the caribbean , the gulf of mexico , and the eastern pacific ocean . since fiscal year 2003 , the united states has provided over $ 950 million to support counternarcotics efforts in transit zone countries , which historically lacked the capacity to interdict drugs . gao was asked to examine how the united states has assisted transit zone countries in disrupting drug trafficking and what factors have impeded these efforts . gao analyzed relevant data , met with u.s. and foreign officials , and visited selected countries . u.s. government assistance has improved international counternarcotics cooperation with the eight major drug transit countries gao reviewed , except venezuela . first , assistance programs have helped partner nations gather , process , and share information and intelligence leading to arrests and drug seizures . second , they have enabled these nations to participate in counternarcotics operations -- both at sea and on land -- by providing assets ( such as interceptor boats and vehicles ) , logistical support , and training for police units . third , u.s. assistance has helped strengthen the capacity of prosecutors to work more effectively on drug - related cases . assessing the impact of such a wide variety of programs is difficult because some are indirectly related to drug interdiction , and because results reporting has been limited and inconsistent . despite gains in international cooperation , several factors , including resource limitations and lack of political will , have impeded u.s. progress in helping governments become full and self - sustaining partners in the counternarcotics effort -- a goal of u.s. assistance . these countries have limited resources to devote to this effort , and many initiatives are dependent on u.s. support . programs to build maritime interdiction capacity have been particularly affected , as partner nations lack fuel and other resources needed to operate and maintain u.s. - provided boats . limited political support , particularly in venezuela , and corruption have also hindered u.s. counternarcotics efforts . in addition , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has implemented a container security initiative ( csi ) that targets and scans containers for weapons of mass destruction and terrorist contraband . but csi has not routinely been used for illicit drug detection , despite its applicability for this purpose .
