concerns have been raised that the economic models used by the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and the u.s. international trade commission do not account for all the factors that affect cattle prices and producer incomes . gao reviewed usda 's livestock model to determine whether it incorporates imports , market concentration , marketing agreements , and forward contracts . in reviewing best modeling practices , gao 's expert panel concluded that domestic cattle demand and supply were the fundamental forces driving cattle prices and producer incomes . the panel identified issues necessary to develop a comprehensive modeling system that predicts cattle prices and producer incomes . the panel recommended the collection of better data to quantify several important factors omitted from the model . the panel also wanted to see a more complete characterization of the supply and demand relationships connecting the cattle producer to the final consumer . the panel 's emphasis on a more complete characterization of the cattle and beef industry underscores the idea that the demand for cattle is ultimately driven by consumer demand for beef and other demand and supply forces linking cattle producers to feedlots , meatpackers , and retailers .
