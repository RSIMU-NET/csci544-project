more than 100,000 retired coal miners and their spouses and dependents in 1992 faced a potential decrease in their employment - related health insurance coverage or loss of such coverage altogether . some former employers had stopped mining coal or gone out of business and were no longer contributing to the united mine workers of america ( umwa ) retiree benefit funds . to ensure that these individuals would continue to receive the health benefits specified in previous collective bargaining agreements reached with coal companies , often gained in exchange for lower pensions , congress enacted the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 ( coal act ) . the coal act replaced the existing umwa benefit funds with the combined benefit fund ( cbf ) and the 1992 benefit plan . these funds ' benefits requires less cost sharing by beneficiaries and provides more extensive coverage than benefit packages offered by the major manufacturing companies and companies with unionized workforces . however , the extent of coverage is generally comparable . the cost of health care for the funds ' beneficiaries in 1999 was about 29 percent higher than for demographically similar medicare beneficiaries with employer - sponsored insurance . the funds ' officials have attempted to control costs largely through approaches that do not reduce or limit the benefits for beneficiaries , do not increase beneficiary cost - sharing requirements , or that have a minimal impact on beneficiaries .
