the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) faces the simultaneous challenges of preparing for the season and implementing the reorganization and other provisions of the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006. the act stipulated major changes to fema that were intended to enhance its preparedness for and response to catastrophic and major disasters . as gao has reported , fema and dhs face continued challenges , including clearly defining leadership roles and responsibilities , developing necessary disaster response capabilities , and establishing accountability systems to provide effective services while protecting against waste , fraud , and abuse . this testimony summarizes gao 's findings on these challenges and fema 's and dhs 's efforts to address them ; and discusses several disaster management issues for continued congressional attention . effective disaster preparedness and response require defining what needs to be done , where and by whom , how it needs to be done , and how well it should be done . gao analysis following hurricane katrina showed that improvements were needed in leadership roles and responsibilities , development of the necessary disaster capabilities , and accountability systems that balance the need for fast , flexible response against the need to prevent waste , fraud , and abuse . to facilitate rapid and effective decision making , legal authorities , roles and responsibilities , and lines of authority at all government levels must be clearly defined , effectively communicated , and well understood . adequacy of capabilities in the context of a catastrophic or major disaster are needed -- particularly in the areas of situational assessment and awareness ; emergency communications ; evacuations ; search and rescue ; logistics ; and mass care and shelter . implementing controls and accountability mechanisms helps to ensure the proper use of resources . fema has initiated reviews and some actions in each of these areas , but their operational impact in a catastrophic or major disaster has not yet been tested . some of the targeted improvements , such as a completely revamped logistics system , are multiyear efforts . others , such as the ability to field mobile communications and registration - assistance vehicles , are expected to be ready for the 2007 hurricane season . the comptroller general has suggested one area for fundamental reform and oversight is ensuring a strategic and integrated approach to prepare for , respond to , recover , and rebuild after catastrophic events . fema enters the peak of the 2007 hurricane season as an organization in transition working simultaneously to implement the reorganization required by the post - katrina reform act and moving forward on initiatives to address the deficiencies identified by the post - katrina reviews . this is an enormous challenge . in the short - term , congress may wish to consider several specific areas for immediate oversight . these include evaluating the development and implementation of the national preparedness system , including preparedness for natural disasters , terrorist incidents , and an influenza pandemic ; assessing state and local capabilities and the use of federal grants to enhance those capabilities ; examining regional and multi - state planning and preparation ; determining the status and use of preparedness exercises ; and examining dhs polices regarding oversight assistance .
