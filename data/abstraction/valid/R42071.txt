the united states will host the asia - pacific economic cooperation 's ( apec 's ) 19th economic leaders ' meeting in honolulu , hi , on november 12 & 13 , 2011. apec was founded in 1989 to facilitate trade and investment liberalization in the asia - pacific region . during the four days prior to the economic leaders ' meeting , apec will hold the fourth senior officials meeting for 2011 , the finance ministers meeting , and the apec ministerial meeting . president barack obama , secretary of state hillary clinton , secretary of the treasury timothy geithner , and u.s trade representative ron kirk are expected to attend their respective meetings . these meetings will culminate a year in which the united states hosted dozens of meetings . although the united states was among apec 's founding members , some u.s. officials have been frustrated with apec 's approach to trade and investment liberalization and facilitation . from its inception , apec has used a consensus - based , non - binding approach in which its members unilaterally adopt non - discriminatory liberalization and facilitation measures . in much of its trade policy , the u.s. government has generally utilized an approach based on negotiated binding agreements applicable only to the parties to the agreement . as such , there has been frequent discussion about apec 's proper role in u.s. trade policy . this discussion remains relevant in 2011 as three other multilateral fora have become increasingly important to the united states . the united states , along with eight other apec members , is attempting to negotiate a comprehensive regional trade agreement — commonly referred to as the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) — that the obama administration has promoted as a model free trade agreement for the 21st century . in addition , the 6th east asia summit ( eas ) , to be held in bali six days after the apec leaders ' meeting , will be the first at which the united states will participate as a full member . reflecting the growing importance the u.s. government places on relations with the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) , president obama is scheduled to attend the 3rd u.s. - asean summit , also in bali , the day before the eas summit . the rising prominence of other asian or asia - pacific events has also brought into question apec 's relevance and the necessity of the president 's attendance at the annual leaders ' meeting . as host in 2011 , the united states chose three main themes for the year — economic growth , green development , and cooperation and convergence of trade regulations . in addition , it is expected that there will be one or more major announcements regarding progress on the tpp negotiations during the economic leaders ' meeting . for more than a year , the obama administration has stated that it hopes substantial progress will be made on the tpp agreement in time for the apec meetings in honolulu . more recently , japan 's new prime minister yoshihiko noda has indicated that his country is contemplating joining the tpp negotiations . congressional interest in apec has generally focused on three issues — implications for u.s. trade policy in general , potential effects on relations with china , and budgetary matters . the voluntary unilateral trade and investment measures offered or agreed to by the united states at the annual economic leaders ' meetings may have implications for u.s. trade laws and regulations , as well as for the federal budget . for example , in the 112th congress h.r . 2042 is intended to help advance the u.s. commitment in 2007 to join the apec business travel card program . in addition , u.s. initiatives under the auspices of apec may impact relations with china . finally , as an apec member , the united states contributes to the organization 's operational budget , and as host for 2011 , the united states was responsible for much of the funding for the apec meetings held throughout the year .
