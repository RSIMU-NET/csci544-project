since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 , the united states has been relying on russia to transport astronauts to and from the iss . the purpose of nasa 's commercial crew program is to facilitate the development of a domestic transport capability . in 2014 , nasa awarded two firm - fixed - price contracts to boeing and spacex with a combined total value up to $ 6.8 billion for the development of crew transportation systems that meet nasa requirements and initial missions to the iss . the contractors were originally required to provide nasa all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017. a house report accompanying h.r . 2578 included a provision for gao to review the progress of nasa 's human exploration programs . this report examines the commercial crew program including the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification , the risks facing the program , and the extent to which the program has visibility into the contractors ' efforts . to do this work , gao analyzed contracts , schedules , and other documentation ; and spoke with officials from nasa , the commercial crew program , boeing , spacex , and independent review bodies . both of the commercial crew program 's contractors have made progress developing their crew transportation systems , but both also have aggressive development schedules that are increasingly under pressure . the two contractors — boeing and space exploration technologies , corp. ( spacex ) — are developing transportation systems that must meet the national aeronautics and space administration 's ( nasa ) standards for human spaceflight — a process called certification . both boeing and spacex have determined that they will not be able to meet their original 2017 certification dates and both expect certification to be delayed until 2018 , as shown in the figure below . the schedule pressures are amplified by nasa 's need to provide a viable crew transportation option to the international space station ( iss ) before its current contract with russia 's space agency runs out in 2019. if nasa needs to purchase additional seats from russia , the contracting process typically takes 3 years . without a viable contingency option for ensuring uninterrupted access to the iss in the event of further commercial crew delays , nasa risks not being able to maximize the return on its multibillion dollar investment in the space station . both contractors are also dealing with a variety of risks that could further delay certification , including program concerns about the adequacy of information on certain key systems to support certification . another top program risk is the ability of nasa and its contractors to meet crew safety requirements . the commercial crew program is using mechanisms laid out in its contracts to gain a high level of visibility into the contractors ' crew transportation systems . the program is using a different model than every other spacecraft nasa has built for humans . for example , nasa personnel are less involved in the testing , launching , and operation of the crew transportation system . the program has developed productive working relationships with both contractors , but the level of visibility that the program has required thus far has also taken more time than the program or contractors anticipated . ultimately , the program has the responsibility for ensuring the safety of u.s. astronauts and its contracts give it deference to determine the level of visibility required to do so . moving forward though , the program office could face difficult choices about how to maintain the level of visibility it feels it needs without adding to the program 's schedule pressures . given the delays in the commercial crew program , gao recommends that nasa develop and report to congress on its contingency plans for maintaining a u.s. presence on the iss beyond 2018. nasa concurred with the recommendation and intends to develop a contingency plan .
