in 2010 , the planned retirement of the space shuttle will require the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) to make disposal and reutilization decisions regarding over 1.2 million types of equipment . to facilitate these and other equipment management decisions , nasa recently invested $ 29 million in a new program : the plant , property , and equipment ( pp & e ) module -- a component of nasa 's integrated enterprise management program . gao was asked to assess the effectiveness of nasa 's processes , systems , and controls for managing its pp & e . this report addresses whether nasa effectively designed controls over steps nasa identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process , including sending equipment to disposal , and implemented policies , controls , and processes to enhance equipment reutilization . to answer these questions , gao reviewed nasa equipment reutilization policy and conducted on - site visits at five nasa centers . inconsistent descriptions and inaccurate information on the condition of equipment hamper the pp & e module 's ability to produce equipment matches and enhance reutilization . although descriptions of equipment items are crucial for the new module to succeed in identifying equipment for reutilization , nasa has not provided detailed guidance on what should be included in the description field , leading to widely varying descriptions . for example , the same type of computer server equipment was described as a `` disk array , '' `` disk drive unit , '' and `` storage array unit . . gao 's physical inspections at two centers found that 83 of the 84 equipment items inspected were incorrectly coded as new and unused in the pp & e module . these problems may lead to reutilization opportunities being overlooked . further hampering equipment reutilization is the pp & e module 's lack of detailed equipment availability information . the module does not identify the extent to which each piece of equipment is in use , necessitating a potentially lengthy search process . for example , an end user searching for an oscilloscope could currently have to contact up to 1,700 other end users to determine the availability status of these equipment items . these conditions contribute to inadequate end user utilization of the nasa property web interface ( n - prop ) , the pp & e module 's automated component . n - prop allows end users to perform online equipment management functions , which nasa anticipated would generate cost savings by facilitating equipment reutilization and eliminating manual processes . however , 98 of the 121 end users who were responsible for equipment selected from a nasa - wide statistical sample stated that they had never used either n - prop or the prior systems , limiting the potential savings from implementing the new pp & e module . nasa 's existing policies and procedures regarding equipment screenings and annual walk - through inspections -- both key controls in the equipment reutilization process -- were carried out inconsistently , if at all , at the five centers gao visited . without specific guidance on how to implement nasa 's equipment screening policy , centers failed to ensure that screenings occurred prior to purchasing new equipment , undermining the purpose of the screenings . further , nasa does not require users to justify the need to purchase new equipment when a screening has identified equipment available for reutilization . in addition , required walk - through inspections intended to identify idle equipment were not conducted at one center and were ineffective at the other four . equipment managers did not always follow up to ensure that the pp & e module was updated and gao 's testing estimated that about 16 percent of nasa 's controlled equipment ( with a value of at least $ 230 million ) was improperly listed as being actively in use and had been overlooked during annual walk - through inspections .
