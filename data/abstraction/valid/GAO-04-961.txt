congress has expanded the number of low - income and minority serving institutions eligible for grants under titles iii and v of the higher education act and nearly doubled funding for these grants in the last 5 years to about $ 432 million in fiscal year 2004. institutions eligible for funding under titles iii and v include historically black colleges and universities , tribal colleges , hispanic serving institutions , alaska native serving institutions , native hawaiian serving institutions , and other postsecondary institutions that serve low - income students . given the recent expansion , we examined these programs to determine how institutions used their title iii and title v grants and the benefits they received from using these grant funds , what objectives and strategies the department of education ( education ) has developed for title iii and title v programs , and to what extent education monitors and provides assistance to title iii and title v institutions . grantees most commonly reported using title iii and title v grant funds to strengthen academics , and they reported a wide range of benefits . most grantees reported using their grants to fund efforts designed to strengthen academics , and we estimate that over three - quarters of the grantees reported initiatives that focused on improving student services ( e.g . , tutoring ) and outcomes for students ( e.g . , course pass rates ) . the most commonly reported benefits were related to improvements in academic quality and student services and outcomes . while grantees reported a wide range of benefits , most also reported challenges in implementing their projects that sometimes resulted in the need for additional time at the end of the grant to complete their efforts . education has developed objectives and strategies designed to strengthen title iii and title v institutions by improving financial sustainability , technological capacity , academic quality , student services and outcomes , and institutional management . while education has developed data to determine its progress in four of these areas , it is still in the process of developing data for measuring increased technological capacity . education has developed plans and tools to enhance its monitoring of and assistance to title iii and title v grantees , but it has made limited progress in implementing these initiatives . specifically , education has not fully implemented its monitoring plan or completed its new electronic monitoring tools , and a new training curriculum to enhance the monitoring skills of staff . we found that only one - quarter of staff conducted two required site visits , and most visits that were conducted were not selected based on the requisite risk criteria . also , staff were not aware of updated department guidance and , as a result , did not always properly monitor grantees . we also found that education 's ability to provide technical assistance was limited . for example , education has acknowledged that its failure to provide information on eligibility criteria has resulted in uncertainty about the eligibility of over three - quarters of title v grantees .
