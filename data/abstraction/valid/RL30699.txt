the united states has long recognized the dangers inherent in the spread of nuclear , biological , and chemical ( nbc ) weapons , and missiles . this report , which analyzes nbc weapons programs potential threat patterns around the globe , is updated as needed . the total number of nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons in the world is shrinking as the major powers scale back their inventories through unilateral reductions and arms control , but other countries and groups still try to acquire these weapons . there are five established nuclear weapon states ( china , france , russia , the united kingdom , and the united states ) . india and pakistan declared their nuclear weapons capability with nuclear tests in 1998 , as did north korea in 2006. israel is also widely believed to have a nuclear weapon arsenal . about a dozen countries have offensive biological weapons ( bw ) programs , and the same number have chemical weapons ( cw ) programs . that number could grow , as new technologies are developed and the international flow of information , goods , expertise , and technology continues . while the united states and russia eliminated intermediate - range missiles and are reducing their intercontinental missile inventories , china is modernizing and expanding its missile force . north korea , iran , israel , india , and pakistan are building short - and medium - range missiles and are developing longer - range missiles . dozens of countries have or are developing short - range ballistic missiles and more are likely to buy them . over 80 countries have cruise missiles ; about 40 manufacture or have the ability to manufacture them . and terrorists continue their efforts to acquire nbc capabilities . elements in north korea , russia , china , india , pakistan , and other countries continue to export weapons technology . the potential for secondary proliferation markets has grown , and concern about the ability of individual actors like the pakistani nuclear scientist , a.q . khan , to peddle nuclear technology has grown considerably . the number of countries or groups that will acquire or produce nbc weapons may decrease if diplomacy , arms control treaties , nonproliferation regimes , and security and assistance strategies are effective . nbc weapons and missiles will remain a potential threat for the foreseeable future , but most observers readily agree that , even if nonproliferation policies alone are insufficient to halt nbc programs , such measures can slow those programs until states are persuaded that nbc weapons are not in their national security interest .
