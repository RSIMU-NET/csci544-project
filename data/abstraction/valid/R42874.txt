ghana : bilateral cooperation and leadership engagement ghana is considered a model for many of the outcomes that many members of congress have long sought to achieve in sub - saharan africa in the areas of authorizations ; appropriations and program guidance ; and oversight . ghana has received a large u.s. millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) compact and may soon receive a second . it is also a recipient of substantial u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and state department bilateral aid , much of which is channeled through three presidential development initiatives : the global climate change ( gcc ) initiative ; feed the future ( ftf ) , a global food security and poverty reduction initiative ; and the president 's malaria initiative ( pmi ) and the global health initiative ( ghi ) . ghana also hosts usaid and u.s. drug enforcement agency ( dea ) regional offices and the usaid - administered west africa trade hub . the hub focuses on expanding intra - regional and bilateral trade with countries in the region , a key area of current congressional interest and a pillar of the obama administration 's u.s. strategy toward sub - saharan africa , released in june 2012. ghana is also one of four initial partnerships for growth ( pfg ) countries . pfg , implementation of which began in 2011 in el salvador , is intended to advance public and private bilateral cooperation with selected countries whose top leaders demonstrate commitment to good governance and sustainable development . ghana hosts regular visits by members of congress , and in 2009 president barack obama signaled that ties remain close by traveling to ghana , the only sub - saharan african country that he has visited as president . good governance and stability president obama 's visit was premised on ghana 's record of having built a relatively robust democracy and a growing economy , albeit in the face of widespread poverty and diverse development challenges , making it a stable country in an often unstable region . during his visit he lauded its democratic and economic development record and made a major policy address relating these issues to good governance in africa and the wider developing world . ghana 's stability is maintained , in part , by its citizens ' commitment to constitutional governance . since undergoing a transition from single party rule in the early 1990s , it has held a series of peaceful but close elections , two involving inter - party transfers of state power . the most recent elections , held in early december 2012 , were closely contested . in all cases , opposition challengers have either accepted poll results outright or contested them through the courts , rather than through the use of violence or street protests . constitutional governance was also upheld in july 2012 , when state power was rapidly and transparently transferred to the current president , john dramani mahama , after the death of president john atta mills . ghana has also contributed to efforts to maintain stability and end conflict in the surrounding west africa region , and regularly contributes to international peacekeeping operations elsewhere . it receives u.s. capacity - building assistance in this area , as well as aid to help counter threats posed by international narcotics trafficking . development and economy : progress and challenges ghana 's economy has grown substantially in recent years , based both on increases in farm and mining exports and , more recently , oil production , which is likely to increase its strategic importance to the united states . growing oil earnings may help fund development , but may also pose resource governance and fiscal management challenges . economic growth has led to socio - economic and infrastructure construction gains , but ghana continues to face profound development challenges and threats to the rule of law linked to corruption and trafficking in illegal drugs and persons .
