five years after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , gao is taking stock of key efforts by the president , congress , federal agencies , and the 9 / 11 commission to strengthen or enhance critical layers of defense in aviation and border security that were directly exploited by the 19 terrorist hijackers . specifically , the report discusses how : commercial aviation security has been enhanced ; visa - related policies and programs have evolved to help screen out potential terrorists ; federal border security initiatives have evolved to reduce the likelihood of terrorists entering the country through legal checkpoints ; and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and other agencies are addressing several major post - 9 / 11 strategic challenges . the report reflects conclusions and recommendations from a body of work issued before and after 9 / 11 by gao , the inspectors general of dhs , state , and justice , the 9 / 11 commission , and others . it is not a comprehensive assessment of all federal initiatives taken or planned in response to 9 / 11 . gao is not making any new recommendations at this time since over 75 prior recommendations on aviation security , the visa waiver program , and u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) , among others , are in the process of being implemented . continued monitoring by gao will determine whether further recommendations are warranted . while the nation can not expect to eliminate all risks of terrorist attack upon commercial aviation , agencies have made progress since 9 / 11 to reduce aviation - related vulnerabilities and enhance the layers of defense directly exploited by the terrorist hijackers . in general , these efforts have resulted in better airline passenger screening procedures designed to identify and prevent known or suspected terrorists , weapons , and explosives from being allowed onto aircraft . nevertheless , the nation 's commercial aviation system remains a highly visible target for terrorism , as evidenced by recent alleged efforts to bring liquid explosives aboard aircraft . dhs and others need to follow through on outstanding congressional requirements and recommendations by gao and others to enhance security and coordination of passengers and checked baggage , and improve screening procedures for domestic flights , among other needed improvements . gao 's work indicates that the government has strengthened the nonimmigrant visa process as an antiterrorism tool . new measures added rigor to the process by expanding the name - check system used to screen applicants , requiring in - person interviews for nearly all applicants , and revamping consular officials ' training to focus on counterterrorism . nevertheless , the immigrant visa process may pose potential security risks and we are reviewing this issue . to enhance security and screening at legal checkpoints ( air , land , and sea ports ) at the nation 's borders , agencies are using technology to verify foreign travelers ' identities and detect fraudulent travel documents such as passports . however , dhs needs to better manage risks posed by the visa waiver program , whereby travelers from 27 countries need not obtain visas for u.s. travel . for example , gao recommended that dhs require visa - waiver countries to provide information on lost or stolen passports that terrorists could use to gain entry . we also recommended that dhs provide more information to congress on how it plans to fully implement us - visit -- a system for tracking the entry , exit , and length of stay of foreign travelers . while much attention has been focused on mitigating the specific risks of 9 / 11 , other critical assets ranging from passenger rail stations to power plants are also at risk of terrorist attack . deciding how to address these risks -- setting priorities , making trade - offs , allocating resources , and assessing social and economic costs -- is essential . thus , it remains vitally important for dhs to continue to develop and implement a risk - based framework to help target where and how the nation 's resources should be invested to strengthen security . the government also faces strategic challenges that potentially affect oversight and execution of new and ongoing homeland security initiatives , and gao has deemed three challenges in particular -- information sharing , risk management , and transforming dhs as a department -- as areas needing urgent attention . dhs and the department of state reviewed a draft of this report and both agencies generally agreed with the information . both agencies provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate .
