gao reviewed the department of defense 's ( dod ) efforts to improve its software acquisition processes and test and evaluation of software - intensive systems , focusing on : how software - related problems affect defense acquisition programs during operational test and evaluation ( ot & e ) ; and barriers that limit ot & e effectiveness . gao found that : dod software - intensive systems often fail to meet their performance expectations , experience cost overruns and schedule delays , and are not ready for ot & e because they are not subject to rigorous developmental testing and evaluation and software development is often not fully mature when ot & e begins ; dod has not adequately addressed barriers that inhibit software acquisition and ot & e effectiveness ; dod has not adequately addressed the importance of software development , lacks a consistent policy that defines and coordinates software maturity and operational testing readiness , has not adequately defined and managed software requirements , and lacks reliable cost , schedule , and performance data ; dod has not implemented previous recommendations to ensure that quality software is adequately developed and tested and software - intensive systems are effective ; although the military services have tried to improve their software development processes , they lack a dod - wide coordinated strategy ; and the creation of a single executive - level office for software development and testing would help to resolve long - standing software problems .
