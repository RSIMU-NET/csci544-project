u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy , creating health and safety hazards for consumers , damaging victimized companies , and threatening the u.s. economy . in 2004 , the bush administration launched the strategy for targeting organized piracy ( stop ) -- a multi - agency effort to better protect intellectual property ( ip ) by combating piracy and counterfeiting . this testimony , based on a prior gao report as well as from observations from on - going work , describes the range and effectiveness of multi - agency efforts on ip protection preceding stop , initial observations on the organization and efforts of stop , and initial observations on the efforts of u.s. agencies to prevent counterfeit and pirated goods from entering the united states , which relate to one of stop 's goals . stop is the most recent in a number of efforts to coordinate interagency activity targeted at intellectual property ( ip ) protection . some of these efforts have been effective and others less so . for example , the special 301 process -- the u.s. trade representative 's process for identifying foreign countries that lack adequate ip protection -- has been seen as effective because it compiles input from multiple agencies and serves to identify ip issues of concern in particular countries . other interagency efforts , such as the national intellectual property law enforcement coordination council ( niplecc ) , are viewed as being less effective because little has been produced beyond summarizing agencies ' actions in the ip arena . while stop has energized ip protection and enforcement efforts domestically and abroad , our initial work indicates that its long - term role is uncertain . stop has been successful in fostering coordination , such as reaching out to foreign governments and private sector groups . private sector views on stop were generally positive ; however , some stated that it emphasizes ip protection and enforcement efforts that would have occurred regardless of stop 's existence . stop 's lack of permanent status and accountability mechanisms pose challenges for its long - term impact and congressional oversight . stop faces challenges in meeting some of its objectives , such as increasing efforts to seize counterfeit goods at the border -- an effort for which the department of homeland security 's customs and border protection ( cbp ) and immigration and customs enforcement are responsible . cbp has certain steps underway , but our initial work indicates that resources for ip enforcement at certain ports have declined as attention has shifted to national security concerns . in addition , prior gao work found internal control weaknesses in an import mechanism through which a significant portion of imports flow , and which has been used to smuggle counterfeit goods .
