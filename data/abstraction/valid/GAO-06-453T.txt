the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) most recent estimate of the difference between what taxpayers timely and accurately paid in taxes and what they owed was $ 345 billion . irs estimates it will eventually recover some of this tax gap , resulting in an estimated net tax gap of $ 290 billion . the tax gap arises when taxpayers fail to comply with the tax laws by underreporting tax liabilities on tax returns ; underpaying taxes due from filed returns ; or nonfiling , which refers to the failure to file a required tax return altogether or in a timely manner . the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate committee on the budget asked gao to present information on the causes of and possible solutions to the tax gap . this testimony addresses the nature and extent of the tax gap and the significance of reducing the tax gap , including some steps that may assist with this challenging task . for context , this testimony also addressed gao 's most recent simulations of the long - term fiscal outlook and the need for a fundamental reexamination of major spending and tax policies and priorities . our nation 's fiscal policy is on an imprudent and unsustainable course . as long - term budget simulations by gao show , over the long term we face a large and growing structural deficit due primarily to known demographic trends , rising health care costs , and lower federal revenues as a percentage of the economy . gao 's simulations indicate that the long - term fiscal challenge is too big to be solved by economic growth alone or by making modest changes to existing spending and tax policies . rather , a fundamental reexamination of major policies and priorities will be important to recapture our future fiscal flexibility . underreporting of income by businesses and individuals accounted for most of the estimated $ 345 billion tax gap for 2001 , with individual income tax underreporting alone accounting for $ 197 billion , or over half of the total gap . corporate income tax and employment tax underreporting accounted for an additional $ 84 billion of the gap . reducing the tax gap would help improve fiscal sustainability . given the tax gap 's persistence and size , it will require considering not only options that have been previously proposed but also new administrative and legislative actions . even modest progress would yield significant revenue ; each 1 percent reduction would likely yield nearly $ 3 billion annually . reducing the tax gap will be a challenging long - term task , and progress will require attacking the gap with multiple strategies over a sustained period . these strategies could include efforts to regularly obtain data on the extent of , and reasons for , noncompliance ; simplify the tax code ; provide quality service to taxpayers ; enhance enforcement of tax laws by utilizing enforcement tools such as tax withholding , information reporting , and penalties ; leverage technology ; and optimize resource allocation .
