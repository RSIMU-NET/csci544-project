the federal government provides elementary and secondary education and educational assistance to indian children , either directly through federally funded schools or indirectly through educational assistance to public schools . direct education is provided by the bureau of indian education ( bie ) in the u.s. department of the interior ( doi ) , through elementary and secondary schools funded by the bie . educational assistance to public schools is provided chiefly through programs of the u.s. department of education ( ed ) . the student population served by federal indian education programs consists of members ( or descendants of members ) of indian tribes , not american indians / alaska natives ( ai / ans ) , as identified by race / ethnicity . most of this indian education population attends public schools . most federal data on indian students are based on race / ethnicity , however , which complicates analysis of results for the population served by federal indian education programs . the bie was originally part of the bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) in doi . the bia began the current system of direct indian education in the decades following the civil war , with congressional approval and funding . the system developed gradually to its current structure . in the late 19th century , the bia began placing a few students in public schools , a trend that accelerated after about 1910. at present , over 90 % of the indian student population attends public schools . the bie - funded education system for indian students includes 169 schools ( and 14 `` peripheral dormitories '' for students attending public schools nearby ) . schools and dorms may be operated by the bie itself or by tribes and tribal organizations . a number of bie programs provide funding and services , supplemented by set - asides for bie schools from ed programs . federal funding for indian students in public schools flows to school districts chiefly through ed programs , with a small addition from a single bie program . most of the ed funds are authorized under the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) and individuals with disabilities in education act ( idea ) . a perennial issue regarding indian education is comparatively poor academic achievement among students in bie schools and ai / an students in public schools . since the 1970s , federal policies to address this issue include permitting greater tribal control and influence through tribally operated bie schools and culturally relevant educational curriculum and language instruction , and encouraging collaboration between states , local educational agencies , and public schools and tribes and parents of indian students . esea standards and accountability requirements also aim to promote the academic achievement of students . with respect to bie schools , congress has wrestled to find a bie administrative structure that will support greater academic achievement of bie students . other issues that congress and administrations have attempted to address are the condition of school facilities , the incidence of violence and alcohol and drug use among indian students , the differential administration of discipline in public schools , and the adequacy of funding .
