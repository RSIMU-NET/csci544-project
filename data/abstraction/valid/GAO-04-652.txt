in their efforts to reduce hazardous fuels and the risk of wildfire on the nation 's public lands , the forest service and the bureau of land management ( blm ) expect that stewardship contracting will play a major role . stewardship contracting involves the use of contracting authorities -- such as the exchange of goods for services -- first authorized in 1998 and intended to help the agencies achieve land management goals that meet community needs . gao was asked , among other things , to determine the contracting and financial controls the agencies use to ensure accountability in managing stewardship contracting projects and the steps the agencies have taken to involve communities in the projects . although the forest service provided limited initial guidance on establishing contracting and financial controls , the eight stewardship projects gao visited had incorporated such controls . ( blm was first granted stewardship authority in 2003 and had no projects under way at the time of gao 's review . ) . the projects generally used pre - and post - award controls , such as reviews of contractor bids using preestablished criteria , and performance and payment bonds to ensure completion of required activities . gao 's review of selected financial controls at the projects we visited showed that they appeared to have procedures in place to account for retained receipts , including tracking funds received and expended , and had incorporated procedures designed to ensure the completion of specific work tasks before contractors were paid . both the forest service and blm issued guidance in january 2004 containing such controls for future projects . the forest service initially provided minimal guidance on soliciting and incorporating public involvement in stewardship contracting projects and , as a result , the type and extent of efforts to involve communities varied considerably among the projects gao reviewed . however , managers who did not incorporate public input may have missed valuable opportunities to strengthen their projects . for example , one project manager said that public involvement led to more stringent criteria for protecting water quality , and another reported that public involvement improved agency access to public lands needing fuel reduction . although most managers gao spoke with said they wanted additional guidance on public involvement , the forest service 's recently issued stewardship contracting handbook does not contain specific guidance for obtaining community input -- and blm 's recent guidance is similarly lacking . without such guidance , each project manager must independently determine the type and extent of community involvement to solicit and then develop and implement community involvement procedures -- an inefficient process that could lead to variation in community involvement across stewardship contracting projects in both agencies .
