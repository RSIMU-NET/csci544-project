pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the federal disaster declaration process , focusing on : whether the federal emergency management agency 's ( fema ) and the small business administration 's ( sba ) disaster declaration policies differ for rural and urban areas ; the length of time taken to respond to disaster declaration requests for rural and urban areas ; the proportion of requests granted for rural areas , as compared with the corresponding proportion for urban areas ; and factors that influence disaster declaration processing time . gao found that : neither fema 's nor sba 's disaster declaration policies differ with respect to whether the affected area is rural or urban ; both agencies use criteria such as measures of damage to homes , businesses , and public facilities to assess requests for disaster declarations and to help determine whether or not to grant assistance ; neither agency 's criteria include a measure of population density ; for requests received in calendar 1993 and 1994 , the time that elapsed between the governors ' requests and the declaration decisions by the president or sba was longer for rural and very rural counties than for urban or very urban counties ; for example , the median processing time for requests to fema for very rural counties was 11 days , and for very urban counties , it was 7 days ; similarly , the time that elapsed between the occurrence of a `` disaster incident '' and the governor 's request for a disaster declaration was longest for very rural counties and shortest for very urban counties ( medians of 10 days and 4 days , respectively , for requests made to the president ) ; in disasters declared by the president , fema made a greater proportion of very rural counties ( 93 percent ) eligible for assistance than any other type of county ; in contrast , sba declared a greater proportion of urban and very urban counties ( 58 percent and 70 percent , respectively ) eligible for assistance than rural and very rural counties ; in the cases gao reviewed , various factors affected the time required for the declaration process ; one factor affecting the length of time between a disaster incident and a gubernatorial request for a declaration was how quickly damage assessments could be made ; and among the factors that affected the length of time between a gubernatorial request and a declaration decision was the extent to which the damage was documented in the governor 's request .
