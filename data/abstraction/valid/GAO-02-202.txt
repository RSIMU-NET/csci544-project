the number of contracts under medicare 's managed care program -- medicare+choice ( m+c ) -- fell from 340 to 180 between 1998 and 2001. the reduction reflected decisions by some managed care organizations ( mcos ) to terminate selected contracts or to discontinue service in some covered areas . although nearly all mcos renewed at least some of their medicare contracts over this period , many reduced the geographic areas served . as a result , 1.6 million beneficiaries had to switch mcos or return to medicare 's traditional fee - for - service program . other mcos plan either to terminate or reduce their participation in m+c at the end of 2001. concerned about mco withdrawals , congress sought to make participation in the program more attractive . as a result of the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 , aggregate medicare+choice payments in 2001 are estimated to have increased by $ 1 billion . the act permitted three basic uses for the higher payment . mcos could improve their health plans ' benefit packages , set aside money for future years in a benefit stabilization fund , or stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers . most mcos reported that additional money would be used to stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers . a minority of mcos reported that the money would go toward benefit improvements or be placed in a benefit stabilization fund . in 83 percent of m+c plans , mcos stated that some or all of the additional money would be used to stabilize or enhance beneficiary access . the payment increases had little effect on the availability of m+c plans during 2001. following passage of the act , three mcos reentered counties they had dropped from their service areas , three mcos expanded into counties that they previously had not served , and one mco both reentered previously served counties and expanded into new ones .
