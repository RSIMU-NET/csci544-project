drinking water in some metropolitan areas contains concentrations of pharmaceuticals , raising concerns about their potential impact on human health . the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) authorizes the environmental protection agency ( epa ) to regulate contaminants , including pharmaceuticals , in public drinking water systems if they may adversely affect human health among other criteria . pharmaceuticals may enter drinking water supplies from several pathways , including discharge from wastewater facilities . gao was asked to provide information on the extent to which pharmaceuticals occur in drinking water and their effects , if any , on human health ; u.s. and other countries ' approaches to reducing their occurrence ; and challenges , if any , that epa faces in determining whether to regulate pharmaceuticals . gao reviewed federal and peer - reviewed reports , and surveyed a nonprobability sample of five u.s. programs designed to properly dispose of pharmaceuticals . we selected these programs based on geographic diversity and program characteristics . we also researched such programs in two countries , and interviewed scientists and agency officials . research has detected pharmaceuticals in the nation 's drinking water . national and regional studies by the u.s. geological survey , epa , and others have detected pharmaceuticals in source water , treated drinking water , and treated wastewater ; but the full extent of occurrence is unknown . the concentrations detected for any one pharmaceutical were measured most frequently in parts per trillion . research has not determined the human health effects of exposure to these concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water . however , federal research has demonstrated the potential impact to human health from exposure to some pharmaceuticals found in drinking water , such as antibiotics and those that interfere with the functioning and development of hormones in humans . some states and local governments as well as the drug enforcement administration have taken actions that could reduce the extent to which pharmaceuticals occur in drinking water . these efforts have primarily been through drug take - back programs to encourage proper control and disposal of pharmaceuticals . additional efforts have been adopted in europe following the european union 's directive in 2004 requiring member states to have appropriate collection systems for unused or expired medicinal products . in addition to collection systems , sweden also encourages actions such as writing small initial prescriptions to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals that are disposed of if patients switch to a different pharmaceutical course . epa faces challenges in obtaining sufficient occurrence and health effects data on pharmaceuticals and other contaminants in drinking water to support analyses and decisions to identify which , if any , pharmaceuticals should be regulated under sdwa . epa is collaborating with the food and drug administration and u.s. geological survey on research to help obtain such data but these efforts are largely informal . epa officials said there is no formal mechanism , such as a long - term strategy or formal agreement , to manage and sustain these collaborative efforts . a recently expired interagency workgroup , which epa co - chaired , initiated work on a research strategy to identify opportunities that will enhance collaborative federal efforts on pharmaceuticals in the environment , but its draft report did not contain key details about how the agencies will coordinate such collaborative efforts . gao previously identified key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration among federal agencies , some of which may help clarify such coordination , such as establishing the roles and responsibilities of collaborating agencies ; leveraging their resources ; and establishing a process for monitoring , evaluating , and reporting to the public the results of the collaborative research efforts . gao recommends that the administrator of epa establish a workgroup or other formal mechanism to coordinate research on pharmaceuticals and other contaminants in drinking water . epa agreed with the recommendation .
