each year , federal agencies spend billions of dollars to buy commercial products and services through the general service administration 's ( gsa ) multiple award schedules program . the program has grown significantly over the past several years . currently , federal agencies can directly purchase , through more than 16,000 schedule contracts , over 8 million products from more than 10,000 commercial vendors . in fiscal year 2004 , purchases from these contracts totaled more than $ 32 billion . the multiple award schedules program is designed to take advantage of the government 's significant buying power . to maximize savings , gsa negotiates discounts that are equal to or greater than those given to the vendor 's most favored customers . this testimony focuses on gsa 's historic use of two proven negotiation tools to improve the pricing of schedules contracts -- pre - award audits and postaward audits of pre - award information . pre - award audits allow gsa to avoid potential overpricing by verifying vendor pricing information before contracts are awarded . postaward audits allow gsa to identify overpricing of awarded contracts and recover overcharges . historically , gsa has used pre - award and postaward audits sporadically , thereby minimizing its ability to avoid excessive pricing and recover overcharges and potentially save millions of federal dollars . for more than 25 years , gao has reported on gsa 's multiple award schedules program pricing problems . in march 1977 , we reported that pre - award information on 6 of 15 contract proposals was not accurate , complete , or current . in 1979 , we again reported that pricing information submitted by some vendors was unreliable . moreover , only 1 pre - award audit and 10 postaward audits had been conducted during fiscal years 1977 and 1978 of which 9 found inaccurate sales information had been reported by vendors or the availability of better discounts had not been disclosed . these problems continued throughout the 1980s . in the early 1990s , gsa made good use of pre - award and postaward audits , negotiating nearly $ 480 million in cost savings and recovering about $ 90 million in vendor overcharges over 5 years . however , in august 1997 , gsa revised its acquisition regulations and effectively eliminated the use of postaward audits . while gsa expected pre - award audits to increase , this increase never materialized . in august 2001 , the gsa inspector general reported that gsa was not consistently negotiating most favored customer pricing . for just one contract , the inspector general projected that over the contract 's term , gsa customers would pay nearly $ 40 million more than they should have . in february 2005 , we completed our most recent review of the multiple award schedules program and found that pricing problems persist and that the number of pre - award audits continued to decline . we concluded that gsa was continuing to miss opportunities to save hundreds of millions of dollars .
