in 1936 , the social security administration ( ssa ) established the social security number ( ssn ) to track worker 's earnings for social security benefit purposes . however , the ssn is also used for a myriad of non - social security purposes . today , the ssn is used , in part , as a verification tool for services such as child support collection , law enforcement enhancements , and issuing credit to individuals . although these uses of ssns are beneficial to the public , ssns are also a key piece of information in creating false identities . moreover , the aggregation of personal information , such as ssns , in large corporate databases , as well as the public display of ssns in various public records , may provide criminals the opportunity to commit identity crimes . ssa , the originator of the ssn , is responsible for ensuring ssn integrity and verifying the authenticity of identification documents used to obtain ssns . although congress has passed a number of laws to protect an individual 's privacy , the continued use and reliance on ssns by private and public sector entities and the potential for misuse underscores the importance of identifying areas that can be strengthened . accordingly , this testimony focuses on describing public and private sector use and display of ssns , and ssa 's role in preventing the proliferation of false identities . public and some private sector entities rely extensively on ssns . we reported last year that federal , state and county government agencies rely on the ssn to manage records , verify eligibility of benefit applicants , and collect outstanding debt . ssns are also displayed on a number of public record documents that are routinely made available to the public . to improve customer service , some state and local government entities are considering placing more public records on the internet . in addition , some private sector entities have come to rely on the ssn as an identifier , using it and other information to accumulate information about individuals . this is particularly true of entities that amass public and private data , including ssns , for resale . certain laws have helped to restrict the use of ssn and other information by these private sector entities to specific purposes . however , as a result of the increased use and availability of ssn information and other data , more and more personal information is being centralized into various corporate and public databases . because ssns are often the identifier of choice among individuals seeking to create false identities , to the extent that personal information is aggregated in public and private sector databases it becomes vulnerable to misuse . as the agency responsible for issuing ssns and maintaining the earnings records for millions of ssn holders , ssa plays a unique role in helping to prevent the proliferation of false identities . following the events of september 11 , 2001 , ssa formed a task force to address weaknesses in the enumeration process and developed major new initiatives to prevent the inappropriate assignment of ssns to non - citizens , who represent the bulk of new ssns issued by ssa 's 1,333 field offices . ssa now requires field staff to verify the identity information and immigration status of all non - citizen applicants with the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , prior to issuing an ssn . however , other areas remain vulnerable and could be targeted by those seeking fraudulent ssns . these include ssa 's process for assigning social security numbers for children under age one and issuing replacement social security cards . ssa also provides a service to states to verify the ssns of driver license applicants . fewer than half the states have used ssa 's service and the extent to which they regularly use it varies . factors such as cost , problems with system reliability , and state priorities and policies affect states ' use ssa 's service . we also identified a weakness in ssa 's verification service that exposes some states to fraud by those using the ssns of deceased persons .
