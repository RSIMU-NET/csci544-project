the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) has been on gao 's high - risk list since march 2006 because of concerns about its long - term financial solvency and related operational issues . significant management challenges also affect the federal emergency management agency 's ( fema ) ability to administer nfip . this report examines the extent to which fema 's management practices affect the administration of nfip ; lessons learned from the cancellation of fema 's attempt to modernize nfip 's insurance management system ; and limitations on fema 's authority that could affect nfip 's financial stability . to do this work , gao reviewed internal control standards and best practices , analyzed agency documentation , reviewed previous work , and interviewed relevant agency officials . fema faces significant management challenges in areas that affect nfip , including strategic and human capital planning ; collaboration among offices ; and records , financial , and acquisition management . for example , because fema has not developed goals , objectives , or performance measures for nfip , it needs a strategic focus for ensuring program effectiveness . fema also faces human capital challenges , including high turnover and weaknesses in overseeing its many contractors . further , fema needs a plan that would ensure consistent day - to - day operations when it deploys staff to federal disasters . fema has also faced challenges in collaboration between program and support offices . finally , fema lacks a comprehensive set of processes and systems to guide its operations , in particular a records management policy and an electronic document management system . fema has begun to address some of these challenges , including acquisition management , but the results of its efforts remain to be seen . unless it takes further steps to address these management challenges , fema will be limited in its ability to manage nfip 's operations or better ensure program effectiveness . fema also faces challenges modernizing nfip 's insurance policy and claims management system . after 7 years and $ 40 million , fema ultimately canceled its latest effort ( nextgen ) in november 2009 because the system did not meet user expectations . as a result , the agency continues to rely on an ineffective and inefficient 30-year old system . a number of acquisition management weaknesses led to nextgen 's failure and cancellation , and as fema begins a new effort to modernize the existing legacy system , it plans to apply lessons learned from its nextgen experience . while fema has begun implementing some changes to its acquisition management practices , it remains to be seen if they will help fema avoid some of the problems that led to nextgen 's failure . developing appropriate acquisitions processes and applying lessons learned from the nextgen failure are essential if fema is to develop an effective policies and claims processing system for nfip . finally , nfip 's operating environment limits fema 's ability to keep the program financially sound . nfip assumes all risks for its policies , must accept virtually all applicants for insurance , and can not deny coverage for high - risk properties . moreover , additional external factors -- including lapses in nfip 's authorization , the role of state and local governments , fluctuations in premium income , and structural and organizational changes -- complicate fema 's administration of nfip . as gao has previously reported , nfip also faces external challenges that threaten the program 's long - term health . these include statutorily required subsidized premium rates , a lack of authority to include long - term erosion in flood maps , and limitations on fema 's authority to encourage owners of repetitive loss properties to mitigate . until these issues are addressed , nfip 's long - term financial solvency will remain in doubt . gao makes 10 recommendations to improve the effectiveness of fema 's planning and oversight efforts for nfip ; improve fema 's policies and procedures for achieving nfip 's goals ; and increase the usefulness and reliability of nfip 's flood insurance policy and claims processing system . gao also presents three matters for congressional consideration to improve nfip 's financial stability . dhs concurred with all of gao 's recommendations .
