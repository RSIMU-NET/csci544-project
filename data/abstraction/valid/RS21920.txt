the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states , known as the 9 / 11 commission , recommended that congress and the transportation security administration give priority attention to screening airline passengers for explosives . the key issue for congress is balancing the costs of mandating passenger explosives detection against other aviation security needs . passenger explosives screening technologies have been under development for several years and are now being deployed in selected airports . their technical capabilities are not fully established , and operational and policy issues have not yet been resolved . critical factors for implementation in airports include reliability , passenger throughput , and passenger privacy concerns . presuming the successful development and deployment of this technology , certification standards , operational policy , and screening procedures for federal use will need to be established . this topic continues to be of congressional interest , particularly as the 110th congress reexamines implementation of the 9 / 11 commission 's recommendations via h.r . 1 and s. 4 .
