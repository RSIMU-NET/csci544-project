section 2034 of the water resources development act of 2007 requires that certain u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) civil works project studies undergo independent external peer review to assess the adequacy and acceptability of the methods , models , and analyses used . in the act , congress established a 7-year trial period for this requirement and also required the corps to submit two reports on its experiences with the peer review process . gao was asked to examine the number of corps project studies that have undergone independent peer review in response to section 2034 , the cost of these peer reviews , the extent to which the corps process for determining if a project study is subject to peer review is consistent with section 2034 , the process the corps uses to ensure that the contractors it hires and the experts the contractors select to review project studies are independent and free from conflicts of interest , and the extent to which peer review recommendations have been incorporated into project studies . gao reviewed relevant laws , agency guidance , and documents and interviewed corps officials and contractors . since enactment of the water resources development act of 2007 , 49 project studies have undergone peer review but it is unclear how many were performed in response to section 2034 requirements because the army corps of engineers ( corps ) does not make specific determinations or track if a peer review is being conducted under section 2034. in february 2011 , in response to section 2034 , the corps submitted its initial report to congress summarizing its implementation of the peer review process . in its report , however , the corps did not distinguish which studies had been selected for peer review in accordance with section 2034 and therefore , did not provide congress information that would help decision makers evaluate the requirements of section 2034 at the end of the trial period . the 49 peer reviews resulted in both direct and indirect costs . specifically , these peer reviews resulted in direct costs of over $ 9 million in contract costs and fees . in addition , corps staff resources were used to manage the reviews , although these costs are not fully quantifiable . furthermore , the addition of peer review to the corps study process has resulted in indirect costs by altering project study schedules to allow for time needed to complete peer reviews . in some cases where a peer review was not planned during the early stages of the study process , significant delays to project studies occurred while funds were sought to pay for the peer review . in contrast , according to some corps officials , when project managers have built in time and identified funding for peer reviews early , the process has had less of an impact on project study schedules . the corps process for determining whether a project study is subject to peer review is more expansive than section 2034 requirements because it uses broader criteria , resulting in peer reviews of studies outside the scope of section 2034. in addition , the process the corps uses does not include the flexibility provided in section 2034 , which allows for the exclusion of certain project studies from peer review . moreover , some studies are undergoing peer reviews that do not warrant it , according to some corps officials gao spoke with . the corps has a process to review general information on contractors conflicts of interest and independence when selecting them to establish peer review panels , but it does not have a process for reviewing project - level information on conflicts of interest and independence . as a result , it can not be assured that contractors do not have conflicts at the project - level . in contrast , the corps contractors do have a process for reviewing information related to conflicts of interest and the independence of experts selected for each peer review panel . the corps has adopted and incorporated into its project study reports most of the peer review recommendations it has received . doing so has resulted in some technical improvements to study reports but generally has not changed the corps decisions about project alternatives , in part because the peer review process occurs too late in the project study process to affect decision making , according to some corps officials gao spoke with . as a result , some recommendations about alternatives may not have been implemented because the decision on the preferred design had already been made . gao recommends that the department of defense direct the corps to , among other actions , better track peer review studies , revise the criteria for determining which studies undergo peer review and the timing of these reviews , and improve its process for ensuring contractor independence . the department generally concurred with these recommendations .
