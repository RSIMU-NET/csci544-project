the recent financial crisis contained a number of systemic risk episodes , or episodes that caused instability for large parts of the financial system . the lesson some policymakers have taken from this crisis is that a systemic risk or `` macroprudential '' regulator is needed to prevent similar episodes in the future . but what types of risk would this new regulator be tasked with preventing , and is it the case that those activities are currently unsupervised ? . some of the major financial market phenomena that have been identified as posing systemic risk include liquidity problems ; `` too big to fail '' or `` systemically important '' firms ; the cycle of rising leverage followed by rapid deleverage ; weaknesses in payment , settlement , and clearing systems ; and asset bubbles . at the time of the crisis , the federal reserve ( fed ) already regulated bank holding companies and financial holding companies for capital and liquidity requirements , and it could influence their behavior in markets that it did not regulate . in addition , the fed directly regulated or operated in some payment , settlement , and clearing systems . many systemically significant firms are already regulated by the fed because they are bank holding companies , although some may exist in what is referred to as the shadow banking system , which was largely free of federal regulation for safety and soundness . the fed 's monetary policy mandate was broad enough to allow it to prick asset bubbles , although it has not chosen to do so . neither the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( fed ) nor other existing regulators had the authority to address gaps in existing regulation that they believed pose systemic risk . opponents of giving regulators new systemic risk responsibilities argue that the crisis did not occur because regulators lacked the necessary authority to prevent it , but because they used their authority poorly and failed to identify systemic risk until it was too late . they fear that greater regulation of financial markets will lead to moral hazard problems that increase systemic risk . the recent crisis has demonstrated that government intervention may become unavoidable , however , even when firms or markets are not explicitly regulated or protected by the government . the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( h.r . 4173 , p.l . 111-203 ) was signed into law on july 21 , 2010. provisions of this legislation involving the federal reserve and systemic risk are discussed in this report . the act creates a financial stability oversight council ( council ) to identify ( but not rectify ) emerging threats and regulatory gaps . it authorizes the fed to regulate systemically significant firms identified by the council for safety and soundness . if the secretary of the treasury believes that a failure of a firm would threaten financial stability , the firm can be placed in receivership . it prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading , limits their ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds , and authorizes the fed to regulate those activities at systemically significant firms . it also authorizes the fed to regulate certain payment , clearing , or settlement systems identified as systemically significant by the council . to prevent assistance to failing firms , it limits the fed 's authority to lend to non - banks in emergencies and requires more oversight and disclosure of federal reserve activities . it imposes minimum capital requirements on a greater array of institutions and calls for capital requirements to be made counter - cyclical . it attempts to move more derivatives into clearinghouses and exchanges . although the act could be portrayed as an expansion of the fed 's powers , the legislation also strips the fed of certain powers , such as consumer financial protection responsibilities , and creates new checks on other powers , such as requirements to obtain approval from the council or the treasury secretary before undertaking certain decisions .
