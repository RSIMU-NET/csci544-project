legislation recently passed by the house of representatives — h.r . 3388 — and pending in the senate — s . 1885 — would provide new regulatory tools to the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) to oversee autonomous vehicles . autonomous vehicles are seen as a way to reduce motor vehicle crashes ; for example , there were 37,461 deaths from motor vehicle crashes in 2016 and nearly all of them were caused by driver error . however , despite unanimous approval in house and senate committees and on the house floor , the legislation has proven controversial in the wake of several high - profile accidents involving autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads . at present , no fully autonomous vehicles are available for public use . many new vehicles have automated some driver functions , but all require a human to monitor the driving environment and control the vehicle . however , rapid advances in technology have made it likely that vehicles with high levels of automation will be on the market within a few years , raising questions about the adequacy of existing methods of safety oversight . the federal government and the states share motor vehicle regulation , with the federal government responsible for vehicle safety and states for driver - related aspects such as licensing and registration . while nhtsa has the statutory authority to regulate all types of motor vehicles , its traditional standard - setting process would take many years at a time when vehicle innovation is changing rapidly ; standards envisioned now could be obsolete by the time they took effect . in the absence of nhtsa regulation of autonomous vehicles , nearly half the states have enacted laws on different aspects of autonomous vehicle deployment , resulting in a wide variety of state regulation . on september 6 , 2017 , the house of representatives passed by voice vote h.r . 3388. the legislation , which incorporates some provisions recommended in 2016 and 2017 u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) reports , would preempt state regulation of some aspects of autonomous vehicle deployment , while providing new regulatory tools to nhtsa . h.r . 3388 would preempt states from regulating the design of autonomous vehicles , unless those laws are identical to federal law ; expand nhtsa 's authority to grant exemptions from its standards to encourage innovation ; require each manufacturer to submit a `` safety assessment certification '' showing how it is addressing autonomous vehicle safety ; mandate within one year of enactment a nhtsa report indicating what federal safety standards must be updated and listing its vehicle safety priorities ; and require manufacturers to publicize their cybersecurity and data privacy plans . the legislation would also establish an advisory committee , a new regulation for rear - seat occupant alerts ( to reduce infant fatalities ) , and a review of headlamp standards . on november 8 , 2017 , the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation reported s. 1885 , legislation that is similar in many respects to the house - passed legislation . both bills address state preemption , safety standards , exemption authority , consumer information , cybersecurity , and privacy , but differ in their details .
