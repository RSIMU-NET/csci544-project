the department of veterans affairs ( va ) estimates it will provide health care to 5.8 million patients with appropriations of about $ 41 billion in fiscal year 2009. it provides a range of services , including primary care , outpatient and inpatient services , long - term care , and prescription drugs . va formulates its health care budget by developing annual estimates of its likely spending for all its health care programs and services , and includes these estimates in its annual congressional budget justification . gao was asked to discuss budgeting for va health care . as agreed , this statement addresses challenges va faces in formulating its health care budget and issues surrounding the possibility of providing advance appropriations for va health care . this testimony is based on prior gao work , including va health care : budget formulation and reporting on budget execution need improvement ( gao - 06-958 ) ( sept. 2006 ) ; va health care : long - term care strategic planning and budgeting need improvement ( gao - 09-145 ) ( jan. 2009 ) ; and va health care : challenges in budget formulation and execution ( gao - 09-459t ) ( mar . 2009 ) ; and on gao reviews of budgets , budget resolutions , and related legislative documents . we discussed the contents of this statement with va officials . gao 's prior work highlights some of the challenges va faces in formulating its budget : obtaining sufficient data for useful budget projections , making accurate calculations , and making realistic assumptions . for example , gao 's 2006 report on va 's overall health care budget found that va underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning from military operations in iraq and afghanistan . according to va officials , the agency did not have sufficient data from the department of defense , but va subsequently began receiving the needed data monthly rather than quarterly . in addition , va made calculation errors when estimating the effect of its proposed fiscal year 2006 nursing home policy , and this contributed to requests for supplemental funding . gao recommended that va strengthen its internal controls to better ensure the accuracy of calculations used to prepare budget requests . va agreed and , for its fiscal year 2009 budget justification , had an independent actuarial firm validate savings estimates from proposals to increase fees for certain types of health care coverage . in january 2009 , gao found that va 's assumptions about the cost of providing long - term care appeared unreliable given that assumed cost increases were lower than va 's recent spending experience and guidance provided by the office of management and budget . gao recommended that va use assumptions consistent with recent experience or report the rationale for alternative cost assumptions . in a march 23 , 2009 , letter to gao , va stated that it concurred and would implement this recommendation for future budget submissions . the provision of advance appropriations would `` use up '' discretionary budget authority for the next year and so limit congress 's flexibility to respond to changing priorities and needs . while providing funds for 2 years in a single appropriations act provides certainty about some funds , the longer projection period increases the uncertainty of the data and projections used . if va is expected to submit its budget proposal for health care for 2 years , the lead time for the second year would be 30 months . this additional lead time increases the uncertainty of the estimates and could worsen the challenges va already faces when formulating its health care budget . given the challenges va faces in formulating its health care budget and the changing nature of health care , proposals to change the availability of the appropriations it receives deserve careful scrutiny . providing advance appropriations will not mitigate or solve the problems we have reported regarding data , calculations , or assumptions in developing va 's health care budget . nor will it address any link between cost growth and program design . congressional oversight will continue to be critical .
