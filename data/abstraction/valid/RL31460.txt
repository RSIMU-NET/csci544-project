the educational and cultural exchange visitor program has become a gateway for foreign medical graduates ( fmgs ) to gain admission to the united states as nonimmigrants for the purposeof graduate medical education and training . the visa most of these physicians enter under is the j - 1nonimmigrant visa . under the j - 1 visa program , participants must return to their home country aftercompleting their education or training for a period of at least two years before they can apply foranother nonimmigrant visa or legal permanent resident ( lpr ) status , unless they are granted a waiverof the requirement . the j - 1 visa waiver program has recently undergone significant change . in february 2002 , the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) , which had historically been the largest sponsorof waivers , decided to end its participation as an interested government agency ( iga ) . thisdevelopment and the pending expiration of the `` conrad 20 '' program , which allowed 20 waivers perstate , threatened the continued availability of waivers . these developments raised concerns amongmany in medically underserved areas because it is often difficult for them to find u.s. medicalgraduates willing to practice in these areas . bills introduced in the 107th congress proposed changesto the `` conrad 20 '' program , including expanding the program and making it permanent . in an effort to ensure the continued availability of medical care in underserved areas , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) announced it would assume usda 's role as asponsor of j - 1 primary care physicians . this was a policy change for hhs which has historicallybeen very restrictive in its sponsorship of waivers . prior to this announcement , hhs had limitedsponsorship to research physicians and scientists involved in research of international or nationalsignificance . on november 2 , 2002 , the `` conrad 20 '' program was extended until 2004 and the number of waivers available to states was increased to 30. this program , which is now referred to as the '' conrad 30 '' or `` state 30 '' program , expired on june 1 , 2004. several measures , to address the expiration of the `` conrad 30 '' program were introduced in the108th congress . on december 3 , 2004 , s. 2302 became p.l . 108-441 . the new lawextends the program until june 1 , 2006 ; exempts physicians granted waivers from the h - 1bnumerical limits ; allows states to hire primary and speciality care physicians ; and place up to fivephysicians in shortage areas designated by the state .
