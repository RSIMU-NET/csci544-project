competition is a critical tool for achieving the best return on the governments investment . federal agencies are generally required to award contracts competitively , but they are permitted to use other than full and open competition in certain situations , such as when open competition would reveal information that would harm national security . gao examined dods use of this provision , known as the national security exception . it requires the use of competition to the greatest extent practicable . gao assessed the pattern of dods use of the national security exception ; dods processes for using the exception ; and the extent to which dod achieved competition under the exception . gao analyzed federal procurement data ; reviewed a selection of 27 contract files and justifications citing the exception from the army , navy , and air force , based on largest obligations , frequent users , and a range of procurement types , as well as five contracts from dod intelligence agencies ; and interviewed dod contracting and program officials . dods use of the national security exception is smallabout 2 percent of the dollar value of its total use of exceptions to full and open competition , but gaps in federal procurement data limit gaos ability to determine the full extent of dods use . dod procures a range of goods and services under this exception , and according to federal procurement data , the air force accounted for about 74 percent of dods use during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. however , dod intelligence agencies and special access programs frequently use the exception , but are generally excluded from reporting procurement data . while an office of the secretary of defense memorandum exempts three of the intelligence agencies from reporting such data , dod policy on reporting sensitive procurements for other military department programs is not clear . for most national security exception contract actions gao reviewed , dod used a single justification and approval document that applies to multiple contractsknown as a class justification . among those reviewed , $ 3.3 billion of $ 3.4 billion was obligated under contracts that used class justifications , which reduce the steps required to proceed with individual contract actions that do not use full and open competition . according to contracting officials , the increased flexibility of national security exception class justifications helps meet mission needs . however , in the air force , concerns about the reduced management review of these contracts have led to changes in the process for approving individual contract actions using class justifications . nevertheless , all of the justifications gao reviewed met federal acquisition regulation requirements . gaos analysis of federal procurement data on about 11,300 contract actions found that , from fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , only 16 percent of all obligations under those actions by the military departments under the national security exception received more than one proposal . contract files and contracting officials cited a limited pool of companies with the right capabilities , the difficulty of changing from an established vendor , and limited tools for soliciting competitive bids as reasons for their inability to obtain more competition . twelve of the 27 military department contract files gao reviewed did not include a record of market research , and others included few details on the results . two intelligence agencies that reported using the national security exception for all contracting reported achieving comparatively high levels of competition . both have systems that catalogue firms , capabilities , and solicitations that are used to facilitate security sensitive market research . gao recommends that dod issue guidance clarifying when security sensitive contracting data must be reported , monitor the impact of new air force class justification processes , and consider using tools that facilitate market research in a secure environment . dod concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with the recommendation on clarifying guidance , citing pending revisions to regulations . gao continues to believe that clarifying guidance is needed .
