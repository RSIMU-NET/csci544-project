pursuant to a congressional request , gao evaluated the food and drug administration 's ( fda ) oversight of transplanted human tissue as well as potential safety problems , focusing on : gaps in the current regulation ; and whether and how fda plans to address them in the approach it has proposed for regulating tissue banking . gao noted that : fda is just now expanding its oversight to improve tissue - banking safeguards in the growing field of tissue - based therapies ; fda has proposed a regulatory approach that is much broader in scope than the current regulation ; still in its formative stages , the regulatory approach describes a risk - based approach that industry has generally received well ; fda 's proposed approach would alleviate three safety problems not covered by the current regulation : fda has no universal registry of tissue facilities currently operating in the united states ; the current regulation does not cover reproductive tissue or stem cell facilities ; and there are numerous instances of misleading and false advertising in private cord blood banking ; two problems that fda does not address in the current regulation or in the proposed approach are : some facilities obtain informed consent after infant delivery , raising safety and ethical concerns about cord blood ; and fda has no current or proposed requirements for disclosing to recipients whether genetic tests have been performed on reproductive tissues and stem cells ; and four instances in which fda 's proposed approach inadequately addresses potential safety problems not covered in the current regulation are : facilities would be required to record and investigate errors and accidents but not to report them to fda ; the proposed approach only minimally mentions tracking tissues as good tissue practices and then only in respect to controlling disease transmission ; fda will not require premarket submissions when cells or tissues are to be used in the person from whom they are obtained or in a close blood relative ; and fda has proposed that certain tissue products be subject to premarket approval and that it evaluate processing techniques used on those products , but , for minimally manipulated tissue products , would require only that the validation of the procedure be documented and available when fda inspects facilities .
