by law , facilities funded by the indian health service ( ihs ) may retain reimbursement from medicare and medicaid without an offsetting reduction in funding . ensuring that ihs - funded facilities enroll individuals in -- and obtain reimbursement from -- medicare and medicaid can provide an important means of expanding the funding for health care services for the population served by ihs . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers medicare and oversees states ' medicaid programs , is required by executive order and hhs policy to consult with indian tribes on policies that have tribal implications . this requirement is in recognition of the unique government - to - government relationship between the 562 federally recognized indian tribes and the federal government . gao was asked to describe interactions between cms and ihs , examine mechanisms cms uses to interact and consult with indian tribes , examine mechanisms that selected states ' medicaid programs use to interact and consult with indian tribes , and identify barriers to medicare and medicaid enrollment and efforts to help eligible american indians and alaska natives apply for and enroll in these programs . gao reviewed documents , interviewed federal and state officials , and visited a judgmental sample of indian tribes and ihs - funded facilities in six states . cms and ihs have interacted to provide support to ihs - funded facilities and tribes in their access to medicare and medicaid and address broader policy and regulatory concerns regarding these programs . their interactions to provide support have included education and technical assistance ; the agencies also have interacted to obtain input from tribal representatives on program operations . on broader policy and regulatory concerns , cms and ihs have worked on policy initiatives aimed at ensuring that existing health care policies meet the needs of ihs - funded facilities and the populations they serve . cms and ihs have had mixed success identifying whether proposed cms regulatory changes would affect ihs - funded facilities or their populations and thus warrant ihs review . cms has been working to improve its identification of such regulations . cms has used two key mechanisms -- tribal liaisons and an advisory board -- to interact with representatives from indian tribes , and it has relied primarily on annual regional sessions sponsored by hhs as its mechanism to consult with indian tribes . tribal liaisons in cms 's central and regional offices generally served as the point of contact for tribal representatives . cms 's tribal advisory board , which is meant to complement but not replace consultation , has provided the agency with advice on policies affecting the delivery of health care for american indians and alaska natives . cms has used annual hhs regional consultation sessions as the primary basis for consulting with indian tribes . however , consulting with tribes is an inherently difficult task , in part because of the variation in tribes ' size , location , and economic status . further , these hhs regional sessions -- which generally lasted 1 to 2 days and covered all hhs programs -- have offered limited time for consultation and discussion . the six state medicaid programs we reviewed have used at least one of three mechanisms -- tribal liaisons , advisory boards , and regular meetings -- to interact and consult with indian tribes . five of the six states reported having policies in place that governed the interactions between the state 's medicaid program and indian tribes , with most of these policies establishing guidelines for how consultation should be conducted . five states reported consulting with tribes about changes to their medicaid programs . american indians and alaska natives have faced several barriers to medicare and medicaid enrollment despite efforts to assist them with the application process . many of these barriers are similar to those experienced by other populations , such as transportation and financial barriers . to help eligible american indians and alaska natives enroll in medicare and medicaid , almost all of the ihs - funded facilities we visited had staff who assisted patients with the application process , including helping them complete and submit applications , and collecting required documentation . in commenting on a draft of this report , cms noted that it was appreciative of gao 's review of cms activities related to interactions with ihs and tribes .
