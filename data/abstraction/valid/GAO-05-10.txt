the navy has traditionally maintained overseas presence by deploying ships for 6 months . rotating crews aboard ships that remain deployed for longer periods is an alternative the navy could pursue to increase the utilization of ships . senior navy officials have also cited crew rotations as a way to reduce part of the navy 's plans for a larger force structure and reportedly free billions of dollars for other priorities . on its own initiative , gao examined the navy 's efforts to evaluate and implement several rotational crewing options and the impacts of ship maintenance on extended rotational crewing deployments . the navy has initiated change by demonstrating that rotating crews aboard surface ships on extended deployments may be a feasible alternative to traditional 6-month ship deployments . to effectively institutionalize and implement change , best practices show that a comprehensive analytical framework provides useful information to decision makers . however , the navy has not established such an analytical framework -- consisting of formal measurable goals , objectives , and metrics -- that could be used to assess the feasibility of various rotational crewing options and determine their impact on operational requirements , ship condition , and crew morale . further , the navy has not systematically collected or developed accurate cost data to perform complete cost - effective analyses . absent such information , the navy may not know the full impact of rotating crews on surface ships , the extent to which the various options should be implemented , or whether it is getting maximum return on investment . because rotating crews on surface ships is evolving as an alternative , the navy has not provided effective guidance when implementing the practice and has not systematically leveraged lessons learned . effective guidance and sharing of lessons learned are key tools used to institutionalize change and facilitate efficient operations . while the navy has well - established crew rotation policies and procedures for ballistic missile submarines that include appropriately documenting a ship 's condition and turnover procedures for accountability , it has not provided comparable guidance to surface ships . as a result , the navy unnecessarily risks repeating mistakes that could decrease warfighting effectiveness and crew morale . furthermore , the impact of ship maintenance on the implementation of rotational crewing has not been fully assessed . effective maintenance strategies help ensure ships can perform their missions without adverse impacts on crew morale . it is a challenge to ensure the mission capability of ships that are deployed for longer periods because most maintenance and repair is usually completed between 6-month deployments . while rotating crews has enabled the navy to keep ships deployed for up to 24 months , the service has not fully examined all issues related to the best maintenance strategies that could affect a ship 's condition and crew 's morale . absent effective strategies , the navy risks degrading long - term ship condition and discouraging crew support for rotational crewing .
