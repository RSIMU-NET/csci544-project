a key concept embodied in the accountability provisions of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb , p.l . 107-110 ) , is that of adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) . in order to be eligible for grants under esea title i , part a — education for disadvantaged pupils — states must implement ayp policies applicable to all public schools and local educational agencies ( leas ) , based primarily on the scores of pupils on state assessments . schools or leas that fail to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years face a variety of consequences . the primary model of ayp under the nclb is a group status model . such models set threshold levels of performance , expressed as a percentage of pupils scoring at a proficient or higher level on state assessments of reading and mathematics , that must be met by all pupils as a group , as well as pupils in designated demographic subgroups , in order for a public school or lea to make ayp . current law also includes a secondary model of ayp , a `` safe harbor '' provision , under which a school or lea may make ayp if , among pupil groups who did not meet the primary ayp standard , the percentage of pupils who are not at the proficient or higher level declines by at least 10 % . substantial interest has been expressed in the use of individual / cohort growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb . such ayp models are not consistent with certain statutory provisions of the nclb , as those were originally interpreted by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) . however , under a pilot program , ed has approved applications from 15 states for waivers to use growth models to make ayp determinations , and regulations adopted in late 2008 allow an unlimited number of states to apply for this option . many proponents of growth models of ayp see them as being more fair and accurate than the models generally employed to meet nclb requirements , primarily because they recognize the fact that different schools and pupils have different starting points in their achievement levels , and recognize progress being made at all levels . growth models of ayp have the disadvantage of implicitly setting lower initial thresholds or expectations for some pupils . although any growth model consistent with the nclb would need to incorporate the act 's ultimate goal of all pupils at a proficient or higher level of achievement by 2013-2014 , such models used currently in state ( non - nclb ) accountability plans do not include such goals and might allow disadvantaged schools and pupils to remain at relatively low levels of achievement for significant periods of time . growth models of ayp may be quite complicated and may address the accountability purposes of the nclb less directly and clearly than the currently statutory ayp models . the authorization for esea programs expired at the end of fy2008 , and the 111th congress is expected to consider whether to amend and extend the esea . this report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and available information .
