management of the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) e - commerce program has been fragmented , and implementation of e - commerce initiatives has varied at different business units . overall , usps ' performance in this area has fallen short of expectations . last year , the postmaster general announced a sweeping management restructuring that changed both the reporting structure and program managers . usps also revised its procedures for approving and implementing new internet initiatives , including e - commerce . however , concerns persist about whether usps ' e - commerce initiatives are being cross - subsidized by other postal products and services . usps managers contend that e - commerce products and services must cover their incremental costs . gao found that this goal has not been met and it is unclear when it might be achieved . without accurate , complete , and consistent financial information , usps can not assess its progress toward its financial performance goals for e - commerce . usps also lacks clear and comprehensive policies and procedures for reporting direct and indirect revenues and costs for e - commerce and other new products and services . as a result , reporting inconsistencies are likely to continue . in contrast , usps has reportedly developed privacy policies and practices for its e - commerce customers that exceed those required by federal law .
