in november 2007 , senator barack obama announced his intention , if elected president , to appoint a federal chief technology officer ( cto ) . he also identified several specific areas of responsibility of the cto including transparency of government operations , computer and network security ( sometimes referred to as cybersecurity ) , identification and adoption of best technologies and practices by federal agencies , and interoperability of emergency communications technologies for first responders . on april 18 , 2009 , president obama appointed virginia secretary of technology aneesh p. chopra to serve in the newly created position of federal chief technology officer . in announcing the appointment , the president indicated that mr. chopra would undertake roles beyond what might be considered traditional cto responsibilities . as the president described them , these roles include promoting technological innovation to help the united states create jobs , reduce health care costs , protect the homeland , and address other national goals . mr. chopra serves as assistant to the president and chief technology officer , as well as associate director for technology in the white house office of science and technology policy . under a provision of executive order 13500 , issued on february 5 , 2009 , he also serves as a member of the white house domestic policy council in his capacity as assistant to the president and cto . the cto may face a variety of challenges in executing the mission envisioned by the president . among the early challenges will be negotiating domains of responsibilities within the white house and with executive branch agencies that have overlapping missions . some commentators have expressed concerns about the impact the creation of a cto might have on existing offices and agencies with respect to the allocation and coordination of authorities and responsibilities . other commentators have asserted that a high - level cto could serve as an advocate for technological innovation and foster increased knowledge sharing among federal agencies to more effectively implement information technology solutions to meet disparate mission requirements . mr. chopra 's appointment as both cto and associate director for technology at ostp may address , in part , questions related to mission alignment , coordination , and integration . since assuming his dual roles , mr. chopra has publicly engaged in discussions covering a wide range of technology policy - related areas , including research and development , innovation , open government , government performance , education , science and engineering workforce , health care information technology , broadband , patent reform , and net neutrality . congress faces president obama 's appointment of mr. chopra and the president 's stated plans for the federal cto . there is currently no formal position description for the cto . accordingly , the official duties of the cto remain largely undefined . congress may elect to provide a statutory foundation for the cto , define the roles and authorities of the cto , authorize and appropriate funds , provide for oversight , and address other aspects of the position .
