a key element of dod military strategy since 2012 has been a rebalance of u.s. presence and capabilities toward the asia - pacific region , pacom 's area of responsibility . u.s. military personnel in this region rely on contracted services to provide support to military operations . pacom 's humanitarian and disaster - relief efforts in response to a may 2015 earthquake in nepal highlighted the importance of ocs in the asia - pacific region . gao was asked to assess pacom 's processes to plan for , manage , and oversee contractors that support military operations in the asia - pacific region . this report assesses the extent to which pacom has accounted for contractor personnel and has a process to vet foreign vendors ; has established an organizational structure to manage and oversee ocs ; and has integrated ocs into key planning documents . gao reviewed documents and data , interviewed relevant officials involved in ocs activities in the region , and analyzed ocs annexes to certain plans . u.s. pacific command ( pacom ) does not fully account for contractor personnel in a steady - state , or peacetime , environment and lacks a process to vet foreign vendors . department of defense ( dod ) guidance requires the accounting of certain contractor personnel during contingency operations , but is unclear for steady - state environments . pacom issued limited guidance in november 2016 to address accountability processes in contingency and steady - state environments , and pacom and some of its components use multiple mechanisms to account for contractor personnel , resulting in inconsistencies in the numbers of contractor personnel accounted for , which could present difficulties in an emergency or contingency operation . additionally , pacom lacks a foreign vendor vetting process due to a lack of dod guidance identifying what vendor vetting processes should be established at combatant commands . pacom has taken some action on vendor vetting , such as including vetting in exercises and screening some contractor personnel , but it lacks a process that includes details , such as under what circumstances a vetting cell should be established . dod guidance specifying under what circumstances a vetting cell should be established would better position pacom to avoid contracting with the enemy in high - threat areas . pacom established an interim operational contract support ( ocs ) organizational structure through a pilot program that ends in june 2017. pacom officials stated that , upon completion of the pilot , they intend to establish the structure as an enduring ocs capability within the command 's logistics directorate . the intent is to provide the combatant command , subordinate unified commands , and service components a central entity to integrate ocs across joint functions , such as directorates dealing with personnel or intelligence . however , service component officials stated that pacom 's ocs organizational structure might have been more effective if it engaged all joint staff functions , including directorates beyond logistics . dod , joint staff , and pacom guidance identify the important role that directorates beyond logistics should play as stakeholders in ocs . similarly , gao has previously reported on the challenges dod has faced integrating ocs in functional areas beyond logistics . by considering ways to expand its ocs organizational structure beyond the logistics directorate and better integrate the equities of other directorates , pacom could be better positioned to build on the progress made during the pilot program . pacom has integrated ocs into key planning documents , as required by guidance , by developing ocs annexes for 6 of its 11 operational , concept , and campaign plans . officials added that they will continue to update the remaining plans as planning cycles and resources allow . however , the annex appendixes generally lack key details , such as contractor management and support estimates . pacom officials told gao that such details are determined through requirements development at the service component commands , but challenges exist related to these issues due to unclear guidance . without guidance that clarifies the requirements - development process for ocs annexes , pacom will continue to lack important details that are needed to determine ocs requirements for operations . gao is making six recommendations , including that dod and pacom develop or update guidance related to contractor personnel accountability , vendor vetting , and ocs organizational structure ; and that pacom develop guidance that clarifies requirements development for plans . dod concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with four . gao continues to believe the recommendations are valid , as discussed in the report .
