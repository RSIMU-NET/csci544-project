this report provides overview and analysis of two recurring questions surrounding the federal government 's role in financing presidential nominating conventions . first , how much public funding supports presidential nominating conventions ? . second , what options exist for changing that amount if congress chooses to do so ? . in the 113th congress , the house passed legislation ( h.r . 2019 ) to eliminate nonsecurity funding . the committee on house administration reported two other related bills ( h.r . 94 ; h.r . 95 ) . other bills that would eliminate convention financing include h.r . 260 , h.r . 1724 , h.r . 2857 , and s. 118. another bill , h.r . 270 , would eliminate convention financing but revamp other parts of the presidential public financing program . the 112th congress also considered legislation to end convention funding . in the senate , an amendment ( containing text from s. 3257 ) to the 2012 agriculture reform , food and jobs act , s. 3240 , would have eliminated the convention funding portion of the presidential public financing program . separately , s. 194 proposed to eliminate the entire public financing program . another senate bill , s. 3312 , would reform the public financing program partially by eliminating convention funding . two measures that would have eliminated convention funding passed the house ( h.r . 359 and h.r . 3463 ) . both would have eliminated the entire public financing program . h.r . 5912 would have eliminated only convention financing . h.r . 414 would have revamped the public financing system but eliminated convention financing . these measures do not appear to affect separate security funding discussed in this report . the 112th congress enacted one law ( p.l . 112-55 ) in fy2012 that affected convention security funding with the appropriation of $ 100 million for the democratic and republican nominating conventions ( each was allocated $ 50 million ) . this security funding was not provided to party convention committees but to the state and local law enforcement entities assisting in securing the convention sites . the 2012 democratic and republican convention committees each received grants , financed with public funds , of approximately $ 18.2 million ( for a total of approximately $ 36.5 million , as rounded ) . a total of approximately $ 133.6 million in federal funds supported the 2008 democratic and republican conventions . such funding was provided through separate federal programs that support public financing of presidential campaigns and convention security . some members of congress and others have objected to federal convention funding and have argued that the events should be entirely self - supporting . others , however , contend that public funding is necessary to avoid real or apparent corruption in this aspect of the presidential nominating process . if congress decides to revisit convention financing , a variety of policy options discussed in this report might present alternatives to current funding arrangements . additional discussion of public financing of presidential campaigns appears in crs report rl34534 , public financing of presidential campaigns : overview and analysis , by [ author name scrubbed ] and crs report r41604 , proposals to eliminate public financing of presidential campaigns , by [ author name scrubbed ] . for additional information on national special security events , which include presidential nominating conventions , see crs report rs22754 , national special security events , by [ author name scrubbed ] . this report will not be updated . discussion of subsequent developments appears in another crs product that supersedes this report . for additional detail , see crs report r43976 , funding of presidential nominating conventions : an overview , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
