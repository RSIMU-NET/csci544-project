the concept that all americans should have affordable access to the telecommunications network , commonly called the `` universal service concept , '' can trace its origins back to the 1934 communications act . the preservation and advancement of universal service has remained a basic tenet of federal communications policy , and in the mid - 1980s the federal communications commission ( fcc ) established the lifeline program to provide support for low - income subscribers . the lifeline program , which is administered under the universal service fund ( usf ) low income program , was established by the fcc in 1984 to assist eligible low - income subscribers to cover the recurring monthly service charges incurred for telephone usage . although the program solely covers costs associated with the minutes of use , not the telephone , misinformation connecting the program to payment for a `` free phone '' has resulted in a significant number of constituent inquiries .
