on october 9 , 2006 , north korea announced it conducted a nuclear test . after several days of evaluation , u.s. authorities confirmed that the underground explosion was nuclear , but that the test produced a low yield of less than one kiloton . as the united nations security council met and approved a resolution condemning the tests and calling for punitive sanctions , north korea remained defiant , insisting that any increased pressure on the regime would be regarded as an act of war . china and south korea , the top aid providers to and trade partners with the north , supported the resolution itself , but have been unwilling to cut off other economic cooperation and aid considered crucial to the regime . the sanction regime depends heavily on individual states ' compliance with the guidelines . economists argue that the only definitively effective punishment on north korea would be the suspension of energy aid from china , which reportedly supplies about 70 % of north korea 's fuel . determining the motivations of a government as opaque and secretive as north korea is exceedingly difficult , but analysts have put forth a range of possibilities to explain why the pyongyang regime decided to test a nuclear weapon . possible motivations include an attempt to engage the united states in bilateral talks , to ensure the security of the regime , and to satisfy hard - line elements within the pyongyang government , as well as technical motivations for carrying out a nuclear test . the short - term implications of north korea 's nuclear test are clear : whether a technical success or failure , north korea 's willingness to carry out a test in the face of significant opposition indicates that it is willing to endure the potential consequences . analysts fear that the medium and long - term implications could include a more potent nuclear threat from pyongyang , a nuclear arms race in asia , and the transfer of nuclear weapons or material to states or groups hostile to the united states . there are also strong concerns about the impact on the global nonproliferation regime , particularly to other states poised to develop their own nuclear weapon programs . the most fundamental u.s. goals of the confrontation with north korea are to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to prevent an attack — either nuclear or conventional — on the united states or on its allies in the region . the options available to u.s. policymakers to pursue these goals include the acceptance of north korea as a nuclear power , bilateral or multilateral negotiations , heightened legal and economic pressure on north korea , adoption of a regime change policy through non - military means , military action or threats , and withdrawal from the conflict . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
