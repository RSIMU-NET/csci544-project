new drugs may not be introduced or marketed without the approval of the food and drug administration ( fda ) . when a person submits a drug application to the fda for approval , the application includes samples of the proposed labeling . the fda may refuse to approve an application if the drug is not safe or effective for the specific uses that are reflected in its labeling . an unapproved new use of a drug , also known as an off - label use , is a use not mentioned in the drug 's approved labeling . although a physician may prescribe a drug for off - label uses , a pharmaceutical manufacturer may not market or promote uses of a drug other than those on the label â€” those uses approved by the fda in the application . in january 2009 , the fda issued a guidance document on the dissemination of medical information regarding off - label uses of drugs . the guidance seemingly creates a safe harbor for dissemination of information on off - label uses of fda - approved drugs and medical devices . however , the agency 's guidance statement does not have the force or effect of law , and the fda still retains its legal authority under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) and fda regulations to determine when promotion of an unapproved new use has occurred or when a product is misbranded . additionally , the guidance does not affect the legal authority , enforcement powers , or other capabilities of outside entities that have been involved in prosecuting false claims act ( fca ) cases related to off - label marketing and the submission of false claims for reimbursement from the u.s. government . first , this report outlines the relevant provisions of the ffdca and related regulations that have been used to address misbranding violations of the act that relate to pharmaceutical manufacturers ' promotion of off - label use . second , the report summarizes the fda 's previous off - label marketing provisions under the fda modernization act of 1997 ( fdama ) , which are no longer in effect . third , the report details the january 2009 guidance document and its similarities to and differences from the fdama provisions . fourth , the report outlines first amendment challenges to fdama and older fda guidance documents addressing off - label promotion . fifth , the report discusses the nature of guidance documents , in contrast to rules promulgated under the administrative procedure act ( apa ) , as well as administrative law issues associated with the fda 's issuance of the guidance . sixth , the report provides an overview of the fca and related qui tam cases that addressed off - label marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies . finally , the report analyzes the interaction of the new guidance document and the fca .
