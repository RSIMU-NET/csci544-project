pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the army 's nonstockpile disposal program , focusing on : the army 's planning process for the nonstockpile disposal program ; the army 's estimated disposal cost and schedule ; and applicable lessons learned from the army 's stockpile disposal program . gao found that : the army has not finalized plans for its nonstockpile disposal program because it has not fully identified the amount of materiel to be destroyed or appropriate disposal methods ; the army believes it can dispose of binary chemical weapons within 10 years for $ 190 million , miscellaneous chemical warfare materiel within 5 years for $ 210 million , and recovered chemical weapons within 10 years for $ 110 million ; the army has limited information on buried chemical warfare materiel , which it estimates will take 40 years to find and destroy at a cost of $ 16.6 billion ; the army 's nonstockpile disposal program will likely be affected by the same issues as the stockpile program , including compliance with federal , state , and local laws and regulations , obtaining environmental approvals and permits , and strong public opposition to chemical weapons incineration and transportation ; although the army said it applied lessons learned from the stockpile disposal program to the nonstockpile disposal program , its 1993 survey and analysis report on the nonstockpile program did not discuss those lessons ; and the army 's estimated cost and schedule for the nonstockpile disposal program are likely to increase , since the army has limited experience in destroying nonstockpile materiel and will likely encounter difficulties similar to those experienced in the stockpile disposal program .
