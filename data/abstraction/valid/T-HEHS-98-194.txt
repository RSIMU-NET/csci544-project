pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the future health care role of the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , focusing on : how va 's system transformation is progressing and what challenges va faces as its role evolves ; and the relationship between va 's health care role and that of other public and private health benefits programs , including the effects changes in those programs could have on va health care . gao noted that : va has made progress in transforming its health care system to compete more effectively with health care providers in order to become veterans ' provider of choice ; these initiatives have enabled va to avoid over $ 1 billion in unnecessary expenses -- savings that have provided critical financing needed to further improve the system 's overall accessibility and quality of care ; in addition , the networks are planning to develop and implement additional efficiency initiatives over the next 5 years ; but va faces several challenges before completing its transformation ; of these , va 's decisions concerning existing infrastructure may be the most significant and contentious ; va continues to serve veterans in other locations , using aged and deteriorating buildings that will require billions of additional dollars to renovate or replace ; va 's decisions to consolidate inpatient medical care at fewer locations are complicated by such challenges as va 's longstanding relationships with universities ' medical schools for education and research , and with the department of defense for contingency medical support ; in gao 's view , va 's future success in fulfilling its health care role , as envisioned by recent eligibility reforms , depends in large part on its ability to transform its current delivery infrastructure into an integrated system of va and private - sector providers , which may be more attractive to new users , especially those already insured , who could provide va with an additional source of revenue ; va 's strategy also suggests that it will ultimately purchase much more health care from private - sector providers than it does now and deliver care using its existing infrastructure only in those geographic areas where a private - sector alternative is not reasonably available or where va is the acknowledged leader ; va 's success also will depend on its ability to overcome several management and implementation challenges ; if , as some have suggested , va 's competitive role is expanded to include not only the current veteran population but also veterans ' spouses and dependents , the challenges facing va will be even greater ; it is essential that va address these infrastructure and other management challenges ; if va is ultimately unable to overcome these challenges , it is conceivable that va could have to limit enrollment among lower - income veterans ; and this could include those with the greatest need , because they have no other health care alternatives .
