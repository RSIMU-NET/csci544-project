over the next several years , rental assistance contracts will expire for about 38,000 affordable housing units currently subsidized through three hud rental programs . owners of these units would no longer be required to maintain affordable rents or make their units available to low - income residents . residents in these units are eligible to receive special tenant - based vouchers called tenant - protection vouchers to shield them from resulting rent increases . hud 's rad program was created in 2011 to preserve affordable housing by , among other things , allowing owners to convert these tenant - protection vouchers to project - based vouchers for units in three designated hud programs . project - based vouchers result in a long - term contract between the property owners and phas , which administer the vouchers . the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2012 mandated that gao review these conversions under rad . this report describes the results of these conversions . gao reviewed hud program documentation and procedures ; analyzed data on conversions as of march 1 , 2014 ; and conducted interviews with hud officials as well as nongeneralizable interviews with four phas and five property owners selected based on geography and other factors . gao is not making recommendations in this report . conversions to project - based vouchers under the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) rental assistance demonstration ( rad ) program will have a small effect on the percentage of total vouchers ( made up of project and tenant - based ) that are project - based . residents with tenant - based vouchers can receive their assistance in any eligible privately owned rental unit , which means if they leave the unit , their assistance goes with them . in contrast , residents with project - based vouchers can only benefit from the assistance if they remain in the specific unit . as of march 1 , 2014 , property owners had converted a total of 6,670 units to project - based vouchers in nine states . the percentage of vouchers that are project - based including rad conversions was 3.81 percent , and without rad , would have been 3.45 percent . further , the impact of these conversions on the overall long - term percentage of project - based vouchers will be small because the conversions are limited to the remaining 38,000 units assisted through the three designated hud programs , which is relatively small compared to the over 2 million total outstanding vouchers . as the figure shows , most conversions have taken place in new york , massachusetts , michigan , and new jersey — four states with a large concentration of units that were originally subsidized under designated hud programs . stakeholders gao interviewed generally viewed the conversions to project - based vouchers as a useful tool in preserving affordable housing . stakeholders explained that , absent rad , property owners would have had few or no options for continuing some form of rental subsidy when their contracts expired . further , rad conversions provide a stable subsidy for their properties that allows them to better obtain financing . all five owners — representing nine properties gao contacted — have recapitalized or plan to recapitalize their properties , including refinancing or restructuring their debt , in order to rehabilitate them . housing organization officials and a housing expert also told gao that rad has helped to preserve the number of affordable housing units . pha officials , property owners , and residents told gao that these conversions have not adversely affected residents ' housing choices .
