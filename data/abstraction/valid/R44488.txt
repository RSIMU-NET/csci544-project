a commercial bank is an institution that obtains either a federal or state charter that allows it to accept federally insured deposits and pay interest to depositors . in addition , the charter allows banks to make residential and commercial mortgage loans ; to provide check cashing and clearing services ; to underwrite securities that include u.s. treasuries , municipal bonds , commercial paper , and fannie mae and freddie mac issuances ; and to conduct other activities as defined by statute , namely the national banking act . commercial banks are limited in what they can do . for example , the glass - steagall act separates commercial banking ( i.e . , activities that are permissible for depository institutions with a bank charter ) from investment banking ( i.e . , activities that are permissible for brokerage firms , which do not include taking deposits or providing loans ) . congressional interest in the financial conditions of depository banks , or the commercial banking industry , has increased in light of the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2009 , which resulted in a large increase in the number of distressed institutions . providing credit during the financial crisis was difficult for the banking system . thus , an analysis of post - financial crisis trends that pertain to lending activity may provide some useful insights about recovery of the banking system . the financial condition of the banking industry can be examined in terms of profitability , lending activity , and capitalization levels ( to buffer against the financial risks ) . this report focuses primarily on profitability and lending activity levels . issues related to higher bank capitalization requirements are discussed in crs report r42744 , u.s. implementation of the basel capital regulatory framework , by [ author name scrubbed ] . the banking system generally has substantially more small banks ( i.e . , those with $ 1 billion or less in assets ) relative to larger size banks . for several decades , bank assets have increased while the number of banking institutions has decreased . the banking industry continues consolidating , with more of the industry 's assets held by a smaller number of institutions . generally speaking , by most measures , the health of the banking system has improved since 2009. there are fewer problem banks since the peak in 2011 , as well as fewer bank failures in comparison to the peak amount of failures in 2010. the return on assets ( roa ) and return on equity ( roe ) for the banking industry , expressed as percentages , have rebounded since the financial crisis . although roa and roe have not returned to pre - recessionary levels , the range of percentages that should be associated with optimal performance of the banking system is subjective . the banking system currently has increased its capital reserves that have been designated to buffer against unforeseen macroeconomic and financial shocks . the banking system also has loan - loss reserves to sufficiently cover losses expected to be uncollectible . for loans that are noncurrent ( delinquent ) but have not yet gone into default , however , the banking system still needs to rebuild this loan - loss capacity if such loans do become uncollectible . hence , news of industry profitability should be tempered by the news that aggregate loan - loss provisions still must increase to sufficiently buffer against noncurrent loans .
