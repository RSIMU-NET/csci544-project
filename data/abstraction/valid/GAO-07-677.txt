since 2003 , the united states has provided several billion dollars in reconstruction funds to help rebuild iraq oil and electricity sectors , which are crucial to rebuilding iraq 's economy . for example , oil export revenues account for over half of iraq 's gross domestic product and over 90 percent of government revenues . the u.s. rebuilding program was predicated on three key assumptions : a permissive security environment , the ability to restore iraq 's essential services to prewar levels , and funding from iraq and international donors . this report addresses the funding made available to rebuild iraq 's oil and electricity sectors , the u.s. goals for these sectors and progress in achieving these goals , and the key challenges the u.s. government faces in these efforts . billions have been provided to rebuild iraq 's oil and electricity sectors , but iraq 's future needs are significant and sources of funding uncertain . from fiscal years 2003 through 2006 , the united states spent about $ 5.1 billion to rebuild the oil and electricity sectors . the united states also spent an additional $ 3.8 billion in iraqi funds on these sectors . however , iraq will need billions of additional dollars to rebuild these sectors . the iraqi government and donors represent important sources of potential funding . however , the oil and electricity ministries have encountered difficulties spending capital improvement budgets because of weaknesses in budgeting and procurement practices and major security challenges . moreover , iraq has not made full use of potential international contributions . it is also unclear what additional financial commitments , if any , will be provided to iraq 's oil and electricity sectors as part of a new international compact . despite 4 years of effort and the substantial resources expended , production in both sectors has consistently fallen below u.s. program goals . in addition , state 's estimate of iraq 's oil production levels may be overstated due to inadequate metering that does not allow precise measurement of crude oil production . the iraqi government projects that it will be able to meet the demand for electricity in 2009. however , these projections assume that the ministry of electricity will be assured of the stable supply of the fuel needed for electricity generation , which has been lacking due to poor coordination between the oil and electricity ministries . a variety of security , corruption , legal , and planning challenges have impeded u.s. and iraqi efforts to restore iraq 's oil and electricity sectors . the challenging security environment and insufficient protection efforts have continued to place workers and infrastructure at risk . corruption , smuggling , and other illicit activities result in revenue losses and low cost recovery . furthermore , the iraqi government has difficulty attracting foreign investment because , according to the world bank , it lacks an adequate legal framework , including comprehensive hydrocarbon legislation that would govern distribution of future oil revenues and granting of exploration rights . finally , although the oil and electricity sectors are mutually dependent , the iraqi government lacks integrated planning for these sectors , which has led to inefficient management of the country 's resources .
