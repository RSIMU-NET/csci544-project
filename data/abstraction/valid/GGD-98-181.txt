pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao provided information on the : optimum circumstances for the procurement of distinctive currency paper ; effectiveness of the bureau of engraving and printing 's ( bep ) efforts to encourage competition in the procurement of currency paper ; fairness and reasonableness of prices paid for currency paper by bep and the quality of the paper purchased ; and potential for disruption to the u.s. currency paper supply from bep 's reliance on a single source . gao noted that : the optimum circumstances for the procurement of distinctive currency paper would include an active , competitive market for such paper , where a number of responsible sources would compete for bep 's requirements ; however , these circumstances have not existed because of the unique market for currency paper and some statutory restrictions ; bep has been aware of the need to increase competition and has made some efforts recently to do so in areas under its control ; however , bep must procure currency paper within the current statutory framework , which limits currency paper contracts to 4 years , prohibits currency paper production outside of the united states , and prohibits purchase of currency paper from foreign - owned or controlled entities ; of the 20 paper manufacturers that responded to gao 's survey , 12 said they were interested in and have the capability now , or could be made capable in the near future , of supplying at least part of bep 's currency paper needs if existing statutory requirements and some of bep 's solicitation terms were changed ; 7 of the 12 are domestic paper manufacturers , and 5 are located in foreign countries ; although the long - term relationship between bep and crane & co. , inc. has historically resulted in quality currency paper , bep was unable to determine that it had obtained fair and reasonable prices for 13 of the 17 contract actions awarded from 1988 to 1997 ; bep sometimes accepted prices even though it was unable to determine that they were fair and reasonable because it had no other source for currency paper ; gao believes that bep 's assessments of the fairness and reasonableness of crane 's proposed prices were hampered by a number of factors , including the lack of market prices for currency paper and the limited analyses of proposed costs and prices it performed ; as the government 's agent for acquiring currency paper , bep is responsible for ensuring that the government 's supply of paper is not disrupted ; although the potential for disruption in the supply of currency paper exists , there have been no such disruptions ; however , for many years , because bep did not maintain a reserve inventory of paper to provide for contingencies , it was more vulnerable to adverse consequences if a disruption had occurred and was at a disadvantage in its contract negotiations because it lacked an alternative source for currency paper ; and bep has recently been purchasing paper to build a 3-month reserve supply and , under the conte amendment , could buy paper from a foreign source if no domestic source exists .
