pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) physical controls over receipts and taxpayer data . gao noted that : irs ' controls over receipts and taxpayer data do not adequately reduce the vulnerability of the federal government and taxpayers to loss from theft ; this condition existed because of the length of time required to conduct background investigations , delays in receiving results of fingerprint checks , and processing demands which required the hiring of thousands of employees during the peak filing season ; placing new hires in sensitive positions prior to , at a minimum , receiving the results of fingerprint check increases the vulnerability of receipts and taxpayer data to theft ; in fact , of the 80 thefts irs investigated at service centers from january 1995 to july 1997 , 12 were committed by individuals who had previous arrest records that were not identified prior to their employment ; gao also noted weaknesses in the physical controls over service center and district office receipts ; while service center receipts are required to be processed only by authorized individuals in the receipt and control branch , which is a restricted access area , numerous receipts were found in unrestricted areas accessible to other irs employees and to non - employees not authorized to handle receipts ; receipts particularly vulnerable to theft also were not adequately secured ; while it is important to adequately protect cash and checks received at irs facilities , it is similarly essential to ensure that these receipts are properly protected during transport to depository institutions ; gao found that single , unarmed couriers in ordinary civilian vehicles were used to transport irs deposits totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to the depository institutions during the peak filing season ; the theft of one peak season deposit could place a significant administrative burden on irs to contact taxpayers and initiate stop payment orders on tens of thousands of checks ; although receipts and taxpayer information will always be vulnerable to theft , irs has a responsibility to protect the government and taxpayers from such losses ; many of the actions gao is recommending to minimize these vulnerabilities and thus better protect taxpayer receipts and data would not result in significant costs , and several other actions gao is recommending are already required by irs policy or are currently under consideration by irs management ; and irs has prepared two corrective action plans to reduce its vulnerability to theft or loss of receipts and taxpayer data .
