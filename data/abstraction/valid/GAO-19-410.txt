royalties paid on the sale of oil and gas extracted from leased federal lands and waters are a significant source of revenue for the federal government . however , interior has faced challenges verifying the accuracy of royalty payments . in the 2000s , gao issued reports highlighting weaknesses in interior 's royalty compliance program . in 2011 , gao added interior 's management of federal oil and gas resources to its high - risk list , in part because its work showed interior did not have assurance that it was collecting its share of revenue from oil and gas produced on federal leases . interior has taken steps to operate more effectively . gao was asked to examine onrr 's federal oil and gas royalty compliance efforts . this report examines , among other objectives , the extent to which onrr reported meeting its compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 , the most recent data available . gao reviewed relevant laws , regulations , agency guidance , and interior 's annual performance plan and report and annual budget justifications for the period ; analyzed onrr compliance data for the period ; and interviewed onrr officials and state auditors who conducted work in coordination with onrr . the department of the interior 's ( interior ) office of natural resources revenue ( onrr ) reported that it met its annual performance goals for its royalty compliance program in 6 of the 8 years from fiscal years 2010 through 2017. under this program , onrr conducts three levels of compliance activities — audits , compliance reviews , and data mining — to help ensure that oil and gas royalty payments submitted by companies that produce oil and gas from federal leases are accurate and comply with federal laws and regulations ( see figure ) . specifically , gao 's analysis of interior 's annual budget justifications for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 found that onrr reported meeting its compliance goals for 6 of the 8 fiscal years . according to onrr officials , onrr did not report meeting its compliance goals for 2 years because of a shift in the agency 's goals that created a short - term misalignment of planned work and available resources . onrr 's fiscal year 2017 goals for its compliance program were to obtain a return of $ 2 of additional royalties for every dollar spent on compliance activities and to collect a defined amount of additional royalties . onrr 's compliance goals generally aligned with the agency 's requirement that resources should not be expended without an expected return . however , these goals may not align with the agency 's mission to collect , account for , and verify royalty payments and other statutory requirements because the goals do not address accuracy — or the extent to which its compliance work is covering , for example , royalty payments . by establishing a goal that addresses accuracy , for example , by covering a portion of royalty payments with its compliance activities , onrr could increase the extent to which it had reasonable assurance that its compliance program is fully accounting for federal oil and gas royalty payments . gao is making seven recommendations , including that onrr establish an accuracy goal that addresses coverage that aligns with its mission . interior concurred with gao 's recommendations .
