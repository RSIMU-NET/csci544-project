forfeiture has long been an effective law enforcement tool . congress and state legislatures have authorized its use for over 200 years . every year , it redirects property worth billions of dollars from criminal to lawful uses . forfeiture law has always been somewhat unique . by the close of the 20th century , however , legislative bodies , commentators , and the courts had begun to examine its eccentricities in greater detail because under some circumstances it could be not only harsh but unfair . the civil asset forfeiture reform act ( cafra ) , p.l . 106-185 , 114 stat . 202 ( 2000 ) , was a product of that reexamination . modern forfeiture follows one of two procedural routes . although crime triggers all forfeitures , they are classified as civil forfeitures or criminal forfeitures according to the nature of the procedure which ends in confiscation . civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding . the property is the defendant in the case . unless the statute provides otherwise , the innocence of the owner is irrelevant â€” it is enough that the property was involved in a violation to which forfeiture attaches . as a matter of expedience and judicial economy , congress often allows administrative forfeiture in uncontested civil confiscation cases . criminal forfeiture is an in personam proceeding , and confiscation is possible only upon the conviction of the owner of the property . the supreme court has held that authorities may seize moveable property without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing but that real property owners are entitled as a matter of due process to preseizure notice and a hearing . as a matter of due process , innocence may be irrelevant in the case of an individual who entrusts his or her property to someone who uses the property for criminal purposes . although some civil forfeitures may be considered punitive for purposes of the eighth amendment 's excessive fines clause , civil forfeitures do not implicate the fifth amendment 's double jeopardy clause unless they are so utterly punitive as to belie remedial classification . the statutes governing the disposal of forfeited property may authorize its destruction , its transfer for governmental purposes , or deposit of the property or of the proceeds from its sale in a special fund . intra - and intergovernmental transfers and the use of special funds are hallmarks of federal forfeiture . every year , federal agencies share among themselves the proceeds of jointly conducted forfeitures . they also transfer hundreds of millions of dollars and property to state , local , and foreign law enforcement officials as compensation for their contribution to joint enforcement efforts . this report is available in an abridged form , without citations , footnotes , or appendices , as crs report rs22005 , crime and forfeiture : in short , by [ author name scrubbed ] . for a discussion of selected proposed reforms , see crs report r43890 , asset forfeiture : selected legal issues and reforms , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
