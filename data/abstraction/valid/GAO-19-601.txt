the medicaid program is typically the payer of last resort . the bipartisan budget act of 2018 changed the medicaid third - party liability payment requirements for prenatal care services , pediatric preventive services , and services provided to cse beneficiaries . before the act , in the case of these three services , states were generally required to pay providers for services delivered to medicaid beneficiaries and then obtain any payments from liable third parties . the bipartisan budget act of 2018 also included a provision for gao to study the potential effects of these changes . in this report , gao describes the status of selected states ' implementation of medicaid third - party liability changes ; evaluates cms 's implementation and oversight of the medicaid third - party liability changes ; and describes stakeholders ' views of the possible effects of these changes on providers and beneficiaries . gao conducted interviews with state medicaid agencies and provider associations in nine selected states , which were selected by taking into consideration medicaid spending and stakeholder recommendations , among other factors . gao also conducted interviews with national experts in medicaid , national organizations representing beneficiaries and providers , and officials from cms . medicaid officials in the nine selected states gao reviewed described being in various stages of implementing third - party liability changes as required by law . these changes affect whether health care providers must seek payment from a liable third party , such as private insurance , before the state medicaid agency pays for services . the changes apply to prenatal care services , pediatric preventive services , and services for children subject to child support enforcement ( cse beneficiaries ) . at the time of gao 's review , officials from four of the nine selected states reported having fully implemented the changes for prenatal care services , which were required to be implemented starting in february 2018. officials from the remaining five states were discussing the changes internally , researching how to implement the changes in their medicaid payment systems , or waiting for additional guidance from the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the federal agency responsible for overseeing states ' medicaid programs . none of the nine states had implemented the changes to pediatric preventive services and services for cse beneficiaries , which must be implemented starting in october 2019. officials from six states told gao that they were in the early stages of exploring how they would make the changes , while the remaining three states had not developed such plans . gao found that guidance issued by cms in june 2018 to assist states in implementing the third - party liability changes contains information inconsistent with the law . for example , cms 's guidance incorrectly informs states that providers do not need to seek third - party payments before the state pays for some prenatal services . in addition , cms has not determined the extent to which states are meeting third - party liability requirements . cms officials stated that they expect states to comply with current law for medicaid third - party liability and that they do not verify whether states have implemented the required third - party liability changes unless the agency is made aware of non - compliance . however , this approach is inconsistent with cms 's medicaid oversight responsibilities , including its responsibility to ensure federal funds are appropriately spent . medicaid experts and other stakeholders told gao that the third - party liability changes could affect some health care providers in ways that could result in decreased beneficiary access to care , because some providers might be less willing to see medicaid patients . according to stakeholders , this could occur for two primary reasons . 1. the changes may increase administrative requirements for providers by requiring them to identify sources of coverage , obtain insurance information , and submit claims to third - party insurers before submitting them to medicaid . 2. the changes may result in providers waiting longer to receive medicaid payment for certain services to the extent that states require providers to seek third - party payments before paying the providers ' claims . gao is recommending that cms ensure that its guidance to states on third - party liability requirements reflects current law , and determine the extent to which state medicaid programs are meeting federal third - party liability requirements . the department of health and human services concurred with these recommendations .
