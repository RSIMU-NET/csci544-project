gao has designated the department of defense 's ( dod ) business systems modernization as a high - risk program because , among other things , it has been challenged in implementing key information technology ( it ) management controls on its thousands of business systems . the global combat support system - marine corps program is one such system . initiated in 2003 , the program is to modernize the marine corps logistics systems . the first increment is to cost about $ 442 million and be deployed in fiscal year 2010. gao was asked to determine whether the department of the navy is effectively implementing it management controls on this program . to accomplish this , gao analyzed the program 's implementation of several key it management disciplines , including economic justification , earned value management , risk management , and system quality measurement . dod has not effectively implemented key it management controls provided for in dod and related acquisition guidance on this program . if implemented effectively , these and other it management disciplines increase the likelihood that a given system investment will produce the right solution to fill a mission need and that this system solution will be acquired and deployed in a manner that maximizes the chances of delivering promised system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget . neither of these outcomes is being fully realized on this program , as evidenced by the fact that its first increment has already slipped more than 3 years and is expected to cost about $ 193 million more than envisioned . these slippages and cost overruns can be attributed in part to the management control weaknesses discussed in this report and summarized below . moreover , additional slippages and overruns are likely if these and other it management weaknesses are not addressed . investment in the system has not been economically justified on the basis of reliable estimates of both benefits and costs . specifically , while projected benefits were risk - adjusted to compensate for limited data and questionable assumptions , the cost side of the benefit / cost equation is not sufficiently reliable because it was not derived in accordance with key cost estimating practices . in particular , it was not based on historical data from similar programs and it did not account for schedule risks , both of which are needed for the estimate to be considered accurate and credible . earned value management that the program uses to measure progress has not been adequately implemented . specifically , the schedule baseline against which the program gauges progress is not based on key estimating practices provided for in federal guidance , such as assessing schedule risks and allocating schedule reserves to address these risks . as a result , program progress can not be adequately measured , and likely program completion dates can not be projected based on actual work performed . some significant program risks have not been adequately managed . while a well - defined risk management plan and supporting process have been put in place , the process has not always been followed . specifically , mitigation steps for significant risks either have not been implemented or proved ineffective , allowing the risks to become actual problems . the data needed to produce key indicators of system quality , such as trends in the volume of significant and unresolved problems and change requests , are not being collected . without such data , it is unclear whether the system is becoming more or less mature and stable . the reasons for these weaknesses range from limitations of dod guidance and tools , to not collecting relevant data . until they are addressed , dod is at risk of delivering a solution that does not cost - effectively support mission operations and falls short of cost , schedule , and capability expectations .
