pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the national credit union administration 's ( ncua ) progress in making sure that the automated information systems belonging to the thousands of credit unions it oversees have adequately mitigated the risks associated with the year 2000 date change . gao noted that : ncua has taken steps to address the year 2000 problem ; these involve incorporating the year 2000 issue into its examination and supervision program , disseminating information about the problem , and assessing year 2000 compliance on the part of data processing vendors ; concerns exist that must be resolved if the ncua is to achieve greater certainty that credit unions will meet their year 2000 deadline ; ncua still does not have a complete picture of where credit unions and their vendors stand in resolving the year 2000 problem , and current efforts to determine credit union compliance are behind the schedule established by gao and the office of management and budget ( omb ) ; while ncua sent questionnaires to credit unions and data processing vendors about the problem , it has not yet queried 20 percent of credit unions and has only received 29 of 87 vendor responses ; of the credit union and vendor responses received , ncua has not yet analyzed this information to identify high - risk credit unions and vendors ; further , the surveys did not specifically ask about the status of corrective efforts and whether interface issues were appropriately being addressed ; ncua has directed credit unions to conduct contingency planning and its staff have discussed what steps they should take should a credit union not be compliant by january 1 , 2000 ; however , the agency still lacks a formal contingency plan ; ncua must take prompt action to ensure that these discussions are formally documented so that it will be well - positioned to handle unforeseen problems ; as potentially damaging as the year 2000 problem is , ncua has not yet ensured that the issue is addressed by credit union auditors ; doing so would provide credit union management with a greater assurance and understanding about where their institution stands in addressing the problem ; ncua does not have enough staff qualified to conduct examination work in complex system areas ; at present , ncua is in the process of hiring an electronic data processing ( edp ) auditor and is requesting authority to hire 2 more ; and these personnel additions may not suffice given the tremendous workload and short time frame for getting it done .
