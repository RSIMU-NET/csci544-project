although the government spends more than $ 80 billion in information technology ( it ) annually , many of the investments have failed or have been troubled . in december 2014 , provisions commonly referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act ( fitara ) were enacted . among other things , fitara states that omb shall make available to the public a list of each major it investment including data on cost , schedule , and performance . omb does so via the federal it dashboard â€” its public website that reports on major it investments , including ratings from cios which should reflect the level of risk facing an investment . gao 's objectives were to describe agencies ' processes for determining cio risk ratings for major federal it investments primarily in development and assess the risk of federal it investments and analyze any differences with the investments ' cio risk ratings . to do so , gao selected major it investments with at least 80 percent of their fiscal year 2015 budget allocated to development ( resulting in 95 investments across 15 agencies ) and compared cio rating processes to omb guidance . gao also analyzed data on those investments to create its own risk assessments . agencies determined investments ' chief information officer ( cio ) ratings using a variety of processes , which included the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) six suggested factors ( including risk management , requirements management , and historical performance ) . specifically , all 17 selected agencies incorporated at least two of omb 's factors into their risk rating processes and 9 used all of the factors . however , agencies ' interpretations of these factors varied . for example , most agencies considered active risks , such as funding cuts or staffing changes , when rating investments , but others only evaluated compliance with the agency 's risk management processes . further , 13 agencies required monthly updates to cio ratings as does omb ( as of june 2015 ) , 1 agency scheduled its reviews based on risk , and 3 agencies required updates less often than on a monthly basis . gao 's assessments generally showed more risk than the associated cio ratings . in particular , of the 95 investments assessed , gao 's assessments matched the cio ratings 22 times , showed more risk 60 times , and showed less risk 13 times ( see graphic ) . forty of the 95 cio ratings were not updated during the month gao reviewed , which led to more differences between gao 's assessments and the cios ' ratings . this underscores the importance of frequent rating updates , which help to ensure that the information on the dashboard is timely and accurately reflects recent changes to investment status . three agencies ' rating processes span longer than 1 month . longer processes mean that cio ratings are based upon older data and may not reflect the current level of investment risk . seven agencies ' rating processes did not focus on active risks . according to omb 's guidance , cio ratings should reflect the cio 's assessment of the risk and the investment 's ability to accomplish its goals . cio ratings that do not incorporate active risks increase the chance that ratings overstate the likelihood of investment success . gao is making 25 recommendations to 15 agencies to improve the quality and frequency of cio ratings . twelve agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations and three agencies disagreed , stating their cio ratings were adequate . gao continues to believe these recommendations are valid .
