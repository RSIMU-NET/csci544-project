pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the provisions of s. 261 , focusing on : state experiences with biennial budgeting ; and provisions regarding gao , the budget enforcement act , and the government performance and results act ( gpra ) . gao noted that : in 1996 , when gao last looked at this data , 8 states had biennial legislative cycles and hence necessarily biennial budget cycles ; the 42 states with annual legislative cycles present a mixed picture in terms of budget cycles ; 27 describe their budget cycles as annual , 12 describe their budget cycles as biennial , and 3 describe their budget cycles as mixed ; perhaps significant is the fact that most states that describe their budget cycles as biennial or mixed are small and medium sized ; of the 10 largest states in terms of general fund expenditures , ohio is the only with an annual legislative cycle and a biennial budget ; a few preliminary observations can be made from looking at the explicit design of those states which describe their budget cycle as `` mixed '' and the practice of those which describe their budget cycle as `` biennial '' ; in general , budgeting for those items which are predictable is different than for those items subject to great volatility whether due to the economy or changes in federal policy ; existing provisions of law requiring gao to assist the congress are sufficiently broad to encompass requests such as those envisioned in section 8 of s. 261 ; the bill explicitly modifies the rules for the pay - as - you - go scorecard in the senate by specifying three time periods during which deficit neutrality is required : the biennium covered by the budget resolution ; the first 6 years covered by the budget resolution ; and the 4 fiscal years after those first six ; s. 261 makes a number of changes to gpra , most designed to make the requirements of gpra consistent with the proposed biennial budget cycle , but others which seek to make substantive revisions to gpra ; other changes in timelines proposed in s. 261 also appear consistent with gpra requirements ; s. 261 also proposes several substantive changes to gpra , including revised requirements for agency performance plans and new requirements for preliminary agency performance plans and governmentwide performance reports ; this bill proposes adding several new requirements to the annual agency performance plans currently required by gpra beyond changing them to a biennial cycle , including : adding an executive summary focusing on the most important goals of an agency , but limited to a maximum of 10 goals ; and requiring that the congress be consulted during the preparation of these plans ; and the bill also adds a new reporting requirement for draft performance plans .
