sovereign debt , also called public debt or government debt , refers to debt incurred by governments . since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 , public debt in advanced economies has increased substantially . a number of factors related to the financial crisis have fueled the increase , including fiscal stimulus packages , the nationalization of private - sector debt , and lower tax revenue . even if economic growth reverses some of these trends , such as by boosting tax receipts and reducing spending on government programs , aging populations in advanced economies are expected to strain government debt levels in coming years . high levels of debt in advanced economies arose as an issue for concern for some analysts following the global financial crisis , after decades of attention on debt levels in developing and emerging markets . four eurozone countries , greece , ireland , portugal , and cyprus , have turned to the international monetary fund ( imf ) and other european governments for financial assistance . some analysts and policymakers are also concerned about are also concerned about debt levels in other advanced economies . to date , many advanced - economy governments have embarked on fiscal austerity programs ( such as cutting spending and / or increasing taxes ) to address historically high levels of debt . this policy response has been criticized by some economists as possibly undermining a weak recovery from the global financial crisis . others argue that the austerity plans do not go far enough , and that more reforms are necessary to bring debt levels down , especially considering the aging populations in many countries . issues for congress is the united states headed for a eurozone - style debt crisis ? . some economists and members of congress fear that , given historically high levels of u.s. public debt , the united states is headed towards a debt crisis similar to those experienced by some eurozone countries . others argue that important differences between the united states and eurozone economies , such as growth rates , borrowing rates , and type of exchange rate ( floating or fixed ) , put the united states in a stronger position . the united states has a long historical record of debt repayment , and bond spreads indicate that investors currently view the united states as far less risky than greece , ireland , or portugal . impact on u.s. economy . the focus of most advanced economies on austerity programs to lower debt levels could slow growth in advanced economies and depress demand for u.s. exports . financial instability stemming from high debt levels could also impact u.s. markets and financial institutions . policy options for congress . congress is debating proposals to reduce federal debt levels in the united states . congress could urge the administration to coordinate fiscal policies multilaterally to avoid simultaneous austerity measures that undermine the economic recovery .
