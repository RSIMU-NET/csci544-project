the constitution divides the responsibility for populating the top positions in the executive branch of the federal government between the president and the senate . article ii , section 2 empowers the president to nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , to appoint the principal officers of the united states , as well as some subordinate officers . these positions are generally filled through the advice and consent process , which can be divided into three stages : first , the white house selects and clears a prospective appointee before sending a formal nomination to the senate . second , the senate determines whether to confirm a nomination . for most nominations , much of this process occurs at the committee level . third , the confirmed nominee is given a commission and sworn into office , after which he or she has full authority to carry out the duties of the office . the president may also be able to fill vacancies in advice and consent positions in the executive branch temporarily through other means . if circumstances permit and conditions are met , the president could choose to give a recess appointment to an individual . such an appointment would last until the end of the next session of the senate . alternatively , in some cases , the president may be able to designate an official to serve in a vacant position on a temporary basis under the federal vacancies reform act or under statutory authority specific to the position . congress has selectively included certain types of statutory provisions when establishing specific executive branch positions . these provisions include those that require appointees to have specified qualifications , that set fixed terms of office , that limit the circumstances under which the president can remove an officeholder , that specify how the chair of a collegial board or commission will be selected and may be removed , and that allow an incumbent to remain in office past the end of a term until a successor is appointed ( hold over ) . although these types of provisions may be found in the establishing statutes for a variety of positions , they are particularly common for members of regulatory and other collegial boards and commissions . in some cases , these types of provisions have influenced the dynamics of the senate confirmation process . they also may be factored into the selection and vetting process in the administration .
