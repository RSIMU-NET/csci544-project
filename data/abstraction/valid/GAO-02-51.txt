the department of energy ( doe ) manages the nation 's nuclear weapons production complex , cleans up the environmental legacy from the production of nuclear weapons , and conducts research and development into both energy and basic science . doe launched several reforms in the 1990s to realign its organizational structure , reduce its workforce , strengthen contracting procedures by competitive awards practices , streamline oversight of activities , and delegate some responsibilities to the private sector . despite these reforms , gao found that management weaknesses persist because doe 's reforms were piecemeal solutions whose effect has been muted by three impediments to fundamental improvement : the department 's diverse missions , dysfunctional organizational structure , and weak control of accountability . management weaknesses and performance problems will likely continue unless doe addresses these impediments in a comprehensive fashion .
