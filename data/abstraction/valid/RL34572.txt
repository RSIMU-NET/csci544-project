roughly a dozen chemicals known as phthalates are used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products , ranging from medical tubing to automotive dashboards to bath toys . these phthalates are not tightly held by the plastics and are released into the environment over time . congress is concerned about possible human health effects from exposure to six of these chemicals : di - ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) , dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , benzyl butyl phthalate ( bbp ) , diisononyl phthalate ( dinp ) , diisodecyl phthalate ( didp ) , and di - n - octyl phthalate ( dnop ) . dehp , dbp , bbp , and ( to less extent ) dinp are known to be toxic to the reproductive systems of rodents . recent rodent experiments demonstrate that pre - natal exposure at a sufficient level to these same phthalates disrupts the normal action of hormones and can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring ( especially males ) . disruption of hormonal functions in humans is known to result in abnormal reproductive development . many scientists believe that the phthalates toxic to rodents might be able to cause similar malformations in humans . however , human health effects of phthalate exposure have not been conclusively demonstrated . very few studies have looked at possible effects in humans , but their results appear consistent with the results of rodent experiments . more research would be needed to test this hypothesis . recent u.s. surveys have found almost universal human exposure to phthalates . individuals may be exposed to high enough levels of phthalates to cause reproductive abnormalities . scientists at the national toxicology program have expressed `` serious concern '' about human male infants undergoing intensive medical procedures , and `` concern '' about development of human males less than a year old who are exposed to dehp . in light of these concerns , the national academy of sciences is evaluating the risk of aggregate human exposure to multiple phthalates . federal agencies have taken several actions , some as early as the mid 1980s , to evaluate and regulate phthalates , but no consumer product to date has been banned outright . the agency responsible for regulating toys and most other child - care products is the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) . the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-314 , enacted august 14 , 2008 ) includes a provision intended to ensure protection of children from six phthalates by restricting their use in toys and child - care products . the scientific basis for concerns about human health risks appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates ( such as dehp ) , adequate with respect to others ( perhaps dinp ) , and weak for the remaining chemicals ( for example , didp and dnop ) . the strongest evidence with respect to developmental effects has been produced since about the year 2000. the new law codifies voluntary agreements previously reached by cpsc with product manufacturers , and should reduce exposure to one particular phthalate . new formulations for toys and child - care products may pose greater or fewer risks than current formulations .
