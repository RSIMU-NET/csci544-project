the sbir program provides grants and contracts to small businesses to develop and commercialize innovative technologies . the 2011 sbir reauthorization included a provision that gave agencies the option to allow majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in sbir . sba issued a rule to implement the statutory provision , which became effective in january 2013. the reauthorization act requires agencies to submit a written determination to sba and congress , explaining how such awards will , among other things , significantly contribute to the agency 's mission , before making sbir awards to majority - owned portfolio companies . the reauthorization mandated gao to review the impact of this provision every 3 years . this is the first report under the mandate , and it examines the impact of allowing majority - owned portfolio companies to participate in agency sbir programs and the extent to which agencies have elected to expand their sbir programs to include majority - owned portfolio companies . gao reviewed agency rules , policies , and other documents ; analyzed sbir data ; and interviewed program officials from sba and the 11 participating agencies , industry associations , and majority - owned portfolio companies . two of the 11 agencies participating in the small business administration 's ( sba ) small business innovation research ( sbir ) program — the department of health and human services ( hhs ) and the department of energy ( doe ) — opted to open part of their sbir programs to small businesses that are majority - owned by multiple venture capital or similar firms ( majority - owned portfolio companies ) , allowing such companies to apply for and receive sbir awards . specifically , hhs 's national institutes of health ( nih ) and the department of energy 's advanced research projects agency - energy ( arpa - e ) opted to allow such companies to participate . for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 , nih and arpa - e collectively received 20 applications from majority - owned portfolio companies and made 12 sbir awards to them , totaling about $ 7.9 million . sbir applications received and awards made to these companies comprise less than 1 percent of nih and arpa - e 's sbir applications and awards . nih and arpa - e officials said the change to allow majority - owned portfolio companies to apply for sbir awards helps ensure that their sbir programs receive the best research proposals . for various reasons , the remaining nine agencies participating in sbir have not submitted a written determination to allow them to make sbir awards to majority - owned portfolio companies . according to officials from these agencies , they did not conduct any formal analysis but considered various factors , such as whether the change would significantly increase the number of applications , what administrative resources would be required to implement the change , and whether they had the evidence needed to prepare a written determination . all but one of the agencies told gao that they may reevaluate their decision in the future , but did not have any specific plans for doing so . officials from several agencies said that they wanted to see how the change in eligibility affected nih and arpa - e before implementing the change at their agencies . gao also found that some agencies viewed the written determination as a potentially stringent requirement . for their written determinations , nih and arpa - e did not conduct any independent research on majority - owned portfolio companies ( nor were they specifically required to do so ) , but nih cited related research . in contrast , six agencies viewed the written determination as potentially requiring independent analysis . five agencies told gao that they did not have the evidence or research needed to support a written determination , and another agency said it might consider opting in if it were easier to do so . according to sba , the written determination is a notification letter that sba reviews but does not approve or deny . sba officials said they meet routinely with sbir program managers , and this issue has not been raised . sba updated its sbir policy directive to include the written determination requirement but essentially used the same language as the reauthorization act without providing any specific guidance . in sba 's rule implementing the reauthorization act , sba stated the rule 's potential benefit is to provide more businesses with access to the sbir program , which could increase competition and the quality of proposals and spur innovation . sba is not responsible for encouraging or discouraging agencies to expand eligibility to include such companies , but sba also has not discussed the issue with them . sba could be missing an opportunity to help agencies better understand the evidence required for the written determination , which could inform the agencies ' decisions whether to expand their program . gao recommends that sba discuss the written determination requirement with participating agencies and , if needed , provide additional guidance . sba generally agrees with the recommendation and plans to discuss the written determination requirement at a future program managers meeting .
