this report discusses and assesses the war powers resolution and its application since enactment in 1973 , providing detailed background on various cases in which it was used , as well as cases in which issues of its applicability were raised . in the post - cold war world , presidents have continued to commit u.s. armed forces into potential hostilities , sometimes without a specific authorization from congress . thus the war powers resolution and its purposes continue to be a potential subject of controversy . on june 7 , 1995 , the house defeated , by a vote of 217-201 , an amendment to repeal the central features of the war powers resolution that have been deemed unconstitutional by every president since the law 's enactment in 1973. in 1999 , after the president committed u.s. military forces to action in yugoslavia without congressional authorization , representative tom campbell used expedited procedures under the resolution to force a debate and votes on u.s. military action in yugoslavia , and later sought , unsuccessfully , through a federal court suit to enforce presidential compliance with the terms of the war powers resolution . the war powers resolution ( p.l . 93-148 ) was enacted over the veto of president nixon on november 7 , 1973 , to provide procedures for congress and the president to participate in decisions to send u.s. armed forces into hostilities . section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) requires the president to report to congress any introduction of u.s. forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities . when such a report is submitted , or is required to be submitted , section 5 ( b ) requires that the use of forces must be terminated within 60 to 90 days unless congress authorizes such use or extends the time period . section 3 requires that the `` president in every possible instance shall consult with congress before introducing '' u.s. armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities . from 1975 through march 2017 , presidents have submitted 168 reports as the result of the war powers resolution , but only one , the 1975 mayaguez seizure , cited section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) , which triggers the 60-day withdrawal requirement , and in this case the military action was completed and u.s. armed forces had disengaged from the area of conflict when the report was made . the reports submitted by the president since enactment of the war powers resolution cover a range of military activities , from embassy evacuations to full - scale combat military operations , such as the persian gulf conflict , and the 2003 war with iraq , the intervention in kosovo , and the anti - terrorism actions in afghanistan . in some instances , u.s. armed forces have been used in hostile situations without formal reports to congress under the war powers resolution . on one occasion , congress exercised its authority to determine that the requirements of section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) became operative on august 29 , 1983 , through passage of the multinational force in lebanon resolution ( p.l . 98-119 ) . in 1991 and 2002 , congress authorized , by law , the use of military force against iraq . in several instances none of the president , congress , or the courts has been willing to initiate the procedures of or enforce the directives in the war powers resolution . in the 115th congress , u.s. military operations related to the joint counter - houthi campaign conducted by the kingdom of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates ( uae ) in yemen spurred congressional legislative action in both houses of congress . the senate on december 13 , 2018 , voted to adopt s.j.res . 54 , a joint resolution to `` direct the removal of united states armed forces from hostilities in the republic of yemen that have not been authorized by congress , '' marking the first instance that such a joint resolution received consideration and passed the full senate under the expedited consideration provisions of section 1013 of the department of state authorization act , fiscal years 1984 and 1985 ( p.l . 98-164 ; 50 u.s.c . ยง1546a ) . in the 116th congress , the house of representatives on february 13 , 2019 , voted to adopt a similar joint resolution on u.s. military involvement in yemen , h.j.res . 37 , and the senate is expected to take up a companion measure , s.j.res . 7 , in march 2019 .
