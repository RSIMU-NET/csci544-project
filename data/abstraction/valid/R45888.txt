the purpose of barriers on the u.s. - mexico border has evolved over time . in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries , fencing at the border was more for demarcation , or discouraging livestock from wandering over the border , rather than deterring smugglers or illegal migration . physical barriers to deter migrants are a relatively new part of the border landscape , first being built in the 1990s in conjunction with counterdrug efforts . this phase of construction , extending into the 2000s , was largely driven by legislative initiatives . specific authorization for border barriers was provided in 1996 in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act ( iirira ) , and again in 2006 in the secure fence act . these authorities were superseded by legislation included in the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 , which rewrote key provisions of iirira and replaced most of the secure fence act . the result of these initiatives was construction of more than 650 miles of barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile border . the trump administration has driven the second phase of construction of border barriers . on january 25 , 2017 , the administration issued executive order 13767 , `` border security and immigration enforcement improvements . . section 2 ( a ) of the e.o . indicates that it is the policy of the executive branch to `` secure the southern border of the united states through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border , monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration , drug and human trafficking , and acts of terrorism . . the debate over funding for and construction of a `` border wall system '' in this phase has created congressional interest in the historical context of border barrier funding . there has not been an authoritative compilation of data on the level of federal investment in border barriers over time . this is in part due to the evolving structure of the appropriations for agencies charged with protecting the borderâaccount structures have shifted , initiatives have come and gone , and appropriations typically have not specified a precise level of funding for barriers as opposed to other technologies that secure the border . funding was not specifically designated for border barrier construction until fy2006 . the nearly $ 4.5 billion in appropriations provided by congress for border barrier planning and construction since the signing of the e.o . exceeds the amount provided for those purposes from fy2007 to fy2016 combined by almost $ 2 billion . most of the contracts that have been awarded thus far are for improvements to , or replacements of , the existing barriers at the border . however , a significant portion of the funds appropriated to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is available for construction of barriers where they do not currently exist . the administration took steps in fy2019 to secure funding beyond the levels approved by congress for border barriers . these included : transferring roughly $ 601 million from the treasury forfeiture fund to u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) ; using $ 2.5 billion in department of defense funds transferred to the department 's counterdrug programs to construct border barriers ; and reallocating up to $ 3.6 billion from other military construction projects using authorities under the declaration of a national emergency . this report provides an overview of the funding appropriated for border barriers , based on data from cbp and congressional documents , and a primer on the trump administration 's efforts to enhance the funding for border barriers , with a brief discussion of the legislative and historical context of construction of barriers at the u.s - mexico border . it concludes with a number of unanswered questions congress may wish to explore as this debate continues . an appendix tracks reported barrier construction mileage on the u.s. - mexico border by year .
