the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) mandates that gao report on an ongoing basis on ways to make the code more effective in resolving certain failed financial companies . this report examines advantages and disadvantages of certain proposals , based on those identified in gao 's first report , to revise the code for financial company bankruptcies -- specifically , proposals to change the role of financial regulators in the bankruptcy process ; affecting funding of financial company bankruptcies ; and to change the safe - harbor treatment of qfcs . for this report , gao held two expert roundtables in which participants evaluated the proposals using criteria for orderly and effective bankruptcies that gao developed in earlier reports . the criteria are minimizing systemic risk , avoiding asset fire sales , ensuring due process , maximizing value , and limiting taxpayer liability . gao identified these criteria by reviewing literature and interviewing government officials , industry representatives , and legal and academic experts . because the bankruptcy code ( code ) does not specifically address issues of systemic risk , experts have proposed giving financial regulators a greater role in financial company bankruptcies . however , according to experts at a gao roundtable , such proposals may have limited impact and raise certain implementation issues . for example , a proposal to require notification before bankruptcy depends on when ( number of days ) notification would be required and with whom ( which regulators ) . experts noted financial companies may not know that they will declare bankruptcy even a few days before the event and could have many regulators to notify . experts also noted ways regulators already can compel financial companies to declare bankruptcy , and that changing the code to allow regulators to place firms in bankruptcy involuntarily could temporarily place a firm in an uncertain legal status , eroding firms ' values and endangering market stability . other options , such as having regulatory standards forcing the firm into bankruptcy , could improve the likelihood of an orderly resolution , according to these experts . although the proposals reflect the need to minimize systemic effects of financial company bankruptcies , the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) -- charged with responding to threats to financial stability -- has not considered changes to the code . consideration could improve fsoc 's ability to address such threats in a timely and effective manner . experts emphasized that funding is needed to facilitate orderly and effective financial company bankruptcies . they generally agreed that prohibiting all federal funding or guarantees of private funding likely would lead to fire sales of assets . they agreed that fully secured funding should be used only to provide short - run liquidity and not for bailouts of insolvent firms ' creditors . experts suggested a private - sector fund could be created for this purpose . such funds could be collected voluntarily , through routine assessments ( before a bankruptcy ) , or through a facility similar to the one created for the orderly liquidation authority , which allows federal funding at the time of a bankruptcy and later recovery of funds through an industry assessment . experts noted some difficulties associated with these proposals , including determining whether a firm was insolvent or needed liquidity , and identifying permissible types of collateral . generally , experts did not agree on advantages or disadvantages of proposals to change the safe - harbor treatment of qualified financial contracts ( qfc ) . the code exempts qfcs , such as derivatives , from the automatic stay that generally prevents creditors from taking company assets in payment of debts before a case is resolved . it also exempts qfcs from provisions that allow bankruptcy judges to `` avoid '' contracts entered into within specified times before a filing . proposals to change qfc treatment -- subjecting all or some contracts to the automatic stay on a permanent or temporary basis and removing the avoidance exemptions -- might address issues raised by extensive contract terminations in the early days of financial company bankruptcies . experts said it was unclear what lessons should be learned from those experiences . many noted that narrowing the exemptions would reduce the size of derivative markets , but views varied about whether such narrowing would increase or decrease systemic risk . some experts said that the current safe harbors decrease systemic risk , while others said they increase it by making firms more dependent on less - reliable short - term financing . fsoc should consider the implications for u.s. financial stability of changing the role of regulators and the treatment of qfcs in financial company bankruptcies . fsoc agreed that a disorderly financial company bankruptcy could pose risks to financial stability , but stated that it would be premature for fsoc to consider proposals to change the code . gao reiterated that its recommendation was consistent with fsocÂ’s statutory role and responsibilities .
