president trump 's budget request for fy2020 includes approximately $ 134.1 billion for research and development ( r & d ) . several fy2019 appropriations bills had not been enacted at the time the president 's fy2020 budget was prepared ; therefore , the president 's budget included the fy2018 actual funding levels , 2019 annualized continuing resolution ( cr ) levels , and the fy2020 request levels . on february 15 , 2019 , congress enacted the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) . this act included each of the remaining appropriations acts , completing the fy2019 appropriations process . the act also rendered the cr levels identified in the budget no longer relevant , though for some agencies the exact amount of r & d funding in the act remained uncertain . the analysis of government - wide r & d funding in this report compares the president 's request for fy2020 to the fy2018 level . for agencies for which the fy2019 r & d funding levels are known , individual agency analyses in this report compare the fy2020 request to fy2019 enacted levels . for agencies for which the fy2019 r & d funding levels remain unknown , individual agency analyses in this report compare the fy2020 request to fy2018 actual levels ; when the fy2019 levels become available , these sections will be updated to compare the fy2020 request to fy2019 enacted amounts . as of the date of this report , the house had not completed action on any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for fy2020 ; nor had the senate . in fy2018 , omb adopted a change to the definition of development , applying a more narrow treatment it describes as `` experimental development . . this change was intended to harmonize the reporting of u.s. r & d funding data with the approach used by other nations . the new definition is used in this report . under the new definition of r & d ( applied to both fy2018 and fy2020 figures ) , president trump is requesting approximately $ 134.1 billion for r & d for fy2020 , a decrease of $ 1.7 billion ( 1.2 % ) from the fy2018 level . adjusted for inflation , the president 's fy2020 r & d request represents a decrease of 5.1 % below the fy2018 level . funding for r & d is concentrated in a few departments and agencies . in fy2018 , eight federal agencies received 96.3 % of total federal r & d funding , with the department of defense ( dod , 38.6 % ) and the department of health and human services ( hhs , 27.2 % ) combined accounting for nearly two - thirds of all federal r & d funding . the same eight agencies account for 97.2 % of the fy2020 request , with dod accounting for 44.3 % and hhs for 25.1 % under the president 's fy2020 budget request , most federal agencies would see their r & d funding decline . the primary exception is the department of defense . dod 's requested r & d funding for fy2020 is $ 7.1 billion ( 13.5 % ) above the fy2018 level . the departments of transportation and veterans affairs would see small increases in r & d funding . among the agencies with the largest proposed reductions in r & d funding in the fy2020 budget compared to the fy2018 actual levels are the department of energy ( $ 2.8 billion , 15.8 % ) , the national science foundation ( $ 567 million , 9.0 % ) , and national aeronautics and space administration ( $ 475 million , 4.0 % ) . the president 's fy2020 budget request would reduce funding for basic research by $ 1.5 billion ( 4.0 % ) , applied research by $ 4.3 billion ( 10.5 % ) , and facilities and equipment by $ 0.5 billion ( 12.8 % ) , while increasing funding for development by $ 4.5 billion ( 8.3 % ) . president trump 's fy2020 budget is largely silent on funding levels for multiagency r & d initiatives . however , some activities supporting these initiatives are discussed in agency budget justifications and are reported in the agency analyses in this report . the request represents the president 's r & d priorities . congress may opt to agree with none , part , or all of the request , and it may express different priorities through the appropriations process . in recent years , congress has completed the annual appropriations process after the start of the fiscal year . completing the process after the start of the fiscal year and the accompanying use of continuing resolutions can affect agencies ' execution of their r & d budgets , including the delay or cancellation of planned r & d activities and the acquisition of r & d - related equipment .
