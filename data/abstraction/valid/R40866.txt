on june 11 , 2009 , in response to the global spread of a new strain of influenza , the world health organization ( who ) raised the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6 , which indicates the start of an actual pandemic . this change reflects the spread of the new influenza a ( h1n1 ) virus , not its severity . although currently the pandemic is of moderate severity with the majority of patients experiencing mild symptoms and making a rapid and full recovery , this experience could change . the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and protects applicants and employees from discrimination based on disability . the application of the ada 's nondiscrimination mandates during an influenza pandemic is uncharted territory since the most recent previous influenza pandemic was in 1969 , before the 1990 enactment of the ada . currently , an individual infected with the h1n1 virus would most likely not be considered an individual with a disability ; however , if the h1n1 virus were to mutate to cause more severe illness , such an infection may be considered a disability . the ada prohibits employers from making certain disability - related inquiries and , currently , this prohibition might be interpreted to apply to inquiries about whether an employee would be in a high - risk group for pandemic influenza . the ada also requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities , and during a pandemic these accommodations would continue to be applicable unless they constitute an undue hardship .
