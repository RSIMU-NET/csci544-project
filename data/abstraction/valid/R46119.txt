cloud computing is a new name for an old concept : the delivery of computing services from a remote location , analogous to the way electricity , water , and other utilities are provided to most customers . cloud computing services are delivered through a network , usually the internet . utilities are also delivered through networks , whether the electric grid , water delivery systems , or other distribution infrastructure . in some ways , cloud computing is reminiscent of computing before the advent of the personal computer , where users shared the power of a central mainframe computer through video terminals or other devices . cloud computing , however , is much more powerful and flexible , and information technology advances may permit the approach to become ubiquitous . as cloud computing has developed , varied and sometimes nebulous descriptions of what it is and what it is not have been commonplace . such ambiguity can create uncertainties that may impede innovation and adoption . the national institute of standards and technology has developed standardized language describing cloud computing to help clear up that ambiguity : cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous , convenient , on - demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( e.g . , networks , servers , storage , applications , and services ) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction . this cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics , three service models , and four deployment models . since 2009 , the federal government has been shifting its data storage needs to cloud - based services and away from agency - owned , in - house data centers . this shift is intended to achieve two goals : reduce the total investment by the federal government in information technology ( it ) , which currently stands at about $ 90 billion each year , and realize other stated advantages of cloud adoption : efficiency , accessibility , collaboration , rapidity of innovation , reliability , and security . however , challenges remain as agencies shift to cloud services . according to a survey conducted in september 2018 , federal it managers expressed concerns about security in certain cloud environments , the complexity of migrating existing ( `` legacy '' ) applications to the cloud , a lack of skilled staff to manage certain cloud environments , and uncertain funding . planning for cloud adoption by federal agencies began with the 2010 publication of `` a 25-point implementation plan to reform federal it management . . more recently , in the 2017 `` report to the president on federal it modernization , '' the office of management and budget ( omb ) pledged to update the government 's legacy federal cloud computing strategy ( `` cloud first '' ) . fulfilling this requirement , the administration developed a new strategy , `` cloud smart , '' which was published on september 24 , 2018. the new strategy is founded on what the administration considers the three key pillars of successful cloud adoption : security , procurement , and workforce . in the 116 th congress , there has been one cloud - related bill introduced and two hearings directly related to cloud computing : the federal risk and authorization management program ( fedramp ) authorization act ( h.r . 3941 ) was introduced on july 24 , 2019 , by representative gerald connolly . the bill would formally establish within the general services administration a risk management , authorization , and continuous monitoring process consistent with the federal information security modernization act of 2014. . on july 17 , 2019 , the house committee on government reform subcommittee on government operations held a hearing , `` to the cloud ! . the cloudy role of fedramp in it modernization . . the purpose of the hearing was to examine the extent to which fedramp has reduced duplicative efforts , inconsistencies , and cost inefficiencies associated with the cloud security authorization process . on october 18 , 2019 , the committee on financial services task force on artificial intelligence ( ai ) held a hearing , `` ai and the evolution of cloud computing : evaluating how financial data is stored , protected , and maintained by cloud providers . . among other topics , the hearing explored how ai could be used to improve cloud management functions . additionally , there have been two hearings on the implementation status of the federal information technology acquisition reform act . these hearings provide an update on data center optimization , which is an indication of the extent of agency adoption of cloud computing .
