nuclear power reactors generate highly radioactive waste . to permanently store this waste , the department of energy ( doe ) has been working to submit a license application to the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) for a nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain about 100 miles from las vegas , nevada . although the project has been beset with delays , in part because of persistent problems with its quality assurance program , doe stated in july 2006 that it will submit a license application with nrc by june 30 , 2008. nrc states that a high - quality application needs to be complete , technically adequate , transparent by clearly justifying underlying assumptions , and traceable back to original source materials . gao examined doe 's development of its schedule for submitting a license application and the stakeholders with whom it consulted , nrc 's assessment of doe 's readiness to submit a high - quality application , and doe 's progress in addressing quality assurance recommendations and challenges identified in gao 's march 2006 report . gao reviewed doe 's management plan for creating the license application , reviewed correspondence and attended prelicensing meetings between doe and nrc , and interviewed doe managers and nrc on - site representatives for the yucca mountain project . in commenting on a draft of the report , both doe and nrc agreed with the report . the director of doe 's office of civilian radioactive waste management set the june 30 , 2008 , date for filing the license application with nrc in consultation with the doe and contractor managers for the yucca mountain project . doe officials told us that external stakeholders were not consulted because there was neither a legal requirement nor a compelling management reason to do so . according to the director , the june 2008 schedule is achievable because doe has already completed a large amount of work , including the completion of a draft license application in 2005 that doe decided not to submit to nrc . nrc officials believe it is likely that doe will submit a license application by june 30 , 2008 , but until nrc receives the application , officials will not speculate about whether it will be high quality . nrc has not seen a draft of the license application , and nrc 's long - standing practice is to maintain an objective and neutral position toward a future application until it is filed . to help ensure that doe understands its expectations , nrc has , among other things , held periodic prelicensing management and technical meetings with doe . doe has made progress in resolving the quality assurance recommendations and challenges identified in gao 's march 2006 report . for example , doe has replaced the one - page summary of performance indicators that gao had determined was ineffective with more frequent and rigorous project management meetings . doe has addressed the management challenges gao identified to varying degrees . for example , regarding management continuity , doe has worked to fill and retain personnel in key management positions , such as the director of quality assurance . however , for various reasons -- including the long history of recurring problems and likely project leadership changes in january 2009 when the current administration leaves office -- it is unclear whether doe 's actions will prevent these problems from recurring .
