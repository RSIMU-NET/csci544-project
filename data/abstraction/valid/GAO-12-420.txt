ssa administers two of the largest federal disability programs . gao designated federal disability programs as a high - risk area , in part because eligibility criteria had not been updated to reflect medical and technological advances and labor market changes . given the size and cost of its disability programs , ssa needs updated criteria to appropriately determine who qualifies for benefits . gao has been asked to assess ssas efforts to update its medical criteria and develop a new occupational information system , and to identify other steps taken to modernize disability determination criteria . to do this , gao reviewed relevant publications and federal laws and regulations ; assessed agency plans , cost estimates , schedules , and other documentation against established project management criteria ; and interviewed ssa officials , experts , and stakeholders . the social security administration ( ssa ) has taken steps that hold promise for improving the process for updating its medical criteria , but continues to face challenges ensuring timely updates . ssa now uses a two - tiered system for ongoing revisions to its medical listings . first , it completes a comprehensive review of all medical conditions listed within each of 14 body systems , making needed revisions . for subsequent updates for a body system , the agency uses a targeted approach , selecting for review and revision only those medical conditions most in need of change . to date , ssa has completed comprehensive revisions for 8 of the 14 body systems and now is reviewing conditions under them to determine where targeted revisions are appropriate . however , some of these targeted revisions have experienced delays . moreover , ssa has yet to complete comprehensive revisions for six body systems that have been ongoing for 19 to 33 years . ssa officials attributed delays to a lack of staff and expertise , along with the complexity and unpredictability of the regulatory process . ssa has embarked on an ambitious plan to design by 2016 an occupational information system for use in its disability decision - making process , but has fallen short of best practices for estimating costs , maintaining a schedule , and considering risks and alternatives . ssa currently relies on occupational information developed by the department of labor which has not had a major update since 1977. in 2008 , ssa initiated a project to develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) , which ssa expects will provide up - to - date information on the physical and mental demands of work to support its decision - making process . to guide the creation of its ois , ssa established an advisory panel , collaborated with outside experts and other agencies , and in july 2011 issued a research and development plan detailing relevant activities through 2016. ssa has made progress on some baseline activities in the plan . however , ssas cost estimate and schedule had key deficiencies , such as not including any estimate of the cost of producing , maintaining , and operating the system , which can inform design options . ssa also did not adequately consider inherent risks or potential alternatives , which could heighten the risk of additional costs or project failure . consistent with modern views of disability , ssa has taken some concrete steps toward greater consideration of an individuals ability to function with a disability but faces constraints in fully modernizing . ssa has incorporated some criteria into its medical listings to determine whether a claimants impairments result in functional limitations that can prohibit the ability to work . ssa is also sponsoring research through the national institutes of health to evaluate how functional abilities can further be considered in determining disability . one project aims to develop a computerized tool to assist adjudicators in evaluating how various impairments affect an individuals function and ability to work . however , ssa officials maintain that other modern concepts of disability can not be fully incorporated into ssas disability decisions . specifically , ssa faces constraints considering the extent to which assistive devices and workplace accommodations can mitigate work disability , because these are not universally available and ssa lacks the resources to conduct individualized assessments . gao recommends that ssa explicitly identify resources needed to achieve its 5-year time frame for updating its medical listings ; follow best practices in its cost estimate , schedule , and risk assessment for the occupational information system ; and conduct limited , focused studies on how to more fully consider assistive devices and workplace accommodations in its disability determinations . ssa agreed with the first two recommendations and disagreed with the third , stating that such studies would be inconsistent with congress intentions . gao continues to believe the recommendation has merit , as discussed more fully within the report .
