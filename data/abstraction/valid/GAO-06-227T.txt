people are critical to any agency transformation because they define an agency 's culture , develop its knowledge base , promote innovation , and are its most important asset . thus , strategic human capital management at the department of defense ( dod ) can help it marshal , manage , and maintain the people and skills needed to meet its critical mission . in november 2003 , congress provided dod with significant flexibility to design a modern human resources management system . on november 1 , 2005 , dod and the office of personnel management ( opm ) jointly released the final regulations on dod 's new human resources management system , known as the national security personnel system ( nsps ) . several months ago , with the release of the proposed regulations , gao observed that some parts of the human resources management system raised questions for dod , opm , and congress to consider in the areas of pay and performance management , adverse actions and appeals , and labor management relations . gao also identified multiple implementation challenges for dod once the final regulations for the new system were issued . this testimony provides gao 's overall observations on selected provisions of the final regulations . gao believes that dod 's final nsps regulations contain many of the basic principles that are consistent with proven approaches to strategic human capital management . for instance , the final regulations provide for a flexible , contemporary , market - based and performance - oriented compensation system -- such as pay bands and pay for performance ; giving greater priority to employee performance in its retention decisions in connection with workforce rightsizing and reductions - in - force ; and involvement of employee representatives throughout the implementation process , such as having opportunities to participate in developing the implementing issuances . however , future actions will determine whether such labor relations efforts will be meaningful and credible . despite these positive aspects of the regulations , gao has several areas of concern . first , dod has considerable work ahead to define the important details for implementing its system -- such as how employee performance expectations will be aligned with the department 's overall mission and goals and other measures of performance , and how dod would promote consistency and provide general oversight of the performance management system to ensure it is administered in a fair , credible , transparent manner . these and other critically important details must be defined in conjunction with applicable stakeholders . second , the regulations merely allow , rather than require , the use of core competencies that can help to provide consistency and clearly communicate to employees what is expected of them . third , although the regulations do provide for continuing collaboration with employee representatives , they do not identify a process for the continuing involvement of individual employees in the implementation of nsps . going forward , gao believes that dod would benefit from developing a comprehensive communications strategy , dod must ensure that it has the necessary institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of its new authorities , a chief management officer or similar position is essential to effectively provide sustained and committed leadership to the department 's overall business transformation effort , including nsps , and dod should develop procedures and methods to initiate implementation efforts relating to nsps . while gao strongly supports human capital reform in the federal government , how it is done , when it is done , and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful . dod 's regulations are especially critical and need to be implemented properly because of their potential implications for related governmentwide reform . in this regard , in our view , classification , compensation , critical hiring , and workforce restructuring reforms should be pursued on a governmentwide basis before and separate from any broad - based labor - management or due process reforms .
