the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) projects the u.s. season - average farm price ( safp ) received for all wheat in the 2007 / 08 marketing year ( june to may ) to be in the $ 6.45 to $ 6.85 per bushel range . the range midpoint exceeds the previous u.s. record of $ 4.55 ( in 1995 / 96 ) by 46 % . during the past 30 years , the all - wheat safp has stayed within a range of $ 2.42 to $ 4.55 , while averaging $ 3.33 per bushel . usda projects a replenishment of u.s. and global supplies in 2008 ( assuming normal weather conditions ) to moderate market prices in the latter half of 2008. however , prices are likely to exhibit substantial variability until global stock levels can be rebuilt . the initial impetus for rising prices over the past year has been a 30-year low in global stocks following seven out of eight years in which global consumption exceeded production . however , in recent months several other factorsâincluding reluctance of traditional exporters to make further supplies available to international markets , strong international demand , the rapid growth in the demand for grains and oilseeds as feedstock for biofuels production , and usda 's announcement that last fall 's winter - wheat plantings were less than expectedâhave contributed to a sharp rise in cash and futures contract prices , particularly for higher - protein wheat varieties . this report will be updated as events warrant .
