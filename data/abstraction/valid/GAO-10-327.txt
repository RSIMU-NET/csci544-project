many federal contractors establish offshore subsidiaries to take advantage of labor and market conditions . gao has found that they also use offshore subsidiaries to reduce their u.s. tax burdens . in 2008 , congress passed the heroes earnings assistance and relief tax ( heart ) act which resulted in contractor offshore subsidiaries paying certain payroll taxes for u.s. personnel working abroad . fiscal year 2009 's national defense authorization act required gao to report on the rationales , implications , and costs and benefits of defense contractors ' use of offshore subsidiaries . we assessed trends and purposes for contractors ' offshore subsidiaries ; identified how contractors use subsidiaries to support defense contracts ; assessed dod 's oversight of contractors ' use of offshore subsidiaries . to conduct our work , we reviewed data for the 29 u.s. publicly traded contractors with at least $ 1 billion in dod spending in fiscal year 2008 , reviewed several illustrative contracts selected based on categories of dod services most often performed overseas , reviewed audit documents , and interviewed dod officials about oversight . many of the top 29 u.s. publicly traded defense contractors -- those with $ 1 billion or more in dod contracts in fiscal year 2008- - have created offshore subsidiaries to facilitate global operations . between fiscal years 2003 and 2008 , they increased their use of these subsidiaries by 26 percent , maintaining at least 1,194 in 2008. we interviewed 13 of the 29 contractors based on a range of the amount of government work , locations of subsidiaries , and industry types ; they reported that 97 percent of the subsidiaries generally supported global commercial and foreign government clients , while the remaining 3 percent supported dod contracts performed overseas . these subsidiaries also helped the 29 contractors reduce taxes , with about one - third decreasing their effective u.s. corporate tax rates in 2008 in part through the use of foreign affiliates , lower foreign tax rates , and indefinite reinvestment of foreign income outside of the united states . for five of the dod contracts we reviewed , companies principally used offshore subsidiaries to hire u.s. workers providing services overseas on u.s. government contracts in order to avoid social security , medicare -- known as federal insurance contributions act ( fica ) -- and other payroll taxes . this practice allowed contractors to offer lower bids when competing for certain services and thereby reduce costs for dod . our analysis of two contracts showed that the use of offshore subsidiaries saved dod at least $ 110 million annually prior to the heart act , through payroll tax avoidance . while this practice provided contract cost savings for dod , it resulted in these companies avoiding payroll taxes that would have contributed to the social security and medicare trust funds . the 2008 heart act resulted in offshore subsidiaries of u.s. companies paying fica taxes for u.s. workers performing services overseas on u.s. government contracts . as a result , in fiscal year 2009 , four of the case study contractors using offshore subsidiaries to support dod work requested reimbursement from dod of at least $ 140 million for new fica payments . federal and state unemployment payroll taxes , however , were not covered by the heart act , and several contractors that used offshore subsidiaries have continued to avoid these taxes . in one state , we reviewed documentation for about 140 former employees of several contractors who were denied unemployment benefits in 2009. state workforce officials indicated these benefits were denied because the employees worked for a foreign subsidiary and not an american employer . dod officials were aware of the roles offshore subsidiaries played in the dod contracts we reviewed and stated that oversight mechanisms , such as the defense contract audit agency 's reviews of incurred costs and oversight documents , inform them of the activities of offshore subsidiaries . in contracts we reviewed , evidence of offshore subsidiaries was present in contractor labor rates , cost accounting disclosures , and contractor price proposals . contracting officials stated that the use of offshore subsidiaries did not negatively impact contract schedule or performance .
