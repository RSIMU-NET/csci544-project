va provides health care benefits to children diagnosed with spina bifida — a birth defect that can cause physical and neurological issues — born to vietnam and certain other veterans . legislation requires the provision of certain health care benefits — including home care , hospital care , outpatient care , and case management — for spina bifida beneficiaries . vha administers the spina bifida health care program for enrolled beneficiaries by processing and paying claims for covered services from private sector providers . gao was asked to evaluate vha 's administration of spina bifida health care benefits . in this report , gao examined for the spina bifida program : the extent to which vha conducts outreach about available benefits , what is known about health care claims that have been processed , and what , if any , oversight , vha conducts of the claims process . gao reviewed the spina bifida program handbook and claims audit reports , analyzed data on submitted , paid , and denied claims from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 , and interviewed vha officials and representatives from key stakeholder organizations . the department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) veterans health administration ( vha ) provides information and updates on covered health care services to beneficiaries enrolled in its spina bifida program , but has conducted limited outreach with key stakeholder organizations . vha provides information on health care benefits to enrolled beneficiaries through the program website , for example . however , vha has conducted limited outreach with key stakeholder organizations — such as the spina bifida association — that have relationships with individuals who are potentially eligible for the spina bifida program and its benefits but are not enrolled . representatives of these organizations told gao this has contributed to lack of awareness of eligibility and available benefits . without this outreach , vha may miss important opportunities to help potentially eligible individuals obtain health care benefits to which they may be entitled . for the spina bifida program , both total claims payments , as well as the total number of claims paid , increased by more than 40 percent from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. vha officials attributed the increase to a 2008 legislative expansion of health care coverage under the program , and growing health care costs for beneficiaries as they age . during this 5-year period , paid claims represented about 90 percent of all claims submitted each fiscal year . vha primarily uses claims audits to oversee its spina bifida claims process . auditors review a sample of claims and prepare a report with the audit 's findings and any necessary follow - up activities . however , vha does not have written guidance on how staff are to document the status of these follow - up activities to ensure their completion . without such written guidance , vha can not be assured that these activities have been successfully completed or that any recommendations outlined in audit reports have been appropriately implemented . gao recommends that va conduct outreach with key stakeholder groups regarding the spina bifida program and its benefits , and develop written guidance for completing and documenting the status of follow - up activities related to claims audits . va concurred with gao 's recommendations .
