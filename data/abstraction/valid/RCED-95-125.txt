pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined the operations of levees involved in the 1993 midwest flood , focusing on : whether the army corps of engineers ' flood control levees prevented flooding and reduced damage or increased the flooding and added to the damage ; and the governments exercise control over the design , construction , placement , and maintenance of nonfederal levees . gao found that : 157 of the 193 army corps of engineers levees found in the areas affected by the 1993 flood prevented rivers from flooding and $ 7.4 billion in damages ; 32 of the corps levees withstood floodwaters until the water rose above the levees and overtopped them ; 4 of the corps levees allowed water into protected areas before their design capacity was exceeded ; the corps estimated that the breaching of these levees caused about $ 450 million in damages ; although levees allow floodwater to rise higher than it normally would because they confine a flood to a portion of a floodplain , the corps believe that its levees have the net effect of reducing flooding ; no federal programs specifically regulate the design , placement , construction , or maintenance of nonfederal levees , however , flood insurance and disaster assistance programs may exercise control over certain levees ; and 17 states and various local governments have programs to regulate levees , many of which are in response to the requirements of the national flood insurance program .
