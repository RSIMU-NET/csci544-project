for more than a decade , gao has identified the national aeronautics and space administration 's ( nasa ) contract management as a high - risk area -- in part because of nasa 's inability to collect , maintain , and report the full cost of its programs and projects . lacking this information , nasa has been challenged to manage its programs and control program costs . the scientific and technical expectations inherent in nasa 's mission create even greater challenges -- especially if meeting those expectations requires nasa to reallocate funding from existing programs to support proposed new efforts . because cost growth has been a persistent problem in a number of nasa programs , gao was asked to examine nasa 's cost estimating for selected programs , assess nasa 's cost - estimating processes and methodologies , and describe any barriers to improving nasa 's cost - estimating processes . to conduct gao 's work , gao analyzed a total of 27 nasa programs -- 10 of which gao reviewed in detail . considerable change in nasa 's program cost estimates -- both increases and decreases -- indicates that nasa lacks a clear understanding of how much its programs will cost and how long they will take to achieve their objectives . for example , the development cost estimates for more than half of the 27 programs that gao reviewed have increased and for some programs this increase was significant -- as much as 94 percent . cost estimates changed for each of 10 programs that gao reviewed in detail . for 8 of the 10 programs , the estimates increased . although nasa cited specific reasons for the changes , such as technical problems and funding shortages , the variability in the cost estimates indicates that the programs lacked the sufficient knowledge needed to establish priorities , quantify risks , and make informed investment decisions , and thus predict costs . most notably , nasa 's basic cost - estimating processes -- an important tool for managing programs -- lack the discipline needed to ensure that program estimates are reasonable . specifically , gao found that none of the 10 nasa programs that gao reviewed in detail met all of gao 's cost - estimating criteria , which are based on criteria developed by carnegie mellon university 's software engineering institute . moreover , none of the 10 programs fully met certain key criteria -- including clearly defining the program 's life cycle to establish program commitment and manage program costs , as required by nasa . in addition , only three programs provided a breakdown of the work to be performed . without this knowledge , the programs ' estimated costs could be understated and thereby subject to underfunding and cost overruns , putting programs at risk of being reduced in scope or requiring additional funding to meet their objectives . finally , only two programs have a process in place for measuring cost and performance to identify risks . nasa has limited ability to collect the program cost and schedule data needed to meet basic cost - estimating criteria . for example , as gao has previously reported , nasa does not have a system to capture reliable financial and performance data -- key to using effectively the cost - estimating tools that nasa officials state that programs employ . further , without adequate financial and nonfinancial data , programs can not easily track an acquisition 's progress and assess whether the program can meet its cost and schedule goals before it incurs significant cost and schedule overruns . nasa identified other barriers , including limited cost - estimating staff . according to nasa officials , several initiatives are under way to remove such obstacles and improve the agency 's cost - estimating practices .
