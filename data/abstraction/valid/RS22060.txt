an aquatic resources trust fund , with two accounts — a sport fish restoration account and a boat safety account — was created in 1984 and subsequently amended to support a variety of programs administered by three federal agencies , including wetlands management , recreational vessel docking and sewage disposal infrastructure , and aquatic resource education . in 2005 , the boat safety account was terminated and remaining programs were consolidated into a renamed sport fish restoration and boating trust fund . this report details sources of funding for this trust fund and summarizes the various programs and activities receiving funding . the five sources of income to the sport fish restoration and boating trust fund are ( 1 ) the portion of federal fuel taxes attributable to motorboat fuel from the highway trust fund ; ( 2 ) annual tax receipts attributable to small engine fuel used for outdoor power equipment from the highway trust fund ; ( 3 ) annual receipts from a manufacturers ' excise tax on sport fishing equipment ; ( 4 ) annual receipts from import duties on fishing tackle and on yachts and pleasure craft ; and ( 5 ) interest on funds invested prior to disbursal . total fy2012 income from these five sources is estimated to be about $ 760 million . the eight efforts funded from the sport fish restoration and boating trust fund are ( 1 ) three coastal wetlands conservation and restoration programs ; ( 2 ) recreational boating safety ; ( 3 ) construction of sewage pump - out and dump stations for recreational vessel sewage disposal ; ( 4 ) construction of docking facilities for large transient recreational vessels ; ( 5 ) national aquatic resource outreach and communications ; ( 6 ) multi - state conservation grants ; ( 7 ) interstate fishery commissions and the sport fishing and boating partnership council ; and ( 8 ) state grants for sport fish restoration projects . some proposals under discussion by congress for reauthorizing federal surface transportation programs include an increase ( possibly more than doubling ) of the 18.4 cents - per - gallon federal fuel tax to better fund highway infrastructure programs through the highway trust fund . ( authorization of appropriations for federal surface transportation programs would have terminated at the end of fy2009 , but has received several short - term extensions , most recently by provisions in p.l . 112-102 , which extended the authorizations through june 30 , 2012 . ) . the 112th congress may decide whether the sport fish restoration and boating trust fund receives substantial benefits ( possibly exceeding an additional $ 350 million annually ) if the federal fuel tax is increased . a corollary set of questions focuses on whether , and if so how , the various programs supported by the sport fish restoration and boating trust fund might be modified to expend increased receipts , should a federal fuel tax increase be enacted .
