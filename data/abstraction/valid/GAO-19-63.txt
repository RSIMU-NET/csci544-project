the federal government spends tens of billions of dollars each year on it products and services . competition is a key component to achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers . federal acquisition regulations allow for noncompetitive contracts in certain circumstances . some noncompetitive contracts act as “ bridge contracts ” — which can be a useful tool to avoid a lapse in service but can also increase the risk of the government overpaying . there is currently no government - wide definition of bridge contracts . gao was asked to review the federal government 's use of noncompetitive contracts for it . this report examines the extent that agencies used noncompetitive contracts for it , the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts for selected it procurements , the extent to which it procurements at selected agencies were bridge contracts , and the extent to which it procurements were in support of legacy systems . gao analyzed fpds - ng data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 ( the most recent and complete data available ) . gao developed a generalizable sample of 171 fiscal year 2016 noncompetitive it contracts and orders awarded by dod , dhs , and hhs — the agencies with the most spending on it , to determine the reasons for using noncompetitive contracts and orders , and the extent to which these were bridge contracts or supported legacy systems . from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 , federal agencies reported obligating more than $ 15 billion per year , or about 30 percent , of information technology ( it ) contract spending on a noncompetitive basis ( see figure ) . gao found , however , that departments of defense ( dod ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) contracting officials misreported competition data in the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) for 22 of the 41 orders gao reviewed . gao 's findings call into question competition data associated with nearly $ 3 billion in annual obligations for it - related orders . dhs identified underlying issues resulting in the errors for its orders and took corrective action . dod and hhs , however , had limited insight into why the errors occurred . without identifying the issues contributing to the errors , dod and hhs are unable to take action to ensure that competition data are accurately recorded in the future , and are at risk of using inaccurate information to assess whether they are achieving their competition objectives . gao found that dod , dhs , and hhs primarily cited two reasons for awarding a noncompetitive contract or order : only one source could meet the need ( for example , the contractor owned proprietary technical or data rights ) or the agency awarded the contract to a small business to help meet agency goals . gao estimates that about 8 percent of 2016 noncompetitive it contracts and orders at dod , dhs , and hhs were bridge contracts , awarded in part because of acquisition planning challenges . gao previously recommended that the office of federal procurement policy define bridge contracts and provide guidance on their use , but it has not yet done so . gao believes that addressing this recommendation will help agencies better manage their use of bridge contracts . additionally , gao estimates that about 7 percent of noncompetitive it contracts and orders were used to support outdated or obsolete legacy it systems . officials from the agencies gao reviewed stated these systems are needed for their mission or that they are in the process of modernizing the legacy systems or buying new systems . gao recommended dod and hhs identify the reasons why competition data for certain orders in fpds - ng were misreported and take corrective action . dod and hhs concurred .
