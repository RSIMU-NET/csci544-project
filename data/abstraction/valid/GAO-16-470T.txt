emerging infectious diseases constitute a clear and persistent threat to the health and well - being of people and animals around the world . the zika virus , which at present appears to be primarily transmitted to humans by infected mosquitos , can cause symptoms including fever , rash , and joint pain . a large ongoing outbreak is occurring in brazil that started in may 2015. as of february 24 , 2016 , over 100 cases of u.s. travel - associated zika virus disease cases have been reported . due to concerns about its potential impact , you asked gao to present preliminary observations on the zika virus . this statement addresses the epidemiology and transmission of the zika virus disease , including reporting on the incidence of disease and what is known about its link to microcephaly ; detection and testing methods ; methods for mosquito control ; and the proposed federal research agenda as it relates to the zika virus and zika virus disease . to report on these questions , gao reviewed relevant peer - reviewed scientific literature , epidemiological alerts , agency documents , and prior gao work from 2003-2016 on related topics ; consulted experts in the fields of virology , infectious diseases , and vector control , including industry representatives ; and interviewed officials of the cdc and nih . while several countries have reported outbreaks of zika virus disease — which appear to be primarily transmitted to humans by mosquitos — unanswered questions remain regarding the epidemiology and transmission of the disease . many factors — including a large number of asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms , and a lack of a consistent international case definition of zika virus disease — complicate understanding of the virus and may hinder responses to the current outbreak . for example , an estimated 80 percent of individuals infected with the zika virus may not manifest clinical symptoms . as a result , incidence of the infection may be underestimated . questions also remain regarding the strength of the association between zika virus infection and two other conditions : microcephaly and guillain - barré syndrome . a lack of validated diagnostic tests , consistent international case definitions , and trend information may also contribute to difficulty in estimating the prevalence of the virus . the united states uses two diagnostic tests for zika , and according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , while there are no commercially - available diagnostic tests for zika , an antibody - based test for zika virus was recently authorized for emergency use by the u.s. food and drug administration . diagnosing zika virus infection is also complicated because it is difficult to differentiate it from other similar diseases , such as dengue or yellow fever . for example , a person previously infected with dengue could be falsely identified as also having been exposed to the zika virus ( and vice - versa ) . moreover , the world health organization has acknowledged the need for a consistent case definition — that is , a set of uniform criteria to define the disease for public health surveillance and to determine who is included in the count and who is excluded . additionally , a lack of pattern and trend data has made surveillance challenging . because zika virus disease can not yet be prevented by drugs or vaccines , vector ( mosquito ) control remains a critical factor in preventing and mitigating the occurrence of this disease . there are three methods for mosquito control : standing water treatment , insecticides , and emerging technologies . mosquito control has been achieved in some locations by methods such as reducing or chemically - treating water sources where mosquitoes breed or mature , or by insecticide dispersal . emerging technologies , including biological control methods — such as infecting mosquitoes with bacteria — genetically - modified mosquitoes , and auto - dissemination traps , show some promise but are still in development and testing phases . the national institutes of health ( nih ) and the cdc have identified several high priority areas of research . research priorities include basic research to understand viral replication , pathogenesis , and transmission , as well as the biology of the mosquito vectors ; potential interactions with co - infections such as dengue and yellow fever viruses ; linkages between zika and the birth defect microcephaly ; improving diagnostic tests ; vaccine development ; and novel vector control methods . these efforts are ambitious , and agencies may face challenges in implementing this agenda . gao is not making recommendations at this time .
