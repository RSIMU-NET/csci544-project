gao discussed social security disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) program weaknesses that impede the social security administration ( ssa ) from requiring beneficiaries to work . gao noted that : between 1985 and 1994 , the combined di and ssi beneficiary population increased 70 percent and the cost of cash benefits grew 66 percent ; these increases were due to eligibility expansion , program outreach , fewer continuing disability reviews , economic factors , and demographic changes ; the beneficiary population is growing younger , and more beneficiaries have long - term impairments ; the development of effective return - to - work strategies for people with severe disabilities is challenging because individuals require various levels of support , remedial training , and education ; technological and medical advances and economic and social changes have created more potential for some individuals with disabilities to return to work ; the ssi and di benefit structure further complicates disability and work capability determinations ; and although ssi and di programs offer such work incentives as trial work periods , extended eligibility , earned income exclusion , work expense subsidies , continued health insurance coverage , and reentitlement , they are not appropriately designed or implemented to motivate beneficiaries to return to work .
