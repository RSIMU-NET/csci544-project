pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the organization and costs of the selective service system ( sss ) draft registration program and estimates of the comparative costs and organizational structure changes of two selected alternatives : a suspended registration alternative , under which most of sss ' infrastructure would remain intact , including a significant portion of its staff and all of its local , district appeal , civilian review , and national boards ; and a deep standby alternative , which would suspend registration , reduce a substantial portion of the workforce , and disband the local , district appeal , civilian review , and national boards . gao noted that : most of sss ' potential cost reductions , under either a suspended registration or a deep standby alternative , would result from reductions in personnel ; sss estimates that the suspended registration alternative would reduce authorized and assigned civilian , active military , and part - time military reserve personnel by about 33 percent ; these reductions would produce first - year cost savings of $ 4.1 million and subsequent annual cost savings of $ 5.7 million ; sss estimates that the deep standby alternative would reduce authorized civilian , active military , and part - time reserve personnel by about 60 percent ; the latter alternative reflects a dismissal of thousands of trained , unpaid local , review , and appeal board volunteers ; under the deep standby alternative , the part - time state directors , who according to sss officials are paid for an average of 14 days of work per year , would not be paid ; altogether , these reductions would produce first - year cost savings of $ 8.5 million and subsequent annual cost savings of $ 11.3 million ; under both alternatives , mass registrations would be needed if a mobilization were authorized ; sss ' plans show that the agency could currently meet the department of defense 's ( dod ) requirement to provide the first draftees at 193 days ; in contrast , sss officials believe that the agency would be unable to meet dod 's current requirements for unpaid manpower under either alternative ; the reason cited is the time needed to reinstate an active registration system ( for either alternative ) , to reconstitute and train the boards , and to rebuild their supporting infrastructure ( for the deep standby alternative ) ; sss officials estimate that in reinstating registration after suspension , they could meet dod 's requirement for the first draftees in about 217 days ; they also estimate that in reinstating a registration system , reconstituting and training the boards , and rebuilding the supporting infrastructure after a deep standby posture , they could meet dod 's requirement for the first draftees in about 374 days ; officials told gao that these estimates represent their best assessment of the time required to return to full operations ; and sss officials also estimated that the cost to reinstate a suspended registration could total about $ 17.2 million and the cost to revitalize the agency from a deep standby posture could total about $ 22.8 million .
