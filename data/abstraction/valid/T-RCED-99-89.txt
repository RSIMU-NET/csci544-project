pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the safety of large commercial trucks on the nation 's highways , focusing on : trends in crashes involving large trucks ; factors that contribute to such crashes ; and the federal highway administration 's office of motor carrier and highway safety 's ( omchs ) activities to improve the safety of large trucks . gao noted that : of the nearly 42,000 people who died on the nation 's highways in 1997 , about 5,400 died from crashes involving large trucks ; this represents a 20 percent increase from 1992 ; at the same time , the annual number of miles traveled by large trucks increased by a similar proportion ; if this trend of increasing truck travel continues , the number of fatalities could increase to 5,800 in 1999 and to more than 6,000 in 2000 ; while trucks are involved in fewer crashes per mile traveled than are cars , crashes involving trucks are more likely to result in a fatality ; in 1997 , 98 percent of the fatalities from crashes between trucks and cars were the occupants of the car ; although no definitive information on the causes of crashes involving large trucks exists , several factors contribute to these crashes ; these contributing factors include errors on the part of car and truck drivers , truck driver fatigue , and vehicle defects ; of these factors , errors on the part of car drivers are cited most frequently as contributing to crashes involving large trucks ; specifically , errors by car drivers were reported in 80 percent of the crashes , while truck drivers errors were reported in 28 percent of the crashes ; while many factors outside omchs ' authority -- such as the use of safety belts by car occupants and states ' actions -- influence the number of fatalities that result from crashes involving large trucks , the federal highway administration has established a goal for 1999 of reducing these fatalities ; its goal is to reduce the number of fatalities to below the 1996 level of 5,126- - substantially less than the projected figure of 5,800 ; omchs has undertaken a number of activities intended to achieve this goal , such as identifying high - risk carriers for safety improvements and educating car drivers about how to share the road with large trucks ; and however , omchs is unlikely to reach the goal because : its initiative to target high - risk carriers for safety improvements depends on data that are not complete , accurate , or timely ; several activities will not be completed before the end of 1999 ; and the effectiveness of omchs ' educational campaign to improve car drivers ' behavior is unknown .
