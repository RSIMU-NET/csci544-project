the federal housing administration ( fha ) has seen increased competition from conventional mortgage and insurance providers . additionally , because of the worsening performance of the mortgages it insures , fha has estimated that its single - family insurance program would require a subsidy -- that is , appropriations -- in fiscal year 2008 in the absence of program changes . to help fha adapt to the evolving market , proposed changes to the national housing act would allow greater flexibility in setting insurance premiums and reduce down - payment requirements . to assist congress in considering the financial challenges facing fha , this testimony provides information from recent reports gao has issued and ongoing work concerning the proposed legislation that address different aspects of fha 's risk management . specifically , this testimony looks at fha 's management of risk related to loans with down - payment assistance , instructive practices for managing risks of new products , fha 's development and use of its mortgage scorecard , and fha 's estimation of program costs . recent trends in mortgage lending have significantly affected fha , including growth in the proportion of fha - insured loans with down - payment assistance , wider availability of low - and no - down - payment products , and increased use of automated tools ( e.g . , mortgage scoring ) to underwrite loans . although fha has taken steps to improve its risk management , in a series of recent reports , gao identified a number of weaknesses in fha 's ability to estimate and manage risk that may affect its financial performance . for example , fha has not developed sufficient standards and controls to manage risks associated with the substantial proportion of loans with down - payment assistance , including assistance from nonprofit organizations funded by home sellers . according to fha , high claim and loss rates for loans with such assistance were major reasons for the estimated positive subsidy cost ( meaning that the present value of estimated cash inflows would be less than the present value of estimated cash outflows ) for fiscal year 2008 , absent any program changes . fha has not consistently implemented practices -- such as stricter underwriting or piloting -- used by other mortgage institutions to help manage the risks associated with new product offerings . although fha has indicated that it would impose stricter underwriting standards for a no - down - payment mortgage if the legislative changes were enacted , it does not plan to pilot the product . the way that fha developed its mortgage scorecard , while generally reasonable , limits how effectively it assesses the default risk of borrowers . with increased competition from conventional mortgage providers , limitations in its scorecard could cause fha to insure mortgages that are relatively more risky . fha 's reestimates of the costs of its single - family mortgage program have generally been less favorable than originally estimated . increases in the expected level of claims were a major cause of a particularly large reestimate that fha submitted as of the end of fiscal year 2003. gao made several recommendations in its recent reports , including that fha incorporate the risks posed by down - payment assistance into its scorecard , study and report on the impact of variables not in its loan performance models that have been found to influence credit risk , and consider piloting new products . fha has taken actions in response to gao 's recommendations , but continued focus on risk management will be necessary for fha to operate in a financially sound manner in the face of market and program changes .
