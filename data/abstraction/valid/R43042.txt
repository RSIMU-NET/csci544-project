traffic signs provide information to help motorists travel safely . if a sign is useful during daytime , it has equal or greater value to motorists at night , when less of the road environment can be seen . federal regulations have long required that traffic signs be visible at night , either through the use of retroreflective materials ( materials that reflect light , such as from headlights , back in the direction from which it came ) or through permanent lighting illuminating the sign . these regulations are part of the manual of uniform traffic control devices ( mutcd ) , a compilation of federal regulations governing traffic control devices . due to the costs and practical limitations on supplying electricity for lighting , agencies typically rely on retroreflective materials to make most traffic signs visible at night . retroreflective materials lose their reflective properties over time due to weathering and other factors . this reduces the visibility of the signs at night . to promote safety , the mutcd also requires agencies to monitor their traffic control devices and make sure they comply with the federal requirements . thus , agencies have been required to make sure that their traffic signs are visible at night , and to replace those which are no longer visible . however , for many years there was no objective standard establishing what level of retroreflectivity was needed for a traffic sign to be visible at night . in 1992 , congress directed the federal department of transportation ( dot ) to develop a standard for the minimum level of retroreflectivity that traffic signs ( and pavement markings ) must maintain . the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) within dot had already been doing research on the reflective properties of sign materials . between 1993 and 2004 fhwa did further research and consulted with state and local transportation agencies regarding the implementation of the congressional directive . between 2004 and 2007 , fhwa completed a rulemaking to add a minimum standard for the retroreflectivity of traffic signs to the mutcd . the new standard had three elements : it set a minimum measurable value for the retroreflectivity of traffic signs to ensure their visibility at night ; it required state and local agencies to adopt a method by which to maintain the nighttime visibility of their traffic signs by 2012 ; and it required agencies to ensure that their signs were in compliance with the standard by 2018. in 2009 , the street sign lettering standard in the mutcd was revised . this standard did not have a compliance deadline . in 2010 , several press reports conflated the new nighttime visibility standard with the new street sign lettering standard . these articles made it appear that the federal government was requiring communities to replace traffic signs just to change their lettering style . communities also complained about the cost of the new nighttime visibility maintenance standard ( though the requirement that they replace traffic signs that were no longer visible at night was not new ) . thus the nighttime visibility maintenance standard came to the attention of congress . in 2012 , fhwa amended the compliance dates for the retroreflectivity standard ( and several other mutcd standards ) to alleviate possible financial burdens the deadlines might have created for state and local highway agencies .
