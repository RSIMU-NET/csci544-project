for individuals with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) , the permanent loss of kidney function , medicare covers kidney transplants and 36 months of follow - up care . kidney transplant recipients must take costly medications to avoid transplant failure . unless a transplant recipient is eligible for medicare other than on the basis of esrd , medicare coverage , including that for medications , ends 36 months posttransplant . pediatric transplant recipients , including those who were under 18 when transplanted but are now adults ( transitional recipients ) , may be more likely than their adult counterparts to lose access to medications once medicare coverage ends because they may lack access to other health insurance coverage . gao was asked to examine the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent outcomes -- retransplant , dialysis , or death -- among pediatric , transitional , and adult kidney transplant recipients and how the cost to medicare for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant compares with the cost for a beneficiary with a transplant failure . to do this , gao analyzed 1997 through 2004 data from the united states renal data system ( usrds ) and interviewed officials from pediatric transplant centers . the centers for medicare & medicaid services -- the agency that administers medicare -- commented that it is concerned about beneficiary outcomes and has an education program to help them . the percentage of kidney transplant recipients who experience a transplant failure varies by age group as do the percentages who experience dialysis , retransplant , or death . after the first year posttransplant , a higher percentage of transitional recipients ( those younger than 18 at the time of their transplants and at least 18 as of december 31 , 2004 ) experienced a transplant failure and subsequently received dialysis compared with their pediatric ( those younger than 18 as of december 31 , 2004 ) and adult ( those at least 18 at the time of their transplants ) counterparts . by 5 years posttransplant , the percentage of transitional recipients who experienced a transplant failure ( 33 percent ) was about twice as high as pediatric recipients ( 16 percent ) and somewhat higher than adult recipients ( 28 percent ) . the largest increase in transplant failures for each age group occurred in the first 3 years posttransplant -- before the termination of medicare coverage on the basis of esrd -- and the increase was substantially higher for transitional recipients ( 133 percent ) than for pediatric ( 83 percent ) and adult ( 100 percent ) recipients . medicare beneficiaries with functioning transplants cost substantially less per year to treat than those who experienced a transplant failure . gao found that the median annual medicare cost for a beneficiary whose transplant failed ( $ 50,938 ) was 500 percent more than the median annual medicare cost for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant ( $ 8,550 ) . this percentage difference was consistent across transplant recipient age groups . the substantial cost of treating transplant recipients who experience a transplant failure underscores the importance of maintaining functioning kidney transplants . while there are many reasons that could account for transplant failures , the large percentage increase in transplant failures from 1 year to 3 years posttransplant for transitional recipients can not be attributed to an inability to access medications due to a lack of medicare coverage .
