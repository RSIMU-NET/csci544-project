during the last several years , senior navy officials have testified before congress on the effects of shortages in training resources on the readiness of aviation units . this report examines one of these resources -- ordnance for air - to - ground training -- to assess the potential for enhancing navy and marine corps tactical aviation unit readiness by improving training ordnance management . the availability of navy and marine training ordnance depends on an accurate requirements determination process , a procurement program that supports identified needs , and an allocation process that puts the right amount of ordnance where it is needed for training . the navy program has problems with all three of these elements . neither the navy nor marine corps provides request data that reflect the training needs identified in its training instruction . although both services have linked their ordnance requirements to readiness in their training instructions , neither services ' request indicates that its instruction serves as the basis for identifying its needs . gao believes each service has the knowledge and ability to develop more accurate and justifiable training ordnance requirements . training ordnance shortages limit the amount of training and exercises aircrews can carry out and reportedly affect their proficiency in certain tasks . the shortages also extend the period of time when units are at lower readiness levels and force them to make a last - minute `` rush '' to achieve readiness just before deployment . this increases the risk that units may not be sufficiently prepared if they suddenly are needed for an unexpected deployment .
