pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed : changes the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) is undertaking to strengthen its safeguards program ; the reasonableness of iaea 's assumptions regarding the impact of these changes on program costs and efficiency ; and comments on the extent of iaea 's reliance on the united states to finance the agency 's safeguards activities . gao noted that : in response to iraq 's secret nuclear weapons program , the international community , led by the united states , launched an intensive effort to create a new capability within the iaea 's safeguards system to detect secret or undeclared activities ; iaea is beginning to implement a strengthened safeguards system by introducing advanced safeguards techniques under its existing safeguards agreements ; it is also seeking additional rights to conduct more intrusive inspections and collect information on nuclear activities through an additional protocol that supplements the existing safeguards agreements ; iaea 's changes to its safeguards systems are intended to give its inspectors greater ability to detect clandestine nuclear activities in non - nuclear weapons states that are signatories to the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons or other regional nonproliferation treaties ; under existing safeguards agreements with states and regional organizations , iaea has increased its access to information on all nuclear activities at declared facilities in non - nuclear weapons states ; iaea 's member states expect that the agency will implement the strengthened safeguards system through cost neutrality , that is , through savings from expected future efficiency gains and cutbacks on certain types of inspections that on an annual basis offset the cost increases resulting from implementation ; while iaea has performed some preliminary planning , it does not have a long - term implementation plan that : identifies the total resource requirements for implementing the new measures ; provides an implementation schedule with milestones for equipment and estimated projections of adoption of the additional protocol ; and provides criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the new measures and their usefulness for reducing inspection efforts ; iaea has limited options for funding the new strengthened safeguard system because of the practice , imposed by its major contributors , that limits the agency 's regular budget to zero - real growth , and by the agency 's practice , insisted on by iaea 's less developed member states , of maintaining a balance between iaea 's technical cooperation and its safeguards programs ; and as a result , if these constraints continue and iaea 's assumptions about cost neutrality for the new program are not borne out by experience , iaea will likely turn to the united states for substantial voluntary extrabudgetary contributions to implement the strengthened safeguards system .
