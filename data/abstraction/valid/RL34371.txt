this report summarizes provisions in division a , titles xvi and xvii , of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , p.l . 110-181 , signed by the president on january 28 , 2008. titles xvi and xvii address matters related to the care and treatment of servicemembers and former servicemembers ( i.e . , veterans ) who were wounded , or who contracted an illness , while serving on active duty . these individuals are widely referred to as `` wounded warriors . . provisions in the act reflect congressional concern about the quality and availability of medical , mental health , and dental care services for servicemembers returning from active duty in iraq and afghanistan , and the difficulties that some of these individuals have experienced in their transition from military service to veteran status . the provisions vary in scope . some of them alter specific aspects of existing services or benefits programs in either the department of defense ( dod ) or the department of veterans affairs ( va ) . others call for comprehensive and long - term redesign of programs or systems in one or both of the departments . congress and others have determined that certain programs and systems that involve both departments are particularly problematic in providing continuity and quality of care and services to wounded warriors . among the problems addressed in the act are the efficient maintenance and transfer of servicemembers ' health and benefits records between the departments , and the separate evaluations of disability by each department . efforts to address these and other transition problems were already underway in both departments , partly in response to the recommendations of several dod and independent commissions and task forces . the act codifies various mandates for these activities , including deadlines . this report does not attempt to analyze provisions in the act , but provides brief outlines of the matters addressed . this report will not be updated .
