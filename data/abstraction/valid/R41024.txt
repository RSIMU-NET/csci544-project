this report provides an overview of the u.s. postal service 's ( usps 's ) financial condition , legislation enacted to alleviate the usps 's financial challenges , and possible issues for the 112th congress . since 1971 , the usps has been a self - supporting government agency that covers its operating costs with revenues generated through the sales of postage and related products and services . in recent years , the usps has experienced significant financial challenges . after running modest profits from fy2004 through fy2006 , the usps lost $ 25.4 billion between fy2007 and fy2011 . were it not for congressional action , the usps would have lost an additional $ 9.5 billion . in the first three quarters of fy2012 , the usps had an $ 11.5 billion operational loss . the usps did not have sufficient cash to make a $ 5.5 billion payment to its retiree health benefits fund ( rhbf ) that was due on august 1 , 2012. the usps is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to make a $ 5.6 billion rhbf payment due on september 30 , 2012. a number of ideas have been advanced that would attempt to improve the usps 's financial condition in the short term so that it might continue as a self - funding government agency . all of these reforms would require congress to amend current postal law . the ideas include ( 1 ) increasing the usps 's revenues by altering postage rates and increasing its offering of nonpostal rates and services ; and ( 2 ) reducing the usps 's expenses by a number of means , such as recalculating the usps 's retiree health care and pension obligations and payments , closing postal facilities , and reducing mail delivery to less than six days per week . this report will be updated after the usps releases its quarterly financial results in early november 2012 , and in the interim should there be any significant developments .
