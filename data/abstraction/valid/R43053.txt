congress , which annually oversees and appropriates $ 1.55 billion in bilateral foreign aid to egypt , is following the political and economic situation in egypt closely . economic conditions in egypt have deteriorated rapidly since the 2011 `` revolution . . political uncertainty abruptly reduced foreign capital flows into egypt ; growth , while still positive , has slowed substantially ; the central bank is at risk of running out of foreign exchange reserves ; and unemployment has increased from 9.2 % before the revolution to 12.3 % in 2012. many policymakers and analysts fear that the fragile economic conditions in egypt jeopardize the country 's political transition and broader stability in the region . egyptian authorities and the international monetary fund ( imf ) have been in negotiations for more than two years over an imf loan to egypt in exchange for policy reforms that , if successful , could stave off economic collapse and create more `` inclusive '' growth . the imf reached tentative agreements with first the military - controlled supreme council of the armed forces ( scaf ) in june 2011 and later with egyptian president mohammed morsi in november 2012. the november 2012 program would have provided $ 4.8 billion in assistance , and other donors pledged about $ 9.7 billion in additional financing once the imf program was in place . no agreement has been finalized or implemented to date . egyptian authorities have been reluctant to commit to economic reforms that may be politically unpopular and increase the country 's debt . pressure to cut fuel subsidies is a particular issue . more broadly , many egyptians associate the imf programs in the late 1980s and 1990s with adverse social outcomes . on its part , the imf has resisted a program that does not have sufficient conditionality consistent with its lending policies . continuing political concerns and uncertainty in egypt have also contributed to the delay . in the absence of an imf agreement , the egyptian government has recently secured financial support from libya and qatar . issues for congress some lawmakers who oppose ongoing u.s. bilateral assistance to egypt may oppose any existing or future imf support of egypt , on several potential grounds . some may be concerned that in the rush to stabilize egypt , the administration could be too lenient in terms of the reforms it seeks from the egyptian government . others may not want the administration to overly politicize an imf loan . they fear that the application of too much pressure on the morsi government could make accepting a possibly unpopular imf deal too politically controversial to pursue and that the lack of imf involvement in egypt could undermine u.s. interests in the region . the united states makes the single largest financial commitment to the imf , and , with the largest voting power at the imf , the united states wields a high degree of influence over imf decisions . if congress wanted to shape u.s. policy toward egypt at the imf , it could pass a `` legislative mandate '' legislation directing the u.s. representative at the imf to use its `` voice and vote '' to push for certain policies toward egypt at the imf . lawmakers may also want to use the terms of imf conditions as `` benchmarks '' for the provision of existing or new bilateral economic aid to egypt . concerns about bilateral debt relief are , in part , related to the absence of an imf agreement . additionally , legislative language ( s.amdt . 44 ) proposed in march 2013 , but not adopted , would have tied u.s. bilateral economic assistance to egypt to , among other things , an imf program .
