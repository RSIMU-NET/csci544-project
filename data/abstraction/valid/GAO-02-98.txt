in recent years , gao has testified that personnel shortages , assignment priorities , and frequent peacekeeping deployments were undermining the combat readiness of the army 's five later - deploying divisions . in 2001 , gao reported on the army chief of staff 's manning initiative of october 1999 , which seeks to ensure that all active army units are assigned the numbers , grades , and skills needed to carry out wartime missions . since then , terrorists have attacked the world trade center and the pentagon , and the bush administration has formulated a new military strategy . these developments may change how , when , and where these divisions will be used -- as seen in the deployment of soldiers from the 40th infantry division in operation enduring freedom . as of june 2001 the five divisions reported they were ready and able to perform all or most of their combat missions . enlisted personnel levels were at or near 100 percent of their authorization compared with 93 percent in march 1998. however , staffing imbalances persist for some combat support skills . each division met its training requirements for combat missions . the amount of equipment on hand and the serviceability of that equipment indicated that the five divisions would be able to perform their combat missions . army officials found it difficult to quantify the varied effects of peacekeeping operations on the five divisions ' readiness .
