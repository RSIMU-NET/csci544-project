missing among the department of defense 's ( dod ) portfolio of systems is a capability to track stationary and moving enemy vehicles on land or at sea in any type of weather , day or night , from space . to meet this need , dod and the intelligence community are collaborating on the ambitious space - based radar ( sbr ) program . by leveraging the newest generation of radar technologies , the sbr concept promises to deliver high - quality data to a wide array of users . dod intends to start product development in 2006 and to field sbr satellites as quickly as possible so that warfighters , the intelligence community , and national decision makers can gain a better understanding of what adversaries are doing in specific locations around the world . gao reviewed the sbr program to assess dod 's progress in attaining the knowledge it needs by 2006 in terms of customer needs ( or requirements ) and resources . although sbr is 2 years away from product development , the program already faces major challenges . dod officials say sbr will likely be the most expensive and technically challenging space system ever built by dod . the acquisition time frame is much shorter than what has been achieved in the past for other complex satellite systems . finally , dod is setting precedence by taking the lead on developing sbr with the intelligence community as a partner . most dod space programs that gao has reviewed in the past several decades were hampered by schedule and cost growth and performance shortfalls . problems were largely rooted in a failure to match requirements with resources when starting product development . commitments were made without knowing whether technologies being pursued would work as intended . to avoid these problems , leading commercial firms have adopted a knowledge - based model that enables decision makers to be reasonably certain about their products at critical junctures and helps them make informed investment decisions . although dod has taken positive steps to strengthen the involvement of senior leaders within dod and the intelligence community in setting requirements , sbr 's concept of operations has not been approved and signed by requirements boards for either of the two partners . without documentation and formal approval , it is unclear who will be held accountable for setting requirements or how disagreements among sbr 's partners will be resolved when dod moves sbr into ensuing phases of acquisition . dod has adopted noteworthy practices to gain knowledge about sbr 's resources . these include maximizing the use of systems engineering to close gaps between requirements and resources ; estimating all of sbr 's costs ; exploring alternatives for sbr if the transformational communications architecture ( tca ) -- the communications infrastructure that is expected to relay sbr data across a network of users -- incurs schedule and performance shortfalls ; and asking contractors to propose multiple operations concepts for sbr with or without tca . despite these accomplishments , dod is at risk of knowledge gaps . sbr 's critical technologies will not be mature when product development starts , as called for by best practices . one of tca 's primary components may not be ready in time to support sbr data . these knowledge gaps make it harder for dod to reliably estimate how much time and money are needed to complete sbr 's development . if tca is delayed , dod 's alternatives may involve reducing sbr 's capabilities or significantly increasing program cost . without sufficient knowledge , dod may not be able to determine by the time sbr 's product development starts in 2006 whether space - based radar is best suited to tracking moving targets on land or at sea or whether air - based radar would provide enough capabilities at far less cost . more specific analyses would help dod weigh the merits of various alternatives and assess how much to invest in the sbr acquisition program versus air platforms with similar capabilities .
