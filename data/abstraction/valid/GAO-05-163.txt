the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) superfund and resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) programs were established to clean up hazardous waste sites . because some sites can not be cleaned up to allow unrestricted use , institutional controls -- legal or administrative restrictions on land or resource use to protect against exposure to the residual contamination -- are placed on them . gao was asked to review the extent to which institutional controls are used at superfund and rcra sites and epa ensures that these controls are implemented , monitored , and enforced . gao also reviewed epa 's challenges in implementing control tracking systems . to address these issues , gao examined the use , implementation , monitoring , and enforcement of controls at a sample of 268 sites . institutional controls were applied at most of the superfund and rcra sites gao examined where waste was left in place after cleanup , but documentation of remedy decisions often did not discuss key factors called for in epa 's guidance . for example , while documents usually discussed the controls ' objectives , in many cases , they did not adequately address when the controls should be implemented , how long they would be needed , or who would be responsible for monitoring or enforcing them . according to epa , the documents ' incomplete discussion of the key factors suggests that site managers may not have given them adequate consideration . relying on institutional controls as a major component of a site 's remedy without carefully considering all of the key factors -- particularly whether they can be implemented in a reliable and enforceable manner -- could jeopardize the effectiveness of the remedy . epa faces challenges in ensuring that institutional controls are adequately implemented , monitored , and enforced . institutional controls at the superfund sites gao reviewed , for example , were often not implemented before the cleanup was completed , as epa requires . epa officials indicated that this may have occurred because , over time , site managers may have inadvertently overlooked the need to implement the controls . epa 's monitoring of superfund sites where cleanup has been completed but residual contamination remains often does not include verification that institutional controls are in place . moreover , the rcra corrective action program does not include a requirement to monitor sites after cleanups have been completed . in addition , epa may have difficulties ensuring that the terms of institutional controls can be enforced at some superfund and rcra sites : that is , some controls are informational in nature and do not legally limit or restrict use of the property , and , in some cases , state laws may limit the options available to enforce institutional controls . to improve its ability to ensure the long - term effectiveness of institutional controls , epa has recently begun implementing institutional control tracking systems for its superfund and rcra corrective action programs . the agency , however , faces significant obstacles in implementing such systems . the institutional control tracking systems being implemented track only minimal information on the institutional controls . moreover , as currently configured , the systems do not include information on long - term monitoring or enforcement of the controls . in addition , the tracking systems include data essentially derived from file reviews , which may or may not reflect institutional controls as actually implemented . while epa has plans to improve the data quality for the superfund tracking system -- ensuring that the data accurately reflects institutional controls as implemented and adding information on monitoring and enforcement -- the first step , data verification , could take 5 years to complete . regarding the rcra tracking system , the agency has no current plans to verify the accuracy of the data or expand on the data being tracked .
