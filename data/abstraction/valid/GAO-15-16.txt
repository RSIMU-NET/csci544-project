in 2014 , the federal government will forgo an estimated $ 17.45 billion in tax revenue from iras , which congress created to ensure equitable tax treatment for those not covered by employer - sponsored retirement plans . congress limited annual contributions to iras to prevent the tax - favored accumulation of unduly large balances . but concerns have been raised about whether the tax incentives encourage new or additional saving . congress is reexamining retirement tax incentives as part of tax reform.gao was asked to measure ira balances and assess irs enforcement of ira laws . this report describes ira balances in terms of reported fmv aggregated by taxpayers ; examines how ira balances can become large ; and assesses how irs ensures that taxpayers comply with ira tax laws . to address these objectives , gao analyzed 2011 irs statistical data , reviewed irs documentation and relevant literature , and interviewed government officials , financial industry stakeholders , and academics . gao compared irs enforcement plans and procedures with law and criteria for evaluating an enforcement program . for tax year 2011 ( the most recent year available ) , an estimated 43 million taxpayers had individual retirement accounts ( ira ) with a total reported fair market value ( fmv ) of $ 5.2 trillion . as shown in the table below , few taxpayers had aggregated balances exceeding $ 5 million as of 2011. generally , taxpayers with ira balances greater than $ 5 million tend to have adjusted gross incomes greater than $ 200,000 , be joint filers , and are age 65 or older . large individual and employer contributions sustained over decades and rolled over from an employer plan would be necessary to accumulate an ira balance of more than $ 5 million . there is no total statutory limit on ira accumulations or rollovers from employer defined contribution plans . a small number of taxpayers has accumulated larger ira balances , likely by investing in assets unavailable to most investors â€” initially valued very low and offering disproportionately high potential investment returns if successful . individuals who invest in these assets using certain types of iras can escape taxation on investment gains . for example , founders of companies who use iras to invest in nonpublicly traded shares of their newly formed companies can realize many millions of dollars in tax - favored gains on their investment if the company is successful . with no total limit on ira accumulations , the government forgoes millions in tax revenue . the accumulation of these large ira balances by a small number of investors stands in contrast to congress 's aim to prevent the tax - favored accumulation of balances exceeding what is needed for retirement . the internal revenue service ( irs ) has enforcement programs covering specific aspects of ira noncompliance , such as excess contributions and undervalued assets . as recommended by an internal task team , irs plans to collect data identifying nonpublicly traded assets comprising ira investments . irs expects the data will help it identify potential ira noncompliance . however , research on those taxpayers and ira assets at risk will hinge on getting resources to effectively compile and analyze the additional data . irs officials said ira valuation cases are audit - intensive and difficult to litigate because of the subjective nature of valuation . additionally , the 3-year statute of limitations for assessing taxes owed can pose an obstacle for irs pursuing noncompliant activity that spans years of ira investment . congress should consider revisiting its legislative vision for the use of iras . gao makes five recommendations to irs , including approving plans to fully compile and digitize new data on nonpublicly traded ira assets and seeking to extend the statute of limitations for ira noncompliance . irs generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
