when a senator introduces a bill or joint resolution , or a house - passed bill or joint resolution is received in the senate from the house , the measure is often referred to committee , pursuant to provisions of senate rules xiv , xvii , and xxv . the senate may , however , use provisions of senate rule xiv to bypass referral of a bill or joint resolution to a senate committee , and have the measure placed directly on the senate calendar of business . although placing a bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full senate will ever consider it , the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps or requirements may be obviated . such procedural steps include committee reporting or discharging a committee from a bill 's consideration , and such procedural requirements include the two - day availability of a committee report . senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions , treaties , and nominations , which are not covered in this report . a senator may also offer a germane , relevant , or nongermane amendment to a measure pending on the senate floor , in addition to or instead of introducing a bill or joint resolution . amendments are also not covered in this report . this report will not be updated again in the 115th congress unless senate procedures change . for a fuller examination of the senate 's use of the rule xiv procedure and other procedures and actions to bypass committees , and also both to bypass committees and pass legislation , see crs report rs22299 , bypassing senate committees : rule xiv and unanimous consent , by michael l. koempel .
