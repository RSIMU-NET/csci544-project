the emergency food and shelter national board ( efs ) program provides supplemental funding to homeless services providers across the nation . efs was first authorized by p.l . 100-77 , the stewart b. mckinney - bruce vento homeless assistance act ( title iii , mckinney - vento act ) , which became law in 1987. eligible services include the provision of overnight shelter and served meals , assistance to food banks and pantries , one month 's rental or mortgage assistance to prevent evictions , and one month 's utility payments to prevent service cut - offs . since its inception , the program 's recipient organizations have provided over 2 billion meals , 241 million nights of shelter , 4.3 million rent and mortgage payments , and 5.9 million utility payments . the program is administered by the efs national board , which is chaired by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and is comprised of representatives from the american red cross , catholic charities usa , the national council of churches , the salvation army , the jewish federations of north america , and united way worldwide . two of the program 's distinguishing features are its focus on local decision - making , and its relatively modest administrative costs . the program was last authorized in 1994 , and has been operating under authority provided by annual appropriations acts . in the past , its funding has generally increased during times of high unemployment and decreased as the unemployment rate declined . for example , in fy2009 , the program received an appropriation of $ 200 million . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 , arra ) then temporarily increased the efs program 's funding to $ 300 million for fy2009 . in more recent years , the program 's funding has declined . the program received an appropriation of $ 200 million for fy2010 , $ 120 million for fy2011 , and $ 120 million for fy2012 . under the full - year continuing resolution ( cr , p.l . 113-6 ) for fy2013 , the efs program is scheduled to receive just under $ 120 million ; however , with sequester amounts not yet confirmed the final amount could be less than that . although legislation providing efs an appropriation of $ 120 million for fy2012 was signed into law on december 23 , 2011 , the distribution of the program 's funds did not begin until august 15 , 2012 , the latest award distribution date in the program 's history . fy2011 was also a notable year for the program because the efs national board changed its distribution formulas , resulting in some large jurisdictions not receiving direct funding for the first time . the national board 's distribution formula uses unemployment and poverty statistics to determine amounts awarded directly to communities across the nation . after notifying jurisdictions of the amount that they will be receiving , efs local boards , comprised of local affiliates of the organizations represented on the national board , at least one homeless or previously homeless person , and representatives of local government , are convened . local boards advertise the availability of funds , accept applications for funding , and determine which local agencies to fund and how the funds are to be used . the national board also provides funding to state set - aside committees ( ssa ) which provide funding to jurisdictions with significant needs that may not have qualified under the national board 's formula , or to further supplement funding to jurisdictions that received a direct award . each state , through direct awards and ssa , receives a minimum of $ 250,000 . efs , originally envisioned as a one - time emergency program , has distributed more than $ 3.9 billion to over 2,500 local jurisdictions and more than 12,000 local service organizations ( both non - profit and governmental ) . the efs program 's rules and processes emphasize fast response , local decision - making , and local accountability . some federal programs have emulated its local board approach for decision - making on the use of resources for programs for the homeless . over the last decade , congressional oversight has occurred through annual appropriations hearings on fema in general . this report examines the administrative history of the program , the evolution of its award process , and the issues that congress may consider as the efs program approaches its fourth decade . in particular , the report highlights recent program delays in funding and , in general , how the efs program and its emphasis on emergency services fit into the context of the federal government 's approach to addressing homelessness .
