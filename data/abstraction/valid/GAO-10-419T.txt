biomonitoring , which measures chemicals in people 's tissues or body fluids , has shown that the u.s. population is widely exposed to chemicals used in everyday products . some of these have the potential to cause cancer or birth defects . moreover , children may be more vulnerable to harm from these chemicals than adults . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) is authorized under the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) to control chemicals that pose unreasonable health risks . one crucial tool in this process is chemical risk assessment , which involves determining the extent to which populations will be exposed to a chemical and assessing how this exposure affects human health this testimony , based on gao 's prior work , reviews the extent to which epa incorporates information from biomonitoring studies into its assessments of chemicals , steps that epa has taken to improve the usefulness of biomonitoring data , and extent to which epa has the authority under tsca to require chemical companies to develop and submit biomonitoring data to epa . epa has made limited use of biomonitoring data in its assessments of risks posed by commercial chemicals . one reason is that biomonitoring data relevant to the entire u.s. population exist for only 212 chemicals . in addition , biomonitoring data alone indicate only that a person was somehow exposed to a chemical , not the source of the exposure or its effect on the person 's health . for most of the chemicals studied under current biomonitoring programs , more data on chemical effects are needed to understand if the levels measured in people pose a health concern , but epa 's authorities to require chemical companies to develop such data is limited . however , in september 2009 , the epa administrator set forth goals for updated legislation to give epa additional authorities to obtain data on chemicals . while epa has initiated several research programs to make biomonitoring more useful to its risk assessment process , it has not developed a comprehensive strategy for this research that takes into account its own research efforts and those of the multiple federal agencies and other organizations involved in biomonitoring research . epa does have several important biomonitoring research efforts , including research into the relationships between exposure to harmful chemicals , the resulting concentration of those chemicals in human tissue , and the corresponding health effects . however , without a plan to coordinate its research efforts , epa has no means to track progress or assess the resources needed specifically for biomonitoring research . furthermore , according to the national academy of sciences , the lack of a coordinated national research strategy has allowed widespread chemical exposures to go undetected , such as exposures to flame retardants . while epa agreed with gao 's recommendation that epa develop a comprehensive research strategy , the agency has not yet done so . epa has not determined the extent of its authority to obtain biomonitoring data under tsca , and this authority is untested and may be limited . the tsca section that authorizes epa to require companies to develop data focuses on health and environmental effects of chemicals . however , biomonitoring data indicate only the presence of a chemical in the body , not its impact on health . it may be easier for epa to obtain biomonitoring data under other tsca sections , which allow epa to collect existing information on chemicals . for example , tsca obligates chemical companies to report information that reasonably supports the conclusion that a chemical presents a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment . epa asserts that biomonitoring data are reportable if a chemical is known to have serious toxic effects and biomonitoring data indicates a level of exposure previously unknown to epa . epa took action against a chemical company under this authority in 2004. however , the action was settled without an admission of liability by the company , so epa 's authority to obtain biomonitoring data remains untested . gao 's 2009 report recommended that epa clarify this authority , but it has not yet done so . the agency did not disagree , but commented that a case - by - case explanation of its authority might be more useful than a global assessment .
