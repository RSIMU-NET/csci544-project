the corporation for national and community service ( the corporation ) was created to help meet community needs and expand educational opportunity by providing education awards to participants . the corporation oversees and funds the americorps program as well as the national service trust ( the trust ) , which pays the education awards . from november 2002 to march 2003 the corporation suspended americorps enrollments because there would not have been sufficient funds in the trust to pay education awards . gao was asked to determine if all americorps enrollments were accurately recorded , how the corporation estimated its funding needs , and if the corporation made changes to prevent another enrollment suspension and to address requirements established in the strengthen americorps program act . gao analyzed laws , reviewed documents , interviewed officials , assessed the reliability of the trust database , examined the model used to estimate funding needs , and surveyed americorps grantees . discrepancies between information in the trust database and participant documentation indicate that not all americorps participant information was accurately reflected in the trust database . an estimated 5 percent ( 8,300 ) of about 158,000 enrollments from program years 2000 to 2002 have discrepancies , and about 3 percent ( 4,400 ) have discrepancies that could affect estimates of future probable expenditures of the trust . further , the users ' manual for the trust database system had not been updated . in 2003 the corporation began using a new model with conservative assumptions of participant behavior to develop its funding estimates . corporation officials explained that they used conservative assumptions because the americorps program does not have a long history from which to extrapolate participant behavior , and the corporation wanted to regain credibility after the enrollment suspension in 2002. using the new model may be prudent until the corporation gains more experience . however , because the new model increased the trust 's funding estimates , the corporation will need to monitor actual experience compared with the model 's assumptions and may need to deobligate unused trust funds . further , the new model does not incorporate external factors , such as downturns in the economy , which may affect funding estimates or the trust 's balances . the corporation recently formed a team to assess the costs and benefits of adding external factors in its model . the corporation has made some changes to its operations that minimize the likelihood it will need to suspend enrollments in the future . corporation officials have been obligating trust funds when positions are approved since june 2003 , and the communication and coordination among officials have greatly improved . changes have also been implemented and planned to address the strengthen americorps program act requirements . however , changes to improve oversight of grantees have not been fully implemented , and policies related to refilling vacated positions and converting unfilled positions may limit enrollments , hinder service delivery , and contribute to the accumulation of a larger trust balance .
