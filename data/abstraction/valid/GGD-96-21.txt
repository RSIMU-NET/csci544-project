pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 , focusing on : how irs addressed the problems identified in a previous gao report ; how persistent problems affect final tcmp results ; other informational sources that irs could use to target its audits more effectively ; and the relevancy of tcmp data for alternative tax system proposals . gao found that : irs has taken appropriate actions to correct the previously identified problems in the implementation of tcmp ; due to uncertainties about its fiscal year 1996 budget , irs has delayed tcmp audits until december 1 , 1995 ; the audit delay will allow irs to complete testing of tcmp database components and data collections systems ; the audits could be further delayed if the tests reveal additional problems ; irs plans to collect data on partners , shareholders , and misclassified workers which should allow it to better measure compliance levels and tcmp audit results ; computerized auditor comments should make it easier for researchers to analyze tcmp results and allow irs to collect data on other tax issues that are not a part of tcmp ; irs still needs to develop a research plan that would allow it to more timely analyze tcmp data ; no alternative information sources exist that could help irs better target its audits ; irs is developing a new identification system for tax return audits , but it will not be available until after year 2000 ; and tcmp could be useful in designing and administering a new tax system and identifying compliance trends .
