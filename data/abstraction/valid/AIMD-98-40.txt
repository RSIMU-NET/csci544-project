pursuant to a congressional request , gao reported on seven technological initiatives that the department of defense ( dod ) identified as key elements of its efforts to improve the contract payment process , focusing on dod 's goal of adopting the best business practices of the private sector . gao noted that : the descriptive information presented in gao 's letter highlights several areas of concern that could prevent dod from meeting its goal of a paperless contracting process by the year 2000 ; for example , even if dod successfully meets the current schedule , as of september 30 , 1997 , three of the four long - term initiatives are not scheduled for completion until the end of fiscal year 2001 ; in addition , the initiatives may not eliminate the weaknesses in the contract payment processing ; as gao previously reported , although dod has numerous initiatives under way to help resolve its disbursement and accounting problems , it has not performed the in - depth analysis necessary to fully determine the underlying causes of these problems and therefore identify the most effective solutions and rank specific reforms ; as a result , as with its other initiatives , the extent to which these seven technology initiatives discussed in gao 's letter will resolve dod 's long - standing disbursement problems is unclear ; even in a highly automated and paperless environment , proper payments can only be made by ensuring that accurate and complete data are available in the systems ; and for example , for some types of payments , unless provided with information that identifies the cost of work accomplished with the appropriate funding source , the new systems and databases will not have the information necessary to ensure that proper payments are made .
