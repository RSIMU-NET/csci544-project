pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the two reviews that it has completed pertaining to case service reporting ( csr ) by the legal services corporation ( lsc ) , focusing on : what efforts lsc and its grantees have made to correct case reporting problems ; and whether these efforts are likely to resolve the case reporting problems that occurred in 1997. gao noted that : lsc issued a new , 1999 csr handbook and distributed other written communications intended to clarify reporting requirements to its grantees ; the 1999 handbook , which replaced the 1993 edition , instituted changes to some of lsc 's reporting requirements and provided more detailed information on other requirements ; in responding to a gao telephone survey , most grantees indicated that the new guidance helped clarify lsc 's reporting requirements , and virtually all of them indicated that they had or planned to make program changes as a result of the requirements ; many grantees , however , identified areas of case reporting that remained unclear to them ; the 1999 csr handbook included changes to : procedures for timely closing of cases ; procedures for management review of case service reports ; procedures for ensuring single recording of cases ; requirements to report lsc - eligible cases , regardless of funding source ; and requirements for reporting cases involving private attorneys separately ; based on gao 's survey of executive directors of 79 grantees , gao estimates that over 90 percent of grantee executive directors viewed the changes in the 1999 csr handbook as being clear overall , and virtually all of them indicated that they planned to or had made at least one change to their program operations as a result of the revised case reporting requirements ; although most of the grantee executive directors reported that the new lsc guidance helped clarify requirements , many of them also indicated that they were still unclear about certain requirements and that additional clarification was needed ; lsc sought to determine the accuracy of grantees ' case data by requiring that grantees complete self - inspections of their open and closed caseload data for 1998 ; on may 14 , 1999 , lsc issued a memo to all grantees instructing them to complete a self - inspection procedure by july 1 , 1999 ; according to lsc officials , about three - fourths of the grantees certified the accuracy of their 1998 case data ; as of august 26 , 1999 , lsc documents indicated that 199 of 261 grantees reported substantially correct csr data to lsc ; the remaining 62 grantees did not certify to lsc that their csr data were substantially correct ; and gao 's review raised some concerns about lsc 's interpretation of the self - inspection results and about the accuracy of the data provided to lsc by grantees .
