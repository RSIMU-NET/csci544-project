terrorism and violent extremism continue to pose a global threat , and combating them remains a top priority for the u.s. government . state leads and coordinates u.s. efforts to counter terrorism abroad . state 's office of the coordinator for counterterrorism was elevated to bureau status in 2012 with the aim of enhancing state 's ability to counter violent extremism , build partner counterterrorism capacity , and improve coordination . gao was asked to review the effects of this change and the new bureau 's efforts . this report examines how the bureau 's staffing resources have changed since 2011 , the extent to which the bureau has assessed its performance since 2011 , and the extent to which the bureau 's coordination with u.s. government entities on selected programs is in line with key collaboration practices . to address these objectives , gao reviewed and analyzed state and other u.s. government agency information and interviewed u.s. government officials in washington , d.c. the department of state 's ( state ) bureau of counterterrorism has had an annual increase in authorized full - time equivalent ( fte ) positions since fiscal year 2011 and has recently undertaken efforts to reduce a persistent staffing gap . the bureau 's authorized ftes increased from 66 in fiscal year 2011 to 96 in fiscal year 2015 , and over the same period , fte vacancies ranged from 17 to 23 percent . the vacancies included both staff and management positions . bureau officials said they postponed filling some positions until the coordinator for counterterrorism had sufficient time to assess the bureau 's needs and priorities . a senior bureau of counterterrorism official testified before congress in june 2015 that the bureau was making progress and that it had 11 vacancies . however , we have not been able to verify that 4 of the reportedly filled positions have been filled because state did not provide sufficient documentation . while the bureau has undertaken efforts to assess its progress , it has not yet evaluated its priority countering violent extremism ( cve ) program and has not established time frames for addressing recommendations from program evaluations . specifically , the bureau established indicators and targets for its foreign assistance – related goals and reported results achieved toward each indicator . the bureau has also completed four evaluations covering three of its six programs that resulted in 60 recommendations . the bureau reported having implemented about half of the recommendations ( 28 of 60 ) as of june 2015 but has not established time frames for addressing the remaining recommendations . without specific time frames , it will be difficult for the bureau to ensure timely implementation of programmatic improvements . in addition , despite identifying its cve program as a priority and acknowledging the benefit of evaluating it , the bureau has postponed evaluating it each fiscal year since 2012. the bureau 's coordination on two programs gao reviewed , cve and counterterrorism finance , generally reflects key practices for effective collaboration . for example , gao identified efforts to define outcomes and accountability , bridge organizational cultures , and establish written guidance and agreements — all key practices of effective collaboration . gao recommends that the secretary of state take steps to ensure that cve program efforts abroad are evaluated and establish time frames for addressing recommendations from program evaluations . state concurred with both of gao 's recommendations . state indicated that it was currently assessing which programs would benefit from a third - party evaluation and that it would commit to setting a timetable for reviewing each recommendation by a third - party evaluator .
