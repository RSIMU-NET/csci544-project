on january 10 , 2013 , the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) released a final rule implementing the ability - to - repay ( atr ) requirement of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) . the rule is effective january 10 , 2014. the atr rule will require a lender to determine based on documented and verified information that at the time a mortgage loan is made , the borrower has the ability to repay the loan . failure to make such a determination could result in a lender having to pay damages to a borrower who brings a lawsuit claiming that the lender did not follow the atr rule . the final rule provides multiple ways for a lender to comply , one of which is by originating a qualified mortgage ( qm ) . to receive qm status , a loan must meet certain underwriting and product - feature requirements . for example , in most cases a qm can not have a balloon payment ( a large payment that is typically due at the end of the loan ) . if a loan is a qm , then the lender receives a presumption of compliance for legal purposes . the type of presumption of compliance that a qm receives depends on the rate of the loan . if the loan is a higher - priced mortgage ( the mortgage 's rate exceeds the average rate for a prime mortgage by more than 1.5 percentage points for a purchase ) , then the lender receives a rebuttable presumption of compliance . it is presumed that the lender complied , but the borrower could win his case if , for example , the court finds that the lender should have known that the borrower did not have sufficient residual income after paying his mortgage and other obligations to afford his living expenses . if the qm is not a higher - priced mortgage , then the lender receives a safe harbor . so long as the mortgage meets the qm standards , the lender is considered to have complied with the atr rule . some are concerned that , at least in the short term , only mortgages meeting the qm standards will be originated because of the legal protections they afford , even though there are other means of complying with the atr rule . the definition of qm , therefore , could determine who would receive a mortgage in the future . to increase access to credit , the cfpb also included a temporary qm option for loans eligible to be purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac or to be insured by the government through the federal housing administration ( fha ) , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , or the rural housing service ( rhs ) . according to the final rule , the temporary option would last for , at most , seven years from when the rule goes into effect in january 2014. the cfpb 's analysis of the mortgage market as of the end of 2011 concluded that , excluding the temporary option , approximately 76 % of mortgages would have received safe harbor qm status . an additional 2 % would have been qualified mortgages with a rebuttable presumption , and 22 % would have satisfied the atr rule through other compliance options . including the temporary option , the cfpb estimates that more than 95 % of the mortgage market as of the end of 2011 would have received qm status . underwriting standards and access to credit are considered to have been tighter in 2011 than before the housing crisis , however . in addition to concerns about credit availability , experts have raised other potential issues with the final rule . some ask how the temporary qm option might affect the government 's role in the housing market , while others raise concerns about the final rule 's impact on rural and community banks . the atr rule is one of several mortgage market rules released by regulators ; some worry about how the rules , in aggregate , will affect the mortgage market .
