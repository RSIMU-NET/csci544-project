gao discussed whether the consumer price index ( cpi ) published by the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) accurately reflects consumer spending , focusing on the : need for and advantages of more frequent updating of the cpi expenditure weights ; nature of the work gao is doing with regard to the cpi ; and bls ' coverage of cpi improvement efforts in its strategic plan and fiscal year ( fy ) 1999 annual performance plan . gao noted that : bls uses expenditure weights to aggregate market basket items into the overall index number ; the preponderance of evidence gao obtained pointed to the need for and advantages of more frequent updates ; this evidence included the : views of professionals knowledgeable about the cpi ; practices of other countries ; results of research that show that the age of expenditure weights affects the cpi ; and the sizable effect more frequent updates could have on the federal budget in comparison to the relatively small costs associated with updates ; bls has said it agrees with gao 's recommendation for more frequent updates and is considering the appropriate update frequency ; in examining bls ' fy 1999 performance plan , gao found that it was partially successful in providing a picture of bls ' intended performance to improve the cpi 's quality ; further , the plan did not fully portray how bls ' strategies and resources would help achieve the performance goals for improving cpi quality or how bls would ensure that the data it uses to assess its performance are credible ; gao found linkages between some , but not all , of the commission 's recommendations and the plan 's performance goals and indicators ; neither bls ' strategic plan nor its fy 1999 performance plan discusses such linkages or the lack of them ; bls and the department of labor question the usefulness of discussing recommendations contained in particular reports , such as the boskin commission report , in long - range planning documents ; and however , gao believes such a discussion would enhance the plans ' usefulness and credibility to cpi stakeholders given the great interest shown in the boskin commission recommendations by congress and others .
