the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions , mergers , or takeovers of u.s. companies if there is credible evidence that a foreign controlling interest might threaten national security and legislation , other than exon - florio and the international emergency economic powers act , does not adequately or appropriately protect national security . the president delegated the authority to review foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies to an interagency group , the committee on foreign investment in the united states . the committee initiates investigations only when it can not identify potential mitigation measures in the review period to resolve national security issues arising from the acquisitions or when it needs time beyond the 30-day review to negotiate potential mitigation measures and the companies involved are not willing to request withdrawal of their notification . the committee 's process for implementing exon - florio contains the following weaknesses that may have limited effectiveness : the committee has not established interim protections before allowing withdrawal when concerns were raised and the acquisition had already been completed agreements between the committee and companies contained nonspecific language that may make them difficult to implement and agreements did not specify responsibility for overseeing implementation and contained few provisions to assist in monitoring compliance .
