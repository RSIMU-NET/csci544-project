the social security administration ( ssa ) is responsible for administering two federal entitlement programs established under the social security act that provide income support to individuals with severe , long - term disabilities : social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) . ssdi is a work - related social insurance program authorized under title ii of the act that provides monthly cash benefits to nonelderly disabled workers and their eligible dependents , provided the workers accrued a sufficient number of earnings credits during their careers in jobs subject to social security taxes . in contrast , ssi is a need - based public assistance program authorized under title xvi of the act that provides monthly cash payments to aged , blind , or disabled individuals ( including blind or disabled children ) who have limited assets and little or no social security or other income . in 2017 , ssdi and ssi combined paid an estimated $ 199 billion in federally administered benefits to 14.5 million qualified disabled individuals and 1.5 million non - disabled dependents of disabled workers . ssdi is part of the federal old - age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program , commonly known as social security . oasdi benefits are based on an insured worker 's career - average earnings in jobs covered by social security and designed to replace a portion of the income lost to a family due to the worker 's retirement , disability , or death . workers become insured against these events by acquiring a certain number of earnings credits during their careers in covered employment or self - employment . the ssdi component of the program provides benefits to disabled workers who are under social security 's full retirement age and to their eligible spouses and children . the old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) component also provides disability benefits to eligible disabled dependents of retired workers and to eligible disabled survivors of deceased beneficiaries and deceased insured workers . although these individuals are not technically disability insurance beneficiaries , they are often included in the term ssdi because they receive social security benefits due to a qualifying impairment . ssdi and oasi disability benefits are paid from the social security trust funds , which are financed primarily by payroll and self - employment taxes levied on the earnings of covered workers . ssi is a federal assistance program that provides needy aged , blind , or disabled individuals with a guaranteed minimum income to meet their basic living expenses . although there are no work or contribution requirements to qualify for payments , the program is based on need and therefore is restricted to individuals with limited financial means . ssi is commonly known as a program of `` last resort '' because claimants must first apply for most other benefits for which they may be eligible ; cash assistance is awarded only to those whose assets and other income ( if any ) are within prescribed limits . the basic federal ssi payment is the same for all recipients and is reduced by the amount of other income that an individual receives . some states supplement the federal ssi payment with solely state funds . unlike social security , ssi is financed by appropriations from general revenues . most claimants are considered disabled for ssdi and ssi eligibility purposes if they are unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity ( sga ) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or to result in death . in 2018 , the sga earnings limit is $ 1,180 per month for most individuals . claimants generally qualify if they have an impairment ( or combination of impairments ) of such severity that they are unable to perform any kind of substantial work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy , taking into consideration their age , education , and work experience . if a claimant 's application for benefits is denied at any point during the disability determination process , the claimant has the right to appeal the determination or decision .
