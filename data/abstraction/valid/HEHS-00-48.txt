gao reviewed states ' efforts to meet the information needs associated with welfare reform , with a focus on temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , focusing on the : extent to which automated systems in selected states meet key information needs of programs that help low - income individuals with children obtain employment and become economically independent ; approaches states are using to develop or modify their automated systems to better meet these information needs ; and major obstacles states have encountered in working to improve their automated systems as well as the potential role of the federal government in helping overcome these obstacles . gao noted that : although automated systems in the states gao examined support welfare reform in many ways , a number of these systems have major limitations in one or more of three key areas ; with respect to information needs for case management , the major shortcoming is an inability to obtain data on individual tanf recipients from some of the agencies serving them , including job assistance agencies ; this situation makes it difficult for tanf case managers to arrange needed services , ensure that the services are provided , and respond quickly when problems arise ; officials in the states , especially those at the local level , said that it is sometimes difficult or impossible to query automated systems to obtain information for planning service strategies for their overall tanf caseloads , such as information on the number of adults with no prior work experience ; automated systems have shortcomings for program oversight purposes , specifically , they do not provide enough information to support enforcement of the 5-year tanf time limit and to monitor the employment progress of tanf recipients overall in some instances ; states ' automated systems projects embody a range of approaches to expanding the ability of system users to obtain and analyze data from multiple sources ; some projects are designed primarily to support tanf case managers and other frontline workers in providing more coordinated delivery of services ; other projects , geared more to improving the ability of program managers to collect and analyze data from different programs , involve developing new query tools and databases that are expected to help program managers with key tasks , such as determining program results and assessing the performance of service providers ; states face a number of obstacles to improving their automated systems , such as the magnitude of changes in the mission and operations of welfare agencies due to welfare reform , the inherent difficulties associated with successfully managing information technology projects , competition with the private sector to recruit and retain information technology staff , and the complexity of obtaining federal funding for systems projects that involve multiple agencies ; the federal government could take various actions to help overcome such obstacles , such as providing more information on best practices for managing information technology ; and in this way , the federal government could serve a facilitative role , in addition to its regulatory role , in helping states improve automated systems for social programs .
