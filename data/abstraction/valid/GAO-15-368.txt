agencies rely on guidance to clarify regulatory text or statutes , to respond to the questions of affected parties in a timely way , and to inform the public about complex policy implementation topics . unlike regulations , guidance is not legally binding . gao was asked to examine guidance processes at four departments . this report reviews how agencies use guidance and decide to issue guidance rather than regulations ; follow applicable criteria and leading practices in their policies , procedures , and practices for producing guidance ; and agencies disseminate guidance to ensure public access and feedback . gao reviewed guidance processes at all 25 components in the four departments that were within the requesting committee 's jurisdiction , and engaged in regulatory or grant activities . gao reviewed relevant requirements , written procedures , guidance and websites , and interviewed agency officials . the four departments — agriculture ( usda ) , education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , and labor ( dol ) — and their selected components used guidance for multiple purposes , such as clarifying or interpreting regulations and providing grant administration information . the terminology used for agency guidance varied and agency components issued varying amounts of guidance , ranging from about 10 to over 100 guidance documents each year . the key criterion used when deciding whether to issue a regulation or guidance was whether it needed to be binding ; in such cases agencies proceeded with regulation . officials reported that they routinely consulted with legal counsel when making these choices . departments typically identified few of their guidance documents as “ significant , ” generally defined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) as guidance with a broad and substantial impact on regulated entities . all four departments identified standard practices to follow when developing guidance . they addressed omb 's requirements for significant guidance to varying degrees and could strengthen internal controls for issuing guidance . education and usda had written departmental procedures for approval of significant guidance as required by omb . dol 's procedures were not available to staff and required updating . hhs had no written procedures . ensuring these procedures are available could better ensure that components consistently follow omb 's requirements . in the absence of specific government standards for non - significant guidance — the majority of issued guidance — the application of internal control standards is particularly important . the 25 components gao reviewed addressed some control standards more regularly than others . for example , few components had written procedures to ensure consistent application of guidance processes . all components could describe standard review practices and most used tools to document management approval of draft guidance . of the 25 components , 15 cited examples in which they conferred with external nonfederal stakeholders while developing guidance and nearly half did not regularly evaluate whether issued guidance remained current and effective . components used different strategies to disseminate guidance and all relied primarily on posting the guidance on their websites . as such , components should follow applicable requirements for federal websites . one of these requirements — easy access to current and relevant guidance — could also facilitate opportunities for affected parties and stakeholders to provide feedback on those documents . usda , dol , and education posted their significant guidance on a departmental website as directed by omb ; hhs did not . components used several strategies — including organizing guidance by audience or topic and highlighting new or outdated guidance — to facilitate access . however , gao identified factors that hindered online access , including long lists of guidance and documents dispersed among multiple web pages . all components gao studied collected web metrics and many used them to evaluate online guidance dissemination . however , many of these components did not use metrics to improve how they disseminated guidance through their websites . beyond their websites , components found other ways to disseminate and obtain feedback on issued guidance , including focus groups , surveys , and direct feedback from the public at conferences , webinars , and from monitoring visits . gao is recommending that hhs and dol ensure consistent application of omb requirements for significant guidance . gao also recommends that usda , education , hhs , and dol strengthen the use of internal controls in guidance production processes and improve online guidance dissemination . usda , education , hhs and dol generally agreed with the recommendations .
