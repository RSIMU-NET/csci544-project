the global positioning system ( gps ) , which provides positioning , navigation , and timing data to users worldwide , has become essential to u.s. national security and a key tool in an expanding array of public service and commercial applications at home and abroad . the united states provides gps data free of charge . the air force , which is responsible for gps acquisition , is in the process of modernizing gps . in light of the importance of gps , the modernization effort , and international efforts to develop new systems , gao was asked to undertake a broad review of gps . specifically , gao assessed progress in acquiring gps satellites , acquiring the ground control and user equipment necessary to leverage gps satellite capabilities , and evaluated coordination among federal agencies and other organizations to ensure gps missions can be accomplished . to carry out this assessment , gao 's efforts included reviewing and analyzing program documentation , conducting its own analysis of air force satellite data , and interviewing key military and civilian officials . it is uncertain whether the air force will be able to acquire new satellites in time to maintain current gps service without interruption . if not , some military operations and some civilian users could be adversely affected . in recent years , the air force has struggled to successfully build gps satellites within cost and schedule goals ; it encountered significant technical problems that still threaten its delivery schedule ; and it struggled with a different contractor . as a result , the current iif satellite program has overrun its original cost estimate by about $ 870 million and the launch of its first satellite has been delayed to november 2009- - almost 3 years late . further , while the air force is structuring the new gps iiia program to prevent repeating mistakes made on the iif program , the air force is aiming to deploy the next generation of gps sa this schedule is optimistic , given the program 's late start , past trends in space acquisitions , and challenges facing the new contracto tellites 3 years faster than the iif satellites . gao 's analysis found that r. of particular concern is leadership for gps acquisition , as gao and other studies have found the lack of a single point of authority for space programs and frequent turnover in program managers have hampered requirements setting , funding stability , and resource allocation . if the air force does not meet its schedule goals for development of gps iiia satellites , there will be an increased likelihood that in 2010 , as old satellites begin to fail , the overall gps constellation will fall below the number of satellites required to provide the level of gps service that the u.s. government commits to . such a gap in capability could have wide - ranging impacts on all gps users , though there are measures the air force and others can take to plan for and minimize these impacts . in addition to risks facing the acquisition of new gps satellites , the air force has not been fully successful in synchronizing the acquisition and development of the next generation of gps satellites with the ground control and user equipment , thereby delaying the ability of military users to fully utilize new gps satellite capabilities . diffuse leadership has been a contributing factor , given that there is no single authority responsible for synchronizing all procurements and fielding related to gps , and funding has been diverted from ground programs to pay for problems in the space segment . dod and others involved in ensuring gps can serve communities beyond the military have taken prudent steps to manage requirements and coordinate among the many organizations involved with gps . however , gao identified challenges to ensuring civilian requirements and ensuring gps compatibility with other new , potentially competing global space - based positioning , navigation , and timing systems .
