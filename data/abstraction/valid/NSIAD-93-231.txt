pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined the effectiveness of the army 's program for : assessing the performance of units during their rotations at combat training centers ; identifying the lessons learned from battlefield experience ; and disseminating information so that training and doctrine can be modified to avoid repeating the same mistakes during training exercises . gao found that : the training and doctrine command ( tradoc ) has overall responsibility for the army 's lessons learned program and has assigned responsibility for the program to its combined arms command ; despite the lessons learned program , army units repeat many of the same mistakes during maneuver exercises at combat training centers ; the tradoc program lacks procedures for assigning priorities to the lessons learned ; tradoc lacks follow - up procedures for tracking use and impact of lessons learned ; and the schools are not held accountable for ensuring that identified problems are resolved .
