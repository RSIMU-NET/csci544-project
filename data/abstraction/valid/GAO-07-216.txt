recognizing the importance of human capital to information technology ( it ) and the need to improve the skills of federal it workers , congress created the information technology exchange program ( itep ) as part of the e - government act of 2002. itep aims to improve federal it skills through exchanges of staff between the government and the private sector . the office of personnel management ( opm ) was required to issue implementing regulations , which it did in september 2005 , and to report semiannually to the congress . opm 's regulations require that each participating agency develop an itep plan before proceeding with exchanges . agencies ' opportunity to begin exchanges ends in december 2007. gao is required to evaluate the program by december 2006. as agreed , gao 's objectives were to determine the status of the program and challenges facing agencies . to address these objectives , gao analyzed key documents and interviewed opm , participating agencies , and others . with only 1 year remaining to begin exchanges under the itep program , the seven agencies that volunteered to participate are still initiating their programs , and no exchanges have taken place . all participating agencies have drafted plans , but only three -- department of homeland security , department of defense , and department of commerce -- have finalized them . further , only homeland security has attempted to negotiate an exchange , but it was unsuccessful . in its last two semiannual reports , opm has reported on the status of agency plans , but has not reported that no exchanges have taken place to date . opm , agencies , and others have identified key challenges that will confront agencies as they finish their plans and begin to implement itep programs . first , employees with desired skills are in short supply in both the federal government and the private sector , particularly in enterprise architecture , project management , and information security , according to industry representatives . second , companies are concerned that employee exchanges could hinder future business , since a company with an employee at an agency might be seen as having an unfair advantage in bidding on agency procurements . third , federal ethics requirements , especially financial disclosure , could discourage private - sector employees from participating . and lastly , federal agencies ' current marketing through a web site has not been productive , according to participating agencies ; suggested improvements include using the media and making personal contacts with companies . opm and the participating agencies are aware of the challenges and acknowledge that they need to be addressed . however , given the short time remaining before authority to begin new exchanges ends ( see figure ) , it will be essential to expeditiously address the challenges to enable a significant number of successful exchanges .
