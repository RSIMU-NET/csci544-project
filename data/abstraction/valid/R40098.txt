although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established more than 35 years ago in the clean water act ( cwa ) to restore and maintain the chemical , physical , and biological integrity of the nation 's waters , long - standing problems persist , and new problems have emerged . water quality problems are diverse , ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches , city streets , and other diffuse or `` nonpoint '' sources , to toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants . there is little agreement among stakeholders about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required to address the nation 's remaining water pollution problems . for some time , efforts to comprehensively amend the cwa have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law . congress has instead focused legislative attention on enacting narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs , but not any comprehensive proposals . for several years , the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects . house and senate committees have approved bills on several occasions , but , for various reasons , no legislation has been enacted . at issue has been how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild , repair , and upgrade wastewater treatment plants , especially in light of capital costs that are projected to be as much as $ 390 billion . in the 111th congress , interest in increased investment in public works infrastructure — including wastewater — in order to stimulate the faltering u.s. economy brought greater attention to water infrastructure issues . acting quickly , in february 2009 , congress passed and the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 ) . among its provisions , the legislation appropriated $ 4.0 billion in additional cwa assistance for wastewater projects . in addition , in march 2009 , the house passed legislation to reauthorize the cwa 's state revolving fund ( srf ) program to finance wastewater infrastructure and several related provisions of the act ( h.r . 1262 ) . a companion bill was approved by the senate environment and public works committee ( s. 1005 ) . no legislation was enacted . programs that regulate activities in wetlands also have been of interest , especially cwa section 404 , which has been criticized by landowners for intruding on private land - use decisions and imposing excessive economic burdens . environmentalists view this regulatory program as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems , and they are concerned about court rulings that narrowed regulatory protection of wetlands and about related administrative actions . many stakeholders desire clarification of the act 's regulatory jurisdiction , but they differ on what solutions are appropriate . in the 111th congress , the senate environment and public works committee approved a bill that sought to clarify but not expand the cwa 's geographic scope ( the clean water restoration act , s. 787 ) . a companion bill was introduced in the house ( h.r . 5088 ) . because some stakeholders believe that the bills would expand federal jurisdiction — not simply clarify it — the bills were controversial , and no legislation was enacted . the 111th congress considered a number of water quality issues through oversight and legislation . two bills amending the cwa were enacted and are discussed . one dealt with extending a moratorium for cwa permitting of certain vessels ( p.l . 111-215 ) , and the other dealt with ensuring that federal agencies and departments pay localities for reasonable costs associated with managing stormwater pollution from federal properties ( p.l . 111-378 ) .
