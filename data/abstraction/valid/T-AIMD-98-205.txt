gao discussed : the results of the most recent reports submitted to the office of management and budget ( omb ) on the slow progress made by the federal government in achieving year 2000 compliance ; and what needs to be done now to minimize disruptions to critical services . gao noted that : in may 1997 , omb reported that about 21 percent of the government 's mission - critical systems were year 2000 compliant ; a year later , these departments and agencies reported a total of 2,914 systems as compliant -- about 40 percent of the 7,336 mission - critical systems in their current inventories ; omb , the president 's council on year 2000 conversion , and congress lack sufficient information with which to judge the progress of systems to be replaced ; agencies will also need a significant amount of time for essential end - to - end testing of multiple systems that have individually been deemed year 2000 compliant ; the council implemented a number of gao 's recommendations for minimizing year 2000 risks , including : requiring federal agencies to establish priorities for their mission - critical business process ; requiring agencies to develop plans for the testing and independent verification and validation of their systems ; requiring agencies to provide information on their year 2000 progress ; issuing omb guidance on the development of business continuity and contingency plans ; and examining various options for ensuring that an adequate number of qualified people are hired to perform year 2000 work ; as the amount of time to the turn of the century shortens , the magnitude of what must be accomplished becomes more daunting ; greater leadership and coordination of disparate efforts is essential if government programs are to meet the needs of the public 19 months from now ; and the conversion council must play a central role in ensuring that agency action not only stays on track , but accelerates significantly .
