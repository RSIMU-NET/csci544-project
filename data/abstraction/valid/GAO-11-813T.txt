as part of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , the federal protective service ( fps ) is responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 9,000 federal facilities owned or leased by the general services administration ( gsa ) . fps has a budget of approximately $ 1 billion and maintains approximately 1,200 full - time employees and about 13,000 contract security guards that help accomplish the agency 's facility protection mission . this testimony is based on past reports and testimonies and discusses challenges fps faces in carrying out its mission with regard to risk management , strategic human capital planning , oversight of its contract guard program , and ensuring that its fee - based funding structure is the appropriate mechanism for funding the agency . gao also addresses the extent to which fps has made progress in responding to these challenges . to perform this work , gao used its key facility protection practices as criteria , visited fps regions and selected gsa buildings , reviewed training and certification data for fps 's contract guards , and interviewed officials from dhs , gsa , guard contractors , and guards . fps continues to face challenges in carrying out its mission . specifically : the absence of a risk management program hampers fps 's ability to protect federal facilities . for many years , gao has advocated the importance of a risk management approach . gao reported in august 2010 that fps does not use a comprehensive risk management approach that links threats and vulnerabilities to resource requirements . instead , fps uses a facility - by - facility approach which assumes that facilities with the same security level have the same risk regardless of their location . without a risk management approach that identifies threats and vulnerabilities and the resources required to achieve fps 's security goals , as gao has recommended , there is limited assurance that programs will be prioritized and resources will be allocated to address existing and potential security threats in an efficient and effective manner . fps has not fully addressed several key human capital issues . fps continues to operate without a strategic human capital plan to guide its current and future workforce planning efforts , as gao recommended in 2009. further , fps is not able to determine what its optimal staffing levels should be because fps headquarters does not collect data on its workforce 's knowledge , skills , and abilities . fps has yet to fully ensure that its recent move to an inspector - based workforce does not hinder its ability to protect federal facilities . fps faces longstanding challenges in managing its contract guard workforce . weaknesses in fps 's contract guard program hamper its ability to protect federal facilities . gao reported in 2009 and 2010 that fps can not ensure that its contract guards have required training and certifications . fps is in the process of addressing gao recommendations . for example , fps revised its x - ray and magnetometer training for its inspectors and guards . fps has not reviewed its fee design or determined an appropriate funding mechanism . fps increased its basic security fee four times in 6 years to try to cover costs , but has not reviewed its fees to develop an informed , deliberate design . fps 's current fee structure has consistently resulted in total collection amounts less than agency costs and continues to be a topic of congressional interest and inquiry . fps has yet to evaluate whether its fee - based structure or an alternative funding mechanism is most appropriate for funding the agency , as gao recommended in 2008 and 2011. fps has made some progress in improving its ability to protect federal facilities . for example , in response to gao recommendations , fps is developing the risk assessment and management program ( ramp ) , which could enhance its ability to comprehensively assess risk at federal facilities and improve oversight of its contract guard program . dhs and fps have initiatives in process to address 21 of the 28 recommendations gao has made related to the challenges above , although none are yet fully implemented . according to fps officials , this is in part because of changes in the agency 's leadership , organization , funding , staffing levels , and delays in developing several new management systems , such as ramp . dhs and fps have generally concurred with gao 's past recommendations . dhs and fps have initiatives in process , for example , to address risk management , strategic human capital planning , and oversight of its contract guard program .
