local election officials ( leos ) are critical to the administration of federal elections and the implementation of the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava , p.l . 107-252 ) . three surveys of leos were performed by academic institutions in collaboration with the congressional research service . although care needs to be taken in interpreting the results , they may have implications for several policy issues , such as how election officials are chosen and trained , the best ways to ensure that voting systems and election procedures are sufficiently effective , secure , and voter - friendly , and whether adjustments should be made to hava requirements . major results include the following : the demographic characteristics of leos differ from those of other government officials . almost three - quarters are women , and 5 % are minorities . most do not have a college degree , and most were elected , although those characteristics appear to be changing . some results suggest areas of potential improvement such as in training and participation in professional associations . leos believed that the federal government has too great an influence on the acquisition of voting systems , and that local elected officials have too little . their concerns increased from 2004 to 2006 about the influence of the media , political parties , advocacy groups , and vendors . concern about the influence of these groups increased again , slightly , from 2006 to 2008. leos were highly satisfied with whatever voting system they used but were less supportive of other kinds . their satisfaction declined from 2004 to 2006 for all systems except lever machines , but rebounded in 2008. they also rated their primary voting systems as very accurate , secure , reliable , and voter - and pollworker - friendly , no matter what system they used . however , the most common incident reported by respondents in both the 2006 and 2008 elections was malfunction of a direct recording ( dre ) or optical scan ( os ) electronic voting system . the incidence of long lines at polling places was highest in jurisdictions using dres . most dre users did not believe that voter - verified paper audit trails ( vvpat ) should be required , but nonusers believed they should be . however , the percentage of dre users who supported vvpat increased from 2004 to 2008 , and more vvpat users were satisfied with them in 2008 than in 2006. on average , leos mildly supported requiring photo identification for all voters and believed it would make elections more secure , even though they strongly believed that it will negatively affect turnout and did not believe that voter fraud is a problem in their jurisdictions . in all three surveys , leos believed that hava is making moderate improvements in the electoral process . the level of support declined from 2004 to 2006 but increased to its highest point in 2008. leos reported that hava has increased the accessibility of voting but has made elections more complicated and has increased their cost , though fewer believed so in 2008 than in 2006. leos spent much more time preparing for the election in 2008 than in 2004. they also believed that the increased complexity of elections is hindering recruitment of pollworkers . most found the activities of the election assistance commission ( eac ) that hava created moderately important , and that its helpfulness improved from 2006 to 2008. their assessment of the statewide voter - registration database was neutral in 2006 but positive in 2008. they believed that it was more accurate and fair than their previous registration system .
