to achieve medicare dme savings , congress required cms to implement a cbp in certain geographic areas for certain dme items . beginning in 2011 , cms began implementing the cbp in several phases . the agency estimates that the cbp will save the medicare program $ 19.7 billion between 2013 and 2022.the patient protection and affordable care act required cms to use cbp information to adjust fee - for - service payment rates for certain dme items in non - bid areas . on january 1 , 2016 , adjusted rates for 393 items went into effect in non - bid areas . cms estimated these adjustments will save the medicare program about $ 3.6 billion between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. gao was asked to review the potential effects of reduced payment rates for dme in non - bid areas . in this report , gao examines payment rate reductions and any changes in the number of suppliers ; any changes in the utilization of rate - adjusted items ; and available evidence related to potential changes in beneficiaries ' access to rate - adjusted items . gao compared non - adjusted 2015 fee - for - service payment rates to adjusted 2016 and 2017 rates and reviewed medicare claims data from 2010 through 2016. gao also reviewed cms 's monitoring activities and interviewed cms officials . in addition , gao interviewed select beneficiary advocacy groups and dme industry trade organizations . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) implemented a competitive bidding program ( cbp ) for certain durable medical equipment ( dme ) , such as wheelchairs and oxygen , in 2011 that is currently operating in 130 designated u.s. areas . on january 1 , 2016 , cms used information from the cbp to start adjusting medicare fee - for - service payment rates for certain dme throughout the country in areas that had previously not been subject to the cbp ( known as non - bid areas ) . for the first year adjusted rates were in effect in non - bid areas , gao found : reductions in payment rates were generally significant but varied by category of dme item . the unweighted average reduction in payment rates for the five rate - adjusted dme items with the highest expenditures in 2016 within each dme category was 46 percent . changes in the number of suppliers furnishing rate - adjusted items were generally consistent with the years before adjusted rates went into effect . gao found that the number of suppliers furnishing rate - adjusted items in non - bid areas in 2016 decreased 8 percent compared to 2015. gao 's review of medicare claims data found that beneficiary utilization of rate - adjusted items in non - bid areas in 2016 showed little change compared to 2015. gao also found that cms 's activities to monitor beneficiary access , including changes in health outcomes , showed little change between 2015 and 2016. gao interviewed several stakeholder groups that reported anecdotal examples of specific beneficiary access concerns they attributed to the rate adjustments , but stakeholders could not provide evidence to substantiate that the access issues were widespread . gao 's findings are consistent with cms 's monitoring results , which indicate that there were no widespread effects on beneficiary access in the year after the adjusted rates went into effect . however , some effects may take longer to appear , underscoring the importance of cms 's continued monitoring activities . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
