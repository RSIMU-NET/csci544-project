federal agencies collect and use personal information for various purposes from information resellers -- companies that amass and sell data from many sources . gao was asked to testify on its report being issued today on agency use of reseller data . for that report , gao was asked to determine how the departments of justice , homeland security , and state and the social security administration use personal data from resellers and to review the extent to which information resellers ' policies and practices reflect the fair information practices , a set of widely accepted principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal data . gao also examined agencies ' policies and practices for handling personal data from resellers to determine whether these reflect the fair information practices . in fiscal year 2005 , the departments of justice , homeland security , and state and the social security administration reported that they used personal information obtained from resellers for a variety of purposes , including performing criminal investigations , locating witnesses and fugitives , researching assets held by individuals of interest , and detecting prescription drug fraud . the agencies spent approximately $ 30 million on contractual arrangements with resellers that enabled the acquisition and use of such information . about 91 percent of the planned fiscal year 2005 spending was for law enforcement ( 69 percent ) or counterterrorism ( 22 percent ) . the major information resellers that do business with the federal agencies gao reviewed have practices in place to protect privacy , but these measures are not fully consistent with the fair information practices . for example , the principles that the collection and use of personal information should be limited and its intended use specified are largely at odds with the nature of the information reseller business , which is based on obtaining personal information from many sources and making it available to multiple customers for multiple purposes . resellers believe it is not appropriate for them to fully adhere to these principles because they do not obtain their information directly from individuals . nonetheless , in many cases , resellers take steps that address aspects of the fair information practices . for example , resellers reported that they have taken steps recently to improve their security safeguards , and they generally inform the public about key privacy principles and policies . however , resellers generally limit the extent to which individuals can gain access to personal information held about themselves , as well as the extent to which inaccurate information contained in their databases can be corrected or deleted . agency practices for handling personal information acquired from information resellers did not always fully reflect the fair information practices . that is , for some of these principles , agency practices were uneven . for example , although agencies issued public notices when they systematically collected personal information , these notices did not always notify the public that information resellers were among the sources to be used . this practice is not consistent with the principle that individuals should be informed about privacy policies and the collection of information . contributing to the uneven application of the fair information practices are ambiguities in guidance from the office of management and budget regarding the applicability of privacy requirements to federal agency uses of reseller information . in addition , agencies generally lack policies that specifically address these uses .
