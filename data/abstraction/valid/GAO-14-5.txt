a small federal agency , nmb facilitates labor relations in two key transportation sectors -- railroads and airlines -- through mediation and arbitration of labor disputes and overseeing union elections . established under the railway labor act , nmb 's primary responsibility is to prevent work stoppages in these critical industries . the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 required gao to evaluate nmb programs and activities . gao examined nmb 's strategic planning and performance measurement practices ; controls for key management areas ; and challenges , if any , in overseeing elections . gao assessed nmb 's management practices using internal control standards and other gao criteria ; interviewed nmb officials , current and former board members , and key stakeholders from rail and air labor and management groups ; and reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and nmb policies . the national mediation board ( nmb ) recently updated its strategic plan but is not meeting some federal strategic planning and performance measurement requirements . nmb missed deadlines for updating its strategic plan and lacks performance measures to assess its progress in meeting its goals , even though an agency 's strategic plan should form the basis for everything an agency does . nmb also lacks some controls in key management areas that could risk its resources and its success : financial accountability : nmb contracts for annual financial statement audits and internal control reviews . however , it lacks a formal process for addressing identified deficiencies , a key internal control . information technology : nmb recently transitioned to new information technology systems but is missing key management and security controls , including an information security program that fully implements federal requirements . human capital : nmb has taken steps to improve its human capital program but improvements are still needed . although all nmb senior managers are eligible for retirement , nmb has not engaged in formal workforce planning to identify gaps in staff skills , and strategies , such as training , to address them . procurement : nmb has established some key procurement policies and controls but weaknesses remain . for example , in a recent purchase of tablet computers for some staff , nmb did not follow its own procedures to assess the need for the devices or solicit competition . other management issues : nmb does not have an inspector general ( ig ) , and oversight by other federal agencies is limited . nmb also has a significant number of pending rail arbitration cases , and it lacks complete data on the types of cases filed to help it address the backlog and the costs . nmb has adapted to challenges presented by large union elections resulting from airline mergers and has implemented improvements such as online voting . in 2010 , nmb changed its rules for determining a majority in union elections . while this process caused disagreement among some stakeholders , nmb data suggest that the percentage of elections in which a union was certified has , thus far , remained relatively constant in the years before and after the rule change . congress should consider authorizing an appropriate federal agency 's ig to provide oversight of nmb . nmb should implement a formal strategic planning process and develop performance goals and measures to meet federal requirements , develop a process to address audit findings , implement key components of an information security and privacy program , and engage in strategic workforce planning . nmb should also collect and analyze data on the types of rail grievances filed to help improve efficiency in its arbitration process . in commenting on a draft of this report , nmb said it would address our recommendations and described actions it plans to take .
