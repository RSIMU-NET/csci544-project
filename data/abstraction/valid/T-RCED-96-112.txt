gao discussed management and budget problems facing the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) . gao noted that : weak internal controls , an ineffective organizational structure , an insufficient staff skill mix , and inadequate information and financial management systems have hampered hud ability to carry out its mission and led to gao designating hud as a high - risk area in january 1994 ; despite some progress in curing management deficiencies , problems persist and , as a result , will likely continue to make hud vulnerable to waste , fraud , and abuse ; hud and congress must try to reduce excessive housing subsidies , address the physical inadequacies of insured multifamily properties , maintain the single - family insurance fund 's financial health , address public housing 's social , management , and budget problems , and contain the costs of renewing housing subsidy contracts for lower - income families ; congress and hud also need to reexamine and reach consensus on housing and community development policy ; and hud downsizing will likely affect its ability to limit financial exposure , carry out its mission , and correct department - wide management and information system problems .
