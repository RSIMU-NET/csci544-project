the united states has long held to the principle that it will not return a foreign national to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened . this principle is embodied in several provisions of the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) , most notably in provisions defining refugees and asylees . aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate a well - founded fear that if returned home , they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics : race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . aliens present in the united states may apply for asylum with the united states citizenship and immigration services bureau ( uscis ) in the department of homeland security ( dhs ) after arrival into the country , or they may seek asylum before the department of justice 's executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) during removal proceedings . aliens arriving at a u.s. port who lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are placed in expedited removal ; however , if they express a fear of persecution , they receive a `` credible fear '' review with an uscis asylum officer and — if found credible — are referred to an eoir immigration judge for a hearing . in fy2004 , there were 27,551 claims for asylum filed with uscis , and 55,067 asylum cases filed with eoir in fy2004 . generally , over two - thirds of all asylum cases that eoir received were cases referred to the immigration judges by the asylum officers . the uscis asylum officers approved 10,101cases in fy2004 , a 32 % approval . of asylum cases eoir decided in fy2004 , the approval rate was 34 % . the total number of individuals who received asylum in fy2004 was 27,222 , down from a high of 38,641 in fy2001 . the individuals approved in fy2005 fell to 25,257. although there are many who would revise u.s. asylum law , those advocating change have divergent perspectives . some express concern that potential terrorists could use asylum as an avenue for entry into the united states , especially aliens from trouble spots in the mideast , northern africa and south asia . others argue that — given the religious , ethnic , and political violence in various countries around the world — it is becoming more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors . some assert that asylum has become an alternative pathway for immigration rather than humanitarian protection provided in extraordinary cases . others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people fleeing human rights violations or gender - based abuses that occur around the world . at the crux is the extent an asylum policy forged during the cold war can adapt to a changing world and the war on terrorism . during the 109th congress , major asylum provisions that were dropped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-458 ) were included in the real id act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-13 , division b ) . this law also eliminated the annual cap of 10,000 on asylee adjustments . the 110th congress may consider other revisions to asylum , especially in the context of comprehensive immigration reform . this report will be updated as warranted .
