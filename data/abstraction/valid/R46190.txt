the administrative procedure act ( apa ) , enacted in 1946 , is known primarily for its procedural requirements for notice - and - comment rulemaking . those requirements state that when issuing regulations , agencies must generally give public notice ( i.e . , issue a proposed rule ) , hold a public comment period , and publish a final rule . a lesser known provision in the apa is a petition mechanism through which any interested party can request an agency to issue , amend , or repeal a rule ( section 553 ( e ) ) . such petitions are sometimes referred to as 553 ( e ) petitions , petitions for rulemaking , petitions for reconsideration , administrative petitions , or citizens ' petitions . the apa petition mechanism is a potentially efficient ( and arguably underused ) means for an individual or stakeholder to call on an agency to take a particular action . although section 553 ( e ) is only one sentence in length and provides very little detail , other sections of the apa contain some additional requirements for agencies with regard to receiving , considering , and responding to rulemaking petitions . an agency is not necessarily required to grant the petition or take the requested action , but the apa does require the agency to consider the petition and respond and to do so `` within a reasonable time . . notably , however , agencies have a great deal of discretion in determining the specifics of their procedures for receiving , considering , and responding to petitions . in 2014 , the administrative conference of the united states ( acus ) found that `` few agencies have in place official procedures for accepting , processing , and responding to petitions for rulemaking '' and that `` how petitions are received and treated varies acrossâand even withinâagencies . . the apa 's requirement for a petition mechanism applies to all agencies covered by the apa , which includes executive agencies and independent regulatory agencies . the apa 's definition of rule is broad and covers a variety of agency actions , including several types of actions that are not subject to the apa 's notice - and - comment rulemaking procedures . such actions include agency interpretive rules and policy statementsâcategories that are often colloquially referred to as `` guidance documents '' âand rules of agency organization , procedure , and practice . thus , the petition mechanism could potentially be used for more than just rules that have undergone , or would be required to undergo , the apa 's notice - and - comment procedures . if an agency grants a petition for rulemakingâthus issuing , amending , or repealing a rule per request of the petitionerâany relevant procedural requirements for rulemaking or other type of action would still apply . furthermore , in taking any action pursuant to a petition , the agency may act only within the delegated authority congress has provided to it in statute . this report briefly discusses the origin of the apa petition mechanism , outlines the mechanism 's requirements for agencies , provides information from various outside sources about what may make an effective petition , discusses potential benefits to agencies and the public , and , finally , identifies some examples of statutory petition mechanisms that congress created in addition to the apa 's .
