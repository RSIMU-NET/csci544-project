since 1990 , dod has been conducting a congressionally directed test program related to how contractors report their subcontracting activities . the purpose of the program is to test whether using comprehensive subcontracting plans that cover multiple contracts across contractor plants , divisions , or entire companies can yield administrative cost savings and enhance small business subcontracting opportunities . despite the 25-year existence of the program , little is publicly known about its effectiveness . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision for gao to report on the results of the program . this report addresses the extent to which the program reduces administrative costs , and enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses . gao analyzed prior dod reviews and data on estimates of administrative costs savings ; reviewed program participants ' performance for enhancing small business subcontracting opportunities for fiscal years 2006 through 2013 ; and interviewed officials from dod , program participants , and small business advocacy groups . reviews commissioned by the department of defense ( dod ) concluded that the test program for negotiation of comprehensive small business subcontracting plans ( test program ) has resulted in the avoidance of millions of dollars in administrative costs for both program participants and dod . according to the review conducted in 2013 , the 12 firms then participating in the program avoided about $ 18.5 million in costs through the use of single comprehensive subcontracting plans rather than multiple individual subcontracting plans . also , a 2007 review estimated that dod avoided administrative costs of at least $ 45 million in fiscal year 2005. gao reviewed the methodologies used for these reviews and took other steps to validate their findings . according to dod officials , if the test program were terminated or allowed to expire , a significant one - time administrative cost of about $ 22 million could result to participants . gao 's analysis confirms this conclusion . test program participants and dod officials gao interviewed stated that the program also has resulted in non - financial benefits , including greater company - wide awareness of small business subcontracting opportunities . the participants gao interviewed said that without the program their companies might be less inclined to award subcontracts to small businesses . they emphasized , however , that the program 's continuing test status creates uncertainty and inhibits further expansion . the 2007 review recommended that dod work with congress to make the test program permanent ; however , dod has not acted on this recommendation . doing so could help eliminate uncertainty with the program . gao found that the test program enhanced small business subcontracting opportunities , although participants ' performance in meeting individual goals has varied . participants are evaluated on their achievement of negotiated initiatives and goals in their comprehensive subcontracting plans . gao 's analysis of performance reports found that participants made acceptable progress on their initiatives 87 percent of the time , thus providing tangible subcontracting opportunities for small businesses . for example , during fiscal years 2006 through 2013 , program participants redirected nearly $ 93 million in subcontracts from large businesses to small businesses . participants also achieved a 72-percent success rate in increasing small business subcontracts in areas such as integrated circuits and information technology , thus addressing a concern among some small businesses that high - end technical work was not being subcontracted under the program . the 2013 dod review estimated that participant initiatives could amount to as much as $ 1.8 billion per year in increased small business opportunities . gao 's analysis found that participants did not always meet individual goals , in part due to the challenging nature of these goals . however , gao also found that their combined performance from fiscal years 2006 through 2013 resulted in subcontract awards to small businesses that exceeded aggregate goals by about $ 5.4 billion . the annual performance reviews of the participants , which take into account performance on both initiatives and goals , have been largely positive . congress should consider making the program permanent . gao also recommends that dod work with congress on the program 's status . dod agreed . dod disagreed with a recommendation to draft a legislative proposal to make the program permanent . gao subsequently modified the recommendation and added the matter for congress .
