the world trade organization ( wto ) is of interest to the 109th congress for several reasons . first , house members considered a joint resolution ( h.j.res . 27 ) to withdraw congressional approval of the agreement establishing the wto . the house ways and means committee reported the resolution adversely on may 26 , 2005 , and the full house disapproved the resolution by a vote of 338-86 on june 9 , 2005. debate on the resolution offered members an opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of wto participation and examine other aspects of wto membership . second , the 109th congress will monitor wto disputes involving u.s. interests and possibly consider whether or not to amend u.s. laws to address wto dispute panel findings . members have criticized the wto dispute process for several reasons , but the process does offer a stable multilateral forum for trade disputes . third , the united states and other wto members are actively engaged in a multilateral round of trade negotiations in the wto . the 109th congress is monitoring those negotiations . final agreements are not expected until 2006 or later . in a report submitted to congress on march 2 , 2005 , on the costs and benefits of continued participation in the wto , the administration cited a number of statistics that show growth in the u.s. and world economies since establishment of the wto . whether the growth cited was the result exclusively or mainly of activity in the wto is arguable . academic studies indicate that the united states would gain substantially from broad reductions in trade barriers worldwide . at the same time , some workers and industries might not share in those gains . questions of governance and power are among the issues at the heart of the debate on the wto . major decisions in the wto are made by member governments , who determine their negotiating positions , file dispute challenges , and implement their decisions . however , some challenge the claim that the wto is democratic in nature by arguing that smaller countries are left out of the decision - making and that governments tend to represent large commercial interests only . the united states has been a frequent participant in wto dispute proceedings , both as a complainant and as a respondent . there have been many complaints of the wto dispute process , including the arguments that countries do not adhere to decisions and that u.s. trade remedy laws have not been judged properly . on the other hand , this multilateral trade dispute forum is unique , and the united states has been successful in many of its challenges . other issues include ( 1 ) the relationship between wto rules and a country 's right to establish domestic standards for labor , the environment , food safety , and other areas ; and ( 2 ) u.s. policy toward developing countries , including a balance between providing assistance to those countries in the wto and addressing their demands in trade negotiations .
