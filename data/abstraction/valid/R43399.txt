in march 2013 , president obama notified congress that his administration would seek a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) with the european union ( eu ) . in addition to addressing tariffs and other trade restrictions , the negotiations seek to reduce regulatory barriers to transatlantic commerce . among the barriers under discussion are those affecting motor vehicles . although many automakers build and sell cars in both regions , they must comply with very different safety , fuel economy , and emissions standards , as well as different regulatory processes . ttip negotiators are seeking to identify ways to narrow the regulatory differences , potentially reducing costs and spurring additional trade in vehicles . u.s. and eu automakers support this initiative , which they see as furthering economic and vehicle design trends already under way . the complexity of complying with different greenhouse gas emissions regulations is also a factor in the industry 's support . this report looks at ways in which ttip might lead to a convergence of motor vehicle regulatory regimes on both sides of the atlantic . these regimes govern three distinct aspects of vehicle manufacturing and involve a number of u.s. and eu agencies . safety . u.s. automakers self - certify that they are meeting u.s. vehicle standards . in europe , vehicles must obtain `` type approval '' from a government before an automaker can bring out a new model . emissions . u.s. and eu emissions regulations are administered by the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) and the european commission ( ec ) , respectively . while u.s. and ec rules address a similar range of pollutants , including carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxide , and non - methane organic oxides , allowable emissions levels in the eu are different from those in the united states â€” and they are stricter in more than a dozen u.s. states than in the other states . the united states and the eu have similar `` type approval '' systems for new engine models . fuel efficiency . auto manufacturers selling in the united states must meet the corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) standards enforced by the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) . under the obama administration , greenhouse gases ( ghg ) in vehicle emissions are being regulated for the first time , making fuel economy standard - setting a joint venture between nhtsa and epa . the eu does not directly set fuel economy standards , but it effectively does so by regulating greenhouse gas emissions of new vehicles . there are several different ways a ttip agreement could promote convergence of automobile regulation , from harmonizing existing u.s. and eu rules to providing for mutual recognition of some or all automotive standards . if a ttip agreement is reached , it will be subject to congressional approval . to the extent that such an agreement would require changes in motor vehicle regulatory processes or standards , it is possible that congress will be asked to modify statutes that govern motor vehicle safety , emissions , and fuel economy .
