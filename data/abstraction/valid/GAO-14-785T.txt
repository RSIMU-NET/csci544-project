recent biosecurity incidents — such as the june 5 , 2014 , potential exposure of staff in atlanta laboratories at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) to live spores of a strain of anthrax — highlight the importance of maintaining biosafety and biosecurity protocols at high - containment laboratories . this statement summarizes the results of gao 's past work on the oversight of high - containment laboratories , those designed for handling dangerous pathogens and emerging infectious diseases . specifically , this statement addresses the need for governmentwide strategic planning for the requirements for high - containment laboratories , including assessment of their risks ; the need for national standards for designing , constructing , commissioning , operating , and maintaining such laboratories ; and the oversight of biosafety and biosecurity at high - containment laboratories . in addition , it provides gao 's preliminary observations on the potential exposure of cdc staff to anthrax . for this preliminary work , gao reviewed agency documents , including a report on the potential exposure , and scientific literature ; and interviewed cdc officials . no federal entity is responsible for strategic planning and oversight of high - containment laboratories . since the 1990s , the number of high - containment laboratories has risen ; however , the expansion of high - containment laboratories was not based on a government - wide coordinated strategy . instead , the expansion was based on the perceptions of individual agencies about the capacity required for their individual missions and the high - containment laboratory activities needed to meet those missions , as well as the availability of congressionally approved funding . consequent to this mode of expansion , there was no research agenda linking all these agencies , even at the federal level , that would allow for a national needs assessment , strategic plan , or coordinated oversight . as gao last reported in 2013 , after more than 12 years , gao has not been able to find any detailed projections based on a government - wide strategic evaluation of research requirements based on public health or national security needs . without this information , there is little assurance of having facilities with the right capacity to meet the nation 's needs . gao 's past work has found a continued lack of national standards for designing , constructing , commissioning , and operating high - containment laboratories . as noted in a 2009 report , the absence of national standards means that the laboratories may vary from place to place because of differences in local building requirements or standards for safe operations . some guidance exists about designing , constructing , and operating high - containment laboratories . specifically , the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories guidance recommends various design , construction , and operations standards , but gao 's work has found it is not universally followed . the guidance also does not recommend an assessment of whether the suggested design , construction , and operational standards are achieved . as gao has reported , national standards are valuable not only in relation to new laboratory construction but also in ensuring compliance for periodic upgrades . no one agency is responsible for determining the aggregate or cumulative risks associated with the continued expansion of high - containment laboratories ; according to experts and federal officials gao interviewed for prior work , the oversight of these laboratories is fragmented and largely self - policing . on july 11 , 2014 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) released a report on the potential exposure to anthrax that described a number of actions that cdc plans to take within its responsibilities to avoid another incident like the one in june . the incident in june was caused when a laboratory scientist inadvertently failed to sterilize plates containing samples of anthrax , derived with a new method , and transferred them to a facility with lower biosecurity protocols . this incident and the inherent risks of biosecurity highlight the need for a national strategy to evaluate the requirements for high - containment laboratories , set and maintain national standards for such laboratories ' construction and operation , and maintain a national strategy for the oversight of laboratories that conduct important work on highly infectious pathogens . this testimony contains no new recommendations , but gao has made recommendations in prior reports to responsible agencies .
