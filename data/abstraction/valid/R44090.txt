recent expansion in natural gas production has made the resource an increasingly significant component in the u.s. energy market . further , a number of policies recently proposed and / or promulgated at the federal , state , and local levels may serve to accelerate this development . examples of federal policies include u.s. environmental protection agency air standards for power plants and vehicles , as well as bills introduced in the 114th congress to promote increased natural gas production on federal lands , amend provisions in the tax code to incentivize natural gas production and use , and streamline the approval , permitting , and / or construction of natural gas infrastructure . many of these proposals promote technology and infrastructure investments that could be significant and long lasting . for this reason , some stakeholders recommend a thorough analysis of the costs and benefits of these proposals as well as a full assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of increased natural gas development . fuel - switching strategies from other fossil fuels to natural gas have the potential to impact many segments of the general economy , including jobs , investments , infrastructure , national security , human health , safety , and the environment . a full assessment of the costs and benefits of these strategies would demand an integrated analysis across all issues . some contend that an important component of this assessment would be a comparative analysis of the various fuels ' greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions . however , reports in the scientific literature and popular press have created some confusion about the climate implications of natural gas . on the one hand , a shift to natural gas is promoted as climate change mitigation because natural gas combustion has a lower carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions intensity than either oil or coal . on the other hand , methane , the primary constituent of natural gas , is itself a more potent ghg than co2 , and some contend that methane leakage from the production , transport , and use of natural gas has the potential to offset the ghg emissions benefits of switching . the net climate impact of replacing other fossil fuels with natural gas depends upon a number of analytic assumptions , including the choice of fuel , end - use sector , equipment , and processes modeled . this report presents a comparative analysis of the potential climate implications of switching from coal to natural gas in the domestic electric power generating sector . the findings include the following : natural gas , when combusted at different types of existing u.s. power plants , produces anywhere from 42 % to 63 % of the co2 emissions of coal , depending upon the power plant technology . however , in order to more fully assess the climate impacts of a fuel employed in the power sector , analyses aim to aggregate emissions across the entire supply and utilization chain ( i.e . , from extraction to end use ) . such analyses are referred to as life - cycle assessments ( lcas ) . due to its potency as a ghg , methane lost to the atmosphere during the production and transport of fossil fuels ( i.e . , fugitive emissions ) can greatly impact the life - cycle ghg emissions estimates for power generation . the department of energy currently estimates a fugitive emissions rate ( fer ) of around 1 % in natural gas systems ; a number of academic studies estimate rates in the range of 2 % - 4 % . further , due to its chemical composition , methane 's climate impacts are significantly more pronounced in the short term as compared to the long term . thus , when considering existing power plants , the average natural - gas - fired combined cycle technology produces approximately 50 % of the life - cycle ghg emissions of coal - fired steam generation , both in the short and the long terms , given a fer of around 1 % . however , when considering other existing natural - gas - fired technologies ( e.g . single cycle ) or advanced technologies , the comparative life - cycle emissions benefits of natural gas are reduced . further , when considering the possibility of higher fers ( e.g . , 2 % - 4 % ) , the life - cycle ghg emissions of both existing and advanced natural - gas - fired technology may be comparable to coal - fired technology in the short term and could remain within range of coal - fired technology for several decades after emissions .
