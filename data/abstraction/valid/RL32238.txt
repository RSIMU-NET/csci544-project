the bush administration identified transformation as a major goal for the department of defense ( dod ) soon after taking office , and initially justified many of its proposals for dod on the grounds that they were needed for defense transformation . although defense transformation is still discussed in administration defense - policy documents and budget - justification materials , the concept is now less prominent in discussions of u.s. defense policy and programs than it was during the earlier years of the bush administration . the administration 's vision for defense transformation calls for placing increased emphasis in u.s. defense planning on the following : irregular warfare , including terrorism , insurgencies , and civil war ; potential catastrophic security threats , such as the possession and possible use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists and rogue states ; and potential disruptive events , such as the emergence of new technologies that could undermine current u.s. military advantages . the administration 's vision for defense transformation calls for shifting u.s. military forces toward a greater reliance on joint operations , network - centric warfare , effects - based operations , speed and agility , and precision application of firepower . transformation could affect the defense industrial base by transferring funding from `` legacy '' systems to transformational systems , and from traditional dod contractors to firms that previously have not done much defense work . potential oversight issues for congress regarding defense transformation include the potential for dod transformation plans to change as a result of robert gates succeeding donald rumsfeld as secretary of defense ; the merits of certain elements of dod 's transformation plan ; overall leadership and management of transformation ; experiments and exercises conducted in support of transformation ; measures for creating a culture of innovation viewed as necessary to support transformation ; the adequacy of information provided to congress regarding transformation - related initiatives ; and whether the administration has invoked the term transformation as an all - purpose rhetorical tool for justifying its various proposals for dod . this report will be updated as events warrant .
