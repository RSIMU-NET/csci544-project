strategic workforce planning can help dod determine whether it has the civilian personnel with the necessary skills and competencies to perform a wide variety of duties and responsibilities , including mission - essential combat - support functions , such as logistics and maintenance , that traditionally have been performed by uniformed military personnel . in 2006 , congress enacted a requirement for dod to produce strategic workforce plans , and gao first reported on dod 's plans in 2008. the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 mandates that gao report to congress on these plans . gao evaluated the extent to which dod 's fiscal year 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan addressed statutory requirements ; and dod 's plan is consistent with key strategic workforce - planning principles . gao examined dod 's fiscal year 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan and associated documents , relevant legislation , and key strategic workforce - planning principles , and interviewed officials from across the department involved in producing the plan . the department of defense 's ( dod ) fiscal year 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan addressed or partially addressed 27 of the 32 statutory reporting requirements and did not address 5 of the requirements . the statute requires dod , for example , to conduct assessments of critical skills and competencies , to assess gaps in the workforce , and to assess the appropriate mix of civilian , military , and contractor capabilities . dod has taken steps to address many of its reporting requirements since 2008. however , dod has not yet addressed the requirement to assess the appropriate mix of civilian , military , and contractor capabilities in its plan , as shown in the table below . gao previously has made 10 recommendations regarding statutory compliance covering a range of issues . in addition to recommending that dod conduct the required assessments , gao also has recommended providing clearer guidance for developing the plan and enhancing performance measures and is not making further recommendations related to statutory compliance at this time . dod 's strategic workforce plan does not fully incorporate key strategic workforce - planning principles . there are six key strategic workforce - planning principles , and most are similar to elements of the statutory reporting requirements , such as assessing critical skills and competencies . a key principle that is not addressed in the statutory requirements is strategic alignment , which links workforce strategies to an agency 's mission and goals , and aligns them with , among other things , budget formulation . dod 's 2013-2018 plan noted the need to integrate the department 's plan with the budget process but did not include specific details and , according to officials , dod does not have actions underway to do so . further , the plan identified strategies addressing some critical - skill staffing gaps , but did not provide specific information on the funding required to implement most of these strategies . the plan also did not align with recent recruiting , retention , and readiness initiatives to improve the morale of dod 's civilian workforce as reported to congressional defense committees . without aligning its workforce plan with the budget process and management workforce initiatives , such as those to address recruiting and retention issues associated with declining morale , the department will not be in the best position to make informed management and resource decisions about its workforce . gao recommends that dod align its workforce plans with the budget process and other workforce management initiatives . dod concurred with gao 's recommendation .
