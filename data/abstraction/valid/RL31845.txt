the u.s. government has always protected scientific and technical information that might compromise national security . since the 2001 terrorist attacks , controls have been widened onaccess to information and scientific components that could threaten national security . the policychallenge is to balance science and security without compromising national security , scientificprogress , and constitutional and statutory protections . this report summarizes ( 1 ) provisions of thepatent law ; atomic energy act ; international traffic in arms control regulations ; the usapatriot act , p.l . 107-56 ; the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and responseact of 2002 , p.l . 107-188 ; and the homeland security act , p.l . 107-296 , that permit governmentalrestrictions on either privately generated or federally owned scientific and technical information thatcould harm national security ; ( 2 ) the evolution of federal concepts of `` sensitive but unclassified '' ( sbu ) information ; ( 3 ) controversies about pending department of homeland security guidance onfederal sbu and `` sensitive homeland security information '' ( shsi ) ; and ( 4 ) policy options . even before the terrorist attacks of 2001 , federal agencies used the label sbu to safeguard from public disclosure information that does not meet standards for classification in executive order12958 or national security decision directive 189. new executive order 13292 might widen thescope of scientific and technological information to be classified to deter terrorism . sbu has notbeen defined in statutory law . when using the term , some agencies refer to definitions for controlledinformation , such as `` sensitive , '' in the computer security act , and to information exempt fromdisclosure in the freedom of information act ( foia ) and the privacy act . the identification ofinformation to be released pursuant to these laws may be discretionary , subject to agencyinterpretation and risk analysis . the white house and the department of justice recently widenedthe applicability of sbu . critics say the lack of a clear sbu definition complicates designing policies to safeguard such information and that , if information needs to be safeguarded , it should be classified . others say thatwider controls will deny access to information needed for oversight and scientific communication . p.l . 107-296 required the president to issue guidance on safeguarding sbu homeland securityinformation , a function assigned to the department of homeland security secretary in executiveorder 13311 ; action is pending . issues of possible interest to congress include designing uniformconcepts and procedures to share and safeguard sbu information ; standardizing penalties forunauthorized disclosure ; designing an appeals process ; assessing the pros and cons of wider sbucontrols ; and evaluating the implications of giving some research agency heads originalclassification authority . on february 20 , 2004 , dhs published a rule to protect voluntarilysubmitted critical infrastructure information . some professional groups are starting to limitpublication of some `` sensitive '' privately controlled scientific and technical information . theiractions may be guided by federal policy . this report will not be updated .
