the federal government spends approximately $ 137 billion annually on research and development — mostly at dod , doe , nasa , and nih — to further agencies ' missions , including at federal labs . multiple laws have directed agencies and labs to encourage commercial use of their inventions , in part by licensing patents , to private sector companies and others that aim to further develop and bring the inventions to market . gao was asked to review agency practices for managing inventions developed at federal labs , with a particular focus on patent licensing . this report examines challenges in licensing patents and steps taken to address and report them and information to guide establishing financial terms in patent licenses at dod , doe , nasa , and nih . gao reviewed relevant literature , laws , and agency documents , including patent licenses from 2014 , to match the most recent nist summary report when the licenses were requested , and gao interviewed agency officials and knowledgeable stakeholders , including organizations that assist federal labs in licensing patents . federal agency and laboratory ( lab ) officials identified challenges in licensing patents across the federal government , and agencies have taken some steps to address and report them . patent licensing is a technology transfer activity that allows , for example , federal inventions to be legally transferred to the private sector for commercial use . specifically , officials at the departments of defense ( dod ) and energy ( doe ) , national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and national institutes of health ( nih ) , as well as external stakeholders , noted challenges in having researchers identify potentially patentable inventions . dod , doe , and nih officials also cited having inadequate internal systems to keep track of inventions developed in the labs . in addition , several stakeholders stated that licensing patented inventions can be lengthy and bureaucratic , which may deter companies from licensing . the agencies reported taking steps to address these challenges , such as implementing model license agreements across labs to expedite the process . the department of commerce has delegated to its national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) to annually report agencies ' technology transfer activities , including patent licensing . although nist has reported some challenges , it has not fully reported the range of challenges identified by agency and lab officials and stakeholders . nist officials stated that they were generally aware of the challenges but had not considered including them to a greater degree in their annual reports to congress . by fully reporting the range of challenges in federal patent licensing , nist has the opportunity to further ensure that congress is more aware of challenges that limit agencies ' efforts and ways for potentially addressing those challenges . federal agencies and labs have limited information to guide officials when establishing the financial terms of patent licenses . for example , while federal labs can use comparable licenses to help establish financial terms , their access to information on comparable licenses from other labs varies , and such information is not formally shared among the agencies . based on its established interagency role , nist is best positioned to assist agencies in sharing information on comparable licenses , in accordance with leading practices for interagency collaboration . by doing so , nist would provide federal agencies and labs with useful information that can help them better establish financial terms and successfully license inventions . gao is making seven recommendations , including that commerce instruct nist to fully report the range of challenges in federal patent licensing in its annual reports to congress and facilitate information sharing among agencies . commerce , dod , doe , nasa , and nih generally agreed with gao 's recommendations and are taking steps to implement them .
