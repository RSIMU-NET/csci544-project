the department of state ( state ) has designated about two - thirds of its 268 overseas posts as hardship posts . staff working at such posts often encounter harsh conditions , including inadequate medical facilities and high crime . many of these posts are vital to u.s. foreign policy objectives and need a full complement of staff with the right skills to carry out the department 's priorities . as such , state offers staff at these posts a hardship differential -- an additional adjustment to basic pay -- to compensate officers for the conditions they encounter and as a recruitment and retention incentive . gao was asked to assess state 's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts since 2006 and the effect of any remaining gaps , and the extent to which state has used incentives to address staffing gaps at hardship posts . gao analyzed state data ; reviewed relevant documents ; met with officials in washington , d.c. ; and conducted fieldwork in five hardship posts . despite some progress in addressing staffing shortfalls since 2006 , state 's diplomatic readiness remains at risk due to persistent staffing and experience gaps at key hardship posts . several factors contribute to these gaps . first , state continues to have fewer officers than positions , a shortage compounded by the personnel demands of iraq and afghanistan . second , while state has reduced its mid - level experience gap , the department does not anticipate eliminating this gap until 2012 and continues to face difficulties attracting experienced applicants to hardship posts -- especially posts of greatest hardship . third , although state 's assignment system has prioritized the staffing of hardship posts , it does not explicitly address the continuing experience gap at such posts , many of which are strategically important , yet are often staffed with less experienced officers . staffing and experience gaps can diminish diplomatic readiness in several ways , according to state officials . for example , gaps can lead to decreased reporting coverage , loss of institutional knowledge , and increased supervisory requirements for senior staff , detracting from other critical diplomatic responsibilities . state uses a range of incentives to staff hardship posts , but their effectiveness remains unclear due to a lack of evaluation . incentives to serve in hardship posts range from monetary benefits to changes in service and bidding requirements , such as reduced tour lengths at posts where dangerous conditions prevent some family members from accompanying officers . in a 2006 report on staffing gaps , gao recommended that state evaluate the effectiveness of its incentive programs for hardship post assignments . in response , state added a question about hardship incentives to a recent employee survey . however , the survey does not fully meet gao 's recommendation for several reasons , including that state did not include several incentives in the survey . state also did not comply with a legal requirement to assess the effectiveness of increasing danger and hardship pay in filling certain posts . recent legislation increasing foreign service officers ' basic pay will increase the cost of existing incentives , thereby heightening the importance that state evaluate its incentives for hardship post assignments to ensure resources are effectively targeted and not wasted .
