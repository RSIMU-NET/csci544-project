floods are the most common and destructive natural disaster in the united states . the national flood insurance program , which fema administers , has struggled financially to both pay for flood losses and keep rates affordable . to address these and other challenges , congress has passed legislation including the homeowners flood insurance affordability act of 2014 ( hfiaa ) . hfiaa included provisions for fema to conduct a study and submit a report that assesses and recommends options , methods , and strategies for making cbfi available through nfip . fema presented the study and related report to congress in march 2016. hfiaa also includes a provision for gao to review the fema report , which is to include the study and submit a related report to congress . to review the study and report fema submitted to congress , gao analyzed the fema study 's objectives , methodology , and findings , and evaluated the fema report 's conclusions . gao analyzed the appropriateness of the objectives , the reasonableness of the methodology , and the extent to which the conclusions were supported by the findings . gao also evaluated relevant study findings against public policy goals for federal involvement in catastrophe insurance previously identified by gao , and interviewed fema and nas officials . gao is not making recommendations in this report . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) used reasonable objectives and methodology for its study on community - based flood insurance ( cbfi ) â€” flood insurance that a community would purchase to cover all properties located within it . fema contracted with the national academy of sciences ( nas ) to conduct the study , and worked with nas to design a study that would provide a high - level , independent discussion of issues related to cbfi . according to fema officials , such a study would help fema decide whether cbfi should be implemented , an important step before developing any plans to implement cbfi . once the study was designed , nas conducted the study independently , using input obtained from an expert committee that met twice in early 2015. the members of the committee represented academia , the private sector , and state and federal government . gao determined that the study objectives were designed to meet fema 's needs , the methodology supported the objectives , and alternative methodologies that were considered would have faced various limitations . in its report submitted to congress , which contained the study , fema concluded that it should not conduct further related research or implement cbfi . specifically , it concluded that the challenges outlined in the study outweigh any potential benefit when considered against limited community interest . fema officials further cited the need to dedicate fema 's resources to effective national flood insurance program ( nfip ) reform . based on the factors cited by fema officials , and the consistency of these factors with findings in prior gao reports on nfip , gao determined that fema 's conclusion was reasonable . for example , prior gao work has highlighted challenges fema faces in balancing reform efforts with limited resources . in prior work , gao identified four public policy goals for federal involvement in natural catastrophe insurance and used them to evaluate changes to nfip . while the fema study did not use these goals , as part of its assessment gao evaluated relevant elements of the study against them . for example , one of these goals is charging premium rates that fully reflect actual risk , and the study discussed innovative uses of cbfi that could help nfip charge such rates . another goal is encouraging private markets to provide natural catastrophe insurance , and the study discusses ways in which cbfi could encourage private market participation in flood insurance markets , as well as challenges that cbfi would pose to private insurers .
