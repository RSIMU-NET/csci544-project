gao discussed its work on the department of defense 's ( dod ) latest reform initiatives , focusing on : risks associated with reducing budgets before savings are achieved ; challenges associated with implementing dod 's various business process reengineering initiatives ; opportunities to capitalize on consolidation and regionalization opportunities ; and underlying management problems that need to be addressed in implementing the reform initiatives . gao noted that : dod 's plans to reduce outyear budgets before the magnitude of savings is clearly known are not without risks ; this risk is that operating units and field commanders will not have sufficient funds to meet their readiness needs ; past reform initiatives , like the defense management review of the early 1990s , started with much the same hope and promise of the defense reform initiative ( dri ) ; however , for a number of reasons , they were not able to sustain themselves and fully achieve hoped for results ; in many cases , dod reduced its operations and maintenance budgets up front , in anticipation that the savings would be realized ; when these savings did not materialize as quickly or to the extent expected , two things happened ; either money was deferred from other parts of the defense budget to pay for shortfalls in operations and maintenance accounts or support functions were unfunded ; gao sees the same type of risk with the dri ; many of the dri business process reengineering initiatives must overcome significant challenges if they are to be implemented in a timely , efficient , and effective manner ; while dod expects these initiatives to save an unspecified amount of money , it is also counting on them to bring world - class business processes to dod and improve the quality of service provided to defense customers ; gao 's overall impression is that the initiatives have the potential to save significant amounts of money and improve the quality of service they provide ; however , in some cases , dod either faces significant implementation challenges or is not thinking broadly enough in implementing the reform ; significant opportunities exist to achieve savings from consolidating , restructuring , and regionalizing initiatives ; however , gao 's past work on these initiatives shows that dod has not been able to fully capitalize on the potential offered by such consolidations ; and achieving success in the dris requires dod to address the underlying causes of its systemic management problems .
