since 1990 , the government accountability office ( gao ) has identified the medicare program as at risk for improper payments and fraud , and , since 2004 , has issued 12 products documenting various program vulnerabilities . as noted by gao and other public and private analysts , medicare 's vulnerability to fraud and abuse arises from the program 's size , complexity , decentralization , and administrative requirements . although a good estimate of the dollar amount lost to medicare fraud and abuse is open to discussion , analysts agree that billions of dollars are lost . administering the volume of claims ( more than 4.5 million per work day ) from medicare 's many providers and suppliers ( over 1 million ) is a daunting task . requirements to process and pay provider reimbursement claims quickly have set up a `` pay and chase '' approach that complicates program integrity efforts . in general , initiatives designed to fight fraud and abuse are considered program integrity activities . these include processes directed at reducing payment errors as well as activities to prevent , detect , investigate , and ultimately prosecute health care fraud . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) responsible for medicare administration and program integrity , oversees private contractors that perform activities such as provider audits , reviewing claims for medical necessity , and conducting investigations . these contractors develop and refer suspected fraud cases to the hhs office of the inspector general ( hhs / oig ) and the department of justice ( doj ) for further investigation and prosecution . cms has made considerable progress in improving program integrity oversight as well as in reporting on medicare program integrity . with increased mandatory and discretionary funding , cms 's ability to wage a consistent , coordinated program integrity campaign has improved . nonetheless , some issues remain , including the need to further improve the identification , monitoring , and reporting of fraud and abuse , and to provide more information on program integrity resource allocation decisions and results . medicare program integrity activities are funded in statute , largely through the health care fraud and abuse control ( hcfac ) and medicare integrity programs ( mip ) , which were both established by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa , p.l . 104-191 ) . hipaa provided cms and federal law enforcement agencies with dedicated funds to coordinate federal , state , and local activities to fight health care fraud . beginning in fy2009 , congress approved additional discretionary funds to enhance these efforts . further hcfac funding was provided under health care reform â€” the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca , p.l . 111-148 as amended ) . ppaca increased hcfac mandatory funding by $ 350 million over the period from fy2011 to fy2020 . ppaca also strengthened and added a number of new tools for cms to help bolster medicare 's program integrity activities . this report provides an overview of medicare program integrity . a description of key program integrity activities is presented as well as a discussion of the role that private contractors and law enforcement agencies play in maintaining medicare 's integrity . detailed information on federal funding for program integrity efforts also is presented . the report concludes with a summary and analysis of medicare 's program integrity oversight and a discussion of recent initiatives , including program integrity provisions in the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l . 112-25 ) , which became law on august 2 , 2011 .
