wildfires burn millions of acres annually . most burnt land can recover naturally , but a small percentage needs short - term emergency treatment to stabilize burnt land that threatens public safety , property , or ecosystems or longer - term treatments to rehabilitate land unlikely to recover naturally . the department of the interior ( interior ) and the department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) forest service -- the two departments that manage most federal land -- spend millions of dollars annually on such treatments . gao was asked to describe the two departments ' processes for implementing their programs , identify the costs and types of treatments implemented , and determine whether these treatments are effective . both interior and usda 's forest service use multidisciplinary teams of experts , such as ecologists and soil scientists , to assess damage and potential risks burnt land poses and to develop emergency stabilization and rehabilitation plans that identify needed treatments to reduce or eliminate those risks . the two departments differ in how they manage their programs , however . interior uses a single process to assess damage and identify treatments for short - term emergency stabilization and longer - term rehabilitation , while usda 's forest service uses different processes for each of these two treatment types . the two departments recognize these differences and recently agreed to work toward standardizing certain aspects of their programs , such as definitions and time frames . following the 2000 and 2001 fires , the forest service obligated $ 192 million and interior $ 118 million for 421 emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatment plans gao reviewed . treatments included seeding ; fencing ; installing soil erosion barriers such as straw bundles , or wattles ; and road or trail work . most of interior 's land -- managed by the bureau of land management -- consists of rangeland . thus , the bureau primarily seeded native grasses to retain soils and forage for cattle and wildlife and fenced to prevent grazing . forest service land is often steeply sloped and includes watersheds used for drinking water and timber . the forest service primarily seeded fast - growing grasses and built soil erosion barriers for emergency stabilization , and worked on roads , trails and reforested for rehabilitation . neither the departments nor gao could determine whether emergency stabilization and rehabilitation treatments were achieving their intended results . the departments require that treatments be monitored , but they do not specify how and the type of data to collect or analyze for determining effectiveness . the departments have stressed the need to systematically collect and share monitoring data for treatment decisions . yet neither has developed a national interagency system to do so . therefore , the nature and extent of data collection , analysis , and sharing vary widely . the departments recognize that they need better information on treatment effectiveness . however , they have not yet committed to this effort .
