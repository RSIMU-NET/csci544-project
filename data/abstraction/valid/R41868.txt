the u.s. - south korea free trade agreement ( korus fta ) was signed on june 30 , 2007. the provisions on the automotive sector were among the most difficult areas negotiated , and were among those in which the obama administration and south korean officials reached further agreement on december 3 , 2010. the agreement 's effect on the automotive sector has drawn particular scrutiny as congress considers implementation of the korus fta . in particular , the specific rules of origin ( roo ) for automobiles and auto parts have become a matter of debate . these rules determine whether the products imported into an fta participating country are eligible to receive the duty - free or reduced tariff benefits of the agreement . for autos and auto parts , a certain percentage of the parts , labor , and other associated costs must come from the region . this is known as a regional value content ( rvc ) test . few vehicles built today are built of parts made in any one country . the roughly 15,000 parts needed to produce a single motor vehicle are typically supplied by a complex web of manufacturers located throughout the world . this makes it challenging to determine whether a particular vehicle or a complex component , such as an engine or a transmission , qualifies for duty - free access to the u.s. or south korean markets under the korus fta . based on analysis of the regional value content required under the korus fta rules of origin , a significant proportion of a vehicle 's value would need to originate in south korea or the united states for that vehicle to enter the united states duty - free . simply assembling a product from inputs obtained from other countries would likely result in insufficient regional value content for a product to qualify for the tariff benefits of the korus fta . it appears that the requirements under the korus fta are roughly equivalent to those imposed upon south korean and european union vehicles under the south korea - european union free trade agreement , which takes effect july 1 , 2011. content produced in north korea is not presently allowed into the united states , a situation that the korus fta would not change . if at some future time the united states were to ease trade restrictions on north korea , u.s. and south korean negotiators would then need to discuss the treatment of north korean inputs to south korean products under the agreement . the korus fta contains provisions to promote cooperation between the two countries ' customs officials . nonetheless , ensuring that north korean parts are not used in south korean products exported to the united states will remain a challenge , whether or not the korus fta takes effect .
