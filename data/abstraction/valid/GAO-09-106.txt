workers who `` blow the whistle '' on prohibited practices play a role in enforcing federal laws , but these workers risk reprisals from their employers . the whistleblower protection program at the department of labor 's ( labor ) occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) is responsible for investigating whistleblowers ' complaints . osha 's decisions generally may be appealed to the office of administrative law judges ( oalj ) and , ultimately , the administrative review board ( arb ) . gao examined what is known about processing times for complaints and what affects these times , what outcomes resulted , and what challenges osha faces in administering the program . to answer these questions , gao analyzed electronic data files from osha , oalj , and arb ; visited five osha regional offices ; reviewed case files ; conducted a web - based survey of investigators ; and interviewed key officials . labor lacks reliable information on processing times and , as a result , can not accurately report how long it takes to investigate and close a case or decide on certain appeals . osha does not have an effective mechanism to ensure that the data are accurately recorded in its database , and gao 's file reviews revealed that the key dates are often inaccurately recorded in the database or can not be verified due to a lack of supporting documentation . for example , in one region visited , none of the case closed dates matched the documentation in case files . at the appeals level , the reliability of information on the processing times is mixed . timeliness data at the oalj level are reliable , and the oalj completed appealed cases in an average of about 9 months in fiscal year 2007. in contrast , arb data are unreliable , and the agency lacks sufficient oversight of data quality . gao 's file review found that arb processing times ranged from 30 days to over 5 years . at all levels of the whistleblower program , gao found that increasing caseloads , case complexity , and accommodating requests from the parties ' legal counsel affect case processing times . whistleblowers received a favorable outcome in a minority of cases that were closed in fiscal year 2007 , both at initial decision and on appeal , but the actual proportion may be somewhat lower than labor 's data show . osha 's data show that whistleblowers received a favorable outcome in 21 percent of complaints -- nearly all settled through a separate agreement involving the whistleblower and the employer , rather than through a decision rendered by osha . however , gao found several problems in the way settlements were being recorded in osha 's database , and a review of settlement agreements suggests that the proportion of cases found to have merit may actually be about 19 percent . as with investigations , when whistleblower complaints were appealed , decisions favored the whistleblower in a minority of the cases -- one - third or less of outcomes favored the whistleblower . with respect to administering the whistleblower program , osha faces two key challenges -- it lacks a mechanism to adequately ensure the quality and consistency of investigations , and many investigators said they lack certain resources they need to do their jobs , including equipment , training , and legal assistance . osha does not routinely conduct independent audits of the program to ensure consistent application of its policies and procedures . osha 's new field audit program has begun to address this need but is lacking in several key areas . for example , the current audit processes do not adequately provide for independence , an important aspect of an effective audit program . moreover , osha is challenged to ensure that investigators in all regions have the resources they need to address their large and complex caseloads . osha has not established minimum equipment standards for its investigators , and nearly half of the whistleblower investigators reported that the equipment they have does not meet the needs of their jobs . furthermore , investigators often cite the need for more training and legal assistance on the complex federal statutes that osha administers .
