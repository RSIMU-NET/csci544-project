the medicaid program spent more than $ 200 billion in fiscal year 2000 to meet the health care needs of nearly 34 million poor , elderly , blind , and disabled persons . states are responsible for making proper payments to medicaid providers , recovering misspent funds , and accurately reporting costs for federal reimbursement . at the federal level , the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) oversee state financial activities and ensure the propriety of expenditures reported for federal reimbursement . gao found that weak financial oversight by cms leaves the program vulnerable to improper payments . the comptroller general 's standards for internal control in the federal government requires that agency managers perform risk assessment , take steps to mitigate identified risks , and monitor the effectiveness of those actions . the standards also require that authority and responsibility for internal controls be clearly defined . cms oversight had weaknesses in each of these areas . as a result , cms did not know if its control efforts were focused on areas of greatest risk . cms also was not effectively implementing the controls it had in place . furthermore , managers had not established performance standards for financial oversight activities , particularly their expenditure review activity . limited data were collected to assess regional financial analyst performance in overseeing state internal controls and expenditures . in addition , the cms audit resolution procedures did not collect enough information on the status of audit findings or ensure that audit findings were resolved promptly . cms ' current organizational structure lacks clear lines of authority and responsibility between the regions and headquarters .
