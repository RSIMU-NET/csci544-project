gao reviewed the following key outcomes in national aeronautics and space administration 's ( nasa ) fiscal year 2002 performance plan : expanding scientific knowledge of the earth 's system , expanding the commercial development of space , and deploying and operating the international space station . gao found that nasa has improved its fiscal year 2002 performance plan and responded to recommendations by gao and others to make its plan more useful -- particularly by providing more comprehensive explanations of how it plans to verify and validate performance data and by better explaining how its performance goals will benefit the public . nasa 's annual performance goals appear to be objective and should help to measure progress toward the outcomes . however , the plan still does not explain the reasons for changes in performance goals . not having these explanations could hinder assessments of nasa 's performance .
