fines are one way for regulators to sanction those who violate securities and futures industry rules . however , for fines to be effective , regulators must collect them . this report reviews fine collection by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , and nine exchanges and industry associations that act as self - regulatory organizations ( sro ) in the securities and futures industries . gao compares how the securities and futures regulators ' current collection rates have changed since gao 's november 1998 report 1998 and assesses the changes they made in their fine imposition practices ; discusses the steps taken by sec and cftc to oversee the sros ' fine imposition activities , including the actions they have recently taken to improve this oversight ; and assesses the effectiveness of actions taken by sec and cftc to refer unpaid fines to the financial management services ( fms ) . gao found that collection rates at sec , cftc , and the sros were generally comparable to , or higher than , their rates at the time of gao 's earlier report . among the sros , the national association of securities dealers ( nasd ) and the national futures association ( nfa ) had the lowest collection rates between 1992 and 1996. however , fine collection rates for both organizations improved after they changed their fine imposition practices . sec has begun to collect data that would allow it to analyze securities sanctions throughout the industry . similarly , cftc has begun to document the results of its review of industrywide futures sanctions . both sec and cftc have reviewed the extent to which their respective sros maintain automated fine collection records . fms ' efforts to collect sec 's fines have been hampered by sec 's delays in approving compromise offers , delays by sec 's commissioners in responding to fms ' requests for more timely action , and by sec 's failure thus far to adopt the regulations it needs to again submit its fines to the treasury offset program to benefit from the associated collection opportunities . although cftc has only recently begun submitting fines to fms for collection , concerns about the timeliness of these submissions already exist . the agency 's inspector general staff has recommended steps to ensure that cftc fines are submitted more timely to fms , but these steps have yet to be implemented . weaknesses in procedures for ensuring that cftc submits all needed information to fms to collect its unpaid fines also appear to have caused further delays in fms ' collection efforts .
