the security of u.s. commercial aviation is a long - standing concern , and substantial efforts have been undertaken to strengthen it . one of these efforts is the development of a new computer - assisted passenger prescreening system ( capps ii ) to identify passengers requiring additional security attention . the development of capps ii has raised a number of issues , including whether individuals may be inappropriately targeted for additional screening , and whether data accessed by the system may compromise passengers ' privacy . gao was asked to determine the development status and plans for capps ii ; the status of capps ii in addressing key developmental , operational , and public acceptance issues ; and other challenges that could impede the successful implementation of the system . key activities in the development of capps ii have been delayed , and the transportation security administration ( tsa ) has not yet completed important system planning activities . tsa is currently behind schedule in testing and developing initial increments of capps ii , due in large part to delays in obtaining needed passenger data for testing from air carriers because of privacy concerns . tsa also has not established a complete plan identifying specific system functionality that will be delivered , the schedule for delivery , and estimated costs . the establishment of such plans is critical to maintaining project focus and achieving intended results within budget . without such plans , tsa is at an increased risk of capps ii not providing the promised functionality , of its deployment being delayed , and of incurring increased costs throughout the system 's development . tsa also has not completely addressed seven of the eight issues identified by the congress as key areas of interest related to the development , operation , and public acceptance of capps ii . although tsa is in various stages of progress on addressing each of these eight issues , as of january 1 , 2004 , only one -- the establishment of an internal oversight board to review the development of capps ii -- has been fully addressed . however , concerns exist regarding the timeliness of the board 's future reviews . other issues , including ensuring the accuracy of data used by capps ii , stress testing , preventing unauthorized access to the system , and resolving privacy concerns have not been completely addressed , due in part to the early stage of the system 's development . the following table is a summary of tsa 's status in addressing the eight key issues . gao identified three additional challenges tsa faces that may impede the success of capps ii . these challenges are developing the international cooperation needed to obtain passenger data , managing the possible expansion of the program 's mission beyond its original purpose , and ensuring that identity theft -- in which an individual poses as and uses information of another individual -- can not be used to negate the security benefits of the system . gao believes that these issues , if not resolved , pose major risks to the successful deployment and implementation of capps ii .
