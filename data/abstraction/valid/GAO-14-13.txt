in 2011 , 5.3 million vehicle crashes in the united states resulted in more than 2.2 million injuries and about 32,000 fatalities . while improvements in automobile safety have reduced the number of fatalities in recent decades , dot has worked with the automobile industry to develop v2v technologies , through which vehicles are capable of warning drivers of imminent collisions by sharing data , including information on speed and location , with nearby vehicles . gao was asked to review the status of v2v technologies . gao examined the state of development of v2v technologies and their anticipated benefits ; the challenges , if any , that will affect the deployment of these technologies and what actions , if any , dot is taking to address them ; and what is known about the potential costs associated with these technologies . gao reviewed documentation on v2v technology - related efforts by dot and automobile manufacturers , visited a pilot study of v2v technologies in michigan , and interviewed dot officials , automobile manufacturers , and 21 experts identified by the national academies of sciences . experts were selected based on their level of knowledge and to represent a variety of subject areas related to v2v technology development . dot and the federal communications commission reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate . the development of vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) technologies has progressed to the point of real world testing , and if broadly deployed , they are anticipated to offer significant safety benefits . efforts by the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) and the automobile industry have focused on developing : 1 ) in - vehicle components such as hardware to facilitate communications among vehicles , 2 ) safety software applications to analyze data and identify potential collisions , 3 ) vehicle features that warn drivers , and 4 ) a national communication security system to ensure trust in the data transmitted among vehicles . according to dot , if widely deployed , v2v technologies could provide warnings to drivers in as much as 76 percent of potential multi - vehicle collisions involving at least one light vehicle , such as a passenger car . ultimately , however , the level of benefits realized will depend on the extent of the deployment of these technologies and the effectiveness of v2v warnings in eliciting appropriate driver responses . the continued progress of v2v technology development hinges on a decision that the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) plans to make in late 2013 on how to proceed regarding these technologies . one option would be to pursue a rulemaking requiring their inclusion in new vehicles . the deployment of v2v technologies faces a number of challenges , which dot is working with the automobile industry to address . according to experts , dot officials , automobile manufacturers , and other stakeholders gao interviewed , these challenges include : 1 ) finalizing the technical framework and management framework of a v2v communication security system , which will be unique in its size and structure ; 2 ) ensuring that the possible sharing with other wireless users of the radio - frequency spectrum used by v2v communications will not adversely affect v2v technology 's performance ; 3 ) ensuring that drivers respond appropriately to warnings of potential collisions ; 4 ) addressing the uncertainty related to potential liability issues posed by v2v technologies ; and 5 ) addressing any concerns the public may have , including those related to privacy . dot is collaborating with automobile manufacturers and others to find potential technical and policy solutions to these challenges and plans to continue these efforts . although v2v technologies are being tested in a real - world pilot that will end in february 2014 , dot officials stated that they can not fully plan for deployment until nhtsa decides how to proceed later this year . dot and the automobile industry are currently analyzing the total costs associated with v2v technologies , which include the costs of both in - vehicle components and a communication security system . all of the automobile manufacturers gao interviewed said that it is difficult to estimate in - vehicle v2v component costs at this time because too many factors -- such as future production volumes and the time frame of deployment -- remain unknown . the costs associated with a v2v communication security system also remain unknown as the specifics of the system 's technical framework and management structure are not yet finalized . while the costs of in - vehicle v2v components may be modest relative to the price of a new vehicle , some experts noted that the potential costs associated with the operation of a v2v communication security system could be significant . further , it is currently unclear who -- consumers , automobile manufacturers , dot , state and local governments , or others -- would pay the costs associated with a v2v communication security system .
