some policymakers have concluded that the energy challenges facing the united states are so critical that a concentrated investment in energy research and development ( r & d ) should be undertaken . the manhattan project , which produced the atomic bomb , and the apollo program , which landed american men on the moon , have been cited as examples of the success such r & d investments can yield . investment in federal energy technology r & d programs of the 1970s , in response to two energy crises , have generally been viewed as less successful than the earlier two efforts . this report compares and contrasts the three initiatives . in 2008 dollars , the cumulative cost of the manhattan project over 5 fiscal years was approximately $ 22 billion ; of the apollo program over 14 fiscal years , approximately $ 98 billion ; of post - oil shock energy r & d efforts over 35 fiscal years , $ 118 billion . a measure of the nation 's commitments to the programs is their relative shares of the federal outlays during the years of peak funding : for the manhattan program , the peak year funding was 1 % of federal outlays ; for the apollo program , 2.2 % ; and for energy technology r & d programs , 0.5 % . another measure of the commitment is their relative shares of the nation 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) during the peak years of funding : for the manhattan project and the apollo program , the peak year funding reached 0.4 % of gdp , and for the energy technology r & d programs , 0.1 % . besides funding , several criteria might be used to compare these three initiatives including perception of the program or threat , goal clarity , and the customer of the technology being developed . by these criteria , while the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for thinking about an energy technology r & d initiative , there are fundamental differences between the forces that drove these historical r & d success stories and the forces driving energy technology r & d today . critical differences include ( 1 ) the ability to transform the program or threat into a concrete goal , and ( 2 ) the use to which the technology would be put . on the issue of goal setting , for the manhattan project , the response to the threat of enemy development of a nuclear bomb was the goal to construct a bomb ; for the apollo program , the threat of soviet space dominance was translated into a specific goal of landing on the moon . for energy , the response to the problems of insecure oil sources and high prices has resulted in multiple , sometimes conflicting , goals . regarding use , both the manhattan project and the apollo program goals pointed to technologies primarily for governmental use with little concern about their environmental impact ; for energy , in contrast , the hoped - for outcome depends on commercial viability and mitigation of environmental impacts from energy use . although the manhattan project and the apollo program may provide some useful analogies for funding , these differences may limit their utility regarding energy policy . rather , energy technology r & d has been driven by at least three not always commensurate goals — resource and technological diversity , commercial viability , and environmental protection — which were not goals of the historical programs .
