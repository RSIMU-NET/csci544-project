gao reviewed the department of the army 's test and acquisition plans for the common ground station ( cgs ) , the fifth version of the joint surveillance target attack radar system ( joint stars ) ground station modules ( gsm ) . gao found that : the army planned to purchase 22 cgs in two years of low - rate initial production ( lrip ) at a cost of $ 138 million , but it now plans to procure 34 cgs systems ; the army has neither demonstrated an urgent need for cgs nor proved that the expected benefits from accelerated procurement outweigh its risks ; by 1998 , the army will need at least four cgs to complete operational test and evaluation ; since earlier versions of cgs have not tested well or completed an operational test and evaluation , the army 's acceleration of cgs lrip increases the risk of procuring a costly and ineffective system ; and because the army is only required to purchase one cgs in the second year of lrip , it could significantly reduce system costs by procuring fewer systems in the early stages of the contract .
