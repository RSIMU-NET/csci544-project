since 2005 , the department of defense ( defense ) , with support from the department of state ( state ) , has directed u.s. efforts to develop the afghan national police ( anp ) into a force capable of enforcing the rule of law and supporting actions to defeat insurgency , among other activities . this testimony discusses u.s. efforts to develop a capable anp ; challenges that affect the development of a capable anp ; and gao analysis of u.s. efforts to develop a coordinated , detailed plan for completing and sustaining the afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , which comprise the anp and the afghan national army ( ana ) . this statement is based on a concurrently issued gao report titled afghanistan security : further congressional action may be needed to ensure completion of a detailed plan to develop and sustain capable afghan national security forces , gao - 08-661 ( washington , d.c. : june 18 , 2008 ) . although the anp has reportedly grown in number since 2005 , after an investment of more than $ 6 billion , no afghan police unit ( 0 of 433 ) is assessed by defense as fully capable of performing its mission and over three - fourths of units ( 334 of 433 ) are assessed at the lowest capability rating . in addition , while the anp has reportedly grown in number to nearly 80,000 personnel , concerns exist about the reliability of this number . several challenges impede u.s. efforts to develop capable anp forces . first , the shortage of police mentors has been a key impediment to u.s. efforts to conduct training and evaluation and verify that police are on duty . second , the anp continues to encounter difficulties with equipment shortages and quality . third , the anp faces a difficult working environment , including a weak afghan judicial sector and consistent problems with police pay , corruption , and attacks by insurgents . defense has recognized challenges to anp development and , in november 2007 , began a new initiative called focused district development -- an effort to train the police as units -- to address them . this effort is too new to fully assess , but the continuing shortfall in police mentors may put the effort at risk . despite a 2005 gao recommendation calling for a detailed plan and a 2008 congressional mandate requiring similar information , defense and state have not developed a coordinated , detailed plan with clearly defined roles and responsibilities , milestones for completing and sustaining the ansf , and a sustainment strategy . in 2007 , defense produced a 5-page document intended to address gao 's 2005 recommendation . however , the document does not identify the role or involve the participation of state -- defense 's partner in training the anp . further , state has not completed a plan of its own . in the absence of a coordinated , detailed plan that clearly defines agency roles and responsibilities , a dual chain of command exists between defense and state that has complicated the efforts of mentors training the police . defense 's 5-page document also contains few milestones , including no interim milestones that would help assess progress made in developing the anp . without interim milestones , it is difficult to know if current anp status represents what the united states intended to achieve by 2008. in addition , defense 's 5-page document lacks a sustainment strategy . without a detailed strategy for sustaining the ansf , it is difficult to determine how long the united states may need to continue providing funding and other resources for this important mission .
