usps manages over 31,000 retail facilities , which help it provide postal services throughout the country . however , usps faces financial challenges . in general , usps is prohibited by statute from providing nonpostal products and services ( i.e . , services not directly related to mail delivery ) unless approved by the postal regulatory commission . but given the ubiquity of the retail network , some stakeholders have suggested that offering additional nonpostal products and services could help usps generate revenue and provide benefits for consumers and communities . gao was asked to review opportunities to enhance the value of usps 's retail facilities . this report examines : the costs , revenues , and other benefits associated with usps 's retail facilities ; usps 's nonpostal efforts since 2008 at retail facilities and the outcomes ; and considerations of new nonpostal efforts at retail facilities . gao analyzed usps retail facility costs and revenue data from fiscal years 2017 and 2018 ( the only years available ) ; reviewed relevant documents and reports from usps and others ; conducted a non - generalizable survey of usps postmasters who managed rural , suburban , and urban retail facilities ; and interviewed usps officials , and stakeholders , including postal employee unions , industry and consumer groups , and federal agencies that partner with usps to obtain views on current and potential nonpostal efforts . gao is making no recommendations . usps , in its comments , reiterated that it faces various constraints to new offerings at retail facilities . in 2018 , u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) retail facilities , such as post offices , generated about $ 10.5 billion in revenue and cost approximately $ 5 billion to operate , making them profitable overall . while such facilities accounted for about 15 percent of usps 's total fiscal year 2018 revenues , and about 7 percent of its total costs , stakeholders identified other benefits that retail facilities provide for communities — particularly in rural areas — such as local access to government information and services . since 2008 , usps has offered a variety of nonpostal products and services at its retail facilities that have generated some revenue and other benefits . usps data show that the nonpostal products and services for which usps captures revenue data , such as money orders , generated about $ 431 million in total revenue in fiscal year 2018 and were profitable overall . stakeholders said many of these nonpostal products and services also provided other benefits , such as enhanced convenience for customers , and postmasters gao surveyed said some offerings , such as passport services , were highly valued in their communities . offering additional nonpostal products and services at usps retail facilities could provide consumer , government , or community benefits , but viability may be limited . stakeholders said new offerings , such as expanded financial products or government services could , for example , enhance consumers ' access and government efficiencies . in particular , some noted that usps could provide a viable banking alternative for those lacking banking services . however , usps officials , postmasters gao surveyed , and stakeholders gao interviewed said that additional offerings may generate minimal revenue and that usps may face factors limiting the viability of these offerings . for example , groups representing states ' licensing agencies said offering state hunting and fishing licenses could be problematic given different state requirements . also , stakeholders said usps may not have the expertise nor the required capital to enter the market of some of these new offerings . given such concerns , usps and policy makers need to carefully weigh costs , benefits , and limitations of any new offerings .
