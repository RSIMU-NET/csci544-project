for several years usps has not generated sufficient revenues to cover its expenses . although much focus has been on usps 's costs as a way to close the gap between its revenues and expenses , generating additional revenue is also needed . to increase mail volume and revenue , usps has implemented nsas , sales , and promotions with a variety of products . as requested , gao reviewed the trends and reported results of usps 's sales , promotions , and nsas , as well as any opportunities and challenges related to generating additional revenue from them . gao reviewed usps documents , prc decisions , and annual reports , and interviewed officials from usps and prc . gao also interviewed mailers , which were selected in part based on participation in nsas , sales , and promotions . their views can not be generalized to all mailers . the u.s. postal service ( usps ) has developed numerous negotiated service agreements ( nsa ) , sales , and promotions since the enactment of the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) in 2006 , and they generate a small but growing portion of usps total revenue . paea established two categories of products : `` market dominant , '' where usps has a monopoly , and `` competitive , '' which includes all other products , such as shipping services . nsas , sales , and promotions are generally designed to encourage additional mail volume and revenue through temporary discounts on specific mail products . for example , usps has offered promotions to incentivize mailers to invest in technology that may increase the value of mail for those mailers over the long - term . no nsas , sales , or promotions followed the enactment of paea until regulations were issued in late 2007. the number of nsas , sales , and promotions has increased most years since . the revenue generated from nsas , sales , and promotions has also increased overall . the most revenue was generated by competitive nsas . financial results of competitive nsas are not reported publicly . according to the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) , which exercises regulatory oversight over usps , nearly all competitive nsas have covered their costs . market dominant nsas generated little revenue , in part because few were done . sales and promotions have also generated little revenue . opportunities for increasing revenue from nsas , sales , and promotions are primarily with competitive nsas , though challenges may limit revenue , and it will likely not offset declines from other products . continued growth in e - commerce is creating opportunities to generate additional revenue through competitive nsas . opportunities to generate additional revenue through market dominant nsas are limited by low demand for those products . also , it is difficult for usps to determine whether any volume and revenue increases directly result from market dominant nsas because it is difficult to accurately estimate mailers ' future mail volume . in addition , usps and some mailers we spoke with noted that the process for developing both market - dominant and competitive nsas can be burdensome , hindering the development of new agreements . usps has taken actions , though , to streamline the process for developing competitive nsas . opportunities for generating revenue from sales and promotions are also limited by low demand as well as limited review of the long - term financial results before implementation . usps has noted that promotions satisfy rate requirements by , for example , helping to generate revenues for usps . in particular , promotions are used to encourage mail volume over the long term . however , usps does not provide data and analysis about the potential long - term financial results when submitting promotions to prc for its approval . as a result , prc does not assess the methodologies for evaluating the long - term financial results of promotions before implementation . given usps 's financial situation , usps should demonstrate how promotions may achieve positive long - term financial results , in order to help maximize the revenue generated by those postage rate discounts . gao recommends that when filing for approval , usps provide information to prc about usps 's data collection and analysis plans for estimating the longterm financial results of promotions . gao also recommends that prc evaluate usps 's data collection and analysis plans for promotions as part of its review . in commenting on the report , usps disagreed with the first recommendation , and prc agreed with both recommendations . usps stated it does not believe the recommendation will significantly affect the prc 's review process or improve the quality of usps 's business decisions . gao continues to believe this recommendation has merit , as discussed in this report .
