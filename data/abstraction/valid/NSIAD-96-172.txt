pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the costs of the department of defense 's ( dod ) environmental cleanup efforts under the base realignment and closure ( brac ) process , focusing on the : reasons that cleanups are so costly ; and potential for reducing costs and the impact on program goals . gao found that : as of march 1996 , dod had allocated about $ 3.4 billion for the brac environmental cleanup program ; as more bases are closed and more cleanup actions are underway , program costs are likely to increase significantly ; although dod has not computed a total cost estimate for the program , available dod financial data indicate that program costs are likely to exceed $ 11 billion ; the key reasons for the high cost of closing base cleanups include the large number of contaminated sites and difficulties associated with types of contamination , requirements of federal and state laws and regulations , lack of cost - effective cleanup technology for certain contaminants , and intended property reuse ; dod has identified over 5,300 potentially contaminated sites at its brac bases ; the laws and regulations dod must abide by in expediting property transfer for reuse have proven to be time - consuming , complex , and costly ; technology limitations in cleaning property of certain contaminants ( such as unexploded ordnance ) have proved costly ; options for reducing cleanup costs at closing bases include deferring or extending certain cleanup actions , modifying existing laws and regulations , adopting more cost - effective cleanup technologies , and sharing costs with the ultimate user of the property ; all of these options may adversely impact programmatic goals , thereby presenting decisionmakers with difficult choices in developing a cost - effective environmental cleanup program ; deferring or extending cleanup actions may delay property transfer and reuse , hurt the economic revitalization of communities affected by the closure process , and harm the environment and health as well ; modifying law and regulations may increase environmental risk , thereby increasing public resistance and dissatisfaction ; adopting more cost - effective technologies may delay the program because new technologies currently under development may not be available for years and the new technologies may not be more cost - effective than existing technologies ; and sharing costs with the ultimate user could present problems because of unknown future liabilities and difficulty establishing the value of the property .
