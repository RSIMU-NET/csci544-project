hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to free oil and natural gas trapped underground in low - permeability rock formations by injecting a fluid under high pressure in order to crack the formations . the composition of a fracturing fluid varies with the nature of the formation , but typically contains mostly water ; a proppant to keep the fractures open , such as sand ; and a small percentage of chemical additives . some of these additives may be hazardous to health and the environment . the shale gas production subcommittee of the secretary of energy advisory board has recommended public disclosure , on a well - by - well basis , of all of the chemical ingredients added to fracturing fluids , with some protection for trade secrets . although a few provisions of federal law require some disclosure of information about the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing , none of them requires that detailed information about the chemical composition of a fracturing fluid be provided . in august 2011 , environmental groups petitioned the environmental protection agency ( epa ) to promulgate rules under sections 4 and 8 of the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) for chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration or production . in october 2012 , environmental groups asked the epa to require the oil and gas extraction industry to report the toxic chemicals it releases under the toxics release inventory . in his 2012 state of the union address , president barack obama said he would obligate `` all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use , '' citing health and safety concerns . in may 2012 , the bureau of land management ( blm ) published a proposed rule that would require companies employing hydraulic fracturing on lands managed by blm to disclose the content of the fracturing fluid . in addition , there were legislative efforts in the 112th congress . h.r . 1084 and s. 587 , the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act ( frac act ) , would have created more broadly applicable disclosure requirements for parties engaged in hydraulic fracturing . chemical disclosure laws at the state level vary widely . of the 15 laws examined in this report , fewer than half require direct public disclosure of chemical information by mandating that parties post the information on the fracfocus chemical disclosure website . the level of detail required to be disclosed often depends on how states protect trade secrets , as these protections may allow submitting parties to withhold information from disclosure at their discretion or to submit fewer details about proprietary chemicals , except , perhaps , in emergencies . even if a disclosure law does not protect information from public disclosure , other state laws , such as an exemption in an open records law , may do so . states also have varying laws regarding the timing of these disclosure requirements . this report provides an overview of current and proposed laws and regulations at the state and federal levels that require the disclosure of the chemicals added to the fluid used in hydraulic fracturing . appendix a provides a glossary of many of the terms used in this report . appendix b contains a table summarizing some of the fracturing chemical disclosure requirements described in this report . for an overview of the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) , see crs report r41760 , hydraulic fracturing and safe drinking water act regulatory issues , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
