pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the : internal revenue code and the internal revenue service ( irs ) administrative requirements that cause some of the complexity associated with estimated tax ( es ) penalty calculations ; and likely effects of corresponding changes to the requirements that would make it easier for taxpayers to calculate their es penalties . gao noted that : to help ensure compliance with the internal revenue code and irs administrative requirements , form 2210 requires numerous calculations to track individual es underpayments and to determine precise es penalty amounts ; gao identified three requirements where the additional calculations did not seem to be justified because they resulted in either little or no effect on es penalty amounts ; the form 2210 underpayment schedule , which currently requires that taxpayers track each underpayment individually , results in a complicated procedure , involving numerous calculations , to comply with the definition of underpayment in the code ; gao found that if taxpayers were allowed to track the accumulated underpayment amounts rather than if individual amounts and if a corresponding change were made to the es penalty underpayment period , taxpayers could reduce the number of calculations without affecting es penalty amounts ; taxpayers currently have to make additional es penalty calculations to account for three of the four 15-day periods between es interest rate effective dates and es payment dates ; if interest rates change , this requirement increases the number of calculations taxpayers must make but only increases or decreases the penalties by small amounts ; in 1986 , congress eliminated this requirement for the 15-day period between april 1 and april 15 by aligning the interest rate effective date with the es payment date ; similar alignments for the other three 15-day periods during the year would eliminate the calculations taxpayers must make for the 15-day periods and have little effect on es penalty amounts ; to account for leap years , taxpayers currently have to make additional es penalty calculations when underpayment balances extend either through the end of the leap year or the end of the year preceding a leap year ; and gao found that , if taxpayers were allowed to use a 365-day year in all es penalty calculations , they could eliminate the additional calculations and the penalties for the periods affected would increase by a very small amount -- only 0.3 percent .
