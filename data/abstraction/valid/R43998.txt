the u.s. sugar program provides a price support guarantee to producers of sugar beets and sugarcane and to the processors of both crops . the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , as program administrator , is directed to administer the program at no budgetary cost to the federal government by limiting the amount of sugar supplied for food use in the u.s. market . to achieve both objectives , usda uses four tools — as reauthorized without change by the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) and found in chapter 17 of the harmonized tariff schedules of the united states — to keep domestic market prices above guaranteed levels . these are : price support loans at specified levels — the basis for the price guarantee ; marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar that each processor can sell ; import quotas to control the amount of sugar entering the u.s. market ; a sugar - to - ethanol backstop — available if marketing allotments and import quotas are insufficient to prevent a sugar surplus from developing , which in turn could result in market prices falling below guaranteed levels . to supplement these policy tools in supporting sugar prices above government loan levels , while avoiding costly loan forfeitures , important administrative changes were adopted in late 2014. these included imposing limits on u.s. imports of mexican sugar and establishing minimum prices for mexican sugar imports , actions that fundamentally recast the terms of bilateral trade in sugar . a u.s. sugar refiner is pursuing a legal challenge to the u.s. government 's finding that these changes have eliminated the harm to the u.s. sugar industry , so although this new regime is in effect , a measure of uncertainty about its future remains . under the u.s. sugar program , nonrecourse loans that may be taken out by sugar processors , not producers themselves , provide a source of short - term , low - cost financing until a raw cane sugar mill or beet sugar refiner sells sugar . the `` nonrecourse '' feature of these loans means that processors — to meet their repayment obligation — can exercise the legal right to forfeit sugar offered as collateral to usda to secure the loan , if the market price is below the effective support level when the loan comes due . sugar marketing allotments limit the amount of domestically produced sugar that processors can sell each year . in a 2008 farm bill provision , retained by the 2014 farm bill , usda each year must set the overall allotment quantity ( oaq ) at not less than 85 % of estimated u.s. human consumption of sugar . the oaq is intended to ensure that permitted sales of domestic sugar , when added to imports under u.s. trade commitments , do not depress market prices below loan forfeiture levels for refined beet sugar and raw cane sugar . the united states imports sugar in order to meet total food demand . the amount of foreign sugar supplied to the u.s. market reflects u.s. commitments made under various trade agreements . the most significant import obligation is the world trade organization ( wto ) quota commitment , which requires the united states to allow not less than 1.256 million tons of sugar ( almost all raw cane ) to enter the domestic market from 40 countries . the united states also grants much smaller import quotas to nine countries covered by four free trade agreements . at the same time , a 2008 farm bill provision , also retained in the 2014 farm bill , directs usda to manage overall u.s. sugar supply , including imports , so that market prices do not fall below effective support levels . if market prices fall below levels guaranteed by the sugar program , usda must administer a sugar - for - ethanol program in which it buys domestically produced sugar from the market and sells it to ethanol producers as feedstock for fuel ethanol . a source of controversy over the sugar program is the balance it strikes between the interests of the sugar industry and sugar users .
