congress is deeply divided over implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) , the health reform law enacted in march 2010. since the aca 's enactment , lawmakers opposed to specific provisions in the aca or the entire law have repeatedly debated its implementation and considered bills to repeal , defund , delay , or otherwise amend the law . in addition to considering aca repeal or amendment in authorizing legislation , some lawmakers have used the annual appropriations process in an effort to eliminate funding for the aca 's implementation and address other aspects of the law . aca - related provisions have been included in enacted appropriations acts each year since the aca became law . in october 2013 , disagreement between the republican - led house and democratic - controlled senate over the inclusion of aca language in a temporary spending bill for the new fiscal year ( i.e . , fy2014 ) resulted in a partial shutdown of government operations that lasted 16 days . the house appropriations committee has added numerous aca - related provisions to annual appropriations acts since the republicans regained control of the house in 2011. most of these provisions were included in the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies ( lhhs ) appropriations act , which funds the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) . a few provisions were incorporated in the financial services and general government ( financial services ) appropriations act , which funds the internal revenue service ( irs ) . by comparison , the lhhs and financial services appropriations bills drafted by the senate appropriations committee were largely free of any aca - related provisions while the committee remained under democratic control through 2014. congressional appropriators have used a number of legislative options available to them through the appropriations process in an effort to defund , delay , or otherwise address implementation of the aca . first , they have denied cms and the irs any new funding to cover the administrative costs of aca implementation . second , house appropriators repeatedly have added limitations ( often referred to as riders ) to the lhhs and financial services appropriations bills to prohibit cms and the irs from using discretionary funds provided in the bills for aca implementation activities . to date , the aca limitation provisions added by house appropriators have been removed during negotiations with the senate . none of them have been included in any of the enacted appropriations acts . third , congressional appropriators have incorporated aca - related legislative language in the lhhs appropriations bills . for example , appropriators have included language to rescind ( i.e . , cancel ) certain mandatory funding provided by the aca and delay ( or place a temporary moratorium on ) certain taxes and fees established by the aca . finally , the appropriators have added to recent lhhs appropriations acts several reporting and other administrative requirements regarding implementation of the aca . these include instructing the hhs secretary to establish a website with information on the allocation of funding from the prevention and public health fund and to provide an accounting of administrative spending on aca implementation .
