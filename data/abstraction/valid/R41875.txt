the united states and canada , while independent countries , effectively comprise a single integrated market for petroleum and natural gas . canada is the single largest foreign supplier of petroleum products and natural gas to the united states — and the united states is the dominant consumer of canada 's energy exports . the value of the petroleum and natural gas trade between the two countries totaled nearly $ 100 billion in 2010 , helping to promote general economic growth and directly support thousands of energy industry and related jobs on both sides of the border . increased energy trade between the united states and canada — a stable , friendly neighbor — is viewed by many as a major contributor to u.s. energy security . the u.s. - canada energy relationship is increasingly complex , however , and is undergoing fundamental change , particularly in the petroleum and natural gas sectors . congress has been facing important policy questions in the u.s. - canada energy context on several fronts , including the siting of major cross - border pipelines , increasing petroleum supplies from canadian oil sands , increasing natural gas production from north american shales , and the construction of new facilities for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) exports . legislative proposals in the 112th congress could directly influence these developments . these proposals include h.r . 1938 , which would expedite consideration of the keystone xl pipeline proposal ; h.r . 909 , which would encourage petroleum and natural gas production on the outer continental shelf and in the arctic national wildlife refuge ; and s. 304 , which would support a program to train workers involved with oil and gas infrastructure in alaska . other proposals in congress affecting hydraulic fracturing operations for natural gas production , offshore drilling , or u.s. oil shale development could also affect the u.s. - canada energy relationship . traditionally , the energy trade between the united states and canada , while intertwined , has been uncomplicated — taking the form of a steadily growing southward flow of crude oil and natural gas to markets in the u.s. midwest and northeast . but recent developments have greatly complicated that energy relationship , creating new competition and interconnections . consequently , while energy policies in one country have always inevitably affected the other , their cross - cutting effects in the future may not be widely understood and , in some cases , may be largely unanticipated . for example , policies affecting u.s. shale gas production could affect north american natural gas prices overall , and thus , the costs of producing petroleum from oil sands ( which requires large volumes of natural gas for heating ) . changing oil sands costs could , in turn , affect canadian petroleum supplies to the united states , affecting north - south pipeline use and changing u.s. petroleum import requirements from overseas . changing natural gas prices would also change the economics of arctic natural gas , however , and influence the development of the arctic natural gas pipelines , which could provide an alternative source of economic natural gas for oil sands production in alberta . how such scenarios could play out in reality is open to debate , but they illustrate the tangled web policymakers in both countries must navigate as they consider future energy , environmental , and transportation decisions . as congress debates legislative proposals affecting the petroleum and natural gas industries , it may be helpful to consider these proposals in the broadest possible north american context , recognizing that the energy sector in canada may be moved in one direction or another based on policies in washington , dc . to date , the judgment of congress has favored a growing u.s. - canada energy partnership — but ensuring that this relationship continues to be as mutually beneficial as possible will likely remain a key oversight challenge for the next decades .
