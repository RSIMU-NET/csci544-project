the federal government is projected to invest more than $ 89 billion on it in fiscal year 2017. historically , these investments have frequently failed , incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages , or contributed little to mission - related outcomes . accordingly , in december 2014 , it reform legislation was enacted , aimed at improving agencies ' acquisitions of it . further , in february 2015 , gao added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to its high - risk list . this statement focuses on the status of federal efforts in improving the acquisition of it . specifically , this statement summarizes gao 's prior work primarily published between june 2013 and february 2017 on key it workforce planning activities , risk levels of major investments as reported on omb 's it dashboard , and implementation of incremental development practices , among other issues . the federal information technology acquisition reform act ( fitara ) was enacted in december 2014 to improve federal information technology ( it ) acquisitions and can help federal agencies reduce duplication and achieve cost savings . successful implementation of fitara will require the office of management and budget ( omb ) and federal agencies to take action in a number of areas identified in the law and as previously recommended by gao . it workforce planning . gao identified eight key it workforce planning practices in november 2016 that are critical to ensuring that agencies have the knowledge and skills to successfully acquire it , such as analyzing the workforce to identify gaps in competencies and staffing . however , gao reported that the five selected federal agencies it reviewed had not fully implemented these practices . for example , none of these agencies had fully assessed their competency and staffing needs regularly or established strategies and plans to address gaps in these areas . these weaknesses were due , in part , to agencies lacking comprehensive policies that required these practices . accordingly , gao made specific recommendations to the five agencies to address the practices that were not fully implemented . four agencies agreed and one partially agreed with gao 's recommendations . it dashboard . to facilitate transparency into the government 's acquisition of it , omb 's it dashboard provides detailed information on major investments at federal agencies , including ratings from chief information officers ( cio ) that should reflect the level of risk facing an investment . gao reported in june 2016 that 13 of the 15 agencies selected for in - depth review had not fully considered risks when rating their investments on the it dashboard . in particular , of the 95 investments reviewed , gao 's assessments of risks matched the cio ratings 22 times , showed more risk 60 times , and showed less risk 13 times . several factors contributed to these differences , such as cio ratings not being updated frequently and using outdated risk data . gao recommended that agencies improve the quality and frequency of their ratings . most agencies agreed with gao 's recommendations . incremental development . an additional reform initiated by omb has emphasized the need for federal agencies to deliver investments in smaller parts , or increments , in order to reduce risk and deliver capabilities more quickly . specifically , since 2012 , omb has required investments to deliver functionality every 6 months . in august 2016 , gao determined that , for fiscal year 2016 , 22 agencies had reported on the it dashboard that 64 percent of their software development projects would deliver useable functionality every 6 months . however , gao determined that only three of seven agencies selected for in - depth review had policies regarding the cio certifying it investments ' adequate implementation of incremental development , as required by omb . gao recommended , among other things , that four agencies improve their policies for cio certification of incremental development . most of these agencies agreed with the recommendations . between fiscal years 2010 and 2015 , gao made 803 recommendations to omb and federal agencies to address shortcomings in it acquisitions and operations . the significance of these recommendations contributed to the addition of this area to gao 's high - risk list . as of december 2016 , omb and the agencies had fully implemented 366 ( or about 46 percent ) of the 803 recommendations . in fiscal year 2016 , gao made 202 new recommendations , thus further reinforcing the need for omb and agencies to address the shortcomings gao has identified .
