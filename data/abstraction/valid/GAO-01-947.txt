the u.s. securities and exchange commission 's ( sec ) human capital management practices have been shaped largely by a growing staffing crisis that threatens to undermine the agency 's ability to carry out its mission . gao surveyed current and former sec attorneys , accountants , and examiners to determine what factors influenced turnover , satisfaction , and morale among sec staff . gao found that inadequate compensation is the primary reason that employees leave the agency . but staff raised other issues that warrant attention , including limited opportunities for advancement , the amount of uncompensated overtime , and the quality of administrative support services . in response to the high turnover rates , sec has placed greater emphasis on compensation - based human capital programs , including compensation - based flexibilities and performance awards . although sec uses compensation - based flexibilities to a greater extent than do other government agencies , the office of personnel management believes it could do more . sec has taken several steps to focus more attention on strategic human capital management but faces continuing challenges . in april 2001 , sec integrated its human capital strategies with it 's core business practices by adding a human capital goal to its 2002 annual performance plan . sec has also developed an extensive recruiting program for attorneys .
