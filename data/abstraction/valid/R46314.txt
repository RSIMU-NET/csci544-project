the higher education act of 1965 ( hea ; p.l . 89-329 , as amended ) authorizes the operation of three federal student loan programs : the william d. ford federal direct loan ( direct loan ) program , the federal family education loan ( ffel ) program , and the federal perkins loan program . as of december 31 , 2019 , $ 1.5 trillion in such loans , borrowed by or on behalf of 42.8 million individuals , remained outstanding . in response to the current coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) pandemic , numerous questions have arisen regarding student loan repayment flexibilities and debt relief that may be available to individuals to alleviate potential financial effects related to covid - 19 . the hea authorizes several flexibilities that may be relevant to individuals facing financial difficulties resulting from covid - 19 . these include the following : loan deferment and forbearance options offer a borrower temporary relief from the obligation to make monthly payments . in certain instances , interest does not accrue during deferment periods ; although interest does accrue during forbearance periods . periods of deferment or forbearance do not count toward the 120 monthly payments required to qualify for public service loan forgiveness ( pslf ) , nor do they count toward the 20- or 25-year repayment periods under the income - driven repayment plans . income - driven repayment ( idr ) plans afford borrowers the opportunity to make payments in amounts that are capped at a specified share or proportion of their discretionary income over a repayment period not to exceed 20 or 25 years , depending on the plan . at the end of the repayment period , the remaining balance of an individual 's loans is forgiven . recent administrative and congressional actions , including the enactment of the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act ( p.l . 116-136 ) , provide additional student loan relief measures : interest rates on federally held student loans are being set to 0 % from march 13 , 2020 , through september 30 , 2020. federally held student loans are being placed in a special administrative forbearance for march 13 , 2020 , through september 30 , 2020. during this time , borrowers will not be required to make payments due on their loans . this special administrative forbearance will count toward the 120 monthly payments required to qualify for pslf , the 20- and 25-year repayment periods under the idr plans , and the nine voluntary payments required for individuals to rehabilitate their defaulted loans . debt collections activities , including involuntary collection activities such as wage garnishment and offset of certain federal benefits ( e.g . , federal income tax return benefits , social security benefits ) are being suspended on federally held student loans for march 13 , 2020 , through september 30 , 2020 .
