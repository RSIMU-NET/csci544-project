in the week before congress adjourned for recess on september 30 , the house and senate passed conference agreements on both the fy2007 national defense authorization bill , h.r . 5122 , and the fy2007 defense appropriations bill , h.r . 5631. the president signed the appropriations bill into law , p.l . 109-289 , on september 29 , and he signed the authorization bill into law , p.l . 109-364 , on october 17. the conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $ 436.6 billion for defense , including $ 366.6 billion in regular appropriations and $ 70 billion in additional appropriations , mainly as a `` bridge fund '' for operations abroad . the total of regular appropriations is $ 4 billion below the administration request . the senate - passed bill provided $ 9 billion less than the request , which freed that much to add to non - defense appropriations bills . the white house , however , threatened to veto the defense bill if reduced defense by more than $ 4 billion . in action on other key issues , the appropriations bill – rejected the administration proposal to terminate c - 17 cargo aircraft production after fy2007 and provided funds for 22 aircraft ; approved a navy proposal to provide partial funding for 2 ddg - 1000 destroyers — formerly the dd ( x ) — rather than providing full funding for just one ship as in the house bill ; included funds as requested for one t - ake cargo ship and for 2 littoral combat ships ( lcs ) , rather than eliminating t - ake funds and procuring only one lcs , as in the senate bill ; and slowed f - 35 joint strike fighter procurement , with funds to buy 2 rather than the requested 5 aircraft , but did not eliminate fy2007 aircraft procurement funds as had the senate bill . on key defense policy issues , the authorization bill provided a 2.2 % pay raise , as requested , rather than or a 2.7 % raise as in the house bill ; approved access for all reservists , except federal employees with federal health insurance , to the dod tricare medical insurance program with a premium of 28 % of the cost of the program ; rejected house language permitting chaplains to use denominational prayers according to each chaplain 's conscience , but , instead , in report language , required the army and navy to rescind recent directives on prayer and return to earlier policies ; agreed to a substantially amended senate change in the buy american act to allow use of foreign - supplied specialty metals in u.s. - built systems ; and did not agree to a senate provision giving the head of the national guard four - star rank and the authority to make independent budget requests , but assigned these issues to a commission on the reserves .
