the federal budget helps implement congress 's `` power of the purse '' by expressing congress 's spending priorities among competing aims . the obama administration 's fy2010 budget described several important changes , including increased funding for certain domestic priorities , major programmatic reforms , and proposed spending cuts in some programs . the current economic climate continues to pose major challenges to policymakers . federal spending tied to means - tested social programs rose due to rising unemployment , while federal revenues are projected to fall as individuals ' incomes have dropped and corporate profits have sunk . federal deficits , according to omb and cbo projections , will likely be high relative to historic norms over the next few years , as spending rises and revenues fall relative to previously anticipated levels . fy2009 outlays rose to $ 3,522 billion ( 24.9 % of gdp ) and revenues fell to $ 2,105 billion ( 14.7 % of gdp ) , yielding a total federal deficit of $ 1,417 billion ( 10.0 % of gdp ) . over the past decade , federal spending has accounted for approximately a fifth of the economy ( as measured by gross domestic product â€” gdp ) and federal revenues have ranged between just under a sixth to just over a fifth of gdp . in fy2008 , the u.s. government collected $ 2.5 trillion in revenue and spent almost $ 3.0 trillion . outlays as a proportion of gdp rose from 18.4 % in fy2000 to 21.0 % of gdp in fy2008 . federal revenues as a proportion of gdp reached a post - wwii peak of 20.9 % in fy2000 and then fell to 16.3 % of gdp in fy2004 before rising slightly to 17.7 % of gdp in fy2008 . the obama administration released the fy2010 budget outline on february 26 , 2009 , followed by the remaining budget documents on may 7 and 11 , 2009. major policy initiatives included new spending targeted toward health care reform , clean energy , and education . the budget resolution ( s.con.res . 13 ) , which followed most of the president 's initiatives , was agreed to on april 29 , 2009. it specified $ 2,322 billion in revenues and $ 3,555 billion in outlays , resulting in a projected fy2010 deficit of $ 1,233 billion . a fy2009 war funding supplemental ( p.l . 111-32 ) was enacted in june 2009. the house passed all 12 regular fy2010 appropriations acts by the end of july 2009. the legislative branch appropriations bill ( p.l . 111-68 ) enacted october 1 contained a continuing resolution to extend funding to the end of the month . on october 30 , the interior - environment bill ( p.l . 111-88 ) , which included a second continuing resolution to extend funding until december 18 , was enacted . five remaining bills ( commerce - justice - science ; financial services ; labor - hhs ; military construction - va ; and state - foreign operations ) were folded into the transportation - hud bill , creating an omnibus spending measure ( h.r . 3288 ; p.l . 111-117 ) that was enacted on december 16. finally , the defense bill ( h.r . 3326 ; p.l . 111-118 ) , was signed into law on december 19 , finishing the regular appropriations process for fy2010 . the federal government made significant financial interventions aimed at alleviating economic recession . the final costs of federal responses to this turmoil will depend on the pace of economic recovery , how well firms with federal credit guarantees weather future financial shocks , and how much the government loses or gains on its asset purchases . federal loans or loan guarantee programs may help provide liquidity to distressed financial markets and stimulate economic activity , but may also expose the federal government to substantial credit risks . while many economists concurred on the need for short - term fiscal stimulus despite adverse impact on the deficit , concerns remain about the federal government 's long - term fiscal situation . rising costs of federal health care programs and baby boomer retirements present serious challenges to fiscal stability . operating these programs in their current form may pass on substantial economic burdens to future generations . this report will not be updated .
