in april 2005 , the domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) was established within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to enhance and coordinate federal , state , and local efforts to combat nuclear smuggling domestically and overseas . dndo was directed to develop , in coordination with the departments of defense ( dod ) , energy ( doe ) , and state ( state ) , a global strategy for nuclear detection -- a system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities domestically and abroad . gao was asked to examine dndo 's progress in developing programs to address critical gaps in preventing nuclear smuggling domestically , dndo 's role in supporting other agencies ' efforts to combat nuclear smuggling overseas , and the amount budgeted by dhs , dod , doe , and state for programs that constitute the global nuclear detection strategy . to do so , gao analyzed agency documents ; interviewed agency , state , and local officials ; and visited select pilot program locations . dndo has made some progress in strengthening radiation detection capabilities to address critical gaps and vulnerabilities in combating nuclear smuggling , which include the land border area between ports of entry into the united states , aviation , and small maritime vessels . however , dndo is still in the early stages of program development , and has not clearly developed long term plans , with costs and time frames , for achieving its goal of closing these gaps by expanding radiological and nuclear detection capabilities . for example , dndo and customs and border protection have been collaborating on radiological and nuclear detection options to better secure the land borders between ports of entry . however , dndo - sponsored field evaluations to test radiation detection equipment are still not complete and dndo and cbp may not have all radiation detection equipment in place until 2012. in addition , dndo is in the first year of a 3-year maritime pilot program , working with the coast guard and local law enforcement agencies in the puget sound , washington , area to field test equipment and to develop radiological and nuclear screening procedures . however , dndo has made little progress in developing criteria for assessing the success of the pilot to help determine whether it should be expanded to other locations , and resolving some of the challenges it faces in the pilot program , such as technological limitations of the detection equipment and sustaining current detection efforts . although dndo has no authority over other federal agencies ' programs to combat radiological and nuclear smuggling overseas , it has worked with dod , doe , and state to provide subject matter expertise and exchange lessons learned on radiological and nuclear detection . however , most of dndo 's efforts are modest in scope , reflecting the fact that these agencies have well - established programs to combat nuclear smuggling . for example , dndo has been working with state 's global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism to develop model guidelines that other nations can use to establish their own nuclear detection programs . according to dndo , approximately $ 2.8 billion was budgeted by dhs , dod , doe , and state in fiscal year 2007 for programs included in the global strategy for nuclear detection . of this amount , approximately $ 1.1 billion was budgeted for programs to combat nuclear smuggling overseas , $ 1.1 billion was budgeted for nuclear detection programs at the u.s. border and within the united states , and approximately $ 577 million was budgeted to fund cross - cutting activities , such as providing technical support to users of the radiation detection equipment . dndo collected budget data and published them in the joint annual interagency review , an annual report required by congress . dod , doe , and state officials told gao that this information is used primarily as a status report of individual programs to combat nuclear smuggling . it is not used as a tool to help plan for or inform the future direction of the strategy or to help establish current or future priorities .
