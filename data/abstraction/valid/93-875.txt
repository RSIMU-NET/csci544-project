the authority of the united states senate ( as well as of the house ) to establish the rules for its own proceedings , to `` punish '' its members for misconduct , and to expel a member by a vote of two - thirds of members present and voting , is provided in the constitution at article i , section 5 , clause 2. this express grant of authority for the senate to expel a senator is , on its face , unlimited — save for the requirement of a two - thirds majority . in the context of what the supreme court has characterized as , in effect , an `` unbridled discretion '' of the body , expulsions in the senate , as well as the house , have historically been reserved for cases of the most serious misconduct : disloyalty to the government or abuses of one 's official position . the senate has actually expelled only 15 members — 14 of those during the civil war period for disloyalty to the union ( one of these expulsions was subsequently revoked by the senate ) , and the other senator during the late 1700s for disloyal conduct . the house of representatives has expelled only five members in its history , three during the civil war period , one in 1980 , and another in 2002 , after convictions for bribery and corruption offenses related to official congressional duties . in the senate , as well as in the house , however , other members for whom expulsion was recommended have resigned from office prior to official , formal action by the institution . the term `` censure , '' unlike the term `` expel , '' does not appear in the constitution , and has traditionally been used to describe the `` punishment '' imposed by the senate under authority of article i , section 5 , clause 2 , when the full body formally disapproves of conduct by way of the adoption of a resolution expressing such condemnation or disapproval . there is no specific forfeiture of rights or privileges that automatically follows a `` censure '' by the senate . the term `` censure '' is used to describe the action of the senate formally adopting a resolution expressing the body 's `` censure , '' `` condemnation , '' `` denouncement , '' or other expression of disapproval of a member 's conduct , even when the word `` censure '' is not expressly included in the language of the resolution . there is no specific or official hierarchy or ranking of the terms that have been employed in a censure resolution , although there may be certain connotations associated with the language used in a resolution because of precedents and associations with past members disciplined . the senate has censured nine senators for various misconduct , including conduct not a violation of any law or specific written senate ethics rule , when such conduct is found contrary to `` acceptable norms of ethical conduct in the senate , '' contrary to `` accepted morals '' and `` senatorial ethics , '' when found to `` derogate from the public trust expected of a senator , '' and / or found to be `` reprehensible '' conduct which brings the senate into `` dishonor and disrepute . . conduct resulting in senate `` censure '' has included violating orders of secrecy of documents ; fighting in the senate ( `` censure '' ) ; allowing a lobbyist with interests in particular legislation to be on official staff with access to the secret considerations of the legislation by committee ( `` condemn '' ) ; non - cooperation and abuse of investigating committees of the senate ( `` condemn '' ) ; financial irregularities concerning political contributions ( `` censure '' ) , office expenses and contributions ( `` denounce '' ) , and excessive honoraria , official reimbursements and gifts ( `` denounce '' ) .
