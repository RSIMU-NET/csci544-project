vigorous enforcement of anti - discrimination laws remains an essential responsibility of government . moreover , diversity in the federal government can be a key component for executing agency missions and achieving results . not only is it the right thing to do , but an inclusive work environment can improve retention , reduce turnover , increase our ability to recruit , and improve overall organizational effectiveness . in 2001 , the comptroller general changed the name of the office of civil rights to the office of opportunity and inclusiveness and gave the office responsibility for creating a fair and inclusive work environment by incorporating diversity principles in gao 's strategic plan and throughout our human capital policies . along with this new strategic mission , the comptroller general changed organizational alignment of the office of opportunity and inclusiveness ( o & i ) by having the office report directly to him . despite our continuing efforts to ensure a level playing field at gao , more needs to be done . the data show that for 2002 to 2005 the most significant differences in average appraisal ratings were among african - americans at all bands for most years compared with caucasian analysts . furthermore , the rating data for entry level staff show a difference in ratings for african - americans in comparison to caucasian staff at the entry - level from the first rating , with the gap widening in subsequent ratings . these differences are inconsistent with the concerted effort to hire analysts with very similar qualifications , educational backgrounds , and skill sets . in june 2006 , we held an senior executive service ( ses ) off - site meeting specifically focusing on concerns regarding the performance ratings of our african - american staff . shortly thereafter , the comptroller general decided that in view of the importance of this issue , gao should undertake an independent , objective , third - party assessment of the factors influencing the average rating differences between african - americans and caucasians . we should approach our concern about appraisal ratings for african - americans with the same analytical rigor and independence that we use when approaching any engagement . we must also be prepared to implement recommendations coming out of this review . additional efforts to enhance diversity are needed and planned while we continue to have a major challenge regarding the average performance ratings of african - americans , the percentages of african - americans in senior management positions at gao have increased in the last several years . gao believes that the o & i monitoring reviews , direct access to top gao management , and the other safeguards have played a significant role in these improvements . specifically , from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2007 , the percentage of african - american staff in the ses / senior level ( sl ) increased from 7.1 percent to 11.6 percent , and at the band iii level the percentages increased from 6.7 percent to 10.8 percent . furthermore , the percentages of african - americans in senior management positions at gao compare favorably to the governmentwide percentages . while the percentage of african - americans at the ses / sl level at gao was lower than the governmentwide percentage in 2000 , by september 2006 , the gao percentage had increased and exceeded the governmentwide percentage . at the band iii / gs - 15 level , the percentage of african - american staff at gao exceeded the governmentwide percentage in 2000 as well as in 2006. nonetheless , as an agency that leads by example , additional steps should be taken .
