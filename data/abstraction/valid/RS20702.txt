the everglades , a unique network of subtropical wetlands in florida , is half its original size . many factors contributed to its decline , including flood control projects and agricultural and urban development . federal , state , tribal , and local agencies collaborated to develop a comprehensive everglades restoration plan ( cerp , or the plan ) . cerp aims to increase storage of wet season waters to augment the supplies during the dry season for both the natural system and urban and agricultural users . the plan consists of more than 60 projects estimated to take more than 30 years and $ 10.9 billion to complete . the water resources development act ( wrda ) of 2000 ( p.l . 106-541 ) approved the cerp framework and authorized a first set of projects at $ 1.4 billion . wrda 2000 established how cerp costs would be split ; the federal government would pay half of construction and operation , and an array of state , tribal , and local agencies the other half . wrda 2007 ( p.l . 110-114 ) authorized a second set of cerp activities ( $ 2.0 billion ) . cerp implementation issues include project priorities and funding ; timeliness and effectiveness of restoration efforts ( e.g . , the impacts of delays in the modified water deliveries project ) ; mitigation of excess phosphorous ; and technological uncertainties . this report summarizes cerp and its implementation .
