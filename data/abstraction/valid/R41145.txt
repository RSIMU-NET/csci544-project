u.s. trade policy is at a cross - roads as the obama administration and the 112th congress face a range of policy issues and challenges . the future direction of trade policy and how the issues will be addressed are unclear at this time and the subject of sharp debate within congress , the administration , and the trade policy community at large . while a number of issues are related to trade policy , the fundamental question that is the subject of this debate is which trade policy , if any , will maximize the benefits of trade and boost u.s. living standards . among the trade issues facing congress and the administration are pending free trade agreements ( ftas ) and negotiations on new ftas ; the stalled doha development agenda ( dda ) multilateral trade negotiations ; the possible renewal of trade promotion authority ( tpa ) ; the review and reauthorization of trade preference programs for developing countries ; the enforcement of u.s. trade laws and rights under existing trade agreements ; the role of export promotion in the u.s. economic recovery ; and the growing link between foreign direct investment and trade and , with it , the increasing use of bilateral investment treaties ( bits ) and investment provisions in trade agreements . the current trade policy environment is affected by a number of political and economic forces . the political forces involve the opinions of the american public , including major stakeholders — business , labor , agriculture , and non - government organizations — on trade ; congressional perspectives ; presidential perspectives ; and tension in the congressional / executive relationship as the two branches play their respective trade policy roles . the economic forces include the global economic downturn ; the rise of developing countries , including the emerging markets of brazil , china , and india as major trading powers ; the growth of global production networks ; the proliferation of free trade agreements and other preferential trade arrangements ; the inherent limitations of trade policy as a tool in economic policy ; the growth of `` behind the border '' trade barriers ; and the long - standing u.s. trade deficits . the debate on trade is framed by three groups of views . one group , who might be called `` trade liberalizers , '' assert that on a net basis the benefits to the united states of trade liberalization are greater than the costs and , therefore , should be encouraged through trade barrier reductions . a second group — `` fair traders '' — acknowledge the benefits of trade liberalization but assert that u.s. firms and workers are often forced to compete under unfair conditions . they support trade agreements , but only if the agreements provide for a `` level playing field . . a third group — `` trade skeptics '' — tends to argue that the costs of trade liberalization outweigh the benefits for the united states , and therefore , reject unrestricted trade liberalization . where policymakers fit on this continuum of views could help to determine how they decide to address the outstanding and emerging trade issues before congress in many cases , the trade policy positions of policymakers and other experts can not be readily categorized as belonging to one group or another , but the categories provide a mechanism to analyze the major concepts in trade policy and their potential implications .
