the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 ( bapcpa ; p.l . 109-8 ) included the most significant amendments to consumer bankruptcy procedures since the 1970s . bankruptcy reform was enacted in response to the high number of consumer bankruptcy filings , which in 2004 and 2005 reached five times the level of the early 1980s . why did filings increase so dramatically during a period that included two of the longest economic expansions in u.s. history ? . because bankruptcy is by definition a condition of excessive debt , many would expect to see a corresponding increase in the debt burden of u.s. households over the same period . however , while household debt has indeed grown , debt costs as a percentage of income have risen only moderately . what aggregate statistics do not show is that the debt burden does not fall evenly on all families . financial distress is common among lower - income households : in 2007 , 27 % of families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution spent more than 40 % of their income to repay debt . following the effective date of bapcpa , in october 2005 , there was a sharp reduction in the number of bankruptcy filings , reflecting the `` rush to the courthouse '' in the months before the new law took effect . since the 2006 lows , the number of filings has risen steadily . in 2010 , personal bankruptcy filings reached 1.5 million , roughly equal to the pre - bapcpa level . it appears that bapcpa has not produced the effect its supporters hoped for â€” a substantial and permanent reduction in the rate of consumer bankruptcy . with the recession that began in december 2007 , the long - term upward trend in consumer indebtedness was interrupted . beginning in the middle of 2008 , the amount of debt held by u.s. households declined for 11 consecutive quarters . through the third quarter of 2011 , households reduced their debt burden by $ 853 billion , or 6.5 % . causes and implications of this trend are discussed in crs report r41623 , u.s. household debt reduction , by [ author name scrubbed ] . this report presents statistics on bankruptcy filings , household debt , and families in financial distress . it will be updated as new statistics become available .
