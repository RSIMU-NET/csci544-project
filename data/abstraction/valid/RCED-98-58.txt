pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed : the efforts by nonfederal land managers to generate revenue or become financially self - sufficient from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands ; and legal and other barriers that may preclude the forest service from implementing similar efforts on its lands . gao noted that : the nonfederal land managers whose efforts gao reviewed -- while not always attaining financial self - sufficiency -- are using a variety of sometimes innovative approaches and techniques to generate revenue or reduce costs from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands ; none of the approaches or techniques are legislatively mandated or otherwise required ; rather , the land managers have : usually tailored their efforts to meet either a clear mission to make a profit over time or an incentive to generate revenue for other mission - related goals and objectives ; and often been delegated the discretion and flexibility to explore innovative entrepreneurial ideas or conduct research to increase profits and to choose where and when to apply the results while being held accountable for their expenditures and performance ; generating revenue and reducing costs are not mission priorities for the forest service ; in keeping with its existing legislative framework , the agency is moving away from , rather than toward , financial self - sufficiency ; increasingly , legislative and administrative decisions -- such as setting aside an increasing percentage of forest service lands for conservation as wilderness , wild and scenic rivers , and national monuments -- and judicial interpretations of statutory requirements have required the forest service to shift its emphasis from uses that generate revenue to those that do not ; and furthermore : the agency is required to continue providing certain goods and services -- such as recreational sites , hardrock minerals , and livestock grazing -- at less than their fair - market value ; and certain congressional expectations and legislative provisions -- including those that require sharing revenue before deducting the costs of providing the goods or services -- serve as disincentives to either increasing revenue or decreasing costs .
