in 2017 two major hurricanes – irma and maria – caused extensive damage throughout puerto rico . hurricane maria , a category 4 hurricane , was the most intense hurricane to make landfall in puerto rico since 1928 , destroying roads , buildings , and cutting power and communication lines , among other things . puerto rico estimates that $ 132 billion will be needed to repair and reconstruct infrastructure and services . fema — a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — is the lead federal agency responsible for assisting puerto rico as it recovers . fema administers the public assistance program in partnership with puerto rico to provide funds to rebuild damaged infrastructure and restore critically - needed services . gao was asked to review the federal government 's recovery efforts related to the 2017 hurricanes . this report , among other objectives , describes fema 's public assistance spending in puerto rico and oversight efforts of federal recovery funds , and initial challenges with the recovery process . gao reviewed public assistance program documents ; analyzed grant funding data ; and interviewed officials from puerto rico and dhs about the public assistance program and recovery efforts , as well as officials from ten municipalities selected on the basis of population and public assistance spending . gao is not making recommendations at this time , but will continue monitoring the recovery as part of its ongoing work . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) obligated almost $ 4 billion in public assistance grant funding to puerto rico as of september 30 , 2018 in response to the 2017 hurricanes . fema obligated about $ 3.63 billion for emergency work — emergency measures such as debris removal and generators — and about $ 151 million for permanent work to repair and replace public infrastructure such as roads ( see figure ) . puerto rico established a central recovery office to oversee federal recovery funds and is developing an internal controls plan to help ensure better management and accountability of the funds . in the interim , fema instituted a manual reimbursement process — requiring fema to review each reimbursement request before providing public assistance funds — to mitigate risk and help ensure financial accountability . fema officials stated that they will remove this manual process once the agency approves puerto rico 's internal controls plan . officials from fema and puerto rico 's central recovery office and municipalities that gao interviewed reported initial challenges with the recovery process , including with public assistance alternative procedures . unlike in the standard public assistance program where fema will fund the actual cost of a project , the public assistance alternative procedures allow awards for permanent work projects to be made on the basis of fixed cost estimates to provide financial incentives for the timely and cost - effective completion of work . challenges identified included concerns about lack of experience and knowledge of the alternative procedures being applied in puerto rico ; concerns about missing , incomplete , or conflicting guidance on the alternative procedures ; and concerns that municipalities have not been fully reimbursed for work already completed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes , causing financial hardships in some municipalities . fema officials stated that the agency is taking actions to address reported recovery challenges , such as leveraging existing expertise to train personnel and developing supplemental guidance on alternative procedures and reducing delays in reimbursements . gao will continue to monitor these issues and plans to report additional findings and recommendations as appropriate later this year .
