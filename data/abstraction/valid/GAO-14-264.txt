defined benefit plans use interest rates to “ discount , ” or determine the current value , of estimated future benefits . experts in the united states have disagreed on both the approach that should be taken by plans to determine a discount rate and the appropriate rate to be used . different discount rates can create large differences in the valuation of a plan 's obligations , which in turn can lead various stakeholders to draw different conclusions about a plan 's health , the value of a plan 's benefits , and the contributions required to fund them . as requested , gao examined different approaches used to determine the discount rate . this report addresses the significance of differences in approaches used to determine discount rates among public and private plans ; purposes for measuring the value of a plan 's future benefits and key considerations for determining discount rate policy ; and approaches selected countries have taken to choose discount rates . for this review , gao analyzed provisions in relevant federal laws and regulations , as well as financial reporting and actuarial standards . gao also reviewed relevant literature and interviewed experts , including experts in canada , the netherlands , and the united kingdom — countries with significant defined benefit systems . in addition , gao modeled hypothetical pension investment portfolios and cash flows to calculate average investment returns using available historical data . public and private sector defined benefit pension plans are subject to different rules and guidance regarding discount rates — interest rates used to determine the current value of estimated future benefit payments . these differences can result in significant implications : sponsors of public sector plans generally use discount rates using a long - term assumed average rate of return on plan assets . this approach results in reported obligations that generally appear lower than those of comparable private sector single - employer plans . some experts believe this approach may encourage public plans to invest in riskier assets , which can increase the assumed return and thereby lower estimated obligations and plan contributions . other experts believe this approach helps to maintain more predictable and lower costs . private sector multiemployer plans generally use an assumed rate of return for funding purposes . sponsors of private sector single - employer pension plans use bond - based discount rates , which are generally lower than assumed rates of return , for financial reporting of their plans ' liabilities . experts believe this approach may encourage plans to invest in less risky assets , particularly high - quality bonds , to make pension costs less volatile , but it may increase current reported costs . funding requirements for these plans are tied to historical interest rates , which can reduce funding compared to measures based on more recent interest rates . experts identified at least five purposes for measuring the value of future benefits where discount rates are used , including determining sponsor contributions , reporting plan liabilities to stakeholders , determining the amount needed to secure benefits , measuring the value of employee benefits , and determining lump sum settlement amounts . they also identified a variety of considerations in setting discount rate policy , including cost , risk , fairness , sustainability , transparency , and comparability . to address trade - offs among these varied and sometimes competing purposes and considerations , many experts saw value in reporting multiple measures of plan obligations , using different discount rates . some experts also regarded assumed returns used by u.s. public plans as too high under current market conditions . selected countries we examined reported that they apply a variety of approaches to discounting . canada requires determination of multiple measures of plan obligations , based on both assumed returns and high - quality bond rates and annuity prices . the netherlands requires that plan obligations be measured based on market interest rates , but allows the use of assumed returns for determining plan contributions or developing recovery plans . in the united kingdom , discount rates are determined on a plan - specific basis and can include some allowance for assumed returns in excess of high - quality bond rates , depending on plan characteristics and the strength of the sponsor . to the extent that plans in these countries use long - term assumed rates of return , they are generally lower than the 7.5 to 8 percent used by many u.s. public plans under recent market conditions . experts gao interviewed in these countries described a greater degree of government oversight which might help explain their use of lower assumed returns . gao is not making any recommendations in this report .
