millions of u.s. workers have little or no savings for retirement , potentially adding to future strains on state and national safety net programs . in addition to federal efforts , a growing number of states have proposed efforts to expand coverage in private sector workplace retirement savings programs . other countries have also implemented similar efforts . gao was asked to study these state and international efforts . gao examined : recent estimates of coverage , including access and participation , as well as characteristics of workers who lack coverage ; strategies used by states and other countries to expand coverage ; and challenges states could face given existing federal law and regulations . gao primarily used sipp data from 2012 ( the most recent available ) . gao also interviewed federal officials , national industry stakeholders , and officials and stakeholders in six states ( california , illinois , maryland , massachusetts , washington , and west virginia ) and three countries ( canada , new zealand , and the united kingdom ) selected based on the range of strategies used in efforts to increase coverage and recommendations from knowledgeable stakeholders . about half of private sector workers in the united states — especially those who are low - income or employed by small firms — lack coverage from a workplace retirement savings program primarily because they do not have access . according to gao 's analysis of 2012 survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data , about 45 percent of private sector u.s. workers participated in a workplace retirement savings program — an estimate that is consistent with prior gao work and other research . using tax data to correct for under - reporting raised the share of workers participating to 54 percent , but still indicates many workers lack coverage . among those not participating , the vast majority — 84 percent — lacked access because they either worked for employers that did not offer programs or were not eligible for the programs that were offered , for example , because they were new employees or in specific jobs that were excluded from the program . in particular , lower - income workers and those employed by smaller firms were much less likely to have access to programs . however , among those who had access , the majority of these workers participated . key strategies to expand private sector coverage identified in the states and countries gao reviewed include encouraging or requiring workplace access , automatic enrollment , financial incentives , and program simplification . for example , pending implementation , programs in two of the states gao studied — california and illinois — would require certain employers to automatically enroll workers in a state - run program , though workers could choose to opt - out . in the countries gao studied , combining workplace access with automatic enrollment and financial incentives — tax preferences or employer contributions — has helped increase participation . moreover , states and countries have tried to simplify program designs to limit the responsibility and cost for employers and reduce complexity , cost , and risk for workers . for example , some states intend to not only reduce burdens for employers by selecting and monitoring providers , but also reduce complexity for workers by limiting the number of investment options . state and national stakeholders reported potential challenges with uncertainty created by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) and agency regulations that could delay or deter state efforts to expand coverage . generally , erisa preempts , or invalidates , any state law relating to “ employee benefit plans ” for private sector workers , but different areas of uncertainty arise based on the details of each state effort . for example , four of the six states gao reviewed intend to create payroll deduction individual retirement account ( ira ) programs that would not be considered employee benefit plans . however , due to uncertainty created by erisa , it is unclear whether a state can offer such programs or whether some of the program features would lead a court to find that they are , or relate to , employee benefit plans . stakeholders also noted uncertainty caused by regulations from the departments of labor ( dol ) and the treasury meant to assist workers and employers . for example , dol 's regulation on payroll deduction iras was written before these state efforts were proposed and omits detail that , if included , could help reduce uncertainty . given these uncertainties , states may face litigation and stakeholders noted that state programs could lose tax preferences if they were ruled preempted by erisa . gao suggests that congress consider providing states limited flexibility regarding erisa preemption to expand private sector coverage . agency actions should also be taken to address uncertainty created by existing regulations . agencies generally agreed with gao 's recommendation . dol plans to issue a proposed rule on state programs by the end of 2015 .
