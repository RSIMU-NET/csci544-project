determining the country of origin of an imported product is important for properly assessing tariffs , enforcing trade remedies ( such as antidumping and countervailing duties ) or quantitative restrictions ( tariff quotas ) , and statistical purposes . other commercial trade policies are also linked with country of origin determinations , such as labeling and government procurement regulations . rules of origin ( roo ) , the methodology used to prove country of origin , can be very straightforward — as long as the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled in one country . however , when a finished product 's component parts originate in many countries , as is often the case in today 's global trading environment — determining origin can be a more complex process . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is the u.s. agency responsible for determining country of origin . cbp uses non - preferential roo to determine the origin of goods imported from countries with which the united states has most - favored - nation ( mfn ) status . a key principle used in non - preferential roo cases is `` substantial transformation , '' which means the country in which the product was last substantially transformed , or made into a `` new and distinct '' product . since no u.s. laws specifically govern non - preferential roo , these determinations are made by cbp primarily on a case - by - case basis using cbp 's own rules and precedents . preferential roo are used to determine the eligibility of imports from u.s. free trade agreement ( fta ) partners to receive fta benefits , and whether goods from eligible developing countries qualify for tariff benefits under u.s. trade preference programs like the generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) . preferential roo apply specifically to each fta or preference , meaning that they vary from agreement to agreement and preference to preference . cbp has periodically proposed implementing a more uniform system of determining non - preferential roo . cbp 's last proposal was made in july 2008 , when it suggested that a system implemented under north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) roo `` has proven to be more objective and transparent and provide greater predictability in determining the country of origin of imported merchandise than the system of case - by - case adjudication they would replace . . the nafta scheme had already been used for several years to determine the origin of imports under nafta . the proposed roo modifications received so many responses from the public that the deadline for public comment was extended twice . changes in roo requirements are opposed by some importers due to the costs involved in transitioning to new rules , or because they assert that some products they import might be at a disadvantage under different roo methodology . according to a subsequent federal register notice , cbp implemented a portion of the proposed regulations applicable to a few specific products , including glass optical fiber , pipe fittings and flanges , and greeting cards . this report deals with roo in three parts . first , it describes the reasons that country of origin rules are important and describes u.s. laws and methods that provide direction in making roo determinations . second , it discusses some of the more controversial issues involving rules of origin , including the apparently subjective nature of some cbp origin determinations , and the effects of the global manufacturing process on roo . third , it concludes with some alternatives and options that congress could consider that might assist in simplifying the process .
