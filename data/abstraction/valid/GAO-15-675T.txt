the federal government invests more than $ 80 billion annually in it . however , these investments frequently fail , incur cost overruns and schedule slippages , or contribute little to mission - related outcomes . this underperformance of federal it projects can be traced to a lack of disciplined and effective management and inadequate executive - level oversight . accordingly , in february 2015 , gao added improving the management of it acquisitions and operations to its high - risk list — a list of agencies and program areas that are high risk due to their vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement , or are most in need of transformation . gao was asked to testify on its designation of the management of it acquisitions and operations as a federal high - risk area and the impact of recent legislation on it acquisition reform . in preparing this statement , gao relied on its previously published work in these areas . federal investments in information technology ( it ) have often resulted in multimillion dollar cost overruns and years - long schedule delays , with questionable mission - related achievements . further , the implementation of initiatives to improve it acquisitions has been inconsistent . for example , the office of management and budget ( omb ) established a process for holding face - to - face investment performance reviews between agencies and omb ( referred to as “ techstats ” ) . however , as of 2013 less than 20 percent of at - risk investments across the government had undergone such reviews , even though gao has identified a number of ongoing it investments with significant issues that require attention . omb also requires investments to deliver capabilities every 6 months , but as gao reported in 2014 , less than half of selected investments at five major agencies planned to deliver capabilities in 12-month cycles . to facilitate transparency across the government in acquiring and managing it investments , omb established a public website — the it dashboard — to provide detailed information on major investments at federal agencies . as of may 2015 , the dashboard showed that 178 of the government 's 738 major investments — totaling $ 8.7 billion — were in need of management attention due to their risk . moreover , omb does not update the public version of the dashboard while the president 's budget request is being formulated , most recently for more than 6 months . gao has made multiple recommendations to improve the dashboard . further opportunities for savings and efficiency exist in agencies ' spending on “ commodity ” it ( e.g . , it infrastructure , enterprise systems such as e - mail , and systems that perform administrative functions ) and the consolidation of federal data centers . the table below shows savings realized or planned from the consolidation of federal data centers . however , limitations exist in how agencies report savings in these areas : better tracking them would provide for greater transparency and oversight . recognizing the importance of these issues , a law was recently enacted aimed at reforming federal it acquisition . this legislation should help address the key issue areas identified in gao 's high - risk designation . omb has released proposed guidance for agencies to implement provisions of this law , to include implementing roles and responsibilities for senior agency officials . to improve the management of it acquisitions and operations , it is also critical for agencies to implement gao 's prior recommendations and demonstrate measurable government - wide progress in key areas such as delivering it systems incrementally and realizing planned data center savings . from october 2009 through december 2014 , gao made 737 recommendations to omb and agencies to improve the management and oversight of it . as of january 2015 , only about 23 percent of these had been fully implemented .
