federal and state agencies are making extensive use of information technology ( it ) to address traditional regulatory management . for example , the department of labor has a system of electronic `` advisors '' imitating the interaction that an individual might have with an employment law expert , and the environmental protection agency is working with partners in state government to develop a national environmental information exchange network . several of the state innovations include interactive systems that allow regulated entities to identify their regulatory responsibilities and complete related transactions . for example , the texas railroad commission has an electronic process that allows users to obtain oil or gas well permits on - line , complete the required forms , and pay any associated fees . representatives from nongovernmental organizations suggest that federal agencies improve both the content and access to on - line information , more broadly and consistently use some existing applications , and adopt some new applications . several key factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption and diffusion of innovative it applications are top - level leadership commitment / support , adequate financial resources and human capital , legislative and executive branch it initiatives , internal and external partnerships with critical stakeholders , reengineering of existing business processes , and development of a communication infrastructure .
