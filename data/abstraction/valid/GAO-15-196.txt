in the wake of the economic and political transitions associated with the “ arab spring , ” congress authorized the creation of enterprise funds for egypt and tunisia in 2011. eaef and taef aim to develop the private sectors in these countries , particularly smes , through instruments such as loans , equity investments , and technical assistance . usaid signed grant agreements with both funds in 2013 and has thus far obligated $ 120 million to eaef and $ 60 million to taef . in this report , gao examines the status of the funds ' investments , the funds ' progress in establishing key management structures to support their missions and operations , and the extent to which the funds have complied with requirements in the grant agreements . to address these objectives , gao reviewed usaid and fund documents , such as eaef and taef grant agreements , policies and procedures , and the funds ' boards of directors meeting minutes . gao also interviewed usaid and fund officials . the egyptian - american enterprise fund ( eaef ) has not yet made any investments in egypt , and the tunisian - american enterprise fund ( taef ) has made an over $ 2.4 million investment in tunisia . eaef has not made any investments in egypt as its initial investment did not proceed as planned . eaef 's attempt to purchase a bank in egypt that would lend money to small and medium - sized enterprises ( sme ) was rejected by the egyptian central bank . eaef is now considering other options , such as investments in the food and beverage sector . taef 's investment strategy is to invest in four different areas : a private equity fund investing in smes , direct investments in smes smaller than those targeted by the private equity fund , microfinance institutions , and start - ups . in june 2014 , taef made an over $ 2.4 million investment in a private equity fund that invests in and finances tunisian smes . eaef and taef ( the funds ) have made progress in establishing key management structures to support their mission and operations , with additional actions under way . in terms of administrative structures , both funds have hired initial staff . regarding their corporate governance , eaef and taef both have boards of directors that have met regularly , adopted by - laws , and developed corporate policies and procedures . both funds plan to develop and implement additional management structures in the future , such as audits of their 2013 and 2014 financial statements . while taef and eaef have generally fulfilled the requirements of the grant agreements , gao found three gaps in the funds ' implementation and one gap in the u.s. agency for international development 's ( usaid ) implementation . first , the funds have not yet submitted their performance monitoring plans as required by the grant agreements . second , eaef has not implemented the provisions in its grant agreement related to public communications , such as development of its own logo . third , the funds ' corporate policies do not include procedures to implement vetting requirements designed to prevent illicit use of the funds , the presence of which was expected by usaid . usaid has also not tracked the funds ' use of cash in a way that allows the agency to monitor whether eaef and taef are spending it in a timely manner . collectively , these gaps in implementation pose challenges for usaid 's oversight of the funds . gao recommends that usaid take steps to further enhance its oversight of the funds ' compliance with the grant agreements and other requirements by establishing a process to better manage cash advances to the funds ; ensuring that the funds comply with the grant agreement requirements related to performance monitoring and public communications ; and ensuring that the funds ' corporate policies include vetting requirements . usaid concurred with our recommendations .
