millions of americans currently use mobile devicese.g . , cellphones , smartphones , and tablet computerson a daily basis to communicate , obtain internet - based information , and share their own information , photographs , and videos . given the extent of consumer reliance on mobile interactions , it is increasingly important that these devices be secured from expanding threats to the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the information they maintain and share . accordingly , gao was asked to determine what common security threats and vulnerabilities affect mobile devices , what security features and practices have been identified to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities , and the extent to which government and private entities have been addressing the security vulnerabilities of mobile devices . to do so , gao analyzed publically available mobile security reports , surveys related to consumer cybersecurity practices , as well as statutes , regulations , and agency policies ; gao also interviewed representatives from federal agencies and private companies with responsibilities in telecommunications and cybersecurity . threats to the security of mobile devices and the information they store and process have been increasing significantly . for example , the number of variants of malicious software , known as malware ,  aimed at mobile devices has reportedly risen from about 14,000 to 40,000 or about 185 percent in less than a year ( see figure ) . cyber criminals may use a variety of attack methods , including intercepting data as they are transmitted to and from mobile devices and inserting malicious code into software applications to gain access to users sensitive information . these threats and attacks are facilitated by vulnerabilities in the design and configuration of mobile devices , as well as the ways consumers use them . common vulnerabilities include a failure to enable password protection and operating systems that are not kept up to date with the latest security patches . mobile device manufacturers and wireless carriers can implement technical features , such as enabling passwords and encryption to limit or prevent attacks . in addition , consumers can adopt key practices , such as setting passwords and limiting the use of public wireless connections for sensitive transactions , which can significantly mitigate the risk that their devices will be compromised . federal agencies and private companies have promoted secure technologies and practices through standards and public private partnerships . despite these efforts , safeguards have not been consistently implemented . although the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has facilitated public - private coordination to address specific challenges such as cellphone theft , it has not yet taken similar steps to encourage device manufacturers and wireless carriers to implement a more complete industry baseline of mobile security safeguards . in addition , many consumers still do not know how to protect themselves from mobile security vulnerabilities , raising questions about the effectiveness of public awareness efforts . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) have not yet developed performance measures or a baseline understanding of the current state of national cybersecurity awareness that would help them determine whether public awareness efforts are achieving stated goals and objectives . gao recommends that fcc encourage the private sector to implement a broad , industry - defined baseline of mobile security safeguards . gao also recommends that dhs and nist take steps to better measure progress in raising national cybersecurity awareness . the fcc , dhs , and nist generally concurred with gaos recommendations .
