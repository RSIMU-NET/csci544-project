gao reviewed the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) systems for identifying geographical areas where access to medical care is limited , focusing on : how well the systems identify areas with primary care shortages ; how well the systems target federal funding to the underserved ; and whether the hhs proposal to combine the systems would lead to improvements . gao found that : the two hhs systems do not reliably identify areas with primary care shortages or help target federal resources to the underserved ; the systems have widespread data and methodology problems which severely limit their ability to pinpoint needy areas ; both systems tend to overstate the need for additional primary care providers because they do not consider all of the categories of providers already in place ; the health professional shortage area system ( hpsa ) does not consider the extent to which available resources are being used ; the medically underserved area system ( mua ) is limited in its ability to identify underserved areas and populations ; neither system identifies the specific subpopulations that have difficulty obtaining medical care ; while the systems can sometimes accurately identify needy areas , they do not provide the necessary data to determine which programs are best suited to those areas ; the proposed consolidation and streamlining of the systems is not likely to solve system problems , since the underlying causes of the problems have not been addressed ; it may be more cost - effective to modify individual programs and application processes to identify where needs exist and the appropriate program to meet those needs and to target resources better ; and hhs officials believe that they need to maintain a national shortage designation system to monitor primary care access , but hhs has another initiative under way that could serve those purposes .
