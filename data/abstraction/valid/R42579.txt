congress continues to look at various fuel contributions to the electricity market and federal involvement with these fuel sources . hydropower , the use of flowing water to produce electricity , is one such contribution . conventional hydropower accounted for approximately 6 % of total u.s. net electricity generation in 2014. hydropower has advantages and disadvantages as an energy source . its advantages include its ability to be a continuous , or baseload , power source that releases minimal air pollutants during power generation relative to fossil fuels . some of its disadvantages , depending on the type of hydropower plant , include high initial capital costs , ecosystem disruption , and reduced generation during low water years and seasons . hydropower project ownership can be categorized as federal or nonfederal . the bulk of federal projects are owned and managed by the bureau of reclamation and the u.s. army corps of engineers . these projects are typically authorized and funded by congress . nonfederal projects are licensed and overseen by the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) . considered by many to be an established and renewable energy source , hydropower is not always discussed alongside clean or other renewable energy sources in the ongoing energy debate due to its potential environmental impacts . however , hydropower proponents argue that hydropower is cleaner than some conventional energy sources , and point to recent findings that additional hydropower capacity could help the united states reach proposed energy , economic , and environmental goals . others argue that the expansion of hydropower in the form of numerous small hydropower projects could have environmental impacts and regulatory issues similar to those of existing large projects . the 114th congress may face several issues as it considers how hydropower fits into a changing energy and economic landscape . for example , existing large hydropower infrastructure is aging ; many of the nation 's hydropower generators and dams are more than 30 years old . proposed options to address these concerns include increasing federal funding , utilizing alternative financing and / or customer investments , and privatizing federally owned dams , among other options . additionally , whether to significantly expand hydropower ( either through new or more efficient federal hydropower generation or through federal incentives to encourage expansion or efficiency gains of nonfederal hydropower ) may require congressional input due to the role of the federal government in hydropower development and permitting . another issue receiving attention is the rate at which ferc issues licenses for nonfederal projects , which some find slower than ideal . others defend the licensing process due to the environmental and other statutes with which agencies must comply . legislation related to hydropower development was enacted in the 113th congress , including p.l . 113-23 and p.l . 113-24. p.l . 113-23 , the hydropower regulatory efficiency act of 2013 , grants small hydropower projects with a capacity of 10 megawatts or less an exemption from ferc licensing requirements , promotes conduit hydropower projects , and requires ferc to examine the feasibility of a two - year licensing process to promote hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed - loop pumped storage projects , among other things . p.l . 113-24 , the bureau of reclamation small conduit hydropower development and rural jobs act , authorizes nonfederal hydropower development at all reclamation projects , provides for the preference of existing project sponsors in developing this power , and makes reclamation the lead agency in implementing this authority . other legislation related to hydropower enacted in the 113th congress included the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-121 ) , part of which expedites the approval and development of nonfederal corps hydropower projects and orders a report on the status and funding of nonfederal hydropower projects as well as a study on the implications of issuing federally tax - exempt bonds from the inland waterways trust fund to hydropower facilities . additionally , p.l . 113-76 , the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 , provided new funding to the department of energy ( doe ) for the expansion of hydropower development at existing dams , as authorized under the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ) .
