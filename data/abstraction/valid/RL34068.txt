the 109th congress passed legislation ( p.l . 109-248 ) that allows the federal government to civilly commit `` sexually dangerous persons . . civil commitment , as it relates to sex offenders , is when a state retains custody of an individual , found by a judge or jury to be a `` sexually dangerous person , '' by involuntarily committing the person to a secure mental health facility after the offender 's prison sentence is done . in 1990 , the state of washington passed the first civil commitment law for sexually dangerous persons . currently , 18 other states and the federal government have similar laws . moreover , the supreme court , in kansas v. hendricks and kansas v. crane , ruled that current civil commitment laws are constitutional . the civil commitment of sex offenders centers on the belief that sex offenders are more likely than other offenders to re - offend . however , data on sex offender recidivism is varied . data show that the recidivism risk for sex offenders may be lower than it is typically thought to be ; in fact , some studies show that sex offenders recidivate at a lower rate than many other criminals . other studies show that , given time , almost all sex offenders will commit a new sex crime . most discussions about recidivism examine ways to decrease recidivism ; for example , by providing sex offenders with treatment . research on the efficacy of sex offender treatment is promising , but it can not prove that treatment reduces recidivism . cognitive - behavioral techniques appear to be the most promising type of treatment for sex offenders , although some research indicates that offenders who receive a diagnosis of psychopathy may be less amenable to treatment . for civil commitment to be effective , practitioners must be able to identify sex offenders who pose a high risk of re - offending . although the ability of practitioners to identify offenders has improved , there is still the possibility that an offender who would not re - offend might be committed . moreover , determining when it is safe to release a sex offender from custody is still difficult for practitioners . such concerns have raised questions about alternatives to civil commitment . one potential alternative is the use of less restrictive measures , such as intensive community supervision . another alternative is the use of indeterminate sentences for sex offenders . the cost of civil commitment programs has fueled debate about other viable means for managing dangerous sex offenders . data show that civil commitment programs are expensive when compared with traditional incarceration or community supervision . the cost of civil commitment programs is expected to grow as more offenders are committed . an issue for congress is whether civil commitment is a sustainable policy for dealing with sexually dangerous persons , or whether there is a different way to manage this population effectively . the issue of civil commitment raises a series of concomitant questions : how much do civil commitment programs cost ? . how dangerous are sex offenders ? . is sex offender treatment effective ? . can sexually dangerous persons be defined and identified ? . are there less restrictive alternatives for managing sex offenders ? . this report will be updated as warranted .
