pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined the proposal by a coalition of the seven largest u.s. airlines to replace the ticket tax with user fees , focusing on : whether the ticket tax should be replaced by a different fee system ; what the potential competitive impacts of the fees proposed by the coalition airlines would be ; what factors need to be considered if a new fee system were to be developed ; and the implications on the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) budget of reinstating or not reinstating the taxes that finance the airport and airway trust fund . gao found that : because the ticket tax is based on the fares paid by travelers and not an allocation of actual faa costs , it may not fairly allocate the system 's costs among the users ; the coalition airlines ' proposal to replace the ticket tax with user fees only incorporates factors that would substantially increase the fees paid by low - fare and small airlines and decrease the fees paid by the seven coalition airlines ; the proposal would dramatically redistribute the cost burden among airlines and could have substantial implications for domestic competition ; any replacement system for the ticket tax would need to account for the wide range of costs incurred by faa in managing the airport and airway system ; the views of all affected parties , not just any particular group of airlines , would need to be included in assessing the mechanisms for financing the airport and airway system ; and congress established a commission to study how best to meet faa financing needs which will help ensure that , in the long term , faa has a secure funding source , commercial users of the system pay their fair share , and a strong , competitive airline industry continues to exist .
