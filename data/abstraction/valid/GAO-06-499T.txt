the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) filing season performance affects tens of millions of taxpayers who expect timely refunds and accurate answers to their tax questions . irs 's budget request is a planning tool showing how it intends to provide taxpayer service and enforce the tax laws in 2007. it is also the first in a series of annual steps that will determine whether irs meets its new long - term goals of increasing tax compliance and reducing taxpayers ' acceptance of cheating on their taxes . tax law enforcement remains on gao 's list of high - risk federal programs , in part , because of the persistence of a large tax gap . irs recently estimated the gross tax gap , the difference between what taxpayers owe and what they voluntarily pay , to be $ 345 billion for 2001. gao assessed irs 's interim 2006 filing season performance ; the budget request ; and how the budget helps irs achieve its longterm goals . gao compared performance and the requested budget to previous years . irs has improved its filing season performance so far in 2006 , continuing a trend . more refunds were directly deposited , which is faster and more convenient . electronic filing continued to grow , but at a slower rate than in previous years . irs 's two most commonly used services -- telephone and web site assistance -- continued to improve . irs estimates that the accuracy rate for its telephone answers is now at 90 percent or more . taxpayers continued the recent pattern of using irs 's walk - in sites less and community - based volunteer sites more . while millions of taxpayers use chain paid tax preparers , taxpayers may not be receiving accurate and complete assistance , putting them at risk of owing back taxes , interest , and penalties . the 2007 budget request of $ 11 billion ( a small decrease after adjusting for inflation ) sets performance goals for service and enforcement that are all equal to or higher than the 2006 goals . the budget reduces funding by 15 percent for business systems modernization , the ongoing effort to replace irs 's aging information systems . the reduction could impede progress delivering improvements to taxpayers . the budget request identified over $ 121 million in savings ; however , opportunities exist for further savings . for example , irs officials told us irs 's 25 call centers have underutilized space . those centers could be consolidated without affecting service to taxpayers . achieving irs 's long - term compliance goals will be challenging because the tax gap has persisted for many years at about its current level . in addition , because the effect of taxpayer service and enforcement on compliance has never been quantified , irs does not have a data - based plan demonstrating how it will achieve its goals . nor does irs have a plan for measuring compliance by 2009 , the date for achieving the goals . reducing the tax gap will likely require new and innovative solutions such as simplifying the tax code , increasing income subject to withholding , and increasing information reporting about income .
