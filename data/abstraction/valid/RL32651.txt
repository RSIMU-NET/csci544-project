congress has identified research and development ( r & d ) as important contributors totechnological progress . the performance of r & d may have intellectual property ramifications , however . to the extent that researchers use patented inventions without authorization , they may faceinfringement liability . although the courts recognize an exception to patent infringement known asthe `` experimental use privilege , '' this judicially created doctrine has been described as very narrowand rarely applied . in particular , the experimental use privilege applies only to uses done foramusement , to satisfy idle curiosity or for strictly philosophical inquiry . this doctrine does notexcuse uses that are in keeping with the accused infringer 's business objectives . in 2002 , the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit applied these principles in the caseof madey v. duke university . the court held that the experimental use privilege does not apply toactivities that are `` in keeping with the alleged infringer 's legitimate business '' -- even though thebusiness of the defendant , duke university , was nonprofit research . this ruling has raised concernsamong some representatives of universities and research institutions , who fear that their basic r & dactivities will subject them to patent infringement lawsuits . competing views have arisen over the significance of the madey v. duke university case . some commentators believe that a limited experimental use privilege may best encouragetechnological advancement by rewarding successful researchers with robust patent rights . othersargue that the restricted nature of the experimental use privilege may in fact limit researcher accessto state - of - the - art technologies and thus discourage further technological development . still othersassert that this issue is not of great practical importance , as few patent owners will likely file costlyand time - consuming lawsuits against researchers who are not making commercially important usesof patented inventions . the judicially created , `` common law '' experimental use privilege is complemented by alimited statutory experimental use privilege for patents on pharmaceuticals , medical devices , andcertain other products regulated by the food and drug administration . this provision , enacted aspart of the 1984 hatch - waxman act , applies to firms seeking to market generic equivalents ofbrand - name products . in addition , congress has enacted other intellectual property legislation thatincorporates provisions shielding researchers from infringement liability . should congressional interest continue in this area , a variety of options are available . if thecurrent scope of the common law experimental use privilege is deemed to be appropriate , then noaction need be taken . alternatively , congress could enact legislation confirming the limitedexperimental use privilege recognized in madey v. duke university and predecessor cases . introduction of a broader form of the experimental use privilege into u.s. patent law is an additionalpossibility . the report will be updated if events warrant such action .
