on november 3 , 2010 , the federal reserve ( fed ) announced that it would purchase an additional $ 600 billion of treasury securities , an action that has popularly been dubbed quantitative easing or `` qe2 . . this announcement followed purchases since march 2009 of $ 300 billion of treasury securities , $ 175 billion of agency debt , and $ 1.25 trillion of agency mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) . ( the agency debt and mbs were primarily issued by fannie mae and freddie mac . ) . this report defines quantitative easing as actions to further stimulate the economy through growth in the fed 's balance sheet once the federal funds rate has reached the `` zero bound . . in its announcement of qe2 , the fed justified its decision by citing the `` disappointingly slow '' progress to date toward achieving its statutory mandate of maximum employment and stable prices . by contrast , critics believe that unconventional monetary actions such as qe2 could be destabilizing and ultimately result in high inflation . there are several ways that quantitative easing can affect the economy . it would be expected to reduce yields on the securities being purchased , and this could have a cascading downward effect on private yields that could stimulate investment spending . like any monetary stimulus , it could put downward pressure on the dollar , which would stimulate exports and u.s. production of import - competing goods . the initial quantitative easing following the 2008 crisis helped restore liquidity to the financial system , although this channel is arguably not as important now that liquidity has generally been restored . finally , the direct effect of quantitative easing to date has been to increase bank reserves by over $ 1 trillion . if banks choose to lend these reserves , it would stimulate economic activity and increase the money supply . but lending has fallen in the past year , and there have been only relatively modest increases in the overall money supply . nevertheless , the increase in bank reserves could eventually result in large increases in the overall money supply , which could arguably make it difficult for the fed to meet its statutory mandate to keep inflation low and stable . the fed has explored different methods of unwinding quantitative easing if inflationary pressures rose , which have been referred to as the `` exit strategy . . one method would be to directly reverse quantitative easing by selling some or all of the additional securities that the fed has purchased , which would automatically withdraw reserves from the banking system . a drawback to this approach is that large sales of securities would probably involve selling its mortgage - related securities , and this could be destabilizing to a housing market that is still sluggish . another method would be to raise the interest rate that the fed has been paying to banks on reserves since 2008 to a level high enough that it would give banks an incentive to keep the funds parked at the fed rather than lending them out . this approach is largely untested , however , and the associated expenditure could become large relative to the fed 's overall profits at historically normal levels of interest rates . since the fed remits most of its profits to the treasury , where these are added to general revenues , both quantitative easing and its unwinding have implications for the federal budget deficit . since quantitative easing increases the amount of income - earning securities held by the fed , it would be expected to increase its profits and reduce the federal budget deficit . indeed , profits increased from $ 38.8 billion in 2008 to $ 52.4 billion in 2009. similarly , unwinding qe would be expected to reduce the fed 's profits . some critics have argued that the fed is monetizing the budget deficit through qe2 . the fed is legally prohibited from purchasing federal debt directly from the treasury , but fed purchases of treasury securities on the open market have a similar effect on the budget deficit as if those purchases were made directly .
