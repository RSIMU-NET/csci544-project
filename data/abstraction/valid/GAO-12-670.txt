over the last 10 years , participation in the u.s. department of agricultures ( usda ) snap , previously known as the food stamp program , has more than doubled , and costs have quadrupled . since 1999 , usda has allowed states to expand snap eligibility by adopting bbce policies , which make households that receive services funded by temporary assistance for needy families , such as a toll - free number or brochure , categorically eligible for snap . under bbce policies , states are able to increase federal snap limits on household income and remove limits on assets . although usda has encouraged states to adopt bbce to improve snap access and administration , little is known about the effects of these policies . gao was asked to assess : to what extent are households that would otherwise be ineligible for snap deemed eligible for the program under bbce ? . what effect has bbce had on program costs ? . what are the program integrity implications of bbce ? . gao analyzed data from usda , selected states , and other national sources ; conducted site visits to 5 states ; and interviewed federal , state , and local officials , as well as others with knowledge of snap . in fiscal year 2010 , gao estimates that 2.6 percent ( 473,000 ) of households that received supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) benefits would not have been eligible for the program without broad - based categorical eligibility ( bbce ) because their incomes were over the federal snap eligibility limits . the characteristics of these households were generally similar to other snap households , although they were more likely to work or receive unemployment benefits . bbce removes asset limits in most states , and while reliable data on participants assets are not available , other data suggest few likely had assets over these limits . although bbce contributed to recent increases in snap participation , other factors , notably the recent recession , had a greater effect . gao estimates that bbce increased snap benefit costs , which are borne by the federal government , by less than 1 percent in fiscal year 2010. in that year , total snap benefits provided to households that , without bbce , would not have been eligible for the program because their incomes were over the federal snap eligibility limits were an estimated $ 38 million monthly or about $ 460 million for the year . these households received an estimated average monthly snap benefit of $ 81 compared to $ 293 for other households . bbces effect on snap administrative costs , which are shared by the federal and state governments , is unclear , in part because of other recent changes that affect this spending , such as state budget and staffing reductions in the recent recession . bbce has potentially had a negative effect on snap program integrity . in recent years , the snap payment error rate declined to an historic low , but evidence suggests the decline is primarily due to changes other than bbce . while bbce may improve administrative efficiency , both national data and discussions with local staff suggest bbce may also be associated with more errors . in addition , bbce has led to unintended consequences for snap and related programs . for example , in implementing bbce , some states are designating snap applicants as categorically eligible without providing them with the service required to make this determination . further , likely because they are unaware of recent usda guidance , some states certify children for free school meals when their households are determined eligible for snap , even though they do not receive snap benefitsa result more common in states with bbce . finally , because of federal guidance on bbce , rules for reporting changes in household circumstances now differ by household income level and may leave higher income households without reporting requirements for several months . gao recommends that usda review state procedures for implementing bbce , disseminate guidance to states on certifying snap households as eligible for school meals , and revisit its guidance on snap reporting requirements to ensure they address all households . usda generally agreed with gaos recommendations .
