the federal communications commission 's ( fcc ) low - income program , administered by the universal service administrative company ( usac ) and supported by the universal service fund ( usf ) , provides low - income households with discounts on installation costs for new telephone service and monthly charges for basic telephone service . in this requested report , gao examined how program participation and support payments have changed over the last 5 years ( 2005-2009 ) , and factors that may have affected participation ; the extent to which goals and measures are used to manage the program ; and the extent to which mechanisms are in place to evaluate program risks and monitor controls over compliance with program rules . gao surveyed state public utility commissions ; reviewed key policies , procedures , and rules ; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders . low - income program participation and support payments have increased since 2005 due to many factors . program participation was stable from 2005 to 2008 , from 6.9 million to 7.1 million participants , but increased to 8.6 million in 2009. likewise , support payments were relatively stable from 2005 to 2008 , from $ 802 million to $ 823 million annually , before increasing to approximately $ 1 billion in 2009. the increases in 2009 were primarily due to the addition of a prepaid wireless service option in certain states , which allows program participants to obtain a free wireless handset and an allotment of free minutes each month . the low - income program has no funding cap and usac officials project its support payments to reach $ 1.4 billion in 2010. they said participation and payments will likely continue to increase beyond 2010 as prepaid wireless service options become available in additional states . fcc has taken limited steps to develop performance goals and measures for the low - income program , however , these steps do not fully align with useful practices for developing successful goals and measures . while performance goals and measures specific to the low - income program would enable fcc to more effectively manage the program and determine its success , fcc has not made developing such measures a priority and , as a result , has limited insight on the intent of the program and what it is accomplishing . fcc might conduct pilot programs as it considers expanding the low - income program to include broadband service ( high - speed internet access ) , as proposed by the national broadband plan . for the broadband pilot programs , if conducted , it is important that fcc develop a needs assessment and implementation and evaluation plans to increase confidence in the results . if implemented properly , the pilot programs would enable fcc to improve its data collection for low - income households and could help facilitate program and policy decisions for the low - income program in the future . although fcc and usac have some mechanisms in place to identify and evaluate risks and monitor compliance with program rules , the low - income program lacks key features of effective internal controls . fcc and usac primarily use audit findings to monitor compliance with program rules . however , the number and scope of usac 's audits have been limited and there is no systematic process in place to review the findings of those audits that are conducted . further , fcc and usac have not conducted a risk assessment specific to the low - income program that includes consideration of all program vulnerabilities , such as the possibility that multiple carriers may claim support for the same telephone line and that households may receive more than one discount , contrary to program rules . according to gao standards , fcc should identify all risks to meeting the program 's goals and objectives and have a process to systematically consider audit findings when assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls . without these mechanisms , fcc and usac may not be capturing and addressing programmatic risks and collecting information that could be leveraged to assess compliance with program rules and strengthen internal controls . fcc should clearly define performance goals and develop quantifiable measures that can be used to determine the program 's success , conduct a needs assessment and develop implementation and evaluation plans for the proposed low - income pilot programs , conduct a robust risk assessment , and implement a systematic process to consider audit results . fcc agreed with gao 's recommendations .
