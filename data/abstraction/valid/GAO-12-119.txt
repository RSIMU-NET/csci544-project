many americans spend frustrating hours each year stuck in traffic . while estimates vary , the department of transportation ( dot ) estimates that traffic congestion costs the united states $ 200 billion each year , and that more than one - quarter of total annual travel time in metropolitan areas occurs in congested conditions . road pricing or congestion pricingassessing tolls that vary with the level of congestion or time of dayaims to motivate drivers to share rides , use transit , travel at less congested times , or pay to use tolled lanes . since the first u.s. congestion pricing project opened in 1995 , 19 project sponsors have 41 pricing projects in operation or under construction . about 400 miles of priced highway lanes including nearly 150 miles on the new jersey turnpike are in operation today with current tolls varying from 25 cents to $ 14 . all u.s. projects in operation are either high occupancy toll ( hot ) lanes , which charge solo drivers to use newly constructed lanes or carpool lanes , or peak - period pricing projects , which charge a lower toll on already tolled roads , bridges and tunnels during offpeak periods . gao examined the federal role in supporting congestion pricing , results of u.s. congestion pricing projects , and emerging issues in congestion pricing . eight project sponsors have current and completed evaluations on at least 1 project , for a total of 14 evaluated projects , all of which gao reviewed . gao interviewed officials about the performance of their pricing projects and effects . dot provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . dot approves all congestion pricing projects on roadways that receive federal funds and provides grants for project studies , implementation , and evaluation . nearly all hot lane projects and most peak - period pricing projects in operation today received federal funds at one time or another . dots largest programs for congestion relief , the urban partnership agreement and congestion reduction demonstration programs , have provided grant funds totaling nearly $ 800 million since 2006 to six metropolitan areas to implement pricing and other strategies . dot requires sponsors of congestion pricing projects to monitor and evaluate performance and , for hot lanes when applicable , ensure that a federal standard for minimum traffic speeds is met . the 14 congestion pricing projects that have current and complete evaluations generally show that pricing can help reduce congestion , although other results are mixed , and not all possible relevant impacts have been assessed . hot lane projects , which aim to reduce congestion by decreasing travel time and increasing speed and the number of vehicles using the lane , have reduced congestion , but some hot lane projects also added new lanes , and studies did not distinguish the extent to which performance improvements were due to added lanes or pricing . in addition , although the number of cars using hot lanes has risen , there were fewer people in those cars because of an increase in the proportion of toll - paying solo drivers or a decrease in carpools . peak - period pricing projects , which aim to reduce congestion by encouraging drivers to travel at off - peak times , have shifted some travel to those times . other congestion pricing effectssuch as equity income impactshave not always been evaluated . potential concerns include income equity ( whether low - income drivers are disproportionately affected by congestion pricing ) and geographic equity ( whether one geographic area is more negatively affected than another , such as when traffic diversion occurs ) . these impacts are important to assess as they address the public and elected officials concerns about the effects of pricing on travelers and communities . ongoing multi - year evaluations across six metropolitan areas will assess the performance and effects of congestion pricing projects using a specific set of measures to assess the effectiveness of congestion reduction strategies . concerns about equity may grow as pricing projects become more widespread . new projects are under construction , and several metropolitan areas have networks of hot lanes planned that will expand the relatively limited use of pricing today . equity concerns may become more acute where sponsors are using pricing not only to manage congestion , but also to raise revenue to build new projects . raising revenue can be at odds with managing congestion ( e.g . , increasing passenger throughput ) if higher tolls can produce more revenue from fewer paying vehicles . options to address equity issues include using a portion of toll revenues to finance public transit service .
