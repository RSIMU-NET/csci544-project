in recent years a number of observers and practitioners have identified various facets of u.s. government national security practice — decision - making , strategy - making , budgeting , planning and execution , and congressional oversight — as inherently `` cross - cutting . . they have in mind arenas — such as counterterrorism , and stabilization and reconstruction — that by definition involve multiple agencies , or for which responsibilities could be divided up in any number of ways among various agencies . for such facets of national security , they argue , the u.s. government is seldom able to conduct genuinely holistic consideration . the cost , they add , is a loss of effectiveness , or efficiency , or both . in order to encourage holistic consideration of national security issues , some members of this inchoate school have called for the use of `` unified national security budgeting '' ( unsb ) . to be clear , their goal is not to refine the u.s. federal system of budgeting , but rather to use budgetary mechanisms to drive changes in u.s. national security practices . within this broad school of thought , various proponents call for the adoption of a number of different approaches , from a single shared funding pool for all national security activities , to mission - specific funding pools , to crosscut displays , to more strategically driven budgeting . in turn , various proponents apparently aim to achieve quite different kinds of change with their proposed remedies — from rebalancing the distribution of roles and responsibilities among executive branch agencies , to saving money , to revisiting fundamental understandings about how u.s. national security is best protected . for congress , constitutionally mandated to control the power of the purse , the most fundamental issue at stake may be ensuring the integrity of the overall federal budgeting system — there may be no single best answer regarding how it should function , but that it function would seem to be of paramount importance . at the same time , while the current system does not adjudicate `` national security '' in an explicit , bounded way , and while no single , generally agreed definition of the boundaries of `` national security '' exists , congress has oversight responsibility for any number of activities and executive branch agencies that could reasonably be considered to contribute to national security , and thus vested interests in both the effectiveness and the efficiency of u.s. national security practices . a basic challenge for congress may be fundamental tensions between optimizing the overall federal budgeting system , and optimizing for its national security sub - system . for any set of `` unified budgeting '' proposals , it may be helpful to congress to consider what problems the proposals are designed to address ; the potential costs and benefits that implementing the proposals might introduce ; the risks the proposals might pose to the functioning of the current overall u.s. federal budgeting system ; and how the impact of the implementation of the proposals would best be gauged .
