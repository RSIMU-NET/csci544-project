aliens awaiting removal proceedings or found to be removable from the united states are detained in ice custody or released into the community under one or more options , such as release on bond and under supervision of the atd program . within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , ice is responsible for overseeing aliens in detention and those released into the community . in 2004 ice implemented the atd program to be a cost - effective alternative to detaining aliens . ice administers the program with contractor assistance using case management and electronic monitoring to ensure aliens comply with release conditions — including appearing at immigration court hearings and leaving the united states if they receive a final order of removal . the joint explanatory statement to the 2014 consolidated appropriations act mandated that gao evaluate ice 's implementation of the atd program . this report addresses trends in atd program participation from fiscal years 2011 through 2013 and the extent to which ice provides oversight to help ensure cost - effective program implementation , and the extent that ice measured the performance of the atd program for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. gao analyzed ice and atd program data , reviewed ice documentation , and interviewed ice and atd contractor officials . from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2013 , the number of aliens who participated in the u.s. immigration and customs enforcement 's ( ice ) alternatives to detention ( atd ) program increased from 32,065 to 40,864 , in part because of increases in either enrollments or the average length of time aliens spent in one of the program 's components . for example , during this time period , the number of aliens enrolled in the full - service component , which is run by a contractor that maintains in - person contact with the alien and monitors the alien with either global positioning system ( gps ) equipment or a telephonic reporting system , increased by 60 percent . in addition , the average length of time aliens spent in the technology - only program component , which offers a lower level of supervision at a lower contract cost than the full - service program component and involves ice monitoring of aliens using either telephonic reporting or gps equipment provided by a contractor , increased by 80 percent — from about 10 months to about 18 months . in 2011 , ice recommended practices in guidance to its enforcement and removal operations ( ero ) field offices to better ensure cost - effective implementation of the program . for example , ice recommended that field officers move aliens who have demonstrated compliance under the full - service component to the less costly technology - only component . gao 's work showed differences in ero field offices ' implementation of the guidance . however , ice headquarters officials said that because of limitations in how they collect and maintain program data , they do not know the extent to which field officers have consistently implemented this guidance . ice plans to institute new data collection requirements to address these limitations and use these data for a variety of purposes ; however , ice has not considered how to analyze these data to monitor the extent to which ero field offices are implementing the guidance . analyzing these data , once collected , could help ice better monitor the extent to which ero field offices are implementing the practices in its guidance intended to ensure more cost - effective program operation . ice has established atd program performance measures to , among other things , assess alien compliance with requirements to appear in court and leave the country after receiving a final order of removal , but it has not collected complete data for assessing progress against these measures . specifically , ice 's atd contractor collected data for the full - service component , and from fiscal years 2011 through 2013 , these data showed that over 99 percent of aliens with a scheduled court hearing appeared in court as required . however , ice did not collect similar performance data to report results for aliens enrolled in the technology - only component — which composed 39 percent of the overall atd program participants in fiscal year 2013 — because when the program was first created , ice officials stated that they envisioned that most aliens would be in the full - service component with data tracked by the contractor . ice plans to expand the contractor 's role in data collection but does not plan to require collection of performance data for aliens enrolled in the technology - only component ; rather ice plans to leave it to the discretion of field officials as to whether to require the contractor to collect these data . without requirements to collect these data , ice may not have complete information to fully assess program performance . gao recommends that ice analyze data to monitor ero field offices ' implementation of guidance and require the collection of data on the technology - only component . dhs concurred with the recommendations .
