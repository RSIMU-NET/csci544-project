hepatitis c is a chronic disease caused by a blood - borne virus that can lead to potentially fatal liverrelated conditions . in 2001 , gao reported that the va missed opportunities to test about 50 percent of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c. gao was asked to review va 's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results in testing veterans at risk for hepatitis c , identify factors that impede va 's efforts to test veterans for hepatitis c , and identify actions taken by va networks and medical facilities to improve the testing rate of veterans at risk for hepatitis c. gao reviewed va 's fiscal year 2002 hepatitis c performance results and compared them against va 's national performance goals , interviewed headquarters and field officials in three networks , and conducted a case study in one network . va 's performance measurement result shows that it tested , in fiscal year 2002 or earlier , 5,232 ( 62 percent ) of the 8,501 veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c in va 's performance measurement sample , exceeding its fiscal year 2002 national goal of 55 percent . thousands of veterans ( about one - third ) of those identified as at risk for hepatitis c infection in va 's performance measurement sample were not tested . va 's hepatitis c testing result is a cumulative measure of performance over time and does not only reflect current fiscal year performance . gao found network 5 ( baltimore ) tested 38 percent of veterans in fiscal year 2002 as compared to network 5 's cumulative performance result of 60 percent . in its case study of network 5 , which was one of the networks to exceed va 's fiscal year 2002 performance goal , gao identified several factors that impeded the hepatitis c testing process . these factors were tests not being ordered by the provider , ordered tests not being completed , and providers being unaware that needed tests had not been ordered or completed . for more than two - thirds of the veterans identified as at risk but not tested for hepatitis c , the testing process failed because hepatitis c tests were not ordered , mostly due to poor communication between clinicians . for the remaining veterans , the testing process was not completed because orders had expired by the time veterans visited the laboratory or test orders were overlooked because laboratory staff had to scroll back and forth through daily lists , a cumbersome process , to identify active orders . moreover , during subsequent primary care visits by these untested veterans , providers often did not recognize that hepatitis c tests had not been ordered nor had their results been obtained . consequently , undiagnosed veterans risk unknowingly transmitting the disease as well as potential complications resulting from delayed treatment . the three networks gao looked at -- 5 ( baltimore ) , 2 ( albany ) , and 9 ( nashville ) -- have taken steps intended to improve the testing rate of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c. to do this , in two networks officials modified clinical reminders in the computerized medical record to alert providers that for ordered hepatitis c tests , results were unavailable . officials at two facilities developed a `` look back '' method to search computerized medical records to identify all at - risk veterans who had not yet been tested and identified approximately 3,500 untested veterans . the look back serves as a safety net for veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c who have not been tested . the modified clinical reminder and look back method of searching medical records appear promising , but neither the networks nor va has evaluated their effectiveness .
