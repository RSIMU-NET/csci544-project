news reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s drew attention to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate `` inversions '' or `` expatriations '' : instances where u.s. firms reorganize their structure so that the `` parent '' element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the united states . the main objective of these transactions was tax savings , and they involved little to no shift in actual economic activity . bermuda and the cayman islands ( countries with no corporate income tax ) were the locations of many of the newly created parent corporations . these types of inversions largely ended with the enactment of the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( jobs act ; p.l . 108-357 ) , which denied the tax benefits of an inversion if the original u.s. stockholders owned 80 % or more of the new firm . the act effectively ended shifts to tax havens where no real business activity took place . however , two avenues for inverting remained . the act allowed a firm to invert if it has substantial business operations in the country where the new parent was to be located ; the regulations at one point set a 10 % level of these business operations . several inversions using the business activity test resulted in treasury regulations in 2012 that increased the activity requirement to 25 % , effectively closing off this method . firms could also invert by merging with a foreign company if the original u.s. stockholders owned less than 80 % of the new firm . if the original u.s. shareholders owned less than 60 % , the firm was not considered as inverting . two features made a country an attractive destination : a low corporate tax rate and a territorial tax system that did not tax foreign source income . the u.k. joined countries such as ireland , switzerland , and canada as targets for inverting when it adopted a territorial tax in 2009. at the same time , the u.k. also lowered its rate ( from 25 % to 20 % by 2015 ) . inverted firms could reduce worldwide taxes by stripping taxable earnings out of the new u.s. subsidiary , largely through allocating debt to that subsidiary . soon after , several high - profile companies indicated an interest in merging with a non - u.s. headquartered company , including pfizer , chiquita , abbvie , and burger king . this `` second wave '' of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the u.s. tax base . chiquita and abbvie canceled their plans in the wake of 2014 treasury regulations , but burger king and other firms completed merger plans . pfizer subsequently terminated its planned merger with allergan after treasury regulations issued in 2016. evidence suggests that these treasury regulations have been an important factor in subsequently decreasing these merger - related inversions . two policy options had been discussed in response : a general reform of the u.s. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax - motivated international mergers . in december 2017 , p.l . 115-97 ( popularly known as the tax cuts and jobs act ) lowered the corporate tax rate as part of broader tax reform which some argued would slow the rate of inversions . other tax reform proposals suggested that if the united states moved to a territorial tax , the incentive to invert would be eliminated . there were concerns that a territorial tax could worsen the profit - shifting that already exists among multinational firms . p.l . 115-97 , while moving in some ways to a territorial tax , also instituted a number of measures aimed at combatting profit shifting , including a global minimum tax on intangible income that limited the tax benefits of a territorial tax . the second option is to directly target inversions . the 2017 act included several provisions that discouraged inversions . in addition , further anti - inversion provisions have been introduced , most recently h.r . 5108 and s. 2459 in the 115th congress , to treat all firms in which former u.s. shareholders have more than 50 % ownership ( or in which management and control is in the united states ) as u.s. firms . these bills also provided that debt could also be allocated to the u.s. member of a worldwide operation in proportion to the u.s. ownership of assets .
