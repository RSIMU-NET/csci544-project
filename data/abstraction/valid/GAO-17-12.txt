public safety personnel across the nation rely on lmr to share information and coordinate their emergency response efforts . lmr systems are intended to provide secure , reliable , mission - critical voice communications in a variety of environments , scenarios , and emergencies ; however , lmr interoperability — the ability to communicate across agencies — has been a long - standing challenge at all levels of government . gao was asked to examine federal agencies ' lmr interoperability and procurement practices . gao examined lmr equipment used by federal agencies and the state of lmr interoperability among these agencies ; factors that help and hinder lmr interoperability among agencies ; and agencies ' lmr procurement practices . gao surveyed civilian federal agencies , identified through their membership in the emergency communications preparedness center ( 57 agencies fully responded to the survey and one agency provided a partial response ) ; reviewed department of homeland security planning documents related to interoperability ; and interviewed federal agency officials with responsibilities related to emergency communications and procurement of lmr equipment . gao also reviewed omb initiatives to improve federal procurement . federal agencies gao surveyed generally use land mobile radio ( lmr ) equipment to meet their core missions , such as public safety , emergency management , or firefighting . more than two - thirds of the 57 agencies gao surveyed reported using equipment from the same manufacturer because , for example , they believe doing so will help ensure compatibility of new lmr equipment with existing system requirements . most agencies gao surveyed were consistent in identifying each other as agencies with which they have or have not needed lmr interoperability over the past 5 years . of the agencies that identified the need to communicate with each other , about two - thirds reported generally having a good or excellent level of lmr interoperability . the use of standards - based and multi - band lmr equipment has helped to enhance interoperability among agencies , but the use of proprietary features and other factors continue to hinder interoperability . almost all of the agencies that gao surveyed reported using lmr equipment that meets voluntary technical standards , which have improved interoperability . further , almost half of these agencies reported using multiband radios , which operate on multiple public - safety radio bands , to enhance interoperability . however , agencies reported several factors continue to limit their progress in achieving interoperability with other federal agencies . these factors include the use of proprietary features and encryption in devices and limited investments in lmr systems and devices . for example , about half of the agencies surveyed reported that the use of proprietary features within lmr devices has hindered interoperability . nearly half of the agencies gao surveyed reported using pre - approved vendors with established prices to acquire lmr equipment , mainly through contracts sponsored by the departments of homeland security and the interior . while this approach can facilitate cost savings and interoperability , many of these agencies reported purchasing equipment through multiple agreements , a practice that can reduce these benefits . about 40 percent of agencies gao surveyed reported using sole - source procurement or independent approaches . according to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , in general , agencies often purchase and manage items in a fragmented and inefficient manner . this approach can result in duplication of effort , which imposes significant costs on federal agencies . omb has directed agencies to implement “ category management ” as an improved way to manage spending across government for commonly purchased goods and services . this approach enables the government to leverage its purchasing power and realize cost savings . however , omb 's category management initiative does not include lmr equipment even though federal agencies spend millions of dollars annually purchasing such equipment . by including lmr equipment in omb 's category management initiative , the government could more fully leverage its aggregate buying power to obtain the most advantageous terms and conditions for lmr procurements . omb officials agreed that a category management approach to lmr procurement might save the government money while supporting the goal of enhanced interoperability among agencies that require it , but omb has not examined the feasibility of applying this approach to the procurement of lmr equipment . gao recommends that omb examine the feasibility of including lmr in its category management initiative . omb generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
