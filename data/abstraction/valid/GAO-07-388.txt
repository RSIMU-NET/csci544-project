over the next several years , the department of defense ( dod ) plans to invest $ 1.4 trillion in major weapons programs . while dod produces superior weapons , gao has found that the department has failed to deliver weapon systems on time , within budget , and with desired capabilities . while recent changes to dod 's acquisition policy held the potential to improve outcomes , programs continue to experience significant cost and schedule overruns . gao was asked to examine how dod 's processes for determining needs and allocating resources can better support weapon system program stability . specifically , gao compared dod 's processes for investing in weapon systems to the best practices that successful commercial companies use to achieve a balanced mix of new products , and identified areas where dod can do better . in conducting its work , gao identified the best practices of : caterpillar , eli lilly , ibm , motorola , and procter and gamble . to achieve a balanced mix of executable development programs and ensure a good return on their investments , the successful commercial companies gao reviewed take an integrated , portfolio management approach to product development . through this approach , companies assess product investments collectively from an enterprise level , rather than as independent and unrelated initiatives . they weigh the relative costs , benefits , and risks of proposed products using established criteria and methods , and select those products that can exploit promising market opportunities within resource constraints and move the company toward meeting its strategic goals and objectives . investment decisions are frequently revisited , and if a product falls short of expectations , companies make tough go / no - go decisions . the companies gao reviewed have found that effective portfolio management requires a governance structure with committed leadership , clearly aligned roles and responsibilities , portfolio managers who are empowered to make investment decisions , and accountability at all levels of the organization . in contrast , dod approves proposed programs with much less consideration of its overall portfolio and commits to them earlier and with less knowledge of cost and feasibility . although the military services fight together on the battlefield as a joint force , they identify needs and allocate resources separately , using fragmented decision - making processes that do not allow for an integrated , portfolio management approach like that used by successful commercial companies . consequently , dod has less assurance that its investment decisions address the right mix of warfighting needs , and , as seen in the figure below , it starts more programs than current and likely future resources can support , a practice that has created a fiscal bow wave . if this trend goes unchecked , congress will be faced with a difficult choice : pull dollars from other high - priority federal programs to fund dod 's acquisitions or accept gaps in warfighting capabilities .
