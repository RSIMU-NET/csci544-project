ten years ago , to coordinate the activities of the various federal agencies involved in export promotion and to ensure better delivery of services to potential exporters , congress established the interagency trade promotion coordinating committee ( tpcc ) under the export enhancement act of 1992. among other things , the act required the committee to develop a governmentwide strategic plan that establishes priorities for federal activities in support of u.s. export activities and proposes the annual , united federal trade promotion budget that supports the plan . tpcc 's annual national export strategies identify broad priorities for promoting u.s. trade , but they do not discuss agencies ' specific goals or assess progress made . in its initial strategies , the committee identified 10 regionally dispersed priority markets for future trade promotion efforts , but it did not discuss agencies ' specific goals or report later on progress made in increasing exports to these markets . shifting to a regional approach 3 years later in its 1997 strategy , the committee identified central and eastern europe as a region where u.s. government assistance to u.s. exporters would be important in increasing market share . again the strategy did not discuss agencies ' specific goals nor did later strategies report on progress made or even cover consistent topics from year to year . without regular assessments of progress , it is not clear whether export promotion resources are being used most productively in support of the strategy . furthermore , the committee has limited ability to align agency resources with its strategy . the committee has made modest but inconsistent progress in coordinating federal agencies ' export promotion efforts . in its first national export strategy in 1993 , the committee identified coordination weaknesses and recommended improvements , most of which required interagency consensus to implement . although many of its initial recommendations were implemented during the committee 's first few years , some have not been implemented -- for example , the need for improved agency staff training and improved trade information services to bring clarity to the export process , as well as the need for expanded outreach and trade education for new - to - export firms .
