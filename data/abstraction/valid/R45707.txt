prior to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , coverage for losses from such attacks was normally included in general insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders . following the attacks , such coverage became expensive , if offered at all . moreover , some observers feared that the absence of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact , because insurance is required to consummate a variety of transactions ( e.g . , real estate ) . for example , if real estate deals were not completed due to lack of insurance , this could have ripple effects — such as job loss — on related industries like the construction industry . terrorism insurance was largely unavailable for most of 2002 , and some have argued that this adversely affected parts of the economy , while others suggest the evidence is inconclusive . congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 ( tria ; p.l . 107-297 ) , which created a temporary three - year terrorism insurance program . under tria , the government would share the losses on commercial property and casualty insurance should a foreign terrorist attack occur , with potential recoupment of this loss sharing after the fact . in addition , tria requires insurers to make terrorism coverage available to commercial policyholders , but does not require policyholders to purchase the coverage . the program expiration date was extended in 2005 ( p.l . 109-144 ) , 2007 ( p.l . 110-160 ) , and 2015 ( p.l . 114-1 ) . over the course of such reauthorizations , the prospective government share of losses has been reduced and the recoupment amount increased , although the 2007 reauthorization also expanded the program to cover losses from acts of domestic terrorism . the tria program is currently slated to expire at the end of 2020. in general terms , if a terrorist attack occurs under tria , the insurance industry covers the entire amount for relatively small losses . for a medium - sized loss , the government assists insurers initially but is then required to recoup the payments it made to insurers through a broad levy on insurance policies afterwards — the federal role is to spread the losses over time and over the entire insurance industry and insurance policyholders . as the size of losses grows larger , the federal government covers more of the losses without this mandatory recoupment . ultimately , for the largest losses , the government is not required to recoup the payments it has made , although discretionary recoupment remains possible . the precise dollar values where losses cross these small , medium , and large thresholds are uncertain and will depend on how the losses are distributed among insurers . the specifics of the current program are as follows : ( 1 ) a terrorist act must cause $ 5 million in insured losses to be certified for tria coverage ; ( 2 ) the aggregate insured losses from certified acts of terrorism must be $ 180 million in a year for the government coverage to begin ( this amount increases to $ 200 million in 2020 ) ; and ( 3 ) an individual insurer must meet a deductible of 20 % of its annual premiums for the government coverage to begin . once these thresholds are met , the government covers 81 % of insured losses due to terrorism ( this amount decreases to 80 % in 2020 ) . if the insured losses are less than $ 37.5 billion , the secretary of the treasury is required to recoup 140 % of government outlays through surcharges on tria - eligible property and casualty insurance policies . as insured losses rise above $ 37.5 billion , the secretary is required to recoup a progressively reduced amount of the outlays . at some high insured loss level , which will depend on the exact distribution of losses , the secretary would no longer be required to recoup outlays . since tria 's passage , the private industry 's willingness and ability to cover terrorism risk have increased . according to data collected by the treasury , in 2017 , approximately 78 % of insureds purchased the optional terrorism coverage , paying $ 3.65 billion in premiums . over the life of the program , premiums earned by unrelated insurers have totaled $ 38 billion . this relative market calm has been under the umbrella of tria coverage and in a period in which no terrorist attacks have occurred that resulted in government payments under tria . it is unclear how the insurance market would react to the expiration of the federal program , although at least some instability might be expected were this to occur . with the upcoming 2020 expiration of the program , the 116th congress may consider legislation to extend tria ; to date , no such legislation has been introduced .
