the revitalization of distressed public housing program , referred to as hope vi , has been credited with eliminating and replacing some of the most dangerous and dilapidated public housing in the country with new mixed income communities . however , the program has come under scrutiny for slow expenditure of funds and for displacing poor families . reflecting these criticisms , the bush administration requested no new funding for the program in each budget request from fy2004-fy2009 , and the obama administration requested no new funding ( proposing , instead , that congress fund a new program ) in the fy2010 and fy2011 budget requests . congress responded by continuing to fund the program , but at less than a quarter of what it had been funded at in fy2003 and prior years . in fy2012 , for the first time since the program 's inception , congress provided no new funding for hope vi . created in 1992 and administered by the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the hope vi program provides funds to renovate or demolish existing public housing and replace it with mixed - income housing . the local public housing authorities ( phas ) that administer public housing apply for grants and use the funds to leverage other private and public resources . the main component of the hope vi program is revitalization grants , which can be used for demolition , rehabilitation , and new construction of public housing , as well as land acquisition , relocation of residents , and community and supportive services for residents . hud has also provided demolition - only grants that could be used — often in conjunction with revitalization grants — for the physical destruction of distressed public housing and the relocation of its residents , although no demolition grants have been issued for several years . a third type of grant , planning grants , are no longer awarded , but could be used for technical assistance in preparing a property to go through a demolition or revitalization . another type of revitalization grant , main street revitalization grants , was created in 2003. they are available to local governments in small communities rather than phas for main street revitalization projects , which may be unrelated to public housing . over the history of the program , 268 hope vi revitalization grants ( incluing main street grants ) have been made to phas in 41 states , districts , and territories . as of june 2009 , the program had been responsible for the demolition of 93,295 units of public housing and the construction or substantial rehabilitation of 78,692 replacement units . the hope vi program has helped transform a number of severely distressed neighborhoods , which has made the program popular with many members of congress from both parties . the program 's authorization was set to expire at the end of fy2006 , but congress has extended the authorization for the program each year in the annual appropraitions acts . beginning with its fy2010 budget request to congress , the obama administration has requested that congress replace the hope vi program with a new program , the choice neighborhoods initiative ( cni ) , which would expand the scope of hope vi beyond public housing to other assisted housing , with a greater focus on neighborhood revitalization . the house financial services approved authorizing legislation in the 111th congress , but it was not enacted before the end of the session . congress did fund a demonstration of cni in the fy2010-fy2012 hud appropriations act . fy2012 was the first year since the hope vi program began that it received no new appropriations . however , the fy2012 appropriations law ( p.l . 112-55 ) did extend the authorization for the program .
