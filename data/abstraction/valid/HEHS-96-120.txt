pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed states ' experiences in utilizing the medicaid waiver program to provide care for developmentally disabled adults in alternative settings , focusing on : expanding state use of the waiver program ; controlling long - term care costs for developmentally disabled individuals ; and the strengths and limitations in states ' quality assurance approaches in community settings . gao found that : based on national data and three case studies , states ' use of the waiver program has changed long - term care for developmental disabled persons by providing such persons with a broader range of services that they and their families prefer ; the waiver program has increased the number of persons served and the use of group home settings while allowing states to close many institutional care facilities and to expand services to persons in state - financed programs ; states now serve more developmentally disabled persons through the waiver program than the institutional program ; the waiver program has allowed states to pursue distinct strategies and achieve different program results ; from 1990 to 1995 , medicaid costs for long - term care for developmentally disabled persons increased an average of 9 percent annually due to increased costs for waiver and institutional program services , but per capita costs and cost increases varied by state ; the cap on the number of program recipients and state management practices helped contain these costs ; changes in the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) process for setting waiver program caps could increase program costs , but hcfa believes that state budget constraints could limit program growth ; and although states are changing their quality assurance procedures for waiver program services , such as customizing quality assurance to individual circumstances , more needs to be done to improve quality oversight mechanisms and reduce participants ' risk as these mechanisms evolve .
