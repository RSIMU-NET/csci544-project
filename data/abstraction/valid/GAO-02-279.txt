nursing homes that participate in medicare and medicaid must periodically assess the needs of residents in order to develop an appropriate plan of care . such resident assessments are known as the minimum data set ( mds ) . according to officials in the 10 states with mds accuracy review programs in operation as of january 2001 , these programs were established to set medicaid payments and identify quality of care problems . nine of the 10 states conduct periodic on - site reviews in all or a significant portion of their nursing homes to assess the accuracy of the mds data . these reviews sample a home 's mds assessments to determine whether the basis for the assessments is adequately documented in residents ' medical records . these reviews often include interviews of nursing home personnel familiar with residents and observations of the residents themselves . states with separate mds review programs identified various approaches to improve mds accuracy . state officials highlighted the on - site review process itself and provider education activities as their primary approaches . state officials also reported such remedies as requiring nursing homes to prepare a corrective action plan or imposing financial penalties on nursing homes when serious or extensive errors in mds data are found . following the 1998 implementation of medicare 's mds - based payment system , the health care financing administration began its own review program to ensure the accuracy of mds data .
