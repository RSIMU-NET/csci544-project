a `` pit '' is the plutonium `` trigger '' of a thermonuclear weapon . during the cold war , the rocky flats plant ( co ) made up to 2,000 pits per year ( ppy ) , but ceased operations in 1989. since then , the department of energy ( doe ) has made at most 11 ppy for the stockpile , yet the department of defense stated that it needs doe to have a capacity of 50 to 80 ppy to extend the life of certain weapons and for other purposes . this report focuses on 80 ppy , the upper end of this range . various options might reach 80 ppy . successfully establishing pit manufacturing will require , among other things , enough laboratory space and `` material at risk '' ( mar ) . mar is essentially the amount of radioactive material permitted in a building that could be released in an accident ; there must be enough mar available for manufacturing within the mar `` ceiling . . pf - 4 , the main plutonium building at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) , or other structures would house manufacturing . analytical chemistry ( ac ) , which analyzes the composition of samples from each pit to support manufacturing , will also require availability of mar and space . for an option to support 80 ppy , mar and space available for manufacturing and ac must exceed mar and space required for 80 ppy . `` margin '' is the amount by which an available amount exceeds a required amount . this report presents amounts of mar and space potentially available for manufacturing under several options , though they may require updating . calculation of margin — needed to determine if an option passes a minimum test for feasibility — also requires data on mar and space required for 80 ppy , yet these data have never been calculated rigorously . as a result , it is not known if an option would increase capacity too little ( making an option infeasible ) , too much ( making an option too costly ) , or by an appropriate amount . congress could direct the national nuclear security administration , which operates the nuclear weapons program , to provide data on space and mar required to manufacture 80 ppy . these data would permit calculation of space margin and mar margin as static numbers . however , the situation is dynamic : uncertainties may materialize over time , increasing or decreasing margin . ac poses different issues . it is needed to support production . it requires much space but uses little mar . the nuclear weapons complex has ample excess space and mar available for ac , so margin is not at issue , though such factors as logistics might become an issue . thus , three key decisions face congress in deciding how to produce 80 ppy : decision 1 : for pit manufacturing , is there currently enough margin for space and mar in pf - 4 ? . if not , what can be done to provide it ? . decision 2 : once enough margin for space and margin for mar are provided for pit manufacturing , what steps can be taken to maintain these margins over decades in the face of uncertainties ? . decision 3 : how much ac should be done at lanl , what is needed to make the space and mar at lanl sufficient to support that amount of ac , and how much , if any , ac should be done at other sites ? . choosing among options also requires data on how options compare on cost and other metrics , setting up a process for downselection . this report is best viewed in color , as it contains many multicolored graphics .
