icd is the standard code set used in the united states to document patient medical diagnoses and inpatient medical procedures . every claim submitted by health care providers to payers for reimbursement , including those for medicare programs , includes these codes . cms is responsible for enforcing the use of icd codes and is requiring providers to begin using the 10th revision of the codes ( icd - 10 ) on october 1 , 2015. its role in preparing for the transition includes making changes to the agency 's information technology systems used to process medicare fee - for - service claims and supporting stakeholders ' efforts to implement changes to the systems they use to submit medicare claims that are to include icd - 10 data . gao was asked to study the actions planned and taken by cms to support entities ' transition to icd - 10 . this report discusses cms 's efforts to implement system changes needed for the agency to process claims that include icd - 10 codes , the extent to which cms 's testing and verification actions are sufficient to ensure the system changes are made , and steps cms is taking to ensure that stakeholders have access to technical support needed to make system changes . to do this , gao reviewed project documentation and held discussions with medicare officials , contractors , and selected stakeholder groups that represent providers , health care clearinghouses , and insurers that share claims data with cms . gao provided a draft of this report to hhs and incorporated its comments as appropriate . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) has finished updating its systems with the changes it determined were needed to process the new international classification of diseases codes ( icd - 10 ) on medicare fee - for - service claims . in 2007 , cms began taking steps to identify components of its systems that needed to be changed to update the icd codes from version 9 to 10. cms began making the system changes in early 2010 as part of an established change management process for releasing system updates on a quarterly basis , and , by october 2013 , had completed actions to modify its systems to process the new data . in doing so , cms made changes to validate that codes on submitted claims were of the correct length and format specific to icd - 10 requirements and to determine whether submitted claims data included the proper codes to be processed and approved for payment . industry guidance states that systems testing should be conducted early and often in the life cycle of a project to allow for the modification of software in a timely manner , and that organizations should define procedures for approving systems for release and plan for contingencies to help mitigate risks that may be introduced when software changes are implemented into a live production environment . consistent with these practices , cms began testing and validating the changes made to its systems in march 2010. for each quarterly release , cms conducted three levels of testing prior to implementing the systems that had been changed , including a level conducted to simulate a live production environment of medicare claims processing . agency reports on the outcomes of the tests described errors found and steps taken to ensure any such errors were corrected . the agency also held management reviews to determine whether each version of the modified systems was ready to be released into a live claims processing environment . in addition , cms officials defined contingencies for cases when systems may not properly process claims that include icd - 10 codes . such actions are important to help minimize the impact on medicare stakeholders that could result from errors in cms 's systems . while cms 's actions to update , test , and validate its systems , and plan for contingencies can help mitigate risks and minimize impacts of system errors , the extent to which any such errors will affect the agency 's ability to properly process claims can not be determined until cms 's systems begin processing icd - 10 codes . cms provided technical support to help its stakeholders identify and make system changes . as early as 2008 , cms had developed and published a website that includes information related to the implementation of system changes to process and submit icd - 10 codes , such as checklists and “ lessons learned ” identified through collaboration with stakeholders , to help stakeholders identify and implement system changes . the agency also developed tools to help its medicare administrative contractors update claims review and submission systems , such as those used to ensure valid claims are transmitted to cms 's claims processing systems . in addition , cms expanded and enhanced capabilities to accommodate end - to - end testing that allowed stakeholders to test the integration of their systems with cms 's internal systems , and offered alternative technical solutions for submitting claims with icd - 10 data in case their systems are not modified in time to meet the compliance date .
