idea provides federal support to school districts through grants to states for the excess cost of educating students with disabilities . education is responsible for monitoring states ' oversight of district compliance with idea , including an moe requirement to ensure special education spending generally is at least equal to the level spent the preceding year . a 2011 gao report found an estimated 24 percent of districts anticipated trouble meeting moe . gao was asked to examine districts ' recent experiences with moe . this report examines : the extent to which districts face challenges meeting moe and why , how moe affects services for students with and without disabilities , and how well education and states facilitate school districts ' compliance with moe . gao surveyed the states , as well as districts that in 2011 anticipated trouble meeting moe ; analyzed moe data ; and interviewed education officials , disability advocates , and state and district officials in three states selected to illustrate a range of experiences with moe . states reported that nearly all school districts generally met the local maintenance of effort ( moe ) spending requirement for special education , but some districts faced challenges for various reasons . under the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) , moe requires districts to spend at least the same amount on special education services for students with disabilities that they spent in the preceding year , with some exceptions . in response to gao 's 50-state survey , states reported that nearly all districts met moe based on the most recent data available in all states ( school year 2012-13 ) . however , most states reported that at least some of their districts faced challenges in doing so . in a separate gao survey of districts , many cited budget and cost reductions — such as state or local revenue declines and new state caps on benefits , which lowered the cost of a special education teacher — as key challenges in meeting moe . state and district officials had mixed views on moe 's effects on services for students with and without disabilities . moe is one of several safeguards meant to protect special education funding , and while some officials reported positive effects , others said the requirement can sometimes create unintended consequences for the services provided to special education students . they said that because the moe requirement lacks flexibility , it can discourage districts from altering their baseline of special education spending , even when doing so would benefit students with disabilities or result in more efficient delivery of the same services . for example , despite other grant provisions in idea that promote innovation , some district officials commented that the moe requirement can serve as a disincentive to districts ' efforts to pilot innovative or expanded services requiring a temporary increase in funds because it would commit them to higher spending going forward . in addition , some district officials noted that prioritizing special education spending to meet moe resulted in cuts to general education spending that affected services for all students , including the many students with disabilities who spend much of their days in general education classrooms . the department of education 's ( education ) delayed monitoring feedback has hampered states ' efforts to facilitate district compliance with moe . in 2010 , education initiated its latest round of reviews of states ' processes for overseeing their districts ' compliance with idea , including moe . however , education currently has no standards for providing timely feedback on this process and — as of august 2015 — had not provided feedback from these reviews to about half the states , due in part to competing priorities . such delays are contrary to federal standards that call for prompt resolution of findings . officials in one state said education 's untimely feedback had delayed the state 's ability to provide guidance to districts regarding moe , and in another state , monitoring was on hold until education approved the state 's process for determining moe compliance . to promote innovation and efficiency while safeguarding special education funding , gao suggests that congress consider options for a more flexible local moe , such as adopting a less stringent requirement . gao also recommends , among other things , that education take steps to establish specific time frames for providing prompt feedback to states about their fiscal monitoring of districts . education agreed with gao 's recommendations .
