congress approved an fy2008 consolidated appropriations act ( h.r . 2764 ) during the week of december 17 , 2007 , that included some emergency supplemental funding for international affairs requested by the white house . the president signed the spending measure on december 26 ( p.l . 110-161 ) . the white house had submitted emergency supplemental requests to congress for military operations in iraq and afghanistan , and international affairs programs totaling $ 196.5 billion . the request was made in two installments â€” an estimate of additional expenses was sent to congress with the fy2008 regular budget request in february 2007 , and a second amended request was made on october 22 , 2007. of the total , $ 6.897 billion consisted of international affairs spending , relating to state department operations and foreign assistance programs , and included $ 350 million in agriculture department food aid appropriations . this report analyzes the international affairs portion of the request and tracks related legislative activity . on february 6 , 2007 , the administration sent to congress its regular fy2008 budget that included $ 35.1 billion for international affairs . at the same time , the president sent congress a separate fy2008 emergency supplemental request of $ 3.301 billion for international affairs . on october 22 , 2007 , the administration amended its supplemental request with $ 3.596 billion in additional spending . while the largest portion of the total request was for state department operations and foreign assistance in iraq and afghanistan , it also included sizeable requests for programs in mexico , the west bank and gaza , north korea , sudan , and pakistan . the bush administration has increasingly requested supplemental funds for international affairs budgets . some budget experts and others have criticized the administration for relying too heavily on supplementals , saying that many items have become routine , particularly relating to iraq and afghanistan , and should be incorporated into the regular appropriations cycle . the administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and unforeseen emergencies , it is necessary to make supplemental requests for what it asserts are unexpected and non - recurring expenses . some congressional leaders have said that an additional supplemental bill may be considered later in 2008. in the meantime , nearly $ 2.4 billion in international affairs funding requested in the supplemental was included in an omnibus fy2008 appropriations bill . h.r . 2764 , the state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriation bill , was the vehicle used to accommodate 11 outstanding appropriations measures for both regular fy2008 and supplemental funding . the omnibus also included supplemental funding for military operations . for further information , see crs report rl34278 , fy2008 supplemental appropriations for global war on terror military operations , international affairs , and other purposes . this report will not be updated .
