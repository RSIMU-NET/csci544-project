the aids epidemic in sub - saharan africa has grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and developmental crisis . the agency for international development ( aid ) has contributed to the fight against human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) / aids in sub - saharan africa by focusing on interventions proven to slow the spread of the disease . however , aid 's ability to measure the impact of its activities on reducing transmission of hiv / aids is limited by inconsistent use of performance indicators , sporadic data collection , and lack of routine reporting of results to headquarters . as part of its approach for allocating the 53 percent increase in funding for hiv / aids prevention activities in sub - saharan africa for fiscal year 2001 , aid prepared a plan to expand monitoring and evaluation systems in countries designated as in need of significant increases in assistance . however , when implemented , the monitoring and evaluation requirements in the plan will not initially include all countries where aid missions and regional offices in sub - saharan africa implement hiv / aids programs . further , the plan does not specify to whom these data will be reported or how the information will be used . failure to address these issues not only inhibits aid 's ability to measure the performance of its hiv / aids activities but also hinders the agency 's decision - making regarding allocation of resources among missions and regional offices and limits efforts to identify best practices .
