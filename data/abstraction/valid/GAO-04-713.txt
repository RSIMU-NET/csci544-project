colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the united states . its mortality can be reduced through early detection and treatment . four key tests are used to detect the cancer -- fecal occult blood test ( fobt ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy , double - contrast barium enema ( dcbe ) , and colonoscopy . private health insurance plans generally cover these tests to diagnose cancer ; however , the extent to which plans cover the tests for screening purposes -- where no symptoms are evident -- is less clear . congress is considering legislation that would require coverage of the tests for screening purposes among all private health insurance plans . gao was asked to identify the state laws that require private health insurance coverage of these screening tests ; and determine the extent to which the tests are covered among small employer , individual , large employer , and federal employee health plans . gao summarized state laws that require coverage of the tests . gao examined test coverage among a sample of the largest 19 small employer and 14 individual plans in 10 states without laws requiring the coverage , and among 35 large employer plans nationally . the findings can not be generalized beyond these plans . gao also reviewed brochures for 143 federal employee health plans . twenty states had laws in place as of may 2004 requiring private insurance coverage of colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes . in 19 of these states , the laws generally applied to insurance sold to small employers and individuals , and required coverage of all four tests -- fobt , flexible sigmoidoscopy , dcbe , and colonoscopy . the law in 1 of the states was more limited in scope , applying to group and managed care plans and not explicitly requiring coverage of each of the four screening tests according to american cancer society ( acs ) guidelines . most , but not all , health plans offered by the insurers and employers gao reviewed covered all four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes . over four - fifths of the small employer plans ( 16 of 19 ) covered all of the tests , whereas 1 plan covered only fobt and flexible sigmoidoscopy and 2 plans covered only fobt . almost three - quarters of the individual plans ( 10 of 14 ) , covered all of the tests , and the remaining 4 plans covered none of the tests . approximately two - thirds of the large employer plans ( 24 of 35 ) covered all four of the tests . among the remaining 11 plans , 5 covered only fobt , 2 covered only flexible sigmoidoscopy , and 4 covered none of the tests . over half of the plans offered to federal employees covered each of the four tests . finally , among all plans that covered at least one but fewer than four tests , dcbe and colonoscopy were least likely to be covered . in commenting on a draft of this report , acs suggested that the report overstated the extent of coverage and did not sufficiently highlight the methodological limitations of the study . in contrast , america 's health insurance plans ( ahip ) commented that the report overstated the lack of coverage . moreover , ahip commented that the report did not address the low rate at which americans actually receive colorectal cancer screening tests regardless of insurance coverage , suggesting that factors other than health insurance coverage are responsible for low screening rates . recognizing that the findings are subject to varying interpretations , gao attempted to report them neutrally . although the draft report disclosed the methodological limitations of the study , in response to acs comments , gao more prominently highlighted certain of the limitations . finally , whereas the draft report noted the screening utilization rates , assessing the factors responsible for them was beyond the scope of this study .
