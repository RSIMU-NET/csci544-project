pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the effectiveness of complaint and enforcement practices to protect nursing home residents , and to ensure that homes participating in medicare and medicaid comply with federal standards , focusing on the : effectiveness of states ' complaint practices in protecting residents ; health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) role in establishing standards and conducting oversight of states ' complaint practices and in using information about the results of complaint investigations to ensure compliance with nursing home standards ; and assessment of hcfa 's use of sanction authority for homes that failed to maintain compliance with these standards . gao noted that : neither complaint investigations nor enforcement practices are being used effectively to ensure adequate care for nursing home residents ; as a result , allegations or incidents of serious problems often go uninvestigated and uncorrected ; gao 's work in selected states reveals that , for serious complaints alleging harm to residents , the combination of inadequate state practices and limited hcfa guidance and oversight have often resulted in : policies or practices that may limit the number of complaints filed ; serious complaints alleging harmful situations not being investigated promptly ; and incomplete reporting on nursing homes ' compliance history and states ' complaint investigation performance ; further , regarding enforcement actions , hcfa has not yet realized its main goal -- to help ensure that homes maintain compliance with federal health care standards ; gao found that too often there is a yo - yo pattern where homes cycle in and out of compliance ; more than one - fourth of the more than 17,000 nursing homes nationwide had serious deficiencies -- including inadequate prevention of pressure sores , failure to prevent accidents , and failure to assess residents ' needs and provide appropriate care -- that caused actual harm to residents or placed them at risk of death or serious injury ; although most homes corrected deficiencies identified in an initial survey , 40 percent of these homes with serious deficiencies were repeat violators ; in most cases , sanctions initiated by hcfa never took effect ; the threat of sanctions appeared to have little effect on deterring homes from falling out of compliance because homes could continue to avoid the sanctions ' effect as long as they kept temporarily correcting their deficiencies ; and hcfa has taken a number of recent actions to improve nursing home oversight in an attempt to resolve problems pointed out in earlier studies .
