the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) gives american indian tribes the option to administer their own temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant programs . gao first reported on the use of this flexibility by tribes in 2002 ( gao - 02-768 ) , and given the upcoming expected reauthorization of tanf , gao was asked to examine how tribal tanf programs have changed since 2002 , especially in light of changing economic conditions ; the challenges tribes face in administering their own tanf programs and what tribes have done to address them ; and the extent to which the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided guidance and oversight to promote the integrity and effectiveness of tribal tanf programs . gao analyzed federal tanf data ; interviewed federal officials ; surveyed all tribal tanf administrators ; and conducted site visits at 11 tribal tanf programs in four states . since gao first reported on tribal tanf programs in 2002 , the number of programs has increased -- from 36 in 2002 to 64 in 2010. in addition , more tribes use program flexibilities to both tailor services to meet the needs of their tanf families and cope with changing economic conditions . gao also found that some tribes have increased their work participation rate goals over time . for example , more than half of the 36 tribes that have been administering a tanf program since 2002 have raised these goals over time . many tribes also allow a wide range of activities families can use to meet work participation rates , such as cultural activities or commuting time . tribes also reported in gao 's survey that changing economic conditions have adversely affected their caseloads , funding , and services provided . for example , some tribes reported that since the beginning of the economic recession in 2007 , they have larger average monthly caseloads , use other federal funding to fill budget gaps , and cut back supportive services to provide more cash grants . according to gao 's survey results , tribal tanf programs face challenges with initial program implementation , staff development and retention , and the development of adequate data systems . moreover , all 11 tribes gao visited talked about the various barriers to self - sufficiency facing their tanf participants , such as a lack of transportation and limited employment opportunities . to address these challenges , many tribes reach out to hhs regional office staff , other tribal and federal programs , and private consultants . for example , to address challenges related to developing adequate data systems , gao learned that the majority of tribes use consultants to develop their systems and provide training . in addition , to enhance employment opportunities , some tribes have placed participants at their head start offices , while another tribe has partnered with its modular housing plant . hhs provides oversight and guidance for tribal tanf programs , but does not always do so in a timely or consistent manner . hhs officials told gao that they use tribal tanf single audit report findings to target training and technical assistance to tribes . however , the systems that hhs uses to track these reports are fragmented , and as a result , tribal tanf officials may not consistently be aware of all the single audit findings related to tribal tanf programs , or be in a position to promptly identify and address recurring problems and mitigate risk . other oversight tools , such as quarterly data reports used to calculate work participation rates , are not consistently updated by hhs in a timely manner , which , according to gao 's survey , is a challenge to tribes ' administration of their tanf programs . hhs headquarters and regional offices provide guidance such as basic policy manuals , training at yearly conferences , and one - on - one assistance over the phone . however , some tribes expressed difficulty in finding and receiving clear , consistent , and timely guidance from hhs , which hinders their ability to successfully manage tribal tanf programs and finances . gao recommends that hhs review its process for tracking related single audit reports , improve processes for maintaining tribal tanf data that can be shared in a timely manner , and provide timely , accessible and consistent guidance that is clearly communicated to its tribal tanf programs . hhs commented it will be mindful of these recommendations as it examines ways to improve its efforts .
