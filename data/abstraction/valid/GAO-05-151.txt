since 1998 , the federal communications commission 's ( fcc ) e - rate program has committed more than $ 13 billion to help schools and libraries acquire internet and telecommunications services . recently , however , allegations of fraud , waste , and abuse by some e - rate program participants have come to light . as steward of the program , fcc must ensure that participants use e - rate funds appropriately and that there is managerial and financial accountability surrounding the funds . gao reviewed the effect of the current structure of the e - rate program on fcc 's management of the program , fcc 's development and use of e - rate performance goals and measures , and the effectiveness of fcc 's oversight mechanisms in managing the program . fcc established the e - rate program using an organizational structure unusual to the government without conducting a comprehensive assessment to determine which federal requirements , policies , and practices apply to it . the e - rate program is administered by a private , not - for - profit corporation with no contract or memorandum of understanding with fcc , and program funds are maintained outside of the u.s. treasury , raising issues related to the collection , deposit , obligation , and disbursement of the funding . while fcc recently concluded that the universal service fund constitutes an appropriation and is subject to the antideficiency act , this raises further issues concerning the applicability of other fiscal control and accountability statutes . these issues need to be explored and resolved comprehensively to ensure that appropriate governmental accountability standards are fully in place to help protect the program and the fund from fraud , waste , and abuse . fcc has not developed useful performance goals and measures for assessing and managing the e - rate program . the goals established for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 focused on the percentage of public schools connected to the internet , but the data used to measure performance did not isolate the impact of e - rate funding from other sources of funding , such as state and local government . a key unanswered question , therefore , is the extent to which increases in connectivity can be attributed to e - rate . in addition , goals for improving e - rate program management have not been a feature of fcc 's performance plans . in its 2003 assessment of the program , omb noted that fcc discontinued e - rate performance measures after fiscal year 2002 and concluded that there was no way to tell whether the program has resulted in the cost - effective deployment and use of advanced telecommunications services for schools and libraries . in response to omb 's concerns , fcc is currently working on developing new e - rate goals . fcc 's oversight mechanisms contain weaknesses that limit fcc 's management of the program and its ability to understand the scope of any waste , fraud , and abuse within the program . according to fcc officials , oversight of the program is primarily handled through agency rulemaking procedures , beneficiary audits , and appeals decisions . fcc 's rulemakings have often lacked specificity and led to a distinction between fcc 's rules and the procedures put in place by the program administrator -- a distinction that has affected the recovery of funds for program violations . while audits of e - rate beneficiaries have been conducted , fcc has been slow to respond to audit findings and make full use of them to strengthen the program . in addition , the small number of audits completed to date do not provide a basis for accurately assessing the level of fraud , waste , and abuse occurring in the program , although the program administrator is working to address this issue . according to fcc officials , there is also a substantial backlog of e - rate appeals due in part to a shortage of staff and staff turnover . because appeal decisions establish precedent , this slowness adds uncertainty to the program .
