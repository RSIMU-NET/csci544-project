investment affiliates of large commercial banks have made competitive inroads in the annual $ 1.3 trillion debt - underwriting market . some corporate borrowers and officials from an unaffiliated investment bank have alleged that commercial banks helped their investment affiliates gain market share by illegally tying and underpricing corporate credit . this report discusses these allegations , the available evidence related to the allegations , and federal bank regulatory agencies ' efforts to enforce the antitying provisions . section 106 of the bank holding company act amendments of 1970 prohibits commercial banks from `` tying , '' a practice which includes conditioning the availability or terms of loans or other credit products on the purchase of certain other products and services . the law permits banks to tie credit and traditional banking products , such as cash management , and does not prohibit banks from considering the profitability of their full relationship with customers in managing those relationships . some corporate customers and officials from an investment bank not affiliated with a commercial bank have alleged that commercial banks illegally tie the availability or terms , including price , of credit to customers ' purchase of other services . however , with few exceptions , formal complaints have not been brought to the attention of the regulatory agencies and little documentary evidence surrounding these allegations exists , in part , because credit negotiations are conducted orally . further , our review found that some corporate customers ' claims involved lawful ties between traditional banking products rather than unlawful ties . these findings illustrate a key challenge for banking regulators in enforcing this law : while regulators need to carefully consider the circumstances of specific transactions to determine whether the customers ' acceptance of an unlawfully tied product ( that is , one that is not a traditional banking product ) was made a condition of obtaining credit , documentary evidence on those circumstances might not be available . therefore , regulators may have to look for indirect evidence to assess whether banks unlawfully tie products and services . although customer information could have an important role in helping regulators enforce section 106 , regulators generally have not solicited information from corporate bank customers . the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) recently reviewed antitying policies and procedures of several large commercial banks . the federal reserve and occ , however , did not analyze a broadly - based selection of transactions or generally solicit additional information from corporate borrowers about their knowledge of transactions . the agencies generally found no unlawful tying arrangements and concluded that these banks generally had adequate policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect tying practices . the agencies found variation among the banks in interpretation of the tying law and its exceptions . as a result , in august 2003 , the board of governors of the federal reserve , working with occ , released for public comment new draft guidance , with a goal of better informing banks and their customers about the requirements of the antitying provision .
