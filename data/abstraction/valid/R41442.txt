the new starts program provides federal funds to public transit agencies on a largely competitive basis for the construction of new fixed - guideway transit systems and the expansion of existing fixed - guideway systems . new starts has funded the development of bus rapid transit ( brt ) and ferries , as these are eligible under the definition of fixed - guideway , but the vast majority of funding has gone to transit rail systems . partly as a result of federal support , rail transit route - mileage in the united states almost doubled between 1985 and 2008 , and rail transit passenger trips and passenger miles grew by 66 % and 73 % , respectively . the federal transit program , of which new starts is a part , is authorized by the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act : a legacy for users ( safetea ) ( p.l . 109-59 ) . since safetea expired on september 30 , 2009 , the program has operated under a series of authorization extensions . the program underwent several significant changes in safetea , and a long - term reauthorization of the surface transportation program provides a major opportunity for congress to make more changes . four of the most important issues that might arise in the reauthorization debate are : the amount of funding authorized for new starts projects . the american public transportation association ( apta ) , for instance , recommends increasing the program from an average of about $ 1.5 billion per year , as authorized by safetea , to an average of $ 3.5 billion per year . other policy analysts advocate shrinking federal government support for transit , particularly expensive new rail systems . another option is to redirect new starts funding to rehabilitating existing transit rail systems . the types of projects favored within the new starts program . some advocate a continuation of building major commuter , heavy ( subway ) , and light rail transit systems and extensions , while others favor more emphasis on cheaper , but slower , streetcar projects , and still others favor bus and bus rapid transit ( brt ) . the new starts approval process . several proposals are pending to simplify the approval process or to change the way projects are rated . encouragement of more private sector participation in new starts projects . formation of public - private partnerships ( ppps ) might increase investment in rail transit , but attracting private money may require simplification of the approval process .
