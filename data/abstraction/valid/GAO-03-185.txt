staffing companies that contract with physicians to staff hospital departments -- including emergency departments -- are not permitted to bill medicare . in the medicare , medicaid , and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 , congress directed gao to assess the program integrity implications of enrolling these companies and allowing them to bill medicare . gao reviewed about 2.8 million emergency department claims for 2000 from five states and assessed whether contractor physicians retained by staffing companies billed medicare comparably to other emergency department physicians . gao also evaluated how the lack of information on staffing companies affects efforts to assure medicare program integrity . contractor physicians associated with staffing companies billed medicare for complex and costly , higher - level emergency department services at rates similar to emergency department physicians with other affiliations , such as those practicing in partnerships , medical groups , or employee - based staffing companies . in addition , the patients treated by contractor physicians received diagnostic tests , were admitted to the hospital , and used ambulance transport at rates similar to patients treated by other emergency department physicians . staffing companies that retain contractor physicians remain largely invisible to the oversight efforts of the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) because these companies are not enrolled in medicare . although cms has information on the individual physicians , it has no information on the companies themselves . this may hinder oversight because contractor physicians provided a significant share of emergency care to medicare beneficiaries . for example , in four of the five states studied , 27 to 58 percent of the physicians with substantial emergency department practices were contractor physicians retained by staffing companies . cms does not permit the enrollment of staffing companies that retain contractor physicians because , under current law , these companies may not be reassigned medicare benefits . this limits cms 's ability to monitor claims . cms can not identify claims submitted by these companies on behalf of their contractor physicians nor can it subject the claims to the same systematic scrutiny given to enrolled groups . consequently , it can not evaluate the billing patterns of specific companies nor assess the aggregate impact of these companies on medicare program integrity .
