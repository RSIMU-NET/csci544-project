pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the impact of support provisions on selected commodity prices , focusing on : whether marketing loan provisions prevent loan rates from acting as price floors and whether they allow u.s. prices to fall to levels closer to world prices ; the effect lower loan rates would have on the relationship between u.s. and world prices ; the affect of a lower loan rate on step 2 payments for cotton exports and the impact of recent changes in timing of payments on the program 's effectiveness ; and the steps that could be taken to make the peanut and sugar programs more market - oriented . gao found that : when alternative repayment rates , which are derived from the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) proxies for world prices , are near or below the loan rates , the marketing loan provisions may prevent the loan rates from serving as price floors ; lowering the loan rates has little if any effect on u.s. prices when alternative repayment rates are above the loan rates ; however , when alternative repayment rates are near or below the loan rates , the effect on u.s. prices of lowering the loan rates differs by commodity ; for cotton and rice , the availability of nonrecourse loans , in combination with other program and market factors , keeps u.s. prices significantly higher than adjusted world prices ; therefore , lowering the loan rates is likely to allow u.s. prices to fall to levels that are closer to adjusted world prices ; for wheat , feedgrains , and oilseeds , most experts assert that the marketing loan provisions will work as intended to overcome the price - supporting effects of the nonrecourse loans ; for these crops , lowering the loan rates would have little if any impact on u.s. prices ; to the extent that a lower loan rate results in lower u.s. cotton prices , step 2 payments would be reduced but not eliminated ; step 2 payments would continue to be made because the marketing loan provisions have not been able to overcome the cotton program 's other features , such as government - paid storage , that help keep u.s. cotton prices higher than adjusted world prices ; however , because of recent changes in how usda makes step 2 payments to exporters , these payments may no longer directly offset higher u.s. prices and therefore may be less effective in enhancing exports ; further changes can be made to make the peanut and sugar programs more market - oriented ; additional reductions in the quota support price for peanuts will lower u.s. prices and increase economic efficiency ; an increase in the tariff - rate import quota for sugar , allowing more sugar to be imported at the lower tariff rate , or its elimination entirely ( no import restrictions ) , would result in lower u.s. prices ; and once prices fall to the level of the loan rate , reductions in the loan rate would be necessary to reduce prices further .
