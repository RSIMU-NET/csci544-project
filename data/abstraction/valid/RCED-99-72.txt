pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the federal housing administration 's ( fha ) appraisal process , focusing on : how well the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) is monitoring the performance of the appraisers on its roster and implementing procedures for addressing consumers ' complaints about fha appraisals ; the extent to which hud is holding appraisers accountable for poor - quality fha appraisals ; the extent to which hud is holding lenders responsible for the quality of the fha appraisals they use ; and how hud ensures that appraisers on its roster are qualified to perform fha appraisals . gao noted that : hud is not doing a good job of monitoring the performance of appraisers ; on - site evaluations of completed appraisals , known as field reviews , are hud 's principal tool for assessing the quality of appraisers ' work ; in fiscal year ( fy ) 1998 , hud performed about 81,000 of these reviews , but three of the four hud homeownership centers ( hoc ) did not meet hud 's requirement to field review no less than 10 percent of the fha appraisals performed within their jurisdictions ; although hud 's guidance states that timeliness is essential to ensure quality field reviews , half of the field reviews conducted in fy 1998 did not occur until more than 2 months after the appraisals had been performed ; moreover , hud did not learn about problems with some appraisals until after it had already approved mortgage insurance for the properties ; the philadelphia and denver hocs ' records for 126 field reviews that rated the appraisals as poor showed that hud approved mortgage insurance for 96 of the homes covered by these reviews ; hud staff did not routinely visit appraised properties to determine the accuracy of the field review contractors ' observations ; the philadelphia and denver hocs did not fully implement guidance on the handling and tracking of consumers ' complaints , including those relating to appraisals ; hud is not holding appraisers accountable for the quality of their appraisals ; contrary to hud 's policy , appraisers who received two or more poor ratings in field reviews were frequently not prohibited from conducting further fha appraisals ; a poor field review score indicates that the appraiser made errors and omissions that could result in an unacceptable insurance risk to fha ; hud has not aggressively enforced its policy to hold lenders equally accountable with the appraisers they select for the accuracy and thoroughness of appraisals because of a disagreement within hud over its authority to do so ; hud has limited assurance that the appraisers on its roster are knowledgeable about fha 's appraisal requirements ; hud relies largely on the states ' licensing process to ensure that appraisers are qualified , but the states ' minimum licensing standards do not include proficiency in fha 's appraisal requirements ; and hud is revising its appraisal guidance and forms to better clarify the roles and responsibilities of appraisers and is adopting a testing requirement for appraisers to ensure their competency in fha 's appraisal standards .
