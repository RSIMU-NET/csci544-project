tax noncompliance , including refund fraud , threatens the integrity of the tax system and costs the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars annually . rrp is irs 's primary pre - refund system for detecting and preventing the issuance of invalid refunds . irs reported that between january 2015 and november 2017 rrp prevented the issuance of more than $ 6.51 billion in invalid refunds . gao was asked to examine rrp 's capabilities . this report describes how rrp detects and selects suspicious returns and prevents invalid refunds ; assesses how irs monitors and adapts rrp ; and examines what else , if anything , irs can do to strengthen rrp and use it to address other enforcement issues . gao reviewed irs plans for rrp and documents on its performance . gao compared irs 's efforts to federal internal control standards , gao 's fraud risk framework and irs 's strategic plan . gao interviewed irs officials who work on and use rrp . the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) return review program ( rrp ) detects and selects potentially fraudulent returns to prevent the issuance of invalid refunds . according to irs , rrp uses advanced analytic techniques and various data sources , including prior - year tax returns , to assign multiple scores to individual returns based on characteristics of identity theft and other refund fraud . gao found that irs routinely monitors rrp 's performance and adapts rrp to improve detection and address evolving fraud threats . each year irs updates rrp 's detection tools to improve accuracy for the next filing season . irs has plans to continue developing rrp to further prevent invalid refunds , including using rrp to analyze and detect fraudulent business returns . however , gao identified other opportunities for irs to improve rrp 's fraud detection and to use rrp for other enforcement activities : rrp 's ability to accurately detect and select suspicious returns could benefit from having information on forms w - 2 , wage and tax statements ( w - 2 ) available for analysis more frequently . as of april 2018 , irs officials said they were drafting but had not yet approved a work request to load w - 2s into rrp daily instead of weekly for the 2019 filing season . irs could collect more information electronically from paper filers . one approach irs evaluated in 2012 is to digitize some paper returns using barcoding technology , but it has not updated that analysis or expanded it to consider other digitizing technologies . irs requested that congress require that returns prepared electronically but filed on paper include a scannable code printed on the return , but congress had not done so as of may 2018. irs could apply rrp 's capabilities to improve other tax enforcement activities , such as audit selection or underreporting detection . individuals ' underreporting of tax liabilities accounts for hundreds of billions in lost tax revenue . until irs evaluates the costs and benefits of expanding rrp to analyze returns not claiming refunds , irs will not have the information needed to make decisions that could help streamline processes for detecting and treating additional types of noncompliance and fraud . gao suggests congress consider legislation to require that returns prepared electronically but filed on paper include a scannable code . gao is also making five recommendations to irs , including that irs take action to make incoming w - 2s available to rrp more frequently , update and expand a 2012 analysis of the costs and benefits of digitizing returns filed on paper , evaluate the costs and benefits of expanding rrp to analyze returns not claiming refunds , and take any appropriate action based on those evaluations . irs agreed with gao 's recommendations .
