since coins are more durable than notes and do not need replacement as often , many countries have replaced lower - denomination notes with coins to obtain a financial benefit , among other reasons . six times over the past 22 years , gao has reported that replacing the $ 1 note with a $ 1 coin would provide a net benefit to the federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually . this testimony provides information on what gaos most recent work in 2011 and 2012 found regarding the net benefit to the government of replacing the $ 1 note with a $ 1 coin , stakeholder views on considerations for the private sector and the public in making such a replacement , and the experiences of other countries in replacing small - denomination notes with coins . this testimony is based on previous gao reports . to perform that work , gao constructed an economic model to assess the net benefit to the government . gao also interviewed officials from the federal reserve and treasury department , currency experts , officials from canada and the united kingdom , and representatives of u.s. industries that could be affected by currency changes . gao reported in february 2012 that replacing $ 1 notes with $ 1 coins could potentially provide $ 4.4 billion in net benefits to the federal government over 30 years . the overall net benefit was due solely to increased seigniorage and not to reduced production costs . seigniorage is the difference between the cost of producing coins or notes and their face value ; it reduces government borrowing and interest costs , resulting in a financial benefit to the government . gaos estimate takes into account processing and production changes that occurred in 2011 , including the federal reserves use of new equipment to determine the quality and authenticity of notes , which has increased the expected life of the note thereby reducing the costs of circulating a note over 30 years . ( the $ 1 note is expected to last 4.7 years and the $ 1 coin 30 years . ) . like all estimates , there are uncertainties surrounding gaos estimate , especially since the costs of the replacement occur in the first several years and can be estimated with more certainty than the benefits , which are less certain because they occur further in the future . moreover , changes to the inputs and assumptions gao used in the estimate could significantly increase or decrease the results . for example , if the public relies more heavily on electronic payments in the future , the demand for cash could be lower than gao estimated and , as a result , the net benefit would be lower . in march 2011 , gao identified potential shorter - and longer - term costs to the private sector that could result from the replacement of the $ 1 note with a $ 1 coin . industry stakeholders indicated that they would initially incur costs to modify equipment and add storage and that later their costs to process and transport coins would increase . however , others , such as some transit agencies , have already made the transition to accept $ 1 coins and would not incur such costs . in addition , for such a replacement to be successful , the $ 1 coin would have to be widely accepted and used by the public . nationwide opinion polls over the last decade have indicated lack of public acceptance of the $ 1 coin . efforts to increase the circulation and public acceptance of the $ 1 coins have not succeeded , in part , because the $ 1 note has remained in circulation . over the last 48 years , many countries , including canada and the united kingdom , have replaced low denomination notes with coins because of expected cost savings , among other reasons . the canadian government , for example , saved $ 450 million ( canadian ) over 5 years by converting to the $ 1 coin . canada and the united kingdom found that stopping production of the note combined with stakeholder outreach and public education were important to overcome public resistance , which dissipated within a few years after transitioning to the low denomination coins . gao has recommended in prior work that congress replace the $ 1 note with a $ 1 coin . gao continues to believe that replacing the $ 1 note with a coin is likely to provide a financial benefit to the federal government if the note is eliminated and negative public reaction is effectively managed through stakeholder outreach and public education .
