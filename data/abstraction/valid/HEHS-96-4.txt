gao examined the department of labor 's ( dol ) senior community service employment program ( scsep ) , focusing on : dol process for awarding scsep grants ; the extent to which dol equitably distributes scsep funds ; and scsep administrative costs . gao found that : in order to maintain 1978 activity levels , the older americans act ( oaa ) requires dol to award scsep grants to national sponsors and those with proven track records ; of the $ 410 million in scsep appropriations for program year 1994 , $ 234.5 million was distributed under the 1978 activity level provision ; dol 's use of the 1978 allocation pattern severely limited its ability to achieve equitable distribution among states ; appropriations statutes have overriden the title v funding provision to require that no more than 22 percent of scsep appropriations be allocated to state governments ; and in program year 1994 , national sponsors ' administrative costs exceeded the 15-percent limit due to administrative expenses being charged to another cost category .
