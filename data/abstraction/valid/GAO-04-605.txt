congress has appropriated more than $ 20 billion since april 2003 to support rebuilding efforts in iraq . this complex undertaking , which is occurring in an unstable security environment and under significant time constraints , is being carried out largely through contracts with private - sector companies . as of september 2003 , agencies had obligated nearly $ 3.7 billion on 100 contracts or task orders under existing contracts . given widespread congressional interest in ensuring that reconstruction contracts are awarded properly and administered effectively , gao reviewed 25 contract actions that represented about 97 percent of the obligated funds . gao determined whether agencies had complied with competition requirements in awarding new contracts and issuing task orders and evaluated agencies ' initial efforts in carrying out contract administration tasks . agencies used sole - source or limited competition approaches to issue new reconstruction contracts , and when doing so , generally complied with applicable laws and regulations . agencies did not , however , always comply with requirements when issuing task orders under existing contracts . for new contracts , the law generally requires the use of full and open competition , where all responsible prospective contractors are allowed to compete , but permits sole - source or limited competition awards in specified circumstances , such as when only one source is available or to meet urgent requirements . all of the 14 new contracts gao examined were awarded without full and open competition , but each involved circumstances that the law recognizes as permitting such awards . for example , the army corps of engineers properly awarded a sole - source contract for rebuilding iraq 's oil infrastructure to the only contractor that was determined to be in a position to provide the services within the required time frame . the corps documented the rationale in a written justification , which was approved by the appropriate official . the u.s. agency for international development properly awarded seven contracts using limited competition . the department of state , however , justified the use of limited competition by citing an authority that may not be a recognized exception to competition requirements , although a recognized exception could have been used . there was a lesser degree of compliance when agencies issued 11 task orders under existing contracts . task orders are deemed by law to satisfy competition requirements if they are within the scope , period of performance , and maximum value of a properly awarded underlying contract . gao found several instances where contracting officers issued task orders for work that was not within the scope of the underlying contracts . for example , to obtain media development services and various subject matter experts , the defense contracting command - washington placed two orders using a management improvement contract awarded under the general services administration 's schedule program . but neither of the two orders involved management improvement activities . work under these and other orders should have been awarded using competitive procedures or , due to the exigent circumstances , supported by a justification for other than full and open competition . the agencies encountered various contract administration challenges during the early stages of the reconstruction effort , stemming in part from inadequate staffing , lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities , changing requirements , and security constraints . while some of these issues have been addressed , staffing and security remain major concerns . additionally , the army and its contractors have yet to agree on key terms and conditions , including the projected cost , on nearly $ 1.8 billion worth of reconstruction work that either has been completed or is well under way . until contract terms are defined , cost risks for the government remain and contract cost control incentives are likely to be less effective .
