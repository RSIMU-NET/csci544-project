gao discussed the military sensitivity of commercial communications satellites and the implications of the 1996 change in export licensing jurisdiction , focusing on : key elements in the export control systems of the departments of commerce and state ; how export controls for commercial satellites have evolved over the years ; the concerns and issues debated over the transfer of commercial communications satellites to the export licensing jurisdiction of commerce ; the safeguards that may be applied to commercial satellite exports ; and observations on the current export control system . gao noted that : the u.s. export control system -- comprised of both the commerce and state systems -- is about managing risk ; exports to some countries involve less risk than to other countries and exports of some items involve less risk than others ; the planning of a satellite launch with technical discussions and exchanges of information taking place over several years involves risk no matter which agency is the licensing authority ; recently , events have focused concern on the appropriateness of commerce jurisdiction over communication satellites ; this is a difficult judgment ; by design , commerce 's system gives greater weight to economic and commercial concerns , implicitly accepting greater security risks ; and by design , state 's systems gives primacy to national security and foreign policy concerns , lessening -- but not eliminating -- the risk of damage to u.s. national security interests .
