the universal service fund 's high - cost program provides financial support to telecommunications carriers in areas where the cost to provide broadband is high . through this program , fcc provides about $ 2.5 billion in annual support payments to rate - of - return carriers . the manner in which fcc currently provides the support payments to some of these carriers is prone to fraud risks . a prior case involved a rate - of - return carrier that received at least $ 27 million in improper payments from the program . gao was asked to review funding reforms and fraud controls fcc has implemented for rate - of - return carriers . this report examines the extent to which fcc : has implemented funding reforms specific to rate - of - return carriers , and is managing fraud risks for the high - cost program in accordance with leading practices . gao reviewed fcc 's and usac 's procedures , relevant regulations , and guidance , and assessed these documents against applicable criteria , including federal internal - control standards , fcc 's strategic plan , and gao 's fraud risk framework . gao interviewed fcc and usac officials , in addition to industry and other stakeholders representing a variety of non - generalizable viewpoints . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has implemented several funding reforms for small , rural telecommunications carriers — referred to as “ rate - of - return carriers ” — receiving high - cost program support . these reforms are aimed at controlling the program 's expenditures and incentivizing efficient broadband deployment . according to fcc 's strategic plan , fcc must ensure the high - cost program is well managed , efficient , and fiscally responsible . one of the reforms that gao reviewed established a funding mechanism for the carriers whereby fcc determines the level of financial support to provide the carriers based on cost and revenue estimates produced by a model . stakeholders told gao that this model - based funding mechanism is less prone to fraud risks than the traditional cost - accounting funding mechanism , which reimburses carriers for their reported costs . however , fcc did not make use of this reform mandatory and a substantial number of rate - of - return carriers continue to receive support from the traditional funding mechanism . fcc officials said they developed the model - based funding mechanism in consultation with industry stakeholders . however , fcc officials said they did not have plans to assess the accuracy of cost estimates from the model , which has been in use for several years , or require carriers to receive model - based support as a way to reduce fraud risks . by assessing the model , fcc would have greater assurance that it is producing reliable cost estimates and be better positioned to determine whether to make its use mandatory . fcc has some policies and processes in place to manage fraud risks for the high - cost program . for example , the universal service administrative company ( usac ) — the not - for - profit corporation that administers the program — reviews and audits rate - of - return support payments and forwards potential fraud cases to fcc 's office of inspector general and enforcement bureau for further investigation . fcc is also developing a data - analytics tool to help detect fraud , and in august 2019 launched a new fraud division to focus on investigating fraud in the universal service fund 's programs . however , fcc 's efforts do not fully align with some elements of gao 's fraud risk framework , including : designing and implementing an antifraud strategy for the program . without regular fraud - risk assessments of the high - cost program , fcc has no assurance that it has fully considered important fraud risks , determined its tolerance for risks that could be lower priorities , or made sound decisions on how to allocate resources to respond to fraud risks . not doing so could result in fcc compensating carriers for improper , ineligible , or inflated costs . furthermore , in the absence of an antifraud strategy , fcc has little assurance that it can prevent or detect the types of documented rate - of - return carrier misconduct that have previously occurred . designing and implementing an antifraud strategy that conforms to leading practices would help fcc effectively manage and respond to the fraud risks identified during the fraud - risk assessments . gao is making five recommendations , including that fcc should assess the model - based support mechanism and consider making its use mandatory , and implement an antifraud strategy for the high - cost program . fcc stated it would take steps to implement these recommendations .
