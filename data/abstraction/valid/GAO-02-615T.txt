the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant makes $ 16.5 billion available to states each year , regardless of changes in the number of people receiving benefits . to qualify for their full tanf allotments , states must spend a certain amount of state money , referred to as maintenance - of - effort funds . as states implemented work - focused reforms during the strong economy of the 1990s , welfare caseloads dropped by more than 50 percent . gao found that most former welfare recipients were employed at some point after leaving welfare , typically with earnings that did not raise them above the poverty level . under welfare reform , spending shifted from monthly cash payments to services , such as child care and transportation . this shift reflects two key features of reform . first , many states have increased spending to engage more welfare families in work - related activities and to provide more intensive services . second , many states have increased their efforts to provide services to low - income families not receiving welfare . services for these families include child care , case management , and job retention and advancement services for families who have recently left welfare for employment as well as other low - income working families . although states have the flexibility under tanf to use their federal and state welfare - related funds to provide services to families not receiving monthly cash assistance , these families are not reflected in caseload data reported to the department of health and human services . as a result , caseload data do not provide a complete picture of the number of families receiving benefits and services through tanf .
