pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) controls over postage paid on presorted and barcoded mail , focusing on whether usps controls ensure that mailer - claimed discounts are earned . gao found that during fiscal year 1994 : 40 percent of required bulk mail verifications were not performed and postal supervisors did less than 50 percent of required follow - up verifications ; rejected mailings were resubmitted and accepted into the mail stream without proper corrections or postage ; mail acceptance clerks were not given adequate tools to determine whether increasing volumes of mailer - applied barcodes met usps standards ; and postal management was unable to make informed decisions concerning the adequacy of bulk mail acceptance controls or determine the amount of revenue lost through improperly prepared mailings . gao also found that : usps needs to determine the management strategy and financial investment necessary to minimize revenue loss ; the random method of selecting bulk business mailings for in - depth verification may not result in the best use of available staff ; usps could better target its verification efforts based on risk by considering such factors as mailer histories and the postage value of mailings ; postal managers are developing a bulk business mail acceptance system , updating acceptance handbooks , acquiring barcoding verification equipment , and requesting field units to submit verification reports ; and usps is also exploring a new risk - based approach for in - depth verification , improving revenue controls , and planning to install its new bulk mail system by 1997 .
