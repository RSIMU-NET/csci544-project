by the mid 1990s , most of the district of columbia 's public schools were more than 50 years old and in poor condition . deferred maintenance had led to a host of safety problems , from fire code violations to leaky roofs . gao found that the d.c. school system mismanaged a contract with the washington gas light company . gao found the use of the gas contract to obtain school renovation services , including painting , carpeting , plumbing , and electrical work , was outside the scope of the contract . in addition , in carrying out the renovation work , the d.c. school system failed to adhere to controls and procedures intended to ensure that the district obtained the best price and services and maintain a proper relationship between the contractors and the d.c. government . these problems raise serious doubts about whether the district obtained fair and reasonable prices on the renovations and whether the school system should continue the gas utility contract .
