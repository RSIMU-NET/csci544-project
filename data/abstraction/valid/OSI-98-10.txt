pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on : which entities or companies engage in telephone slamming violations ; the process by which the providers defraud consumers ; and what the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , state regulatory entities , and the telecommunications industry has done to curtail slamming . gao noted that : all three types of long - distance providers -- facility - based carriers , which have extensive physical equipment , switching resellers , which have one or more switching stations , and switchless resellers , having the least to lose and the most to gain , most frequently engage in intentional slamming , according to the fcc , state regulatory agencies , and the telecommunications industry ; intentional slamming is accomplished by deceptive practices ; these include falsifying documents that authorize a switch and misleading customers into signing such a document ; the fcc , state regulatory agencies , and the telecommunications industry rely on the others to be the main forces against intentional slamming ; however , with regard to the fcc , its antislamming measures effectively do little to protect consumers from slamming ; although representatives of state regulatory agencies and the industry view a provider 's fcc tariff -- a schedule of services , rates , and charges -- as a key credential , the fcc places no significance on the tariffs that long - distance providers are required to file with it before providing service ; although the fcc in 1996 attempted to regulate tariffs out of existence , a circuit court stayed that fcc regulation in 1997 as a result of a lawsuit ; the fcc now accepts tariffs ; however , it does not review the tariff information ; thus , having a tariff on file with the fcc is no guarantee of a long - distance provider 's integrity or of fcc 's ability to penalize a provider that slams consumers ; as part of gao 's investigation and using fictitious information , gao easily filed a tariff with the fcc and could now , as a switchless reseller , slam consumers with little chance of being caught ; state regulatory measures that could preclude slamming range from none in a few states to extensive in others ; industry 's antislamming measures appear to be more market - driven ; and however , a primary interexchange carriers freeze -- an action that consumers can take by contacting their local exchange carrier and freezing their choice of primary interexchange carriers , or long distance providers -- effectively reduces the chance of intentional slamming .
