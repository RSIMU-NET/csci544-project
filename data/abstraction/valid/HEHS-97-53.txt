gao reviewed the challenges facing the new commissioner of the social security administration ( ssa ) . gao found that : ssa is ahead of many federal agencies in developing strategic plans , measuring its service to the public , and producing complete , accurate , and timely financial statements ; this gives ssa a sound base from which to manage significant current and future challenges ; these challenges include the aging of the baby boom generation , coupled with increasing life expectancy and the declining ratio of contributing workers to beneficiaries , which will place unprecedented strains on the social security program in the next century ; unless congress acts , social security funds will be inadequate to pay all benefits by 2029 ; ssa , however , has not preformed the research , analysis , and evaluation needed to inform the public debate on the future financing of social security , the most critical long - term issue facing ssa ; ssa has recently taken initial steps to more actively participate in the financing debate by reorganizing and strengthening its research , policy analysis , and evaluation activities ; also challenging ssa have been disability caseloads that have grown by nearly 70 percent in the past decade ; to its credit , ssa has undertaken an important effort to fundamentally redesign its inefficient disability claims process , however , while ssa has begun many of its planned initiatives , none is far enough along for ssa to know whether specific proposed process changes will achieve the desired results ; ssa has not sufficiently promoted return - to - work efforts in the administration and design of its disability programs ; if even an additional 1 percent of the 6.6 million working - age people receiving disability benefits were to leave ssa 's disability rolls by returning to work , lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $ 3 billion ; in its supplemental security income program , ssa has not done enough to combat fraud and abuse and address program weaknesses ; ssa faces increasing responsibilities in the future and must manage its growing workloads with reduced resources ; to successfully meet its workload challenges , ssa knows that it must increasingly rely on technology and build a workforce with the flexibility and skills to operate in a changing environment ; ssa faces significant challenges , however , in modernizing its information systems , a complex , multiyear effort that could easily cost billions of dollars ; compounding this challenge will be the possible loss of many senior managers and executives ; and at this critical juncture , effective leadership is needed so ssa can take actions to better ensure its success in the 21st century .
