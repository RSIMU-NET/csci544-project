the president 's annual budget reports on federal funding dedicated to combating terrorism activities . identification of such funding is inherently difficult because a significant portion of combating terrorism funding is embedded within appropriation accounts that include funding for other activities as well . in 2002 , gao reported on the difficulties that the executive branch faced in reporting funding for combating terrorism to congress ( see gao - 03-170 ) . this report updates the information contained in the 2002 report by providing information on the methods agencies use to determine the portion of their annual appropriations related to combating terrorism , and the status of recommendations from gao 's 2002 report . seven of 34 agencies that reported receiving funding related to combating terrorism activities to omb used different methodologies to estimate the portion of their authorized funding that supports such activities . these 7 agencies account for about 90 percent of the total fiscal year 2006 budget request that the 34 agencies estimate relate to combating terrorism . all of these methods involve some level of professional judgment . agencies stated this process is managed through omb oversight and supervisory review . omb staff said they do not review the overseas component of combating terrorism funding data since they are no longer required to report it . as a result , congress does not receive omb - reviewed data on the entirety of counterterrorism funding . three recommendations from gao 's 2002 report have not been implemented . the first recommendation requests that omb include agencies ' obligation data in its annual reporting of funding data on combating terrorism . omb staff continue to cite the effort required to produce such data but said they might consider reporting obligation information for a targeted set of accounts . without obligation data , it is difficult for congress to know how much funding from prior years is still available to potentially reduce new spending requests , whether the rate of spending for a program is slower than anticipated , or what the size of the program is for a particular year and over time . the second recommendation was for omb to direct relevant departments to develop or enhance combating terrorism performance goals and measures and include such measures in the governmentwide plan . three of the seven agencies told us that omb had not directed them to develop performance measures or enhance such measures for combating terrorism activities . however , four of the seven agencies had developed such measures . omb staff said they are working with agencies to improve performance measurement of government programs related to combating terrorism . the development of such measures would assist congress in determining whether funding increases have improved performance results . the third recommendation calls for the inclusion of national - level and federal governmentwide combating terrorism performance measures in supplements to existing strategies and their future revisions . there have been no supplements or revisions to the existing strategies that include governmentwide or national - level combating terrorism measures .
