article i , section 6 , of the u.s. constitution requires that compensation for members of congress be `` ascertained by law , and paid out of the treasury of the united states . . congress has relied on three different methods in adjusting salaries for members . specific legislation was last used to provide increases in 1990 and 1991. it was the only method used by congress for many years . the second method , under which annual adjustments took effect automatically unless disapproved by congress , was established in 1975. from 1975 to 1989 , these annual adjustments were based on the rate of annual comparability increases given to the general schedule ( gs ) federal employees . this method was changed by the 1989 ethics act to require that the annual adjustment be determined by a formula based on certain elements of the employment cost index ( eci ) . under this revised process , annual adjustments were accepted 13 times ( scheduled for january 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1998 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , and 2009 ) and denied 16 times ( scheduled for january 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 , 2007 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ) . since january 2009 , the salary for members of congress has been $ 174,000 . subsequent adjustments were denied by p.l . 111-8 ( enacted march 11 , 2009 ) , p.l . 111-165 ( may 14 , 2010 ) , p.l . 111-322 ( december 22 , 2010 ) , p.l . 112-175 ( september 28 , 2012 ) , p.l . 112-240 ( january 2 , 2013 ) , p.l . 113-46 ( october 17 , 2013 ) , p.l . 113-235 ( december 16 , 2014 ) , p.l . 114-113 ( december 18 , 2015 ) , p.l . 114-254 ( december 10 , 2016 ) , p.l . 115-141 ( march 23 , 2018 ) , and p.l . 115-244 ( september 21 , 2018 ) . although provisions prohibiting the annual adjustment often appear in appropriations acts , both the automatic annual adjustments and funding for members ' salaries are provided pursuant to other laws ( 2 u.s.c . §4501 ) — not the annual appropriations bills — and a provision prohibiting the scheduled adjustment could be included in any bill , or introduced as a separate bill . a third method for adjusting member pay is congressional action pursuant to recommendations from the president , based on the recommendations of the citizens ' commission on public service and compensation established in the 1989 ethics reform act . although the citizens ' commission was to have convened in 1993 , it did not and has not met since then . this report contains information on actions taken affecting each pay year since the establishment of the ethics reform act adjustment procedure . it also provides information on other floor action related to pay for members of congress . crs report 97-1011 , salaries of members of congress : recent actions and historical tables , by ida a. brudnick , has additional information on the rate of pay for members of congress since 1789 ; recent proposals to change member pay ; the adjustments projected by the ethics reform act as compared with actual pay adjustments ; details on enacted legislation with language prohibiting the automatic annual pay adjustment ; and member pay in constant and current dollars since 1992. members of congress only receive salaries during the terms for which they are elected . former members of congress may be eligible for retirement benefits . for additional information on retirement benefit requirements , contributions , and formulas , see crs report rl30631 , retirement benefits for members of congress , by katelin p. isaacs .
