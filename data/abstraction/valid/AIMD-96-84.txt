pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the extent to which department of defense ( dod ) computer systems are attacked , focusing on the : potential for further damage to dod computer systems ; and challenges dod faces in securing sensitive information on its computer systems . gao found that : dod relies on a complex information infrastructure to design weapons , identify and track enemy targets , pay soldiers , mobilize reservists , and manage supplies ; use of the internet to enhance communication and information sharing has increased dod exposure to attack , since the internet provides unauthorized users a means to access dod systems ; while the dod information available on the internet is unclassified , it is sensitive and must be restricted ; only about 1 in 500 attacks is detected and reported , but the defense information systems agency ( disa ) estimates that dod is attacked about 250,000 times per year ; attackers have stolen , modified , and destroyed data and software , disabled protection systems to allow future unauthorized access , and shut down entire systems and networks to preclude authorized use ; security breaches pose a serious risk to national security because terrorists or u.s. adversaries could disrupt the national information infrastructure ; security breaches cost dod hundreds of millions of dollars annually ; and dod needs to increase the resources devoted to computer security , update the policies that govern computer security , and increase security training for system and network administrators .
