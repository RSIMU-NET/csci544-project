the world bank is a multilateral development bank ( mdb ) that makes loans and grants to low and middle - income countries to reduce poverty and promote economic development . both the world bank and the international monetary fund ( imf ) were founded at the bretton woods conference in 1944. two of the world bank facilities , the international bank for reconstruction and development ( ibrd ) and international development association ( ida ) lend directly to governments to finance projects and programs . ida was established in 1960 , 16 years after the creation of the world bank to address concern that the poorest countries could not afford to borrow at the near - market rate terms offered by the ibrd . consequently , ida was established as a revolving fund , providing concessional loans to the poorest countries subsidized by donor contributions and transfers from the ibrd . ida assistance is highly discounted , it is increasingly provided as grants , and only available to low - income member countries . since ida provides loans and grants to the poorest countries at subsidized rates , its resources must be periodically replenished . donor nations have replenished ida 14 times since its founding . on march 5 , 2007 , donor nations began to discuss a possible fifteenth replenishment of funds for ida . this is the first replenishment since the g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in scotland in 2005 where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative ( mdri ) . the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the world 's poorest countries and pledges to double the amount of aid to sub - saharan africa between 2004 and 2010 , primarily in the form of grant - based assistance . donor governments selected three themes for ida - 15 : ( 1 ) ida 's role in the international foreign aid system , ( 2 ) the role of the world bank in post - conflict reconstruction and fragile states , and ( 3 ) the need to improve the effectiveness of ida assistance . this report provides brief background material on the world bank 's ida , the u.s. role at the institution , and information on the status of the current ida - 14 replenishment . it then examines the negotiations for ida - 15 , and analyzes the three core themes identified for ida - 15 . the report will be updated as events warrant .
