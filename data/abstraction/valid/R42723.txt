on january 6 , 2011 , after spending approximately $ 3 billion in developmental funding , the marine corps cancelled the expeditionary fighting vehicle ( efv ) program due to poor reliability demonstrated during operational testing and excessive cost growth . because the efv was intended to replace the 40-year - old amphibious assault vehicle ( aav ) , the pentagon pledged to move quickly to develop a `` more affordable and sustainable '' vehicle to replace the efv . the amphibious combat vehicle ( acv ) is intended to replace the aav , incorporating some efv capabilities but in a more practical and cost - efficient manner . in concert with the acv , the marines were developing the marine personnel carrier ( mpc ) to serve as a survivable and mobile platform to transport marines when ashore . the mpc was not intended to be amphibious like an aav , efv , or the acv but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers , lakes , and other water obstacles such as shore - to - shore operations in the littorals . both vehicles were intended to play central roles in future marine amphibious operations . on june 14 , 2013 , marine leadership put the mpc program `` on ice '' due to budgetary pressures but suggested the program might be resurrected some 10 years down the road when budgetary resources might be more favorable . in what was described as a `` drastic shift , '' the marines decided to `` resurrect '' the mpc in march 2014. the marines designated the mpc as acv increment 1.1 and planned to acquire about 200 vehicles . the marines also plan to develop acv increment 1.2 , a tracked , fully amphibious version , and at the time planned to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study . although acv increment 1.1 is to have a swim capability , another mode of transport ( ship or aircraft ) would be required to get the vehicles from ship to shore . the marines are reportedly exploring the possibility of developing a high water speed acv 2.0 , which could accompany tanks and light armored vehicles into combat . on november 5 , 2014 , the marines released a draft request for proposal ( rfp ) for acv increment 1.1. on november 24 , 2015 , the marine corps awarded bae systems and saic contracts to develop acv 1.1 prototypes for evaluation . bae 's contract was for $ 103.8 million and saic 's for $ 121.5 million , and each company was to build 16 prototypes to be tested over the next two years . both bae and saic delivered their prototypes early , and engineering and manufacturing development ( emd ) testing began mid - march 2017. in early december 2017 , the marines reportedly sent the acv 1.1 down select request for proposals to bae and science applications international corporation ( saic ) . on june 19 , 2018 , the marine corps selected bae systems to produce the acv . the initial contract — valued at $ 198 million — was for low - rate production of 30 vehicles to be delivered by the autumn of 2019. on april 10 , 2019 , during testimony to the senate armed services committee , navy and marine corps leadership announced that during the fall of 2018 , acv 1.1 prototypes demonstrated satisfactory water mobility performance in high surf conditions and , in doing so , met the full water mobility transition requirement for acv 1.2 capability . as a result , acv 1.1 and acv 1.2 were to be consolidated into a single variant — the acv — which is intended to replace all aavs . potential issues for congress include the potential ramifications of the consolidation of the acv 1.1 and acv 1.2 programs and how the possible adoption of the expeditionary advance base operations ( eabo ) operational concept could affect the acv program .
