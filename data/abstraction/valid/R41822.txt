as households and taxpayers , americans have a large stake in the future of fannie mae and freddie mac . homeowners and potential homeowners indirectly depend on fannie mae and freddie mac , which in recent years backed and guaranteed home loans accounting for nearly half of the outstanding home mortgages in the nation . taxpayers have a large investment in fannie mae and freddie mac . the department of the treasury kept the two insolvent companies in business by providing more than $ 175 billion in support . based on past performance , it is not clear how the enterprises will be able to repay treasury out of future earnings . in addition to the $ 175 billion in direct support , treasury and the federal reserve ( the fed ) purchased nearly $ 1.4 trillion in gse - issued and guaranteed mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) . these two entities are stockholder - owned , congressionally chartered companies that purchase home mortgages , commonly called government - sponsored enterprises ( gses ) . in 2008 , increasing mortgage delinquencies and the general financial crisis weakened the two enterprises to the point that they agreed to a voluntary takeover by the federal government known as conservatorship . this report summarizes and analyzes bills introduced in the 112th congress that seek to enhance the public accountability of the two enterprises . the bills covered are h.r . 31 , h.r . 408 , h.r . 463 , h.r . 1182 , h.r . 1221 , h.r . 1222 , h.r . 1223 , h.r . 1224 , h.r . 1225 , h.r . 1226 , h.r . 1227 , h.r . 1859 , h.r . 2413 , h.r . 2425 , h.r . 2428 , h.r . 2436 , h.r . 2439 , h.r . 2440 , h.r . 2441 , h.r . 2462 , s. 178 , and s. 693. some seek to reduce the cost to the government , while others seek to change the enterprises ' charters if or when they leave conservatorship . none of the above bills introduced proposes government actions to replace the two enterprises . to date , two bills , h.r . 1859 and h.r . 2413 , propose creating a replacement for the two enterprises . h.r . 1859 would authorize the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) to charter special purpose associations to support the secondary mortgage market by issuing mbs with an explicit federal catastrophic guarantee . the associations would be charged for this guarantee . h.r . 1859 would require fhfa to develop a plan to transition from enterprise support for the secondary mortgage market to support by these new associations . the second bill , h.r . 2413 , would create a government corporation ( the secondary market facility for residential mortgages ) to purchase and to securitize mortgages . those selling mortgages to the facility would be required to pay guarantee and reinsurance fees for an explicit federal guarantee on the securities . because fannie mae and freddie mac are under conservatorship , congress has unusual leverage to direct fhfa , which is both their regulator and conservator , to implement policy changes . currently , fhfa has unusual control in that it both regulates and manages fannie mae and freddie mac . this report will be updated as warranted .
