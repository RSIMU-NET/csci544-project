pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the customs service 's management of its automated commercial environment ( ace ) system . gao noted that : the need to leverage information technology to improve the way that customs does business in the import arena is undeniable ; customs ' existing import processes and supporting systems are simply not responsive to the business needs of either customs or the trade community , whose members collectively import about $ 1 trillion in goods annually ; these existing processes and systems are paper - intensive , error - prone , and transaction - based , and they are out of step with the just - in - time inventory practices used by the trade ; recognizing this , congress enacted the customs modernization and informed compliance act to define legislative requirements for improving import processing through an automated system ; customs fully recognizes the severity of the problems with its approach to managing import trade and is modernizing its import processes and undertaking ace as its import system solution ; begun in 1994 , customs ' estimate of the system 's 15-year life cycle cost is about $ 1.05 billion , although this estimate is being increased ; in light of ace 's enormous mission importance and price tag , customs ' approach to investing in and engineering ace demands disciplined and rigorous management practices ; such practices are embodied in the clinger - cohen act of 1996 and other legislative and regulatory requirements , as well as accepted industry system / software engineering models , such as those published by the software engineering institute ; unfortunately , customs has not employed such practices to date on ace ; gao 's february 1999 report on ace describes serious management and technical weaknesses in customs ' management of ace ; and the ace weaknesses are : building ace without a complete and enforced enterprise systems architecture ; investing in ace without a firm basis for knowing that it is a cost effective system solution ; and building ace without employing engineering rigor and discipline .
