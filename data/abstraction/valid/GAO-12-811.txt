brt is a form of transit that has generated interest around the world to help alleviate the adverse effects of traffic congestion and potentially contribute to economic growth . brt features can include improvements to infrastructure , technology , and passenger amenities over standard bus service to improve service and attract new riders . the use of federal funding for brt in the united states has increased since 2005 , when the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act : a legacy for users expanded eligibility for major capital projects under ftas capital investment grant program to include corridor - based bus projects . brt projects can be funded through new , small , and very small start grants under the capital investment grantprogram . gao was asked to examine features included in brt projects funded by the fta ; brt project performance in terms of ridership and service and how they compare to rail transit projects ; how brt - projects costs differ from rail transit project costs ; and the extent to which brt projects provide economic development and other benefits . to address these objectives , gao sent questionnaires to officials of all 20 existing brt and 20 existing rail - transit projects that the fta recommended for funding from fiscal year 2005 through 2012 to collect information on project features , ridership , and service and interviewed select project sponsors . gao also reviewed documents and interviewed government , academic , and industry group officials . the u.s.department of transportation did not comment on the draft report . u.s. bus rapid transit ( brt ) projects we reviewed include features that distinguished brt from standard bus service and improved riders experience . however , few of the projects ( 5 of 20 ) used dedicated or semi - dedicated lanes a feature commonly associated with brt and included in international systems to reduce travel time and attract riders . project sponsors and planners explained that decisions on which features to incorporate into brt projects were influenced by costs , community needs , and the ability to phase in additional features . for example , one project sponsor explained that well - lighted shelters with security cameras and real - time information displays were included to increase passengers sense of safety in the evening . project sponsors told us they plan to incorporate additional features such as off - board fare collection over time . the brt projects we reviewed generally increased ridership and improved service over the previous transit service . specifically , 13 of the 15 project sponsors that provided ridership data reported increases in ridership after 1 year of service and reduced average travel times of 10 to 35 percent over previous bus services . however , even with increases in ridership , u.s. brt projects usually carry fewer total riders than rail transit projects and international brt systems . project sponsors and other stakeholders attribute this to higher population densities internationally and riders who prefer rail transit . however , some projectssuch as the m15 brt line in new york citycarry more than 55,000 riders per day . capital costs for brt projects were generally lower than for rail transit projects and accounted for a small percent of the federal transit administrations ( fta ) new , small , and very small starts funding although they accounted for over 50 percent of projects with grant agreements since fiscal year 2005. project sponsors also told us that brt projects can provide rail - like benefits at lower capital costs . however , differences in capital costs are due in part to elements needed for rail transit that are not required for brt and can be considered in context of total riders , costs for operations , and other long - term costs such as vehicle replacement . we found that although many factors contribute to economic development , most local officials we visited believe that brt projects are contributing to localized economic development . for instance , officials in cleveland told us that between $ 4 and $ 5 billion was invested near the healthline brt projectassociated with major hospitals and universities in the corridor . project sponsors in other cities told us that there is potential for development near brt projects ; however , development to date has been limited by broader economic conditionsmost notably the recent recession . while most local officials believe that rail transit has a greater economic development potential than brt , they agreed that certain factors can enhance brts ability to contribute to economic development , including physical brt features that relay a sense of permanence to developers ; key employment and activity centers located along the corridor ; and local policies and incentives that encourage transit - oriented development . our analysis of land value changes near brt lends support to these themes . in addition to economic development , brt project sponsors highlighted other community benefits including quick construction and implementation and operational flexibility .
