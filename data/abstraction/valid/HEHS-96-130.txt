pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of labor 's efforts to prevent the use of inaccurate wage data for davis - bacon act wage rate determinations , focusing on : the steps labor follows in collecting and reporting wage data ; and weaknesses in labor 's wage determination process . gao found that : labor 's wage determinations are based on voluntary submissions of wage and benefit data from employers and third parties ; such internal control weaknesses as inaccurate wage and fringe benefit data , limited computer capability , and an inaccessible appeals process often lead to increased government construction costs or lower wages and fringe benefits for construction workers ; labor began requiring its regional staff to verify third - party wage survey data in august 1995 , but the verification does not address erroneous employer - reported data ; labor does not have sufficient computer resources to automate data collection and verification ; and labor requested $ 4 million in its fiscal year 1997 budget to develop , evaluate , and implement alternative reliable methodologies that will provide accurate and timely wage determinations at a reasonable cost .
