the 2010 deepwater horizon incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in u.s. waters , releasing more than 200 million gallons into the gulf of mexico . bp has estimated the combined oil spill costs — cleanup activities , natural resource and economic damages , potential clean water act ( cwa ) penalties , and other obligations — will be approximately $ 41 billion . the deepwater horizon oil spill raised many issues for policymakers , including the ability of the existing oil spill liability and compensation framework to respond to a catastrophic spill . this framework determines ( 1 ) who is responsible for paying for oil spill cleanup costs and the economic and natural resource damages from an oil spill ; ( 2 ) how these costs and damages are defined ( i.e . , what is covered ? . ) ; and ( 3 ) the degree to which , and conditions in which , the costs and damages are limited and / or shared by other parties , including general taxpayers . the existing framework includes a combination of elements that distribute the costs of an oil spill between the responsible party ( or parties ) and the oil spill liability trust fund ( osltf ) , which is largely financed through a per - barrel tax on domestic and imported oil . responsible parties are liable up to their liability caps ( if applicable ) ; the trust fund covers costs above liability limits up to a per - incident cap of $ 1 billion . policymakers may want to consider the magnitude of the deepwater horizon incident and the liability and compensation issues raised under a scenario in which bp had refused to finance response activities or establish a claims process to comply with the relevant opa provisions . bp has either directly funded oil spill response operations or reimbursed the federal government for actions taken by various agencies . bp has paid damage claims well above its liability limit and outside the scope of its liable damages . although evidence indicates that the levels of current framework ( liability limits and osltf ) may be sufficient to address the more common mix of spills that have historically occurred , the current combination of liability limits and $ 1 billion per - incident osltf cap is not sufficient to withstand a spill with damages / costs that exceed a responsible party 's liability limit by $ 1 billion . even if the per - incident cap were increased , the current ( and projected ) level of funds in the osltf may not be sufficient to address costs from a catastrophic spill . the options available to address these issues depend upon the overall objective of congress . one objective — which has been expressed by many in and outside congress — is to provide full restoration and timely compensation ( i.e . , through channels other than litigation ) for the impacts from the spill , without directly burdening the general taxpayers . if this is the objective , congress may consider some combination of ( 1 ) increasing the offshore facility liability limit and corresponding financial responsibility demonstration ; ( 2 ) increasing the osltf per - incident cap ; or ( 3 ) increasing the level of funds available in the osltf . in addition , policymakers may want to consider an industry - financed fund , akin to the nuclear power industry 's fund , that could supplement or potentially replace the current system . another objective might be to maintain the existing system , which may be sufficient to address all but the most extreme scenarios . catastrophic spills in u.s. waters have historically been rare . some may argue that establishing a system that can withstand a catastrophic event would impose costs and yield consequences that would not justify the ( expected ) ability to address a catastrophic event .
