real property disposal is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer , donate , or sell real property they no longer need . disposition is an important asset management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial , consuming financial resources that might be applied to long - standing real property needs , such as repairing existing facilities , or other pressing policy issues , such as reducing the national debt . despite the expense , federal agencies hold thousands of unneeded and underutilized properties . agencies have argued that they are unable to dispose of these properties for several reasons . first , there are statutorily prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete . second , agencies are often required to complete major repairs or environmental remediation before properties are ready for disposal — steps for which agencies lack funding . third , key stakeholders in the disposal process — including local governments , non - profit organizations , and businesses — are often at odds over how to dispose of properties . in addition , congress may be limited in its capacity to conduct oversight of the disposal process because it currently lacks access to reliable , comprehensive real property data . four bills have been introduced in the 113th congress that propose significant changes to the existing real property disposal system . the federal real property asset management reform act of 2013 ( s. 1398 ) , would establish an expedited disposal program under which 200 properties would be exempt from time - consuming , statutory disposal requirements . in addition , s. 1398 would expand the role of an interagency workgroup , the federal real property council , to set disposal goals for agencies and monitor their progress in meeting those goals . the bill would also increase oversight of agency disposal activities by requiring the administrator of the general services administration ( gsa ) to establish a real property database available to the public at no cost . the excess federal building and property disposal act of 2013 ( h.r . 328 ) would establish an expedited disposal program under which the 15 unneeded federal properties with the highest fair market value would bypass statutory disposal requirements and be offered for sale immediately . h.r . 328 would also require the gsa administrator to establish a real property database available to the public at no cost and provide a report to congress on the progress each landholding agency has made in reducing its unneeded property . two similar , but not identical , versions of the civilian property realignment act ( h.r . 695 , s. 1715 ) have been introduced . both bills would have the same overarching structure . they would centralize the disposal process by establishing a civilian property realignment commission , which would work with agencies to develop a list of disposal recommendations to the president . if the president approved the recommendations , then they would be sent to congress . if congress passed a joint resolution of approval , then agencies would be required to implement the recommendations ; if a joint resolution of approval was not passed , then the realignment process would end for the fiscal year .
