the space industry refers to economic activities related to the manufacture and delivery of components that go into earth 's orbit or beyond . the space industry is a subset of the u.s. aerospace industry and u.s. strength in aerospace has helped to provide u.s. strength in space . the space industry was originally developed by government entities , and government policies and spending continue to exercise a strong influence on commercial space activities in the united states and elsewhere . space - oriented manufacturing , which includes launch vehicles , spacecraft , satellites , and parts and equipment , has created a large space - industrial infrastructure that enables a much larger space services sector that includes satellite telecommunications and broadcasting services , and satellite remote sensing , among others . together , these are an important part of the u.s. industrial and technology base . the focus of this report is the global commercial space manufacturing sector ( launch vehicles , spacecraft , and satellites ) . although relatively small , accounting for less than $ 6 billion of expenditures in 2010 , it enables an estimated $ 276 billion in spending for ground equipment and satellite services . the united states manufactures more launch vehicles , spacecraft , and satellites than any other country , but the relative u.s. competitive position has eroded as other countries have made large investments in commercial and government space activities . the u.s. government remains the world 's largest customer for space equipment and services . with the end of the space shuttle era , the government will increasingly depend on the u.s. commercial space industry for transport of humans and cargo , and on commercial satellites for communications and data . the extent and nature of government demand are likely to be significant factors shaping the u.s. commercial space industry . u.s. policy has gradually shifted toward encouraging more competition among firms that manufacture launch equipment , spacecraft , and satellites , encouraging the participation of smaller , entrepreneurial firms in an industry segment traditionally dominated by large aerospace firms . several policy issues appear to have significant effects on the growth and competitiveness of the u.s. space manufacturing industry : in 1998 , congress passed legislation that reclassified all satellites and satellite parts and equipment as weapons under the international traffic in arms regulations , limiting the ability of u.s. manufacturers of commercial space equipment to sell abroad and encouraging foreign rivals to increase their global market share at the expense of u.s. manufacturers . on april 18 , 2012 , the department of defense ( dod ) and department of state issued a congressionally mandated report that assessed risks associated with removing satellites and related components from the united states munitions list ( usml ) . bills have been introduced in the 112th congress to reauthorize and amend u.s. export control laws ( h.r . 2122 , h.r . 2004 , h.r . 1727 , h.r . 3288 ) . the rapid growth in technologies that consume large amounts of bandwidth threatens to destabilize the current system that allocates spectrum and orbital position to specific users . spectrum is a scarce resource , but increasingly , commercial satellite operators are developing technological solutions to increase capacity . dod is now a major user of commercial satellites . from a surge related to the wars in iraq and afghanistan , it now places greater reliance on commercial satellites . hosted payloads are also likely to become a more common feature of the commercial satellite industry in the future .
