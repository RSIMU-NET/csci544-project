pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the effectiveness of the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) year 2000 program , including the reliability of its year 2000 cost estimate . gao noted that : faa 's progress in making its systems ready for the year 2000 has been too slow ; at its current pace , it will not make it in time ; the agency has been severely behind schedule in completing basic awareness activities , a critical first phase in an effective year 2000 program ; for example , faa appointed its initial program manager with responsibility for the year 2000 only 6 months ago , and its overall year 2000 strategy is not yet final ; faa also does not know the extent of its year 2000 problem because it has not completed most key assessment phase activities , the second critical phase in an effective year 2000 program ; it has yet to analyze the impact of systems ' not being year 2000 date compliant , inventory and assess all of its systems for date dependencies , develop plans for addressing identified date dependencies , or develop plans for continuing operations in case systems are not corrected in time ; faa currently estimates it will complete its assessment activities by the end of january 1998 ; until these activities are completed , faa can not know the extent to which it can trust its systems to operate safely after 1999 ; the potential serious consequences include degraded safety , grounded or delayed flights , increased airline costs , and customer inconvenience ; delays in completing awareness and assessment activities also leave faa little time for critical renovation , validation , and implementation activities -- the final three phases in an effective year 2000 program ; with 2 years left , faa is quickly running out of time , making contingency planning for continuity of operations even more critical ; faa 's inventory and assessment actions will define the scope and magnitude of its year 2000 problem ; since they are incomplete , faa lacks the information it needs to develop reliable year 2000 cost estimates ; and faa 's year 2000 project manager currently estimates that the entire program will cost $ 246 million based on early estimates from managers throughout the agency .
