in approving the fy2001 agriculture appropriations act , congress codified the lifting of unilateral sanctions on commercial sales of food , agricultural commodities , medicine , and medical products to iran , libya , north korea , and sudan , and extended this policy to apply to cuba ( title ix of h.r . 5426 , as enacted by p.l . 106-387 ; trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 , or tsra ) . other provisions place financing and licensing conditions on sales to these countries . those that apply to cuba , though , are permanent and more restrictive . tsra also gives congress the authority in the future to veto a president 's proposal to impose a sanction on the sale of agricultural or medical products . codifying the food and medical sales exemption for cuba generated much debate . exemption proponents argued that prohibiting sales to cuba harmed the u.s. agricultural sector , and that opening up limited trade would be one way to pursue a `` constructive engagement '' policy . opponents countered that an exemption would undercut u.s. policy to pressure the castro government to make political and economic reforms . though top cuban officials initially stated no purchases would be made with tsra 's conditions in place , food stock losses due to a hurricane and a shift in cuban strategy led to almost $ 1.25 billion in cash purchases by cuba of u.s. food and farm commodities from december 2001 to april 2006. agricultural sales to iran , libya , and sudan under tsra have totaled $ 313 million . congressional opponents of tsra 's prohibitions on private u.s. financing of agricultural sales , public financing of eligible exports , and tourist travel to cuba have introduced bills since 2000 to repeal these provisions . though several amendments to repeal or relax tsra provisions relative to cuba were adopted by committees or passed during floor debate , all were dropped in conference action . the bush administration 's policy is to allow sales under tsra , but not to change any aspect of the embargo until political and economic reforms occur in cuba . reflecting this , administration officials continually signal to conferees they will advise the president to veto any bill that would change tsra 's prohibitions against cuba . in the 109th congress , h.r . 719 / s . 328 , h.r . 1339 / s . 634 , s.amdt . 281 and s.amdt . 282 to s. 600 , and amendments to appropriations bills seek to change a rule issued in early 2005 which defined `` payment of cash in advance '' to mean that payment must be received by the u.s. exporter prior to when agricultural products are shipped from a u.s. port , rather than before title and control is transferred to the cuban buyer . fearing lost sales , farm groups and some congressional opposition to this rule has led to ongoing debate on this issue . responding to congressional pressure , the bush administration in july 2005 , revised this rule slightly to allow for goods to be shipped from a u.s. port once a third - country bank receives payment for the u.s. exporter from the cuban purchaser . in recent floor action , the house on june 14 , 2006 , adopted an amendment to the fy2007 transportation - treasury spending bill ( section 950 of h.r . 5576 ) to prohibit implementation of this rule . conferees dropped identical language in fy2006 's treasury 's bill ( h.r . 3058 ) in response to a presidential veto threat .
