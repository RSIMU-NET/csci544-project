over 1.2 million foreign students studied at u.s. universities in 2018 ( see fig . ) . although foreign students and scholars contribute to u.s. research , there is a risk that they will “ export ” sensitive knowledge they gain to their home countries . to mitigate this risk , the u.s. government implements export controls . gao was asked to review agency guidance and universities ' security practices . this report examines the extent to which state and commerce have provided guidance and outreach that supports u.s. universities ' understanding of export control regulations ; challenges u.s. universities face working with other federal agencies , such as dod ; and the extent to which universities ' export compliance practices align with state and commerce guidelines . gao reviewed related laws , regulations , and guidance , and interviewed officials from relevant federal agencies and four university associations . gao also visited nine universities — selected , in part , on the basis of research expenditures and geography — and assessed their compliance practices against agency guidelines . the departments of state ( state ) and commerce ( commerce ) have each provided guidance and outreach to support exporters ' understanding of and compliance with their separate export control regulations . exporters , including universities , are subject to these regulations if they ship export - controlled items overseas or if they share such items , including technology or source code , with foreign persons in the united states . university and association officials raised concerns that state and commerce guidance and outreach does not adequately address export compliance issues that are more common to universities than to industry , such as fundamental research — i.e . , research that is ordinarily published and not subject to export control regulations . without additional guidance and outreach that addresses such issues , universities may not have the information they need to adequately comply with these regulations and properly safeguard export - controlled items . officials from selected universities and university associations identified three export control - related challenges in working with other federal agencies . for example , university and association officials asserted that department of defense ( dod ) officials misunderstand the term fundamental research , which may limit universities ' ability to conduct research for dod . dod acknowledged that some officials have inconsistently interpreted the regulations and that it has not yet fully addressed this challenge . additionally , university and association officials expressed concerns that threat briefings and other guidance that the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and department of homeland security provide are not helpful because , for example , they do not contain unclassified information that can be shared widely . to address these concerns , the fbi partnered with a university association to produce a series of unclassified “ awareness - raising ” materials for university audiences , among other efforts . seven of the nine universities gao visited have export compliance policies and practices that generally align with state 's and commerce 's export compliance guidelines . for example , most have demonstrated a strong management commitment to export compliance and have robust practices for tracking export - controlled items , recordkeeping , and reporting potential violations . however , gao identified gaps in some universities ' practices in four areas — risk assessments , training , internal audits , and export compliance manuals . gao is making four recommendations , including that state and commerce should improve their export control guidance and outreach , which may help address gaps in university export control compliance practices . gao also recommends that dod take steps to ensure its officials consistently interpret export control regulations . state , commerce , and dod concurred with the recommendations .
