this testimony discusses states ' plans for operating their temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) programs in the event of an economic downturn . gao found that the data available on the levels and adequacy of states ' reserves is insufficient and misleading . furthermore , most states have done little planning for economic contingencies . many states cite obstacles to saving money for possible economic downturns . although tanf funds can be set aside in a budgetary reserve , state officials said that they are concerned that the accumulation of unspent tanf funds might signal that the funds are not needed . another option for states would be to save their own funds in a general purpose rainy day account , but state officials said that welfare would have to compete with other state priorities when these funds are released from state treasuries . there are now federal contingency mechanisms for states to access additional federal resources in the event of a recession or other emergency -- the contingency fund for state welfare programs and the federal loan for state welfare programs . however , states generally found these programs too complex and restrictive , and would most likely find other ways to sustain their welfare programs .
