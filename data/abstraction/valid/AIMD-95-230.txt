pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed selected financial issues relating to the denver international airport ( dia ) , focusing on : dia construction cost growth ; differences between the dia financial consultant 's report and audited financial statements relating to the denver airport system 's bond debt ; and securities and exchange commission ( sec ) jurisdiction over municipal bonds and the status and scope of its dia investigation . gao found that : dia construction costs increased from an estimated $ 2.08 billion in may 1990 to $ 3.004 billion in february 1995 ; the cost increases were due to changes in the scope of dia and capitalized interest increased by $ 300 million due to the delay in dia opening ; the two financial reports on dia differed mainly due to their different purposes and the different time periods and scopes covered ; the financial statements covered both dia and the stapleton international airport , while the consultant 's report presented financial forecasts only for dia based on certain assumptions about future events ; the differences in annual bond debt payments reflected the consultant 's assumption that certain bonds would be refinanced in 1995 , bond principal would be prepaid , lower interest rates would be paid on variable rate bonds , and passenger facility charges would be used to reduce annual debt service amounts ; the audited financial statements included all airport system debts while the consultant 's report included only dia construction bond debt ; municipal bonds are exempt from securities registration requirements and civil liability provisions , but they are subject to antifraud provisions ; and sec is investigating dia disclosures of its baggage system issues under its antifraud authority .
