congress passed the qualifying industrial zone ( qiz ) program in 1996 , as an amendment to the u.s. - israel free trade agreement ( usifta ) implementing legislation . this narrowly focused program provides duty - free access to the u.s. market for goods produced with certain levels of israeli and jordanian ; israeli and egyptian ; or palestinian content . the purpose of the program was political ( to further the middle - east peace process ) and economic ( to support economic growth in the middle east / north africa ( mena ) region ) . after the terrorist events of september 11 , 2001 , the bush administration , and six years later , the obama administration , undertook broader initiatives to expand regional efforts to promote peace , democratic transitions , and economic development in the larger middle east region through trade and investment . thus , the qiz program may now be viewed against a backdrop of these more comprehensive programs . the qiz program carries some provisions beyond those in most other u.s. trade preference programs . on one hand , it requires cooperative production . on the other , it includes more relaxed content requirements and more generous tariff benefits on certain goods than most trade preference programs , and permits u.s. input to reach the usifta 35 % content requirement . jordan joined the qiz program in 1997 , and egypt joined seven years later in 2004. three years after jordan opened its qiz program , it entered into a free trade agreement ( fta ) with the united states . the fta eliminated tariffs between jordan and the united states without requiring cooperative production , leading to a decrease in the importance of the qiz program in u.s. - jordan trade . initially , the qiz program was a driver of economic growth for jordan . in 13 qizs along the border with israel , factories primarily funded by asian investment and predominately populated by guest workers from asian countries co - produced apparel products with partner operations in israel . for four years , the program contributed an amount equivalent to 30 % of jordan 's total gdp growth . today , the united states is jordan 's second - most important trading partner ( after saudi arabia ) . while jordan 's qiz program has been largely superseded by the u.s. - jordan fta , its qizs remain the source of many of its exports to the united states , as well as to other countries . for egypt , the qiz program was not as transformational as it was for jordan and contributed , at best , an amount equivalent to 2 % of its gdp growth for two years . the country already produced and exported apparel and textiles from egypt 's own cotton woven into fabric in egyptian factories . the united states was and remains egypt 's top trading partner . president obama recently expanded the qiz program for egypt , naming more zones and including all present and future producers in those zones as eligible for qiz tariff benefits . if congress were to explore additional trade options for stimulating mena intra - regional and world trade , it might move to reexamine the purposes and effects of the qiz program . options for the 113th congress include possible consideration of the qiz program in the context of larger policy options relating to u.s. - mena relations and mena trade and development . this report does not address the current turmoil in egypt . for a discussion of this issue , see crs report rl33003 , egypt : background and u.s. relations , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
