fmcsa 's primary mission of reducing crashes , injuries , and fatalities involving large trucks and buses is critical to the safety of our nation 's highways . however , with more than 500,000 active motor carriers operating on u.s. roadways , fmcsa must screen , identify , and target its resources toward those carriers presenting the greatest risk for crashing in the future . fmcsa has recently taken some steps in this direction by , among other actions : establishing its oversight program — the csa program — based on a data - driven approach for identifying motor carriers at risk of presenting a safety hazard or causing a crash , and establishing a vetting program designed to detect potential “ chameleon ” carriers — those carriers that have deliberately disguised their identity to evade enforcement actions issued against them . this testimony provides information on both of these programs , based on two recent gao reports on the oversight challenges fmcsa faces in identifying high risk motor carriers for intervention ( gao - 14-114 ) , and chameleon carriers ( gao - 12-364 ) , respectively . the federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) has taken steps toward better oversight of motor carriers by establishing the compliance , safety , accountability ( csa ) and chameleon carrier vetting programs ; however , fmcsa could improve its oversight to better target high risk carriers . the csa program oversees carriers ' safety performance through roadside inspections and crash investigations , and issues violations when instances of noncompliance with safety regulations are found . csa provides fmcsa , state safety authorities , and the industry with valuable information regarding carriers ' performance on the road . a key component of csa — the safety measurement system ( sms ) — uses carrier performance data collected from inspections and investigations to calculate safety scores for carriers and identify those at high risk of causing a crash . the program then uses these scores to target high risk carriers for enforcement actions , such as warning letters , additional investigations , or fines . however , gao 's 2014 report identified two major challenges that limit the precision of the sms scores and confidence that these scores are effectively comparing safety performance across carriers . first , sms uses violations of safety - related regulations to calculate a score , but gao found that most of these regulations were violated too infrequently to determine whether they were accurate predictors of crash risk . second , most carriers lacked sufficient data from inspections and violations to ensure that a carrier 's sms score could be reliably compared with scores for other carriers . gao concluded that these challenges raise questions about whether fmcsa is able to identify and target the carriers at highest risk for crashing in the future . to address these challenges , gao recommended , among other things , that fmcsa revise the sms methodology to better account for limitations in available information when drawing comparisons of safety performance across carriers . fmcsa did not concur with gao 's recommendation to revise the sms methodology because it believed that sms sufficiently prioritized carriers for intervention . therefore , fmcsa has not taken any actions . gao continues to believe that a data - driven , risk - based approach holds promise , and efforts to improve fmcsa 's oversight could allow it to more effectively target its resources toward the highest risk carriers , and better meet its mission of reducing the overall crashes , injuries , and fatalities involving motor carriers . gao 's 2012 report found that fmcsa examined only passenger and household goods carriers as part of its chameleon carrier vetting program for new applicants . gao found that by modifying fmcsa 's vetting program , fmcsa could expand its examinations of newly registered carriers to include all types of carriers , including freight carriers , using few additional staff resources . gao recommended that fmcsa develop , implement , and evaluate the effectiveness of a data - driven , risk - based vetting methodology to target carriers with chameleon attributes . fmcsa concurred with gao 's recommendation and has taken actions to address these recommendations .
