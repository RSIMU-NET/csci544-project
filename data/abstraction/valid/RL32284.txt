the section 8 low - income housing program is really two programs authorized under section 8 of the u.s. housing act of 1937 , as amended : the housing choice voucher program and the project - based rental assistance program . vouchers are portable subsidies that low - income families can use to lower their rents in the private market . vouchers are administered at the local level by quasi - governmental public housing authorities ( phas ) . project - based rental assistance is a form of rental subsidy that is attached to a unit of privately owned housing . low - income families who move into the housing pay a reduced rent , on the basis of their incomes . the section 8 program began in 1974 , primarily as a project - based rental assistance program . however , by the mid - 1980s , project - based assistance came under criticism for seeming too costly and concentrating poor families in high - poverty areas . congress stopped funding new project - based section 8 rental assistance contracts in 1983. in their place , congress created vouchers as a new form of assistance . today , vouchers — numbering more than 2 million — are the primary form of assistance provided under section 8 , although over 1 million units still receive project - based assistance under their original contracts or renewals of those contracts . congressional interest in the section 8 programs — both the voucher program and the project - based rental assistance program — has increased in recent years , particularly as the program costs have rapidly grown , led by cost increases in the voucher program . in order to understand why costs are rising so quickly , it is important to first understand how the program works and its history . this report presents a brief overview of that history and introduces the reader to the program . for more information , see crs report rl34002 , section 8 housing choice voucher program : issues and reform proposals ; and crs report r41182 , preservation of hud - assisted housing , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
