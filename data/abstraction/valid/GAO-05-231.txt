federal agencies are facing a set of emerging cybersecurity threats that are the result of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack and the blending of once distinct types of attack into more complex and damaging forms . examples of these threats include spam ( unsolicited commercial e - mail ) , phishing ( fraudulent messages to obtain personal or sensitive data ) , and spyware ( software that monitors user activity without user knowledge or consent ) . to address these issues , gao was asked to determine the potential risks to federal systems from these emerging cybersecurity threats , the federal agencies ' perceptions of risk and their actions to mitigate them , federal and private - sector actions to address the threats on a national level , and governmentwide challenges to protecting federal systems from these threats . spam , phishing , and spyware pose security risks to federal information systems . spam consumes significant resources and is used as a delivery mechanism for other types of cyberattacks ; phishing can lead to identity theft , loss of sensitive information , and reduced trust and use of electronic government services ; and spyware can capture and release sensitive data , make unauthorized changes , and decrease system performance . the blending of these threats creates additional risks that can not be easily mitigated with currently available tools . agencies ' perceptions of the risks of spam , phishing , and spyware vary . in addition , most agencies were not applying the information security program requirements of the federal information security management act of 2002 ( fisma ) to these emerging threats , including performing risk assessments , implementing effective mitigating controls , providing security awareness training , and ensuring that their incident - response plans and procedures addressed these threats . several entities within the federal government and the private sector have begun initiatives to address these emerging threats . these efforts range from educating consumers to targeting cybercrime . similar efforts are not , however , being made to assist and educate federal agencies . although federal agencies are required to report incidents to a central federal entity , they are not consistently reporting incidents of emerging cybersecurity threats . pursuant to fisma , the office management and budget ( omb ) and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) share responsibility for the federal government 's capability to detect , analyze , and respond to cybersecurity incidents . however , governmentwide guidance has not been issued to clarify to agencies which incidents they should be reporting , as well as how and to whom they should report . without effective coordination , the federal government is limited in its ability to identify and respond to emerging cybersecurity threats , including sophisticated and coordinated attacks that target multiple federal entities .
