the employer shared responsibility provisions ( esrp ) , which often are referred to as the employer mandate , generally incentivize large employers to offer adequate and affordable health insurance coverage to their full - time employees and full - time employees ' dependents . if an applicable large employer fails to offer health insurance or offers substandard coverage to its employees , the employer may be subject to a penalty ( i.e . , assessment payment ) . all common - law employers , including government entities ( such as federal , state , local , or indian tribal government entities ) , are responsible for annually determining whether they are considered an applicable large employer ( ale ) , which is generally an employer that has at least 50 full - time employees ( including full - time equivalent employees , which are a representation of non - full - time employees as full - time employees ) . if an employer qualifies as an ale in a given year , then it will be subject to the esrp in the subsequent year , meaning it will have to offer adequate , affordable health insurance coverage to generally all of its full - time employees ( and their dependents ) or it will risk being subject to one of two penalties . regardless of penalty type , a penalty will be triggered only if at least one full - time employee receives financial assistance through an exchange . these types of financial assistance generally are not available to employees who were offered affordable and adequate coverage by their employer . if an employer does not qualify as an ale , then it will not be subject to the esrp and will not face a penalty for failing to offer health insurance coverage to its full - time employees . which potential esrp penalty an ale may be subject to is contingent upon whether an ale offered appropriate health insurance to enough of its full - time employees ( and their dependents ) . if an ale offered appropriate health insurance to 95 % or more of its full - time employees ( and their dependents ) and at least one employee received a premium tax credit or cost - sharing subsidy through a health insurance exchange , then the employer may be subject a penalty that is the lesser of ( 1 ) an amount based on the number of people who received financial assistance through an exchange or ( 2 ) an amount based on the number of the firm 's full - time employees . if an ale did not offer appropriate health insurance coverage to its full - time employees ( or offered appropriate coverage to less than 95 % of its full - time employees and their dependents ) and at least one employee received a premium tax credit or cost - sharing subsidy through a health insurance exchange , then the employer may be subject to a penalty based on the number of the firm 's full - time employees .
