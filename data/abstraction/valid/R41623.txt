since the third quarter of 2008 , u.s. household debt has steadily fallen . household debt reduction is known as deleveraging , and such substantial and persistent deleveraging ( reflected in federal reserve data ) has been uncommon over the past several decades . given that much household debt is used to finance consumption , which accounts for about 70 % of gross domestic product , continued deleveraging implies slower consumption growth and economic recovery . beginning in the third quarter of 2007 , household net worth ( i.e . , the difference between the value of assets and liabilities ) preceded the fall in household debt . the recent drop in household net worth has also been substantial and persistent relative to previous decades and , therefore , may arguably have precipitated such pronounced household deleveraging . household deleveraging may dampen the immediate effectiveness of legislative efforts to generate economic stimulus . for example , h.r . 363 and its companion s. 170 , the housing opportunity and mortgage equity act of 2011 , were introduced to facilitate the refinancing of mortgages held by the government - sponsored enterprises . in addition , the obama administration announced an initiative to assist qualified homeowners with privately held mortgages refinance into lower rate loans . if refinancing activity results in lower mortgage payments , then households may have more discretionary income to spend and , therefore , spur economic stimulus . given the trend of household debt reduction , the additional income that would have gone toward paying mortgage interest still may not be applied to new spending . households may prefer using the additional income to pay down current debt obligations . hence , such legislative efforts may enhance future borrowing capacity and long - term consumption if households continue to strengthen their balance sheets via deleveraging , but the effect on near - term consumption activity may be modest . this report presents information on recent household debt usage patterns . it also discusses possible reasons for the reduction in household credit use . consumers have reduced their indebtedness by accelerating repayment of outstanding debts and defaulting on loan obligations . lenders have also tightened lending standards . hence , both demand and supply factors can explain the decline in household credit usage .
