pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) efforts to improve the measurement of improper payments in the medicare fee - for - service program . gao noted that : because it was not intended to include procedures designed specifically to identify all types of potential fraudulent and abusive activity , the current methodology does not provide an estimate of the full extent of improper medicare fee - for - service payments ; hcfa has initiated three projects designed to further its measurement efforts which offer some promise for determining the extent of improper payments attributable to potential fraud and abuse ; based on careful evaluation of their effectiveness , performing additional potential fraud identification techniques as part of its efforts to measure improper payments could assist hcfa in arriving at a more comprehensive measurement and , ultimately , develop cost - effective internal controls to combat improper payments ; and however , no set of techniques , no matter how extensive , can be expected to measure all potential fraud and abuse .
