cox - 2 inhibitors and ssris — the u.s. public has become more familiar with these technical abbreviations for biochemical processes than one might expect from our general level of science knowledge . safety concerns about these drugs — used primarily to treat pain and depression — have turned a spotlight on the food and drug administration ( fda ) and its approach to protecting the public from drug risks that had not been identified before fda - approval allowed the drugs on the market . two regulatory frameworks exist for the review of prescription drugs . first , in the premarket approval process , fda reviews the safety and effectiveness of new drugs that manufacturers wish to market in the united states . a large part of this review is fda 's examining the manufacturer - provided data from clinical testing — studies in which humans take the investigational new drug in carefully controlled , and usually randomized , trials — from progressively larger phase i , ii , and iii trials . second , after a manufacturer has sufficiently demonstrated a drug 's safety and effectiveness for a defined population and specified conditions , and the drug is fda - approved , fda acts through its postmarket regulatory procedures . manufacturers must report all serious and unexpected adverse reactions to fda and clinicians and patients may do so . the law gives fda authority to take limited action if it finds a drug 's post - approval use presents an increased risk of an adverse event . however , many suggest that not only does fda need a broader range of enforcement tools , but that fda also is not taking full advantage of the authority it does have . while critics of fda differ in their assessment of what is wrong with fda 's approach to postmarket safety activities , there is broad agreement that it needs significant change . discussion of the problems and possible solutions revolves around six areas : fda organization , fda budget , role of industry , opportunities to use the drug approval process to enhance postmarket activities , insufficient postmarket information , and lack of public access to available data . some of the proposed changes lie within the power of fda to implement . others would require congressional action . this report examines various options for strengthening fda 's ability to protect the public . it will be updated from time to time to reflect legislative action by congress .
