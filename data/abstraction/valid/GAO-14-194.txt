from prolonged duration of a disease , to permanent injury , to death , drug shortages have led to harmful patient outcomes . fda — an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — is responsible for protecting public health and works to prevent , alleviate , and resolve shortages . in 2011 , gao recommended that fda should enhance its ability to respond to shortages . in 2012 , fdasia gave fda new authorities to improve its responsiveness and mandated gao to study drug shortages . in this report , gao reviews the trends in recent drug shortages and describes what is known about their effect on patients and providers ; examines the causes of drug shortages ; and evaluates the progress fda has made in addressing drug shortages . gao analyzed data from fda and the university of utah drug information service , which is generally regarded as the most comprehensive source of drug shortage information for the time period we reviewed . gao interviewed officials from fda and other federal agencies , organizations representing patients and providers , and drug manufacturers . gao also reviewed the literature , relevant statutes , regulations , and documents . the number of drug shortages remains high . although reports of new drug shortages declined in 2012 , the total number of shortages active during a given year — including both new shortages reported and ongoing shortages that began in a prior year — has increased since 2007. many shortages are of generic sterile injectable drugs . provider association representatives reported that drug shortages may force providers to ration care or rely on less effective drugs . the immediate cause of drug shortages can generally be traced to a manufacturer halting or slowing production to address quality problems , triggering a supply disruption . other manufacturers have a limited ability to respond to supply disruptions due to constrained manufacturing capacity . gao 's analysis of data from the food and drug administration ( fda ) also showed that quality problems were a frequent cause . gao also identified potential underlying causes specific to the economics of the generic sterile injectable drug market , such as that low profit margins have limited infrastructure investments or led some manufacturers to exit the market . while shortages have persisted , fda has prevented more potential shortages in the last 2 years by improving its responsiveness . among other things , fda implemented food and drug administration safety and innovation act ( fdasia ) requirements and recommendations gao made in 2011. fda has also initiated other steps to improve its response to shortages , such as developing procedures to enhance coordination between headquarters and field staff . however , there are shortcomings in its management of drug shortage data that are inconsistent with internal control standards . for example , fda has not created policies or procedures governing the management of the data and does not perform routine quality checks on its data . such shortcomings could ultimately hinder fda 's efforts to understand the causes of specific shortages as well as undermine its efforts to prevent them from occurring . in addition , fda has not conducted routine analyses of the data to proactively identify and evaluate the risks of drug shortages . fda should strengthen its internal controls over its drug shortage data and conduct periodic analyses to routinely and systematically assess drug shortage information , using this information to proactively identify drug shortage risk factors . hhs agreed with gao 's recommendations .
