pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on how to improve the social security administration 's ( ssa ) continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) process for disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) beneficiaries , focusing on : the number and characteristics of individuals who are due for cdr ; how ssa selects individuals for and conducts cdr ; whether available resources are adequate for conducting required cdr ; and potential options for improving the cdr process . gao found that : about 4.3 million di and ssi beneficiaries are due or overdue for cdr in fiscal year 1996 ; ssa selects beneficiaries for cdr on the basis of the likelihood that their benefits will be terminated ; ssa plans to improve its cdr selection process by obtaining medicare and medicaid data and mailing questionnaires to beneficiaries ' physicians ; funding for cdr could exceed $ 4 billion by 2002 ; ssa must incorporate additional cdr required by legislation into the agency 's workload and conduct cdr for beneficiaries whose cdr were previously done at the agency 's discretion ; ssa should conduct cdr on a random sample of beneficiaries normally excluded from the selection process to improve program integrity ; ssa proposal for time - limited benefits may increase the agency 's workload when beneficiaries who are terminated from the program reapply for benefits ; the formula used by ssa to select beneficiaries for cdr excludes approximately half of those who are due or overdue for cdr ; and ssa could utilize cdr to strengthen its return - to - work initiatives .
