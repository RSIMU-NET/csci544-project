grants are a key tool used by the federal government to achieve a wide variety of national objectives . however , there are no government - wide training standards or requirements for the federal grant workforce . cofar has reported it plans to develop such standards . gao was asked to describe how the grant workforce is trained and what challenges and good practices exist . this report describes the federal grant workforce at selected agencies and analyzes the challenge of identifying the workforce government - wide and examines selected good practices agencies use and challenges , if any , in grants training and the potential implications for developing government - wide grants training standards . gao obtained government - wide information on grants training through a questionnaire to chief learning officers at 22 federal agencies . for in - depth illustrative examples of grants training practices and challenges , gao selected four agencies -- education , hhs , state , and dot -- based on factors such as total grant obligations and the number and type of grant programs administered . gao also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials at omb and opm . identifying the federal grant workforce presents challenges due to differences in how agencies manage grants and the wide range of job series that make up the grant workforce . some agencies manage grants by using a combination of program specialists ( subject - matter experts ) and grants management specialists , while other agencies use program specialists to manage the entire grant process . in the four agencies that gao focused on for this review -- the departments of education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , state ( state ) , and transportation ( dot ) -- agency officials identified over 5,100 employees who were significantly involved in managing grants , spanning more than 50 different occupational job series . recognizing the need for a classification that would more accurately capture the work of federal employees who manage grants , in 2010 the office of personnel management ( opm ) created the `` grants management specialist '' job series . however , due to the different ways that agencies manage grants , the extent to which agencies have adopted this series varies widely . more than half of the 22 federal grant - making agencies gao surveyed make limited or no use of the job series . the council on financial assistance reform ( cofar ) , established by the office of management and budget ( omb ) in october 2011 to provide recommendations on grants policy and management reforms , has announced plans to develop government - wide grants training standards , but it has not released information on how it plans to define the grant workforce . defining the grant workforce is an important step in developing an effective government - wide grants training strategy . agency officials identified three key practices to develop the grant workforce : competencies , agency - specific training , and certification programs . first , some agencies developed their own competency models in order to better reflect the way they assigned grants management responsibilities . officials at these agencies told gao that opm 's grants management competency model was not directly applicable to employees carrying out the program specialist role in their organizations . for example , rather than apply opm 's competency model , a component of hhs developed a separate competency model tailored to program specialist employees responsible for managing grants . second , agencies addressed their grants training needs through courses and other training mechanisms designed to provide knowledge of agency - specific policies and procedures . officials reported challenges finding grants training that met all the needs of the grant workforce , and responded to this by customizing grants training courses . for example , education customized commercial courses to include agency - specific policies and procedures and a component of hhs developed its own grants management courses to achieve the same goal . third , to ensure a minimum level of proficiency in grants management , some agencies established grants management certification programs and tailored the certifications to fit the different roles within the grant workforce . for example , state tailored separate certification programs after recognizing two distinct roles played by its employees who manage grants . these agencies ' experiences have implications for cofar 's plans to develop government - wide training standards , including creating grants management competencies , delivering training for those competencies , and establishing certification standards . gao is making recommendations to the director of omb regarding the importance of including both types of grants management roles -- grants management specialists and program specialists -- when developing government - wide grants management competencies and certification standards . omb staff concurred with the recommendations .
