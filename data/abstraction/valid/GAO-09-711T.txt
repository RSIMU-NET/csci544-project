the f - 35 joint strike fighter ( jsf ) program is the department of defense 's ( dod 's ) most costly acquisition , seeking to simultaneously develop , produce , and field three aircraft variants for the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight international partners . the total expected u.s. investment is now more than $ 300 billion to develop and procure 2,456 aircraft over the next 25 years . gao 's most recent report in march of this year discussed increased development costs and schedule estimates , plans to accelerate procurement , manufacturing performance and delays , and development test strategy . a recurring theme in gao 's work has been concern about what gao believes is undue concurrency of development , test , and production activities and the heightened risks it poses to achieving good cost , schedule , and performance outcomes . this testimony discusses : current jsf cost and schedule estimates ; engine development ; manufacturing performance ; contracting issues for procurement of aircraft ; and test plans . this statement draws from gao 's march 2009 report , updated to the extent possible with new budget data and a recently revised procurement profile directed by the secretary of defense . jsf development will cost more and take longer to complete than reported to the congress in april 2008 , primarily because of contract cost overruns and extended time needed to complete flight testing . dod is also significantly increasing annual procurement rates and plans to buy some aircraft sooner than reported last year . total development costs are projected to increase between $ 2.4 billion and $ 7.4 billion and the schedule for completing system development extended from 1 to 3 years . the department has not asked for funding for the alternate engine program in the budgets since 2007 arguing that an alternate engine is not needed as a hedge against the failure of the main engine program and that the savings from competition would be small . nonetheless , the congress has added funding each year since then to sustain its development . our prior analysis indicates that competitive pressures could yield enough savings to offset the costs of competition over the jsf program 's life . to date , the two contractors have spent over $ 8 billion on engine development -- over $ 6 billion with the main engine contractor and over $ 2 billion with the second source contractor . manufacturing of development test aircraft is taking more time , money , and effort than planned , but officials believe that they can still deliver the 9 remaining test aircraft by early 2010. the contractor has not yet demonstrated mature manufacturing processes , or an ability to produce at currently planned rates . it has taken steps to improve manufacturing ; however , given the manufacturing challenges , dod 's plan to increase procurement in the near term adds considerable risk and will be difficult to achieve . dod is procuring a substantial number of jsf aircraft using cost reimbursement contracts . cost reimbursement contracts place most of the risk on the buyer -- dod in this case -- who is liable to pay more than budgeted should labor , material , or other incurred costs be more than expected when the contract was signed . jsf flight testing is still in its infancy and continues to experience flight testing delays . nonetheless , dod is making substantial investments before flight testing proves that the jsf will perform as expected . dod may procure 273 aircraft costing an estimated $ 42 billion before completing flight testing .
