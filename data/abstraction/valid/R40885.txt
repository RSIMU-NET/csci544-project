this report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance , including provisions to raise revenues , in division a of h.r . 3962 , the affordable health care for america act , as passed by the house of representatives on november 7 , 2009. h.r . 3962 is based on h.r . 3200 , america 's affordable health choices act of 2009 , which was originally introduced on july 14 , 2009 , and was reported separately on october 14 , 2009 , by three house committees â€” education and labor , energy and commerce , and ways and means . division a of h.r . 3962 focuses on reducing the number of uninsured , restructuring the private health insurance market , setting minimum standards for health benefits , and providing financial assistance to certain individuals and , in some cases , small employers . in general , h.r . 3962 would require individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to either provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment , with some exceptions . several insurance market reforms would be made , such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal . both the individual and employer mandates would be linked to acceptable health insurance coverage , which would meet required minimum standards and incorporate the market reforms included in the bill . acceptable coverage would include ( 1 ) coverage under a qualified health benefits plan ( qhbp ) , which could be offered either through the newly created health insurance exchange ( the exchange ) or outside the exchange through new employer plans ; ( 2 ) grandfathered employment based plans ; ( 3 ) grandfathered nongroup plans ; and ( 4 ) other coverage , such as medicare and medicaid . the exchange would offer private plans alongside a public option . based on income , certain individuals could qualify for subsidies toward their premium costs and cost - sharing ( deductibles and copayments ) ; these subsidies would be available only through the exchange . in the individual market ( the nongroup market ) , a plan could be grandfathered indefinitely , but only if no changes were made to the terms and conditions of that plan , including benefits and cost - sharing , and premiums were only increased as allowed by statute . most of these provisions would be effective beginning in 2013. the exchange would not be an insurer ; it would provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to insurers ' plans in a comparable way . the exchange would consist of a selection of private plans as well as a public option . individuals wanting to purchase the public option or a private health insurance not through an employer or a grandfathered nongroup plan could only obtain such coverage through the exchange . they would only be eligible to enroll in an exchange plan if they were not enrolled in medicare , medicaid , and acceptable employer coverage as a full - time employee . the public option would be established by the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) , would offer three different cost - sharing options , and would vary premiums geographically . the secretary would negotiate payment rates for medical providers , and items and services . the bill would also require that the health choices commissioner to establish a consumer operated and oriented plan ( co - op ) program under which the commissioner would make grants and loans for the establishment of not - for - profit , member - run health insurance cooperatives . these co - operatives would provide insurance through the exchange . only within the exchange , credits would be available to limit the amount of money certain individuals would pay for premiums and for cost - sharing ( deductibles and copayments ) . ( although medicaid is beyond the scope of this report , h.r . 3962 would extend medicaid coverage for most individuals under 150 % of poverty ; individuals would be ineligible for exchange coverage if they were eligible for medicaid . ) .
