the deadlocked november 2000 presidential election focused national attention on previously obscure details of election administration . congress responded with the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava ; p.l . 107-252 ) . hava created the election assistance commission ( eac ) , established a set of election administration requirements , and provided federal funding , but it did not supplant state and local control over election administration . several issues have arisen or persisted in the years since hava was enacted . some observers have criticized the eac for being obtrusive , slow , ineffectual , or even unnecessary . others believe that the agency is an important resource for improving the election administration . the eac lacked a quorum of commissioners between 2011 and 2015. hava requires computerized state voter registration systems , and its voting - system requirements promote the use of electronic voting systems . however , those systems , especially the kinds that record votes directly into a computer 's memory ( dres ) , raise concerns about security and reliability . in response , many states have enacted requirements for paper ballot records that can be verified by the voter and used in recounts . all states now use paper - based optical scan systems for at least some voters , and most use them in at least some polling places . dre systems are also used in most states , in many cases to meet hava accessibility requirements , but in several states to serve as the primary voting system in at least some jurisdictions . several states also have jurisdictions that still use hand - counted paper ballots . both dre and optical scan voting systems are computerized , with votes counted electronically . all computerized systems , whether used in the polling place or the election office , are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access aimed at stealing , deleting , or modifying the information that the systems store or process . such vulnerabilities apply not only to systems with internet connectivity but also those that can be accessed electronically through other means , such as memory cards . documented intrusions into systems of state and local election offices and political organizations in 2016 have amplified concerns about attempts by nation - states such as russia , or by nonstate actors , to use tampering or disinformation campaigns to influence the election . the department of homeland security and the eac are providing assistance to states to help them secure their systems . whether such actions will be sufficient is a subject of ongoing debate , although many observers expect that the risk of tampering is minimal . hava 's limited voter - identification provisions did not resolve the longstanding controversy over whether broad identification requirements are needed to prevent voter fraud , or whether such requirements would create an unacceptable risk of disenfranchising legitimate voters . many states have enacted requirements that voters present identification documents at polling places . also , while hava 's voter - registration requirements may have improved that process , some observers have argued that more automated registration systems are needed to make further improvements . hava authorized $ 3.65 billion in payments to states to replace voting systems and meet the requirements of the act . congress appropriated $ 3.28 billion of that amount between fy2003 and fy2010 . altogether , more than $ 3.5 billion of hava funds were appropriated through fy2016 : the $ 3.28 billion in election reform payments to states , $ 196 million for the eac and its programs , and more than $ 129 million in accessibility payments to states , administered by the department of health and human services . numerous bills to amend hava have been considered in congress , but none have been enacted except the 2009 move act , which made some amendments relating to uniformed services and overseas voters . in the 114th congress , h.r . 195 , reported by the committee on house administration , would eliminate the eac and transfer its functions to the federal election commission . house - passed appropriations bills for fy2014 and fy2015 would have defunded the eac , but the agency has received about $ 10 million in final appropriations for each fiscal year since fy2012 . other bills in the 114th congress would address a variety of issues , and some committees have held hearings on election issues , including security .
