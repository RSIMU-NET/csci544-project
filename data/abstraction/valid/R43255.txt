congress has held hearings and some members have introduced legislation addressing the interrelated topics of the quality of mental health care , access to mental health care , and the cost of mental health care . the mental health workforce is a key component of each of these topics . the quality of mental health care depends partially on the skills of the people providing the care . access to mental health care relies on , among other things , the number of appropriately skilled providers available to provide care . the cost of mental health care depends in part on the wages of the people providing care . thus an understanding of the mental health workforce may be helpful in crafting policy and conducting oversight . this report aims to provide such an understanding as a foundation for further discussion of mental health policy . no consensus exists on which provider types make up the mental health workforce . this report focuses on the five provider types identified by the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) as mental health providers : clinical social workers , clinical psychologists , marriage and family therapists , psychiatrists , and advanced practice psychiatric nurses . the hrsa definition of the mental health workforce is limited to highly trained ( e.g . , graduate degree ) professionals ; however , this workforce may be defined more broadly elsewhere . for example , the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) definition of the mental health workforce includes mental health counselors and paraprofessionals ( e.g . , case managers ) . an understanding of typical licensure requirements and scopes of practice may help policymakers determine how to focus policy initiatives aimed at increasing the quality of the mental health workforce . most of the regulation of the mental health workforce occurs at the state level because states are responsible for licensing providers and defining their scope of practice . although state licensure requirements vary widely across provider types , the scopes of practice converge into provider types that generally can prescribe medication ( psychiatrists and advanced practice psychiatric nurses ) and provider types that generally can not prescribe medication ( clinical psychologists , clinical social workers , and marriage and family therapists ) . the mental health provider types can all provide psychosocial interventions ( e.g . , talk therapy ) . administration and interpretation of psychological tests is generally the province of clinical psychologists . access to mental health care depends in part on the number of mental health providers overall and the number of specific types of providers . clinical social workers are generally the most plentiful mental health provider type , followed by clinical psychologists , who substantially outnumber marriage and family therapists . while less abundant than the three aforementioned provider types , psychiatrists outnumber advanced practice psychiatric nurses . policymakers may influence the size of the mental health workforce through a number of health workforce training programs . policymakers may assess the relative wages of different provider types , particularly when addressing policy areas where the federal government employs mental health providers or pays for their services through government programs such as medicare . psychiatrists are typically the highest earners , followed by advanced practice psychiatric nurses and clinical psychologists . marriage and family therapists earn more than clinical social workers . the relative costs of employing different provider types may be a consideration for federal agencies that employ mental health providers .
