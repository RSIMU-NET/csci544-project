the supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) is a measure of economic deprivation â€” having insufficient financial resources to achieve a specified standard of living . the spm addresses some of the limitations of the official poverty measure , without supplanting it outright . both the spm and the official measure determine the poverty status of people and families by comparing their financial resources against poverty thresholds that are valued in dollars . for both measures , poverty thresholds vary by family size and composition , and families whose resources are lower than the thresholds are considered to be poor . the measures differ in their definitions of need , as it is used in the thresholds ( the dollar amounts used to determine poverty status ) , financial resources that are considered relevant for comparing against the measure of need as specified in the thresholds , and family , for the purpose of assigning thresholds and counting resources . need the official poverty thresholds measure needs derived from the cost of an austere food budget . the food budget was multiplied by three , based on the finding that food accounted for about one - third of total family expenditures in 1955. since their original computation , these thresholds have been adjusted annually for price inflation . in contrast , the spm 's thresholds are based on consumer expenditures for food , clothing , shelter , and utilities , and it uses five years of data from the consumer expenditure survey in calculating needs and thresholds . developing the spm thresholds starts with spending data for families with exactly two children . these data are refined by using approximately the 33rd percentile of families ' expenditures on food , clothing , shelter , and utilities . next , an extra 20 % is figured into the thresholds for miscellaneous expenses such as cleaning supplies and personal care items . the thresholds then undergo further adjustment to reflect that housing costs differ between homeowners with mortgages , homeowners without mortgages , and renters ; housing costs differ geographically ; and costs differ by family size and composition . financial resources financial resources to meet needs , whether in the spm or the official measure , are based on the sum of income of all family members . while the official measure uses money income before taxes , the spm makes additional adjustments and considers a wider range of resources . the spm includes the value of certain in - kind benefits ( such as food and housing subsidies ) , uses income after estimated federal and state taxes , and subtracts some expenses from income . these expenses include medical out - of - pocket costs , such as health insurance premiums , physician co - pays , and over - the - counter medications ; child support paid outside of the household ; and work expenses , such as child care and the cost of commuting , tools , uniforms , or licensing fees related to a person 's employment . work expenses , including child care , are capped at the amount of earnings from work of the lowest - earning family member . these expenses are subtracted from family income because they can not be used to obtain the needs defined in the spm thresholds . unlike the official poverty measure , the range of financial resources included in the spm is defined to be consistent with the types of needs used to compute the spm poverty thresholds . family like the official measure , the spm family unit definition includes people related by birth , marriage , or adoption living in the same housing unit . however , the spm additionally includes cohabiting couples and their children , and foster children below age 22. how does poverty look through the lens of the spm ? . the demographic profile of the poverty population is different under the spm than under the official measure . children have a comparatively lower poverty rate ( percentage in poverty ) under the spm , and the aged ( 65 and older ) and working - age persons ( 18 to 64 ) have comparatively higher poverty rates . these differences can be explained by the spm 's resource definition . the spm includes tax credits and in - kind benefits that help families with children ( in effect , boosting the measure of family income ) . it subtracts medical out - of - pocket expenses , which disproportionately affects the aged ( lowering their measure of income ) , and subtracts work - related expenses , which disproportionately affects the working - age population ( lowering their measure of income ) . uses and limits the spm can give policymakers the tools to understand how taxes and government programs , including the noncash programs , affect the poor . it also illustrates how medical expenses and work - related expenses such as child care can affect a family 's economic well - being . however , the spm poverty estimates are derived from household survey data , and hence are affected by issues such as underreporting of income from government benefit programs , limitations on how tax liabilities and tax benefits can be estimated based on survey data , and differences in how noncash benefits and lump - sum tax refunds are `` valued '' by program recipients versus how they are valued for the purposes of poverty measurement . additionally , the spm does not directly value health insurance provided publicly or privately . further , poverty has historically been measured in the united states as an `` absolute '' measure , based on how many people fall below a set standard of living . questions have been raised about whether the spm continues to measure poverty in that way , or represents a `` relative '' measure of poverty , based on how the population ranks in terms of well - being relative to each other .
