pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed selected aspects of the navy 's management procedures for controlling items in transit , focusing on the : reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) ; and navy 's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory . gao noted that : the navy has not effectively controlled its in - transit inventory and places enormous amounts of inventory at risk of undetected theft or misplacement ; for fiscal years 1996-1998 , the navy reported that it had lost over $ 3 billion in in - transit inventory , including some classified and sensitive items such as aircraft guided - missile launchers , military night vision devices , and communications equipment ; the navy 's inventory control point ( navicp ) at philadelphia , which manages the largest portion of the navy 's inventory , reported the largest losses -- $ 2.5 billion , or 84 percent of the navy 's in - transit losses ; however , gao 's work showed that a few of the items reported as lost by navicp philadelphia had in fact been accounted for in inventory records ; navy activities involved in issuing and receiving inventory items have not always followed the navy 's control procedures to ensure that in - transit items are accounted for ; navy units have not always reported to navicp philadelphia that they received requested items ; ineffective accounting systems have been used to monitor receipts of items redistributed between storage activities , shipped to and from repair facilities , and shipped from end users ; navicp philadelphia and its shipping and receiving activities have not adequately investigated unreported receipts of items redistributed between storage activities , shipped to and from repair facilities , and shipped from end users ; navicp philadelphia has not monitored receipts of items it purchased from commercial sources ; as early as 1990 , gao reported that there were indications of inadequate internal controls over procured assets ; naval supply systems command and navicp philadelphia oversight of in - transit inventory has not been adequate ; although navy officials have initiated actions intended to correct the problems gao cited , the navy has not established any performance measures , milestones , or timetable for reducing the vulnerability of in - transit inventory to theft or loss ; and the navy has not identified management of in - transit inventory as a significant weakness in its assessments of internal controls , as provided in the federal managers ' financial integrity act of 1982 .
