security clearances allow personnel access to classified information that , through unauthorized disclosure , can , in some cases , cause exceptionally grave damage to u.s. national security . in 2011 , the dni reported that over 4.8 million federal government and contractor employees held or were eligible for a clearance . to safeguard classified data and manage costs , agencies need an effective process to determine whether civilian positions require a clearance . gao was asked to examine the extent to which the executive branch has established policies and procedures for agencies to use when first determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance and reviewing and revising or validating existing federal civilian position security clearance requirements . gao reviewed executive orders and the code of federal regulations and met with officials from odni and opm because of their directors assigned roles as security and suitability executive agents , as well as dhs and dod based on the volume of clearances they process . the director of national intelligence ( dni ) , as security executive agent , has not provided agencies clearly defined policy and procedures to consistently determine if a position requires a security clearance . executive order 13467 assigns dni responsibility for , among other things , developing uniform and consistent policies to determine eligibility for access to classified information , and gives the dni authority to issue guidance to agency heads to ensure uniformity in processes relating to those determinations . in the absence of this guidance , agencies are using an office of personnel management ( opm ) tool that opm designed to determine the sensitivity and risk levels of civilian positions which , in turn , inform the type of investigation needed . opm audits , however , found inconsistency in these position designations , and some agencies described problems in implementing opms tool . in an april 2012 audit , opm reviewed the sensitivity levels of 39 positions in an agency within the department of defense ( dod ) and reached different conclusions than the agency for 26 of them . problems exist , in part , because opm and the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) did not collaborate on the development of the position designation tool , and because their roles for suitabilityconsideration of character and conduct for federal employmentand security clearance reform are still evolving . without guidance from the dni , and without collaboration between the dni and opm in future revisions to the tool , executive branch agencies will continue to risk making security clearance determinations that are inconsistent or at improper levels . the dni also has not established guidance to require agencies to review and revise or validate existing federal civilian position designations . executive order 12968 says each agency shall request or grant clearance determinations , subject to certain exceptions , based on a demonstrated need for access , and keep to a minimum the number of employees that it determines are eligible for access to classified information . the order also states that access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access , and prohibits agencies from requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements for access . during this review of department of homeland security ( dhs ) and dod components , gao found that agency officials were aware of the need to keep the number of security clearances to a minimum , but were not always required to conduct periodic reviews and validations of the security clearance needs of existing positions . overdesignating positions results in significant cost implications , given that the fiscal year 2012 base price for a top secret clearance investigation conducted by opm is $ 4,005 , while the base price of a secret clearance is $ 260 . conversely , underdesignating positions could lead to security risks . gao found that the agencies follow varying practices because the dni has not established guidance that requires executive branch agencies to review and revise or validate position designations on a recurring basis . without such a requirement , executive branch agencies may be hiring and budgeting for initial and periodic security clearance investigations using position descriptions and security clearance requirements that no longer reflect national security needs . further , since reviews are not done consistently , dhs and dod and other executive branch agencies can not have assurances that they are keeping the number of positions that require security clearances to a minimum . gao recommends that the dni issue clearly defined policy for agencies to follow when determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance , and that the dni and director of opm collaborate to revise the existing position designation tool . gao further recommends that the dni issue guidance to require agencies to periodically review and revise or validate the designation of their existing federal civilian positions . odni and opm concurred , although opm raised concerns with which gao disagrees and addresses in the report .
