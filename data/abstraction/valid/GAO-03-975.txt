congress recognized the importance of building the capacity of community development organizations by passing section 4 of the hud demonstration act of 1993. the act authorized the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) to partner with several national nonprofit organizations that provide funding to these community groups for such things as training , staff salaries , office equipment and supplies , and management information systems . in 2002 , hud provided $ 31 million for capacitybuilding activities . to help congress with its oversight of section 4 , we reviewed the evolution and use of section 4 funding , the importance of section 4 funding to private sector involvement , and the management controls and measurements that are in place to assess section 4. we found that section 4 has evolved from a narrowly targeted initiative that focused on providing funding for capacity building in 23 urban areas to a broader program that funds groups and activities in urban , rural , and tribal areas nationwide . the four organizations ( grantees ) use section 4 funding to provide a variety of capacity - building support to their subrecipients . these subrecipients are nonprofit organizations that undertake locally targeted initiatives in areas such as economic development , low - income housing construction , and job training . the section 4 funds that the grantees receive help leverage private sector funding and in - kind contributions such as land and equipment , pro bono legal services , office space , and voluntary labor . since the four grantees became eligible for section 4 funding , they have leveraged nearly $ 800 million in cash and in - kind contributions from the private sector . hud is responsible for ensuring that section 4 funds are used according to federal law and regulations and that grantees are utilizing funds efficiently and effectively . however , hud relies on grantees to oversee their subrecipients . the grantees had far - reaching organizational structures and processes in place to monitor and control their subrecipients . but we found that one of the seven subrecipients we tested for monitoring and control procedures had reimbursed a subrecipient for an item that was prohibited by the office of management and budget ( omb ) . while hud has the overall responsibility to prevent such internal control failures , the cost - effectiveness of adding additional federal controls must be weighed against the amount of the federal dollars involved . we believe that as long as hud and the grantees remain vigilant , additional controls are not necessary at this time . hud is taking steps to develop a framework for assessing the effectiveness of its technical assistance programs and will take part in an omb program assessment rating tool review .
