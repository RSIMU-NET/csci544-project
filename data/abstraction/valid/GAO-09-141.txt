the department of justice 's federal bureau of prisons ( bop ) is responsible for the custody and care of more than 202,000 federal offenders with approximately 35,000 employees , almost half of whom are correctional officers , dispersed across bop 's 114 correctional facilities in 6 regions . in response to a request , gao identified whether bop had policies and procedures and how it assessed the management of those policies and procedures for employee - requested lateral transfers of bop employees between correctional facilities and day - to - day changes in correctional services or temporary assignments of bop employees within a correctional facility . gao reviewed available documentation on bop 's policies and procedures on lateral transfers and temporary assignments . gao also interviewed officials from bop 's central and regional offices and seven facilities selected on the basis of the number of staff ; at least one facility was selected from within each of bop 's six regions . bop does not have written policies and procedures on lateral transfers of staff . each correctional facility evaluates requests for lateral transfers on a case - by - case basis . typically , when an employee requests a lateral transfer to another facility , the warden at the employee 's current facility determines whether to forward the request to the desired facility 's warden . the processes for requesting a lateral transfer and the criteria for forwarding , granting , or denying such requests varied across the facilities gao reviewed , and generally no documentation on decisions reached or actions taken was maintained . further , bop does not systematically review decisions concerning these requests at any level . as a result , bop can not determine the number of requests for lateral transfers , the outcome of these requests , or whether requests were handled consistently within or among facilities . gao has previously reported that agencywide policies and procedures help ensure consistent treatment of staff when agencies have geographically dispersed locations . other department of justice law - enforcement components have written policies , procedures , and a review process concerning requests for lateral transfers . unlike lateral transfers , bop has written policies and procedures on how facilities are to temporarily assign staff to fill in for absences or to meet other needs that arise in a facility . however , bop has not systematically assessed how facilities are managing temporary assignments . as part of a costreduction strategy affecting temporary assignments , in 2005 , bop designated mission critical posts , that is , assignments that were deemed essential for the safe and secure operations of its facilities and that would be vacated only in rare circumstances . the mission critical post initiative was intended to reduce facilities ' reliance on overtime and non - correctional services staff , who had typically been used for temporary assignments . a memorandum from the assistant director of correctional programs described how each facility was to gather information for 6 months on overtime and staffing under the mission critical post initiative and how bop would evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative . however , bop conducted no such evaluation . bop officials also generally do not review temporary assignments at any level , including the effect of leaving mission critical posts unassigned . according to the standards for internal control in the federal government , federal agencies are to employ internal control activities , such as top - level review , to help ensure that management 's directives are carried out and to determine if agencies are effectively and efficiently using resources . without assessing its mission critical post initiative and data on temporary assignments , bop does not know whether it is efficiently and effectively using staff for temporary assignments or achieving the desired cost savings . also , without reviewing the effect of leaving mission critical posts unassigned , bop can not assess the effect , if any , of unassigned posts on the safety and security of its facilities .
