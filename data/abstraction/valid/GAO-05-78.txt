gao was asked to assess the effectiveness of nursing home oversight by considering the effect of a unique arkansas law that requires county coroners to investigate all nursing home deaths . coroners refer cases of suspected neglect to the state survey agency and law enforcement entities such as the state medicaid fraud control unit ( mfcu ) . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) contracts with survey agencies in every state to periodically inspect nursing homes and investigate allegations of poor care or neglect . mfcus are charged with investigating and prosecuting resident neglect . gao examined the results of arkansas coroner investigations , the state survey agency 's experience in investigating coroner referrals , and whether weaknesses in state and federal nursing home oversight identified in prior gao reports were evident in the survey agency 's investigation of coroner referrals . according to the pulaski county coroner , he referred 86 cases of suspected resident neglect to the state survey agency for the period july 1999 , when the arkansas law took effect , through december 2003. agency officials said that other state coroners referred four cases during this time period . importantly , these 86 referrals constituted just 2.2 percent of all nursing home deaths the coroner investigated . however , the referrals included disturbing photos and descriptions of the decedents , suggesting serious , avoidable care problems ; more than two - thirds of the 86 referrals listed pressure sores as the primary indicator of neglect . some photos of decedents ' pressure sores depicted skin conditions so deteriorated that bone or ligament was visible , as were signs of infection and dead tissue . the referrals involved 27 homes , over half of which had at least 3 referrals . arkansas state survey agency officials told gao that they received 36 ( fewer than half ) of the pulaski county coroner 's referrals . the 50 referrals not received described decedents ' conditions similar to those the survey agency did receive . of the 36 referrals for alleged neglect that it received , the survey agency complaint investigations substantiated 22 and eventually it closed the home with the largest number of referrals . however , the agency 's investigations often understated serious care problems -- both when neglect was substantiated and when it was not . for 11 of the 22 substantiated referrals , the state survey agency either cited no deficiency for the decedent or cited a deficiency at a level lower than actual harm for the predominant care problem identified by the coroner . in contrast , mfcu investigations of many of the 11 referrals found the homes negligent in caring for decedents , and the mfcu reached settlements with the owners of several homes . in half of the 14 referrals not substantiated , the mfcu or an independent expert in long - term care either found neglect or questioned the `` not substantiated '' finding . moreover , they found gaps and contradictions in the medical records for some decedents , raising a question about the survey agency 's conclusions that the same records indicated appropriate care had been provided . gao 's prior work on nursing home quality of care found that weaknesses in federal and state oversight nationwide contributed to serious , undetected care problems indicative of resident neglect . gao 's review of the arkansas survey agency 's investigations of coroner referrals confirmed that serious , systemic weaknesses remain . oversight weaknesses gao previously identified nationwide and those it found in arkansas included complaint investigations that understated the seriousness of allegations and were not timely ; predictable timing of annual state surveys that could enable nursing homes so inclined to cover up deficiencies ; survey methodology weaknesses , coupled with surveyor reliance on misleading medical records , that resulted in missed care problems ; and a policy that did not always hold homes accountable for neglect associated with a resident 's death .
