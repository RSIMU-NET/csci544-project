pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the savings claims from the national performance review ( npr ) , which has been renamed the national partnership for reinventing government , focusing on how the office of management and budget ( omb ) estimated savings from selected npr recommendations targeted toward individual agencies . gao noted that : npr claimed savings from agency - specific recommendations that could not be fully attributed to its efforts ; omb generally did not distinguish npr 's contributions from other initiatives or factors that influenced budget reductions at the agencies gao reviewed ; therefore , the relationship between the recommended action and the savings claimed from the recommendations gao reviewed was not clear ; to estimate the savings from the agency - specific recommendations , omb said it used the same types of procedures and analytic techniques that have long been used in developing the president 's budget ; as gao 's previous reviews of budget estimates have shown , it is difficult to reconstruct the specific assumptions used and track savings for estimates produced several years ago ; moreover , gao has reported that it is often impossible to isolate the impacts of particular proposals or recommendations on actual savings achieved due to the multiple factors involved ; omb relied on these point - in - time estimates rather than attempting to measure actual savings ; omb last updated its estimates in 1997 , so any changes that have occurred since then are not reflected in npr 's claimed savings ; gao identified two instances where omb counted at least part of the estimated savings twice ; therefore , the total estimated savings from the department of agriculture ( usda ) and national aeronautics and space administration recommendations were overstated ; for one recommendation where omb and the congressional budget office ( cbo ) both estimated savings , gao found that offsetting program costs may not have been fully included in omb 's estimates ; in estimating savings that resulted from personnel reductions at usda , omb and cbo considered different offsetting costs and arrived at different estimates , with cbo 's estimate being $ 324 million less than omb 's $ 770 million estimate ; according to cbo , it assumed that severance benefits and relocation costs would reduce the potential savings , while omb assumed that the agency could absorb those costs ; consistent with omb 's normal budget practices , omb examiners generally did not retain documentation when estimating npr savings ; instead , the omb examiners attempted to reconstruct how they thought the savings had been estimated through approximating rather than replicating savings estimates ; omb had documentation for two of the recommendations gao reviewed ; and however , gao found that the savings were reported incorrectly .
