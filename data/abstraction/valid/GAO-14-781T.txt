ntis was established by statute in 1950 to collect scientific and technical research reports , maintain a bibliographic record and repository of these reports , and disseminate them to the public . in addition , it provides various information - based services to other federal agencies . ntis charges fees for its products and services and is required by law to be financially self - sustaining to the greatest extent possible . gao was asked to provide a statement summarizing its november 2012 report in which it examined ntis 's operations ; the age of and demand for reports added to its repository ; and the extent to which these reports are readily available from other public sources . in preparing this statement , gao relied primarily on its previously published work as well as related updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in the federal government . the department of commerce 's national technical information service ( ntis ) offers a variety of products and information - related services . its products include a repository of scientific , technical , engineering , and business research reports , which it makes available individually as well as through subscriptions to its reports library . however , from fiscal year 2001 through 2011 , costs for ntis 's products exceeded revenue for 10 of the 11 fiscal years , and the agency was financially sustained during this period by services it offered to other federal agencies , such as distribution and order fulfillment and various web - based services . ( see figure . ) . in addition , about 62 percent of the reports added to ntis 's repository between 1990 and 2011 were older — with publications dates in the year 2000 or earlier , while about 38 percent were published from 2001 to 2011. however , demand was greater for more recent reports — those published in 2001 or later . further , gao estimated that 74 percent of the reports added to ntis 's collection from fiscal year 1990 through 2011 were available elsewhere , and 95 percent of these were available for free . this calls into question the viability and appropriateness of ntis 's fee - based model for disseminating the reports it collects . in its 2012 report , gao suggested that congress reassess the appropriateness and viability of the fee - based model under which ntis operates to determine whether this model should be continued . while the department of commerce stated that it did not plan to propose any changes to ntis 's fee - based model , legislation recently introduced in congress may provide a vehicle for reassessing this model .
