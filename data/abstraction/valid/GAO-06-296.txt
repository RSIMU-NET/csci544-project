the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a program -- the u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) -- to collect , maintain , and share information , including biometric identifiers , on selected foreign nationals entering and exiting the united states . us - visit uses these identifiers ( digital fingerscans and photographs ) to screen persons against watch lists and to verify that a visitor is the person who was issued a visa or other travel document . visitors are also to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning at selected air and sea ports of entry ( poe ) . gao has made many recommendations to improve the program , all of which dhs has agreed to implement . gao was asked to report on dhs 's progress in responding to 18 of these recommendations . the current status of dhs 's implementation of the 18 recommendations is mixed , but progress in critical areas has been slow . dhs has implemented 2 of the recommendations : it defined program staff positions , roles , and responsibilities , and it hired an independent verification and validation contractor . it has also taken steps to implement the other recommendations , partially completing 11 and beginning to implement another 5. in september 2003 , gao reported that the program had not assessed the costs and benefits of increment 1 ( which provides entry capabilities to air and sea poes ) and recommended that the program determine whether proposed increments will produce mission value commensurate with cost . in the latest cost - benefit analysis , dated june 23 , 2005 , the program identified potential costs and benefits for three alternatives for an air and sea exit solution . however , the analysis does not meet key office of management and budget criteria ; for example , it does not include a complete uncertainty analysis , which helps to provide decision makers with perspective on the potential variability of the cost and benefit estimates should circumstances change . gao reported in may 2004 and february 2005 that system testing was not based on well - defined test plans and recommended that before testing begins , the program develop and approve test plans meeting certain criteria . however , although the latest test plan did cover many required areas ( such as the tests to be performed ) , it did not adequately trace between test cases and the requirements to be verified by testing . without complete and traceable test plans , the risk is increased that the deployed system will not perform as intended . in may 2004 , gao reported that the program had not assessed its workforce and facility needs for increment 2b ( which extends entry capabilities to the 50 busiest land poes ) and recommended that it do so . since then , the program evaluated the processing times to issue and process entry / exit forms at 3 of the 50 busiest poes and concluded that the results showed that no additional staff and only minor facilities modifications were required . however , the scope of the evaluation was limited . since then , dhs has deployed and implemented increment 2b capabilities to these 50 poes , making the collection of predeployment baseline data for these sites impractical . nonetheless , other alternatives , such as surveying site officials about the increment 's impacts , have yet to be explored . until they are , the program may not be able to accurately project resource needs or make any needed modifications to achieve its goals of minimizing us - visit 's impact on poe operations , which was the impetus for gao 's recommendation . dhs attributed the pace of progress to competing demands on time and resources . the longer that us - visit takes to implement the recommendations , the greater the risk that the program will not meet its stated goals on time and within budget .
