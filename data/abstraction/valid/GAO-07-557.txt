about two - thirds of drugs that are prescribed for children have not been studied and labeled for pediatric use , which places children at risk of being exposed to ineffective treatment or incorrect dosing . the best pharmaceuticals for children act ( bpca ) , enacted in 2002 , encourages the manufacturers , or sponsors , of drugs that still have marketing exclusivity -- that is , are on - patent -- to conduct pediatric drug studies , as requested by the food and drug administration ( fda ) . if they do so , fda may extend for 6 months the period during which no equivalent generic drugs can be marketed . this is referred to as pediatric exclusivity . bpca required that gao assess the effect of bpca on pediatric drug studies and labeling . as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction , gao assessed the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under bpca for on - patent drugs , including when drug sponsors declined to conduct the studies ; evaluated the impact of bpca on labeling drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling was changed ; and illustrated the range of diseases treated by the drugs studied under bpca . gao examined data about the drugs for which fda requested studies under bpca from 2002 through 2005. gao also interviewed officials from relevant federal agencies , pharmaceutical industry representatives , and health advocates . drug sponsors have initiated pediatric drug studies for most of the on - patent drugs for which fda has requested studies , but no drugs were being studied when drug sponsors declined these requests . sponsors agreed to 173 of the 214 written requests for pediatric studies of on - patent drugs . in cases where drug sponsors decline to study the drugs , bpca provides for fda to refer the study of these drugs to the foundation for the national institutes of health ( fnih ) , a nonprofit corporation . fnih had not funded studies for any of the nine drugs that fda referred as of december 2005. most drugs ( about 87 percent ) granted pediatric exclusivity under bpca had labeling changes -- often because the pediatric drug studies found that children may have been exposed to ineffective drugs , ineffective dosing , overdosing , or previously unknown side effects . however the process for approving labeling changes was often lengthy . it took from 238 to 1,055 days for information to be reviewed and labeling changes to be approved for 18 drugs ( about 40 percent ) , and 7 of those took more than 1 year . drugs were studied under bpca for the treatment of a wide range of diseases , including those that are common , serious , or life threatening to children . these drugs represented more than 17 broad categories of disease , such as cancer . the department of health and human services stated that the report provides a significant amount of data and analysis and generally explains the bpca process , but expressed concern that it did not sufficiently acknowledge the success of bpca or clearly describe some elements of fda 's process . gao incorporated comments as appropriate .
