pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined various issues involving consumers ' dealings with funeral - related or death care industries , which include businesses that provide funeral and cemetery goods or services , focusing on : the availability of information on the nature and extent of consumer complaints about death care industries ; the federal trade commission 's ( ftc ) efforts to ensure compliance with its funeral rule ; and selected state governments ' roles in protecting consumers in their death care transactions . gao noted that : comprehensive information on consumer complaints that would indicate the overall nature and extent of problems that consumers experienced with various aspects of death care industries was not available for a variety of reasons ; one reason is that consumers can complain to a variety of organizations about death care issues and can lodge the same complaint to more than one organization ; another reason is that no single organization or combination of organizations collects and compiles all complaints into one database ; also , each organization can have its own way of compiling and maintaining complaint information , which would confound efforts to compile and analyze aggregate complaint data ; although the organizations gao contacted were able to provide some data , the number of complaints about death care was generally low compared to complaints about other categories of consumer issues ; ftc 's funeral rule requires that funeral providers give consumers accurate , itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services ; over the last 5 years , ftc has taken steps , including distributing compliance guides and working with the funeral home industry , to promote compliance with the funeral rule ; ftc took these steps because it was concerned about what it perceived as a relatively low level of compliance -- about one - third -- among funeral homes in the late 1980s ; ftc maintains that compliance among providers covered by the rule has increased substantially over the years ; however , ftc does not have a systematic or structured process for measuring funeral homes ' compliance so that overall conclusions can be drawn about their actual compliance with the rule ; ftc 's efforts to measure compliance have been limited to narrowly scoped test - shopping sweeps in selected areas ; gao analyzed the available records of funeral homes ftc test - shopped in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 ; gao 's analysis indicated that among the limited sample of homes visited , compliance indeed was high for the funeral rule 's core requirement and somewhat lower for other elements of the rule gao reviewed ; and the five selected states differed in their approaches to protecting consumers who deal with funeral homes and cemeteries and make preneed arrangements .
