rising prescription drug costs have contributed to rising employer health plans premiums in recent years . most federal employees , retirees , and their dependents participating in the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) , administered by the office of personnel management ( opm ) , are enrolled in plans that contract with pharmacy benefit managers ( pbm ) to administer their prescription drug benefits . gao was asked to examine how pharmacy benefits managers participating in the federal program affect health plans , enrollees , and pharmacies . gao examined the use of pbms by three plans representing about 55 percent of the 8.3 million people covered by fehbp plans . for example , gao surveyed 36 retail pharmacies on prices that a customer without third party coverage would pay for 18 high - volume or high - expenditure drugs and compared these prices to prices paid by the plans and pbms . the pbms reviewed produced savings for health plans participating in fehbp by obtaining drug price discounts from retail pharmacies and dispensing drugs at lower costs through mail - order pharmacies , passing on certain manufacturer rebates to the plans , and operating drug utilization control programs . for example , the average price pbms obtained from retail pharmacies for 14 brand name drugs was about 18 percent below the average price paid by customers without third - party coverage . enrollees in the plans reviewed had wide access to retail pharmacies , coverage of most drugs , and benefited from cost savings generated by the pbms . enrollees typically paid lower out - of - pocket costs for prescriptions filled through mail - order pharmacies and benefited from other savings that reduced plans ' costs and therefore helped to lessen rising premiums . most retail pharmacies participate in the fehbp plans ' networks in order to obtain business from the large number of enrollees covered . pharmacy associations report that the pbms ' large market shares leave some retail pharmacies with little leverage in negotiating with pbms . retail pharmacies must accept discounted reimbursements from pbms they contract with and perform additional administrative tasks associated with claims processing . opm generally concurred with gao 's findings . the plans and pbms reviewed provided technical comments , and two independent reviewers stated the report was fair and balanced . one pharmacy association expressed strong concerns , including that the report did not more broadly address economic relationships in the pbm industry . gao examined relationships between the pbms and manufacturers and pharmacies specific to their fehbp business . however , relationships between pbms and other entities for other plans were beyond the report 's scope .
