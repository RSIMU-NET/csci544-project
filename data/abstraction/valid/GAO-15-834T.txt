regulatory guidance is an important tool agencies use to communicate timely information about regulatory and grant programs to regulated parties , grantees , and the public . guidance provides agencies flexibility to articulate their interpretations of regulations , clarify policies , and address new issues more quickly than may be possible using rulemaking . the potential effects of guidance and risks of legal challenges underscore the need for consistent processes for the development , review , dissemination , and evaluation of guidance . this statement discusses four key questions addressed in gao 's april 2015 report on regulatory guidance : what it is ; how agencies use it ; how agencies decide whether to use guidance or undertake rulemaking ; and steps agencies can take to ensure more effective guidance processes . to conduct that work , gao reviewed relevant requirements , written procedures , guidance , and websites , and interviewed agency officials . what is regulatory guidance ? . one of the main purposes of guidance is to explain and help regulated parties comply with agencies ' regulations . even though not legally binding , guidance documents can have a significant effect on regulated entities and the public , both because of agencies ' reliance on large volumes of guidance documents and because the guidance can prompt changes in the behavior of regulated parties and the general public . how do agencies use regulatory guidance ? . the four departments gao reviewed — agriculture ( usda ) , education ( education ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , and labor ( dol ) — and the 25 components engaged in regulatory or grant making activities in these departments used guidance for multiple purposes , such as clarifying or interpreting regulations and providing grant administration information . agencies used many terms for guidance and agency components issued varying amounts of guidance , ranging from about 10 to more than 100 guidance documents each year . departments typically identified few of their guidance documents as “ significant , ” generally defined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) as guidance with a broad and substantial impact on regulated entities . how do agencies determine whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking ? . according to officials , agencies considered a number of factors when deciding whether to issue a regulation or guidance . however , the key criterion in making the choice was whether they intended the document to be binding ; in such cases agencies proceeded with regulation . how can agencies ensure more effective guidance processes that adhere to applicable criteria ? . all four departments we studied identified standard practices to follow when developing guidance but could also strengthen their internal controls for issuing guidance . agencies addressed omb 's requirements for significant guidance to varying degrees . education and usda had written departmental procedures for approval as required by omb . dol 's procedures were not available to staff and required updating . hhs had no written procedures . in addition , usda , dol , and education consistently applied omb 's public access and feedback requirements for significant guidance , while hhs did not . in the absence of specific government standards for non - significant guidance — the majority of issued guidance — the application of internal controls is particularly important . the 25 components gao reviewed addressed some control standards more regularly than others . for example , few components had written procedures to ensure consistent application of guidance processes . however , all components could describe standard review practices and most used tools to document management approval of guidance . not all components conferred with external nonfederal stakeholders when developing guidance . finally , nearly half of the components gao reviewed did not regularly evaluate whether issued guidance was effective and up to date . gao is making no new recommendations in this statement . in the april 2015 report , gao recommended steps to ensure consistent application of omb requirements for significant guidance and to strengthen internal controls in guidance production processes . the agencies generally agreed with the recommendations .
