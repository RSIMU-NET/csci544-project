this report reviews u.s. emissions of greenhouse gases in the contexts both of domestic policy and of international obligations and proposals . on october 15 , 1992 , the united states ratified theunited nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) , which entered into forceon march 21 , 1994. this committed the united states to `` national policies '' to limit `` itsanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases , '' with a voluntary goal of returning `` emissions ofcarbon dioxide [ co 2 ] and other greenhouse gases [ methane ( ch 4 ) , nitrous oxide ( n 2 o ) , hydrofluorocarbons ( hfcs ) , perfluorocarbons ( pfcs ) , and sulfur hexafluoride ( sf 6 ) ] '' at the `` endof the decade '' to `` their 1990 levels . . subsequently , in the 1997 kyoto protocol to the unfccc , the united states participated in negotiations that ended with agreement on further reductions that could become legally binding . theunited states signed the kyoto protocol in 1998 , but president clinton did not send it to the senatefor advice and consent . president bush has said that he rejects the protocol , and former u.s.environmental protection agency administrator christine todd whitman told reporters that theadministration would not be pursuing the unfccc commitment either . instead , president bushhas proposed to shift the nation 's climate change program from a goal of reducing emissions per seto a goal of reducing energy intensity -- the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit ofeconomic productivity . under the proposal , the intensity , which has been declining for a numberof years , would decline 18 % between 2002 and 2012 , as opposed to a 14 % projected `` business asusual '' decline . meanwhile , the unfccc `` end of the decade '' deadline has passed and u.s. greenhouse gas emissions continue on an upward trend , though with dips in 1991 and in 2001 , attributed mostly toeconomic slowdowns . based on historical data , 2001 emissions were about 13 % in excess of theunfccc goal . overall , from 1990 to 2001 , u.s. greenhouse gas emissions ( weighted by globalwarming potential ) have increased an average of about 1.1 % per year . projections suggest that u.s.emissions will continue to rise for at least the next decade . reversing the upward trend ingreenhouse gas emissions would represent an extraordinary technical and political challenge to u.s.energy and environmental policy . this report will be updated as necessary .
