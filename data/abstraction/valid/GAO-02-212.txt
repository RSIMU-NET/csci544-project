congress has long been concerned about the quality of service that taxpayers receive when calling the internal revenue service ( irs ) for help in understanding and meeting their tax obligations . irs has taken steps to improve its responsiveness to the tens of millions of telephone calls it receives each year , from expanding the hours of service to increasing the use of automation . in the 2000 tax filing season , the quality of telephone assistance was mixed and below irs ' long - term goal of providing world - class service . overall , irs made limited progress toward its goal of providing world - class telephone service . when compared with the 2000 tax filing season , access and accuracy in 2001 improved in two of six comparable measures , declined in one , and changed two percentage points or less in the others . irs fell considerably short of its target to reduce the time that taxpayers spend waiting to speak with an assistor . although assistors exceeded quality - of - service targets when responding to taxpayer questions , they did not meet higher targets for providing correct answers and account adjustments . irs officials missed opportunities to analyze data to better understand the factors affecting telephone performance , including the actions it took to improve performance . irs managers sometimes reached conclusions about key factors without conducting analyses to test their conclusions . irs officials also missed opportunities to plan evaluations to determine the effectiveness of the actions taken to improve access and accuracy .
