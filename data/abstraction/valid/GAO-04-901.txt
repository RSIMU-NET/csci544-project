since 1981 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) has been working to modernize its aging air traffic control ( atc ) system . individual projects have suffered cost increases , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls of large proportions , leading gao to designate the program a high - risk information technology initiative in 1995. because the program remains a high risk initiative , gao was requested to assess faa 's progress in several information technology management areas . this report , one in a series responding to that request , has two objectives : to evaluate faa 's capabilities for developing and acquiring software and systems on its atc modernization program and to assess the actions faa has under way to improve these capabilities . faa has made progress in improving its capabilities for acquiring software - intensive systems , but some areas still need improvement . gao had previously reported in 1997 that faa 's processes for acquiring software were ad hoc and sometimes chaotic . focusing on four mission critical air traffic projects , gao 's current review assessed system and software management practices in numerous key areas such as project planning , risk management , and requirements development . gao found that these projects were generally performing most of the desired practices : of the 900 individual practices evaluated , 83 percent were largely or fully implemented . the projects were generally strong in several areas such as project planning , requirements management , and identifying technical solutions . however , there were recurring weaknesses in the areas of measurement and analysis , quality assurance , and verification . these weaknesses hinder faa from consistently and effectively managing its mission critical systems and increase the risk of cost overruns , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls . to improve its software and system management capabilities , faa has undertaken a rigorous process improvement initiative . in response to earlier gao recommendations , in 1999 , faa established a centralized process improvement office , which has worked to help faa organizations and projects to improve processes through the use of a standard model , the integrated capability maturity model . this model , which is a broad model that integrates multiple maturity models , is used to assess the maturity of faa 's software and systems capabilities . the projects that have adopted the model have demonstrated growth in the maturity of their processes , and more and more projects have adopted the model . however , the agency does not require the use of this process improvement method . to date , less than half of faa 's major atc projects have used this method , and the recurring weaknesses we identified in our project - specific evaluations are due in part to the choices these projects were given in deciding whether to and how to adopt this process improvement initiative . further , as a result of reorganizing its atc organizations to a performance - based organization , faa is reconsidering prior policies , and it is not yet clear that process improvement will continue to be a priority . without a strong senior - level commitment to process improvement and a consistent , institutionalized approach to implementing and evaluating it , faa can not ensure that key projects will continue to improve systems acquisition and development capabilities . as a result , faa will continue to risk the project management problems -- including cost overruns , schedule delays , and performance shortfalls -- that have plagued past acquisitions .
