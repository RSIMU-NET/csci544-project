tribal lands hold considerable energy resources — oil , gas , coal , wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass . tribal energy projects can help tribes fund programs and services that improve tribal members ' quality of life . federal agencies are large consumers of energy in the united states , spending about $ 6 billion in 2017 on energy for their facilities . congress has provided a mechanism for agencies to support development and use of tribal energy by authorizing agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned suppliers when purchasing energy . gao was asked to review federal efforts to use the preference . this report examines , among other objectives , the extent to which gsa , dod , and doe have used the tribal energy preference . gao reviewed available agency information on use of the preference and interviewed federal agency officials to understand how agencies would use the preference when entering into contracts with tribal suppliers . none of the three primary federal agencies with authority to enter into energy contracts — the general services administration ( gsa ) and the departments of defense ( dod ) and energy ( doe ) — have used the tribal energy preference since it was established in the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact05 ) . the section of the act that includes the preference provides federal agencies with mechanisms that can support development and use of tribal energy resources . the mechanisms include grants to assist tribes in developing their energy resources and authorization for agencies to give preference to majority tribally owned sources in federal energy purchases , so long as they pay no more than prevailing market prices and obtain no less than prevailing market rate terms and conditions . according to doe , tribal lands account for 2 percent of u.s. land but contain about 6.5 percent of all utility - scale u.s. renewable energy potential . gsa , dod , and doe officials identified five instances in the past when a tribe bid for a federal energy contract , and the agencies did not use the preference in any of those instances . gsa awarded a contract to tribes in two of the instances . in the first instance , the tribe submitted the best bid . in the second , gsa officials attempted to use the preference by limiting the energy contract solicitation solely to tribal sources , according to a stakeholder that worked on the project , but the gsa administrator expressed concern about limiting competition in that manner . gsa instead used the small business preference authority , through which the tribe ultimately won the contract . dod and doe received the other three bids , which did not lead to contracts because either the cost was too high or the bid was not needed by the agency , according to agency officials . federal officials noted that use of the preference is discretionary . epact05 , which says agencies “ may give preference , ” does not require use of the preference , and the federal acquisition regulation does not specifically address the preference . in november 2016 , gao reported that one reason federal agency officials cited for not using the preference was uncertainty about how to do so . gao recommended that gsa develop guidance to clarify use of the preference across the federal government . gsa agreed that such guidance would be beneficial but stated that the federal acquisition regulatory council is the regulatory body empowered to address this issue . in april 2017 , gsa presented the council with a business case on the issue . however , gsa officials told gao that the council determined that the preference has limited application government - wide because it mainly affects gsa , dod , and doe , and that , accordingly , the council declined to issue regulations and recommended gsa consider nonregulatory paths . gsa then added the preference language to the form it will use if it delegates purchasing authority in the future . in 2018 , federal agency officials told gao they were uncertain how to use the preference . according to gsa and dod officials , other statutes that authorize agencies to apply preferences for acquisition of goods and services from specific sources include more specific requirements in their statutory language , making them easier to apply . gsa officials noted that the small business act , as amended , contains specific requirements and measurable goals that increase contracts awarded to small businesses . dod officials stated that the agency might use the tribal energy preference if epact05 had similar requirements . to the extent that congress wants to further encourage use of tribally owned energy sources , it should consider amending epact05 to provide more specific direction to federal agencies for implementing the tribal energy preference , to include consideration of additional incentives or requirements .
