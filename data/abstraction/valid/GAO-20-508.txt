nfip has faced significant financial challenges over the years , highlighted by a rise in catastrophic flood events and its $ 20.5 billion debt to treasury . contributing to these challenges are repetitive loss properties — those that have flooded and received a claim payment multiple times . acquiring and demolishing these properties is one alternative to paying for repeated claims , but questions exist about the cost , efficiency , and effectiveness of this approach . gao was asked to review fema 's property acquisition efforts as a means of addressing nfip 's financial challenges . this report examines funding programs available for acquisitions , fema 's flood mitigation efforts , and factors contributing to nfip 's fiscal exposure . to conduct this work , gao reviewed fema guidance and other documentation ; analyzed fema data sets related to nfip policies and claims , repetitive loss properties , and mitigation projects ; and interviewed fema officials . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) administers three grant programs that can fund efforts to mitigate the flood risk of properties insured by the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) . together , these three programs funded $ 2.3 billion in mitigation projects from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. the largest program 's funding is tied to federal recovery dollars following presidential disaster declarations , while the other two programs are funded each year through congressional appropriations . states and localities generally must contribute 25 percent of the cost of a mitigation project , but some other federal program funds can be used for that purpose . one example of such a project is property acquisition — purchasing a high - risk property from a willing property owner , demolishing the structure , and converting the property to green space . from 1989 to 2018 , fema has helped states and localities mitigate more than 50,000 properties ; however , the number of nonmitigated repetitive loss properties ( generally meaning those that flooded at least twice in 10 years ) has grown . mitigation efforts varied by state . property acquisition accounted for about 80 percent of mitigated properties nationwide , but , in some states , elevation ( raising a structure ) was more commonly used . in addition , some states ( e.g . , missouri and north carolina ) mitigated a high number of properties relative to their numbers of repetitive loss properties , while others ( florida , new york , louisiana , and texas ) mitigated a low number . while these efforts can reduce flood risk and claim payments , the federal government 's fiscal exposure from nfip remains high because premium rates do not fully reflect the flood risk of its insured properties . nfip has experienced several catastrophic flood events in recent years , and the frequency and severity of floods is expected to increase . however , nfip 's premium rates have not provided sufficient revenue to pay claims . as a result , fema still owed treasury $ 20.5 billion as of march 2020 , despite congress cancelling $ 16 billion of debt in 2017. as gao has reported in the past ( gao - 17-425 ) , congress will need to consider comprehensive reform , including mitigation and structural changes to premium rates , to ensure nfip 's solvency . gao suggested in gao - 17-425 that congress make comprehensive reforms to nfip to improve the program 's solvency . given nfip 's continued debt growth , gao maintains that comprehensive reform warrants consideration .
