rich in minerals , the eastern democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) has long been the site of one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises . since 1998 , an estimated 5 million have died as a result of the conflict . gao was asked to examine the connection between minerals trade and human rights abuses , and the efforts to help control the trade . this report assesses how the key minerals are mined , transported , and processed ; the links between the minerals trade , armed conflicts , and human rights abuses ; measures the united states and the international community have taken to control the trade and ; challenges faced in controlling the trade . gao reviewed and analyzed reports , memorandums , and other documents and interviewed officials from the department of state ( state ) , other united states agencies , the united nations ( un ) , and foreign governments as well as representatives from nongovernmental organizations and industry . tin , tantalum , tungsten , and gold are the key minerals mined in eastern drc . tin , tantalum , and tungsten follow a similar supply chain ; they are mined by hand , sold to small - scale traders , carried by porters , transported by truck or airplane to the border , and sold to trading houses for export . the minerals transit drc 's neighbors , such as rwanda , and most are processed in asia and used in technology products , such as mobile telephones . in contrast , according to u.s. officials and others , most gold is smuggled out of the drc and is ultimately used by the jewelry industry . illegal armed groups and some congolese national military units commit human rights abuses and are involved in the minerals trade . a un official stated that approximately 50 percent of the reported human rights abuses are committed by congolese army units ; many soldiers in these units have committed violations in the past as rebels , are poorly integrated into the congolese military , and are consistently unpaid . to varying degrees , illegal armed groups and some military units illicitly tax minerals at mines and mineral transport routes , but they also make money illicitly taxing other trades , such as trade in charcoal and timber . the minerals trade is not the root cause but one of many factors perpetuating the conflict . the united states and the international community , particularly the un , are working to help control the illicit minerals trade , but many efforts are in the preliminary stage . state issued a `` white paper '' and produced a map of mines and armed groups , but both should be improved . the white paper lacks concrete , actionable steps regarding u.s. contribution to help control the trade , and the map presents data that need updating to enhance its usefulness . provisions in the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 ( pub . l. no . 111-203 ) underscore the importance of u.s. agencies taking action to help address the trade . the un has made efforts to help control the trade by imposing sanctions , deploying expert teams , and developing mineral training centers . others , such as a global tin industry association and the drc government , have also made efforts , but these efforts are in the early stage . significant challenges , which are yet to be addressed , exist to monitoring and controlling the minerals trade , including tracking the mine of origin . for example , many mines are in remote areas , lack road access , and are occupied by armed groups , making it challenging to monitor mine activities . tracking the origin of minerals will rely on drc mining officials , but these officials suffer from a lack of skills and from corruption . u.s. and foreign officials and others said that lack of security , weak governance , and lack of infrastructure in eastern drc are significant challenges that , unless addressed , will likely impede efforts to control the minerals trade . addressing these challenges requires measures to reform the security sector , improve governance , and invest in infrastructure , but little progress has been made in these areas . gao recommends that the secretary of state , in consultation with relevant agencies , provide concrete , actionable steps to help control the minerals trade , including addressing lack of security , governance , and infrastructure , and work with relevant stakeholders to periodically update information on mines and armed groups . state concurred with gao 's recommendations .
