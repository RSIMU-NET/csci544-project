some stakeholder groups have questioned the use of the bcbs fehbp standard plan premium costs as the basis of the age and gender adjustment , as stipulated by ppaca . the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 includes a provision for gao to report on the suitability of using these data for this purpose . this report examines : 1 ) the benefits and limitations of using fehbp bcbs standard plan data as the basis of the age and gender adjustment , and what alternatives to these data could be considered ; and 2 ) how any limitations to bcbs standard plan data could be mitigated . gao reviewed irs documentation ; interviewed industry experts and officials from irs , the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the department of treasury , and other agencies ; reviewed comment letters submitted in response to irs notices ; and analyzed 2010 and 2015 cost and enrollment data from opm . the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) included a revenue provision for a 40 percent excise tax on high - cost employer - sponsored health coverage to be administered by the internal revenue service ( irs ) . the tax would be imposed when an employee 's annual cost of coverage exceeds an established dollar limit . this limit could be adjusted upward if an employer 's workforce — based on its age and gender characteristics — was likely to have higher health costs than the national workforce , on average . this adjustment , known as the age and gender adjustment , is based on the premise that older individuals and younger females tend to have higher health care costs than other individuals . it is designed to lower the tax burden so that taxes are owed based on the plan design and not based on the health care costs of its members . ppaca stated that this adjustment would be made based on the premium costs of the blue cross and blue shield ( bcbs ) standard plan under the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) . the bcbs standard plan has benefits and limitations for use as the basis of the adjustment . the benefits include that it is a large , national , decades - old , convenient data source , in that it is already known by , and available to , the federal government . however , there are some specific limitations to its use . the bcbs standard plan has selection bias within fehbp because members have a choice among many plans , and , compared to other options available to federal employees , it is a relatively expensive plan that covers members with higher health care costs . gao 's analysis of opm data found that these higher costs are particularly true for younger members . the plan 's enrollment has declined in recent years . furthermore , officials noted that any one plan offering could be discontinued . the selection bias in the bcbs standard plan may result in an age and gender adjustment that is not adequate . for example , because the bcbs standard plan covers young members with higher health care costs , the ratio between the average claims costs of the younger and older members in that plan is smaller than it would be in a plan that did not have that particular selection bias issue . therefore , the age and gender adjustment could be too small . while experts gao spoke with identified several potential alternative sources of cost data for use as the basis of the adjustment , those alternatives also had limitations , such as not being convenient sources of data and potentially not being representative of the national workforce . to mitigate limitations of the bcbs standard plan , these data could be supplemented with data from other fehbp plans , such as the bcbs basic plan , which is known to have younger members with lower health care costs and increasing enrollment . gao found that using combined data from these two sources could result in a different adjustment for some employers — in particular , for those with older employees . standards for internal control suggest that effective information is vital for an entity to achieve its objectives . relying on bcbs standard plan data alone does not provide irs with the comprehensive information it may need to determine an adequate age and gender adjustment . gao recommends that , in implementing the age and gender adjustment , irs consider taking steps to mitigate the limitations of the bcbs standard premium cost data , such as by combining data from multiple fehbp plans . irs neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendation , but stated that it would consider the recommendation as it works to implement the age and gender adjustment .
