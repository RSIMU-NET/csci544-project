the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) , whose reauthorization is the subject of today 's hearing , plays a vital role in advancing transportation safety by investigating accidents , determining their causes , issuing safety recommendations , and conducting safety studies . to support the agency 's mission , ntsb 's training center provides training to ntsb investigators and others . from 2006 through 2008 , gao made 21 recommendations to ntsb that address management , information technology ( it ) , accident investigation criteria , safety studies , and training center use . this testimony addresses ntsb 's progress in implementing recommendations that it follow leading management practices , conduct aspects of its accident investigations and safety studies more efficiently , and increase the use of its training center . this testimony is based on gao 's assessment from july 2009 to october 2009 of plans and procedures ntsb developed to address these recommendations . ntsb provided technical comments that gao incorporated as appropriate . ntsb hasfully implemented or made significant progress in adopting leading management practices in all areas in which gao made prior recommendations . for example , as gao recommended in 2006 , ntsb issued agencywide plans for human capital management and it management , as well as a strategic plan . in 2008 , gao identified opportunities for improvement in those plans , and ntsb has since issued revised human capital and it plans and drafted a revised agencywide strategic plan and a new strategic training plan . ntbs has taken steps to improve its diversity management . however , the percentages of ntsb 's fiscal year 2008 workforce that were women and minorities were lower than those of the federal government . in addition , no members of a minority group are part of ntsb 's 15-member career senior executive service . since gao 's 2008 report , ntsb has continued to improve information security by installing encryption software on agency laptops and appropriately restricting users ' access privileges . ntsb has obligated money to implement a full cost accounting system consistent with a prior gao recommendation , but ntsb officials said that the system will not be implemented until late in fiscal year 2010. in 2008 , gao reported that ntsb had made significant progress in articulating risk - based criteria for selecting which accidents to investigate . specifically , ntsb had established such criteria for identifying which rail , pipeline , hazardous materials , and aviation accidents to investigate at the scene . since then , ntsb has adopted the remaining highway and marine criteria , and ntsb is streamlining and increasing it use of technology in closing - out recommendations . ntsb has three safety studies in progress and would like to broaden the term `` safety studies '' to include not only its current studies of multiple accidents , but also the research it does for other smaller safety - related reports and data inquiries . ntsb has continued to increase the use of its training center -- from 10 percent in fiscal year 2006 to 80 percent in fiscal year 2009. as a result , revenues have increased and the center 's overall deficit has declined from about $ 3.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to about $ 1.9 million in fiscal year 2009 .
