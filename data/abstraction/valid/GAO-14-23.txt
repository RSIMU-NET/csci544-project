the effects of climate change on water resources have already been observed and are expected to continue . the corps and reclamation own and operate key water resource management infrastructure , such as dams and reservoirs . adaptation -- adjustments in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects -- can be used to help manage the risks to vulnerable resources . in 2009 , a law -- commonly referred to as the secure water act -- and a presidential executive order directed federal agencies to address the potential impacts of climate change . gao was asked to review agency actions to address climate change impacts on water infrastructure . this report examines actions taken by the corps and reclamation since 2009 to assess and respond to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure and challenges , if any , faced by the corps and reclamation in assessing and responding to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure , and the steps the agencies are taking to address them . gao analyzed the agencies ' climate change adaptation guidance and planning documents and interviewed agency officials and other key stakeholders , including water users , environmental groups , and researchers . the department of defense 's u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) and the department of the interior 's bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) have assessed water resource and infrastructure vulnerabilities and taken steps to develop guidance and strategies to adapt to the effects of climate change . specifically , since 2009 , the corps has completed a high - level assessment of the vulnerabilities to climate change of various agency missions . the assessment found , for example , that the effects of increasing air temperatures on glaciers could negatively impact mission areas including navigation and flood damage reduction . the corps has also conducted pilot studies to help identify adaptation guidance and strategies ; it has completed 5 of the 15 pilot studies initiated and plans to start another study in 2013. similarly , reclamation has completed baseline assessments of the potential impacts of climate change on future water supplies for the major river basins where it owns and operates water management infrastructure . reclamation , in collaboration with nonfederal entities , is now conducting more focused assessments , known as basin studies , through which reclamation seeks to identify water supply vulnerabilities and project future climate change impacts on the performance of water infrastructure . according to agency officials , these studies will also help reclamation develop adaptation strategies to address these impacts , such as operational or physical changes to existing water infrastructure or development of new facilities . three basin studies have been completed , an additional 14 are under way , and 2 more are planned . reclamation next plans to initiate feasibility studies for adaptation strategies identified in completed basin studies . both agencies are incorporating what they have learned from their efforts into agency policies , planning , and guidance , according to agency officials . in 2009 , the corps , reclamation , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , and the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) , jointly published a study that identified several challenges that climate change poses for water resource managers , and the corp and reclamation are collaboratively addressing these challenges . specifically , these agencies are identifying the data and tools needed by water managers to address climate change , which will help guide federal research efforts ; obtaining needed climate data by collaborating with other agencies to help ensure that the data are collected , such as by sharing some costs associated with maintaining usgs 's stream flow measurement activities , which are valuable to corps water planning and management ; integrating climate science into water resource management decision making through activities such as developing and communicating science to inform climate adaptation strategies ; and collaborating in the development of a climate change science training program for federal and nonfederal water resources managers . the corps and reclamation have collaborated together and with others in a manner that is generally consistent with practices that gao has identified as important to enhancing and sustaining collaboration among agencies . the corps and reclamation have made collaboration a key element of their policy and plans for adapting to the effects of climate change and have reinforced accountability for collaboration through agency performance management systems . gao is not making any recommendations .
