to accomplish its mission of protecting about 9,000 federal facilities , the federal protective service ( fps ) currently has a budget of about $ 1 billion , about 1,225 full - time employees , and about 15,000 contract security guards . fps obligated $ 659 million for guard services in fiscal year 2009. this testimony is based on our report issued on april 13 , 2010 , and discusses challenges fps continues to face in managing its guard contractors and overseeing guards deployed at federal facilities , and the actions fps has taken to address these challenges . to address these objectives , gao conducted site visits at 6 of fps 's 11 regions ; interviewed fps officials , guards , and contractors , and analyzed fps 's contract files . gao also reviewed new contract guard program guidance issued since our july 2009 report and observed guard inspections and penetration testing done by fps . fps faces a number of challenges in managing its guard contractors that hamper its ability to protect federal facilities . fps requires contractors to provide guards who have met training and certification requirements . fps 's guard contract also states that a contractor who does not comply with the contract is subject to enforcement action . gao reviewed the official contract files for the seven contractors who , as gao testified in july 2009 , had guards performing on contracts with expired certification and training requirements to determine what action , if any , fps had taken against these contractors for contract noncompliance . these contractors had been awarded several multiyear contracts totaling $ 406 million to provide guards at federal facilities in 13 states and washington , d.c. fps did not take any enforcement actions against these seven contractors for noncompliance . in fact , fps exercised the option to extend their contracts . fps also did not comply with its requirement that a performance evaluation of each contractor be completed annually and that these evaluations and other performance - related data be included in the contract file . fps plans to provide additional training and hold staff responsible for completing these evaluations more accountable . fps also faces challenges in ensuring that many of the 15,000 guards have the required training and certification to be deployed at a federal facility . in july 2009 , gao reported that since 2004 , fps had not provided x - ray and magnetometer training to about 1,500 guards in 1 region . as of january 2010 , these guards had not received this training and continued to work at federal facilities in this region . x - ray and magnetometer training is important because guards control access points at federal facilities . fps currently does not have a fully reliable system for monitoring and verifying whether its 15,000 guards have the certifications and training to stand post at federal facilities . fps developed a new risk assessment and program management system to help monitor and track guard certifications and training . however , fps is experiencing difficulties with this system and has suspended its use . in addition , once guards are deployed to a federal facility , they are not always complying with assigned responsibilities ( post orders ) . since july 2009 , fps has conducted 53 penetration tests in the 6 regions we visited , and in over half of these tests some guards did not identify prohibited items , such as guns and knives . in response to gao 's july 2009 testimony , fps has taken a number of actions that , once fully implemented , could help address challenges it faces in managing its contract guard program . for example , fps has increased the number of guard inspections at federal facilities in some metropolitan areas . fps also revised its x - ray and magnetometer training ; however , all guards will not be fully trained until the end of 2010 , although they are deployed at federal facilities . despite fps 's recent actions , it continues to face challenges in ensuring that its $ 659 million guard program is effective in protecting federal facilities . thus , among other things , fps needs to reassess how it protects federal facilities and rigorously enforce the terms of the contracts .
