pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed selected aspects of the department of defense 's ( dod ) disposal process , focusing on whether : dod destroyed , during the disposal process , usable aircraft parts that did not have military technology and flight safety implications ; and the military services recalled aircraft parts from the disposal process to preclude unnecessary purchases or repairs . gao noted that : management of the aircraft parts disposal process can be improved ; dod destroyed some usable aircraft parts and sold them as scrap ; these parts were in new or repairable condition and did not have military technology or flight safety implications ; the parts could possibly have been sold intact at higher than scrap prices ; this situation occurred for several reasons ; for example , disposal offices destroyed parts because the demilitarization codes the military services had assigned to the parts were inaccurate ; the codes indicated the parts contained military technology when they did not ; gao work showed that the oklahoma city disposal office destroyed 62 of 71 sample items , even though they did not have technology implications , because the assigned codes required their destruction ; personnel responsible for assigning and reviewing the codes had not been sufficiently trained and guidance was not adequate ; in addition , policies and practices designed to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized release of parts with military technology and flight safety implications did not distinguish between parts with or without such implications ; parts without military technology and flight safety concerns were destroyed along with parts that had these characteristics ; gao work also showed that dod could have purchased or repaired fewer aircraft parts if it would have recalled the needed parts from the disposal process ; for example , the army could have reduced current and planned purchases by about $ 200,000 by using cobra helicopter parts scheduled for destruction ; dod regulations require the military services to know which parts they have placed in the disposal process ; however , interface problems between service and disposal office computer systems precluded the services from knowing what parts were at the disposal offices ; the military services had not instituted alternative ways to obtain this information on a routine basis ; problems with the disposal process are likely not unique to the three disposal yards gao visited because dod , military service , and defense logistics agency policies and procedures generally apply to activities being performed at all locations ; and gao past reviews and dod internal studies have identified similar problems at these and other locations over the past 10 years or earlier .
