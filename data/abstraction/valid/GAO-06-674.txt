the growth of information resellers -- companies that collect and resell publicly available and private information on individuals -- has raised privacy and security concerns about this industry . these companies collectively maintain large amounts of detailed personal information on nearly all american consumers , and some have experienced security breaches in recent years . gao was asked to examine financial institutions ' use of resellers ; federal privacy and security laws applicable to resellers ; federal regulators ' oversight of resellers ; and regulators ' oversight of financial institution compliance with privacy and data security laws . to address these objectives , gao analyzed documents and interviewed representatives from 10 information resellers , 14 financial institutions , 11 regulators , industry and consumer groups , and others . financial institutions such as banks , credit card companies , securities firms , and insurance companies use personal data obtained from information resellers to help make eligibility determinations , comply with legal requirements , prevent fraud , and market their products . for example , lenders rely on credit reports sold by the three nationwide credit bureaus to help decide whether to offer credit and on what terms . some companies also use reseller products to comply with patriot act rules , to investigate fraud , and to identify customers with specific characteristics for marketing purposes . gao found that the applicability of the primary federal privacy and data security laws -- the fair credit reporting act ( fcra ) and gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) -- to information resellers is limited . fcra applies to information collected or used to help determine eligibility for such things as credit or insurance , while glba only applies to information obtained by or from a glba - defined financial institution . although these laws include data security provisions , consumers could benefit from the expansion of such requirements to all sensitive personal information held by resellers . the federal trade commission ( ftc ) is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing information resellers ' compliance with fcra 's and glba 's privacy and security provisions . since 1972 , the agency has initiated formal enforcement actions against more than 20 resellers , including the three nationwide credit bureaus , for violating fcra . however , ftc does not have civil penalty authority under the privacy and safeguarding provisions of glba , which may reduce its ability to enforce that law most effectively against certain violations , such as breaches of mass consumer data . in overseeing compliance with privacy and data security laws , federal banking and securities regulators have issued guidance , conducted examinations , and taken formal and informal enforcement actions . a recent national survey sponsored by the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) identified some noncompliance with glba by insurance companies , but state regulators have not laid out clear plans with naic for following up to ensure these issues are adequately addressed .
