at the direction of congress , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) in the department of defense ( dod ) undertakes water resource development activities . usace develops civil works projects principally to improve navigable channels , reduce flood and storm damage , and restore aquatic ecosystems . congress directs usace through authorizations and appropriations legislation . congress often considers usace authorization legislation biennially and appropriations annually . usace attracts congressional attention because its projects can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects . this report summarizes authorization legislation , project delivery , authorities for alternative project delivery , and other usace authorities . authorization legislation . for usace studies and projects , congressional study and project authorization generally is required prior to being eligible for federal appropriations . congress generally considers an omnibus usace authorization bill biennially . the bill is typically titled a water resources development act ( wrda ) . agency action on an authorization typically requires funding ; that is , both an authorization and an appropriation would be needed to proceed . most water resource project authorizations in wrdas fall into three general categories : project studies , construction projects , and modifications to existing projects . a few provisions in wrda bills have time - limited authorizations ; therefore , some wrda provisions may reauthorize expired or expiring authorities . recent authorization bills include : america 's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( awia 2018 ; p.l . 115-270 ) , which included title i , water resources development act of 2018 ( wrda 2018 ) which focused on usace civil works ; water infrastructure improvements for the nation act ( wiin ; p.l . 114-322 ) , which included title i , water resources development act of 2016 ( wrda 2016 ) which focused on usace civil works ; and water resources reform and development act of 2014 ( wrrda 2014 ; p.l . 113-121 ) , which was largely , but not wholly , focused on usace civil works . in wrrda 2014 , congress developed processes for identifying site - specific studies and projects for authorization to overcome concerns related to congressionally directed spending ( known as earmarks ) . congress also used these processes for wrda 2016 and wrda 2018. standard and alternative project delivery . the standard process for a usace project requires two separate congressional authorizations — one for studying feasibility , and a subsequent one for construction — as well as appropriations for both . in recent years , congressional authorization for project construction has been based on a favorable report by the chief of engineers ( a chief 's report ) and an accompanying feasibility report . for most activities , congress requires a nonfederal sponsor to share some portion of study and construction costs . for some project types ( e.g . , local flood control ) , nonfederal sponsors are responsible for operation and maintenance . wrrda 2014 , wrda 2016 , and wrda 2018 expanded the opportunities for interested nonfederal entities , including private entities , to have greater roles in project development , construction , and financing . wrrda 2014 also authorized , through the water infrastructure finance and innovation act ( wifia ) , a program to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for water projects . although the wifia program administered by the u.s. environmental protection agency is operational , the usace wifia program for navigation , flood risk reduction , and ecosystem restoration projects has not been implemented . other usace activities and authorities . congress has granted usace general authorities to undertake some activities without requiring additional congressional authorization , including emergency actions related to flooding and limited actions in response to drought . additionally , under the national response framework , usace may be tasked with performing activities in response to an emergency or disaster , principally associated with public works and engineering such as providing temporary roofing and emergency power restoration . in addition to its work for the department of the army under usace 's military program , usace under various authorities also may perform work on a reimbursable basis for other dod entities , federal agencies , state and local governments , and foreign governments ( e.g . , usace manages the construction of multiple border barrier projects on a reimbursable basis for customs and border protection ) .
