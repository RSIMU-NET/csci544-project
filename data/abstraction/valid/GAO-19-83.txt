the oda provides incentives , including tax credits and exclusive marketing rights , for manufacturers to develop drugs to treat rare diseases , which are typically defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the united states . approximately 7,000 rare diseases affect an estimated 30 million people in the united states , and only 5 percent of rare diseases have fda - approved treatments . gao was asked to examine fda 's orphan drug processes . in this report , gao examines , among other things , the actions fda has taken to address the growing demand for orphan designations ; the extent to which fda has used consistent criteria and complete information in reviewing orphan designation applications ; and the steps fda has taken to address rare disease drug development challenges . gao analyzed fda documents and data , as well as all designation review templates fda completed as of march 2018 for applications received from october to december 2017. gao interviewed agency officials , as well as stakeholders , including drug manufacturers , industry experts , and patient advocacy groups . the food and drug administration 's ( fda ) office of orphan products development is responsible for reviewing drug manufacturer applications for orphan designation . drugs granted this designation treat rare diseases and may receive various incentives under the orphan drug act ( oda ) . as the number of orphan designation applications received and granted has grown , fda outlined several process changes in its june 2017 modernization plan to improve designation review timeliness and consistency . in evaluating designation applications , fda reviewers generally apply two consistent criteria — the size of the rare disease population , and the scientific rationale that the drug may effectively treat the disease . to inform their evaluation , reviewers must record certain background information in a standard review template , such as the drug 's u.s. marketing history . officials told us this information provides important context , such as whether fda has experience with a little known disease , critical to ensuring a complete designation application review . however , gao 's analysis of 148 designation review templates found that fda does not consistently record or evaluate background information when making designation decisions . for example , 48 of 148 review templates gao analyzed were missing information on the drug 's u.s. marketing history . as such , fda can not be sure that reviewers are conducting complete evaluations that include all critical information needed for assessing its criteria . stakeholders gao interviewed and research gao reviewed identified a number of rare disease drug development challenges , such as the difficulty in recruiting small populations for clinical trials , with differing opinions about the oda incentives . for example , several stakeholders were critical of manufacturers obtaining multiple orphan designations — and oda incentives — for the same drug when the drug may otherwise be profitable from treating multiple patient groups . however , many patient advocacy groups noted that granting oda incentives in these circumstances is needed to encourage drug manufacturers to study the safety and efficacy of drugs in rare disease populations . fda should ensure that all required information for reviews of orphan designation applications is consistently recorded and evaluated . the agency concurred with our recommendation .
