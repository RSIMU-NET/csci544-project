cuba has remained a hard - line communist state under fidel castro for more than 47 years , but fidel 's july 31 , 2006 announcement that he was ceding political power to his brother raúl for several weeks in order to recover from surgery could be the beginning of a political transition . over the past few years , there has been increased speculation about cuba 's future without fidel , who turned 80 on august 13 , 2006. while previous predictions about fidel 's imminent demise proved premature , his recent surgery and advanced age make the date of his permanent departure from the political scene all the closer . before his recent surgery , observers discerned several potential scenarios for cuba 's future after fidel . these fit into three broad categories : the continuation of a communist government ; a military government ; or a democratic transition or fully democratic government . according to most observers , the most likely scenario , at least in the short term , is a successor communist government led by raúl castro . this the most likely scenario for a variety of reasons , but especially because of raúl 's official designation as successor and his position as leader of the cuban military . for a number of years , the u.s. government has begun to plan for cuba without fidel at the helm . this has included examining transition issues and appointing a state department cuba transition coordinator . assistance has been provided — primarily through the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , but also through the department of state — to fund projects aimed at promoting a democratic transition in cuba . the bush administration established an inter - agency commission for assistance to a free cuba to help plan for cuba 's transition to democracy and to help cubans hasten the transition to democracy . some observers , however , have questioned the adequacy of the transition planning , in part because it does not recognize the likelihood of a successor communist government headed by fidel 's brother raúl . in the new context of fidel 's transfer of power , there are two broad policy approaches to contend with political change in cuba : a stay - the - course or status - quo approach that would maintain the u.s. dual - track policy of isolating the cuban government while providing support to the cuban people ; and an approach aimed at influencing the cuban government and cuban society through increased contact and engagement . some members support the administration 's stay - the - course policy approach through assistance to strengthen cuban civil society while maintaining u.s. economic sanctions . other members advocate a change in u.s. policy toward cuba in the direction of engagement , easing sanctions , or providing the president with flexibility to respond to change in cuba . this report will not be updated . it was written in the aftermath of fidel castro 's july 2006 announcement that he was temporarily stepping down from power , and provides analysis of potential future political scenarios for cuba after fidel castro and u.s. policy implications and approaches . for further information , see crs report rl33819 , cuba : issues for the 110th congress .
