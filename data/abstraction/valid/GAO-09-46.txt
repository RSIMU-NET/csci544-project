rising energy prices and concerns about the environment have fueled interest in `` green building '' -- resource - efficient construction and maintenance practices that reduce adverse impacts on the natural environment . the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , spends an estimated $ 5 billion on energy costs annually in its affordable housing programs and has recently taken steps to reduce its energy costs . gao was asked to review hud 's efforts to promote energy efficiency in its programs and the use of performance measures , potential costs and long - term benefits of green building in hud 's affordable housing programs , and lessons learned elsewhere that hud could use to promote green building . gao reviewed hud program documents and studies on green building , interviewed hud officials and industry representatives , and made site visits to locations that use green building practices . hud has taken steps to promote energy efficiency by providing information , training , and technical assistance , but its efforts have limitations . hud has also provided some financial incentives to promote green building , including energy efficiency , for public housing and for a small segment of the multifamily properties hud supports . additionally , hud has developed some performance measures to track the progress of its energy efficiency efforts . however , hud has not begun requiring energy - efficient products and appliances in its public housing properties , as required by statute . hud has also not implemented major energy efficiency updates to the building code for manufactured housing in more than a decade . without such requirements and updates , public housing authorities may be spending more on utility expenses than is necessary and manufacturers may lack an incentive to build energy - efficient manufactured homes . green building practices can increase up - front costs but may also provide long - term benefits , including financial , environmental , and health benefits . but the benefits in rental housing may not go to the party incurring the up - front costs , potentially discouraging the use of green building practices in a significant segment of affordable housing . hud has partnered with others to develop a utility benchmarking tool for identifying savings in public housing , but only for the public housing portfolio . utility benchmarking is often used to assess energy consumption and to help identify properties that could improve their energy efficiency . hud does not collect the data needed to understand its current utility costs or future savings possibilities in some parts of its multifamily housing portfolio . hud officials told gao that developing a utility benchmarking tool for this portfolio would be helpful but could be costly to hud and property owners . however , a 2003 study by harvard university -- and funded by hud -- found that collecting consumption data in insured privately owned multifamily housing would not be unreasonably burdensome . without such a tool , hud can not fully understand the utility costs for over 1.6 million units in its portfolio and may be missing opportunities to reduce utility expenses for some properties . hud has focused its attention on incentives that encourage energy efficiency but has few financial incentives , such as those used by states , to encourage other green building practices such as water conservation . many state and local governments have used financial incentives to promote the development of green affordable housing . for example , in the scoring systems for some competitive funding , applicants are awarded additional incentive points for energy and nonenergy green building practices . without financial incentives for nonenergy green building , hud is likely missing opportunities to make its affordable housing more resource efficient and environmentally friendly .
