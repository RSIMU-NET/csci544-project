flaws in software code can introduce vulnerabilities that may be exploited to cause significant damage to federal information systems . such risks continue to grow with the increasing speed , sophistication , and volume of reported attacks , as well as the decreasing period of the time from vulnerability announcement to attempted exploits . the process of applying software patches to fix flaws , referred to as patch management , is a critical process to help secure systems from attacks . the chairmen of the house committee on government reform and its subcommittee on technology , information policy , intergovernmental relations and the census requested that gao assess the reported status of 24 selected agencies in performing effective patch management practices , patch management tools and services available to federal agencies , challenges to performing patch management , and additional steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks created by software vulnerabilities . based on agency - reported data , agencies generally are implementing important common practices for effective patch management , such as performing systems inventories and providing information security training . however , they are not consistently performing others , such as risk assessments and testing all patches before deployment . additional information on key aspects of agencies ' patch management practices -- such as their documentation of patch management policies and procedures and the frequency with which systems are monitored to ensure that patches are installed -- could provide omb , congress , and agencies themselves with consistent data that could better enable an assessment of the effectiveness of an agency 's patch management processes . several automated tools and services are available to assist agencies in performing patch management . these tools and services typically include a wide range of functionality , including methods to inventory computers , identify relevant patches and workarounds , test patches , and report network status information to various levels of management . a centralized resource could provide agencies with selected services such as the testing of patches , a patch management training curriculum , and development of criteria for patch management tools and services . a governmentwide service could lower costs to -- and resource requirements of -- individual agencies , while facilitating their implementation of selected patch management practices . agencies face several challenges to implement effective patch management practices , including quickly installing patches while implementing effective patch management practices , patching heterogeneous systems , ensuring that mobile systems receive the latest patches , avoiding unacceptable downtime when patching high - availability systems , and dedicating sufficient resources toward patch management . agency officials and computer security experts identified a number of additional steps that can be taken by vendors , the security community , and the federal government to assist agencies in mitigating the risks created by software vulnerabilities . for example , more rigorous software engineering practices by software vendors could reduce the number of software vulnerabilities and the need for patches . in addition , the research and development of more capable technologies could help secure information systems against cyber attacks . also , the federal government could use its substantial purchasing power to influence software vendors to deliver more secure systems .
