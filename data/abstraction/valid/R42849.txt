iran has long been a source of concern for the united states and other countries because its goals are at odds with core u.s. objectives in the middle east . although it is not certain that iran has made the decision to develop a nuclear weapon , it is taking steps to drastically reduce the time needed to obtain nuclear weapons should a decision be made to do so . it is the prospect of an iranian nuclear weapon mated to an effective missile delivery capability that is especially worrisome to most . congress has long been interested in these matters . congress has held numerous hearings on iran , passed various resolutions regarding iran and approved a range of sanctions against iran over the past several decades . according to the u.s. government , iran has the largest number of ballistic missiles in the middle east ; it is developing missiles and space launch vehicles for multiple purposes . iran is pursuing its missile and space programs with development and testing facilities that are scattered throughout the country . assessing iran 's ballistic missile programs is challenging for many reasons , including the lack of specificity in official public sources , the secretive nature of iran 's regime and the regime 's frequent exaggerations of its ballistic missile capabilities , and the overwhelming amount of and often conflicting information found in non - official sources . the vast majority of iran 's heavy artillery rockets and ballistic missiles are short - range of less than about 500 kilometers . most of iran 's ballistic missiles in fact are scud - b and scud - cs , with a majority likely being scud cs , which are 500 km range capable . iran views its short - range ballistic missiles ( srbm ) capability as necessary for battlefield and tactical military purposes . these missiles could not strike u.s. or allied bases in the region unless they were moved far from their operating base and launched from vulnerable positions along iran 's persian gulf coastline . this is not likely because of logistical and operational security reasons . although these srbms are not very accurate , they could be fired against economic or civilian targets . also , any such missile attacks against u.s. bases , while not militarily decisive , could disrupt or complicate ( but not halt ) base operations . iran has grown increasingly self - sufficient in the production of srbms , but it still probably relies on others for some key components . gaining access to these kinds of critical components and materials has grown increasingly difficult for iran . stricter international enforcement of export controls and broadening sanctions have reportedly slowed down iran 's efforts and forced iran to find less reliable alternative sources of rocket and missile technology . iran is developing and producing medium - range ballistic missile ( mrbm ) capabilities with ranges estimated up to about 2,000 kilometers ( with some non - u.s. government sources citing slightly higher ranges ) , sufficient to strike targets throughout the middle east . u.s. intelligence assessments state such missiles are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear warhead . although the number of iran 's mrbms is thought to be relatively small by official u.s. estimates , it is expected to continue to build more capable mrbms . iran views these missiles as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against u.s. and other forces in the region in the event of war . iran has also constructed an underground network of bunkers and underground silo - like missile launch facilities , and is seeking improved air defenses presumably to enhance the survivability of their mrbms against preemptive attack . currently iran must rely on others for certain key missile components and materials in its mrbm program . export controls and sanctions have made it increasingly difficult , but certainly not impossible , for iran to acquire the best of such items . on the other hand , these export control measures and sanctions have forced iran to try to exploit weaknesses in existing export and nonproliferation regimes , including by trying to find foreign sellers willing to circumvent those laws . iran also has a genuine and ambitious space launch program , which seeks to enhance iran 's national pride , and perhaps more importantly , its international reputation as a growing advanced industrial power . iran also sees itself as a potential leader in the middle east offering space launch and satellite services . iran has stated it plans to use future launchers for placing intelligence gathering satellites into orbit , although such a capability is a decade or so in the future . many believe iran 's space launch program could mask the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) â€“ with ranges in excess of 5,500 km that could threaten targets throughout europe , and even the united states if iran achieved an icbm capability of at least 10,000 km . icbms share many similar technologies and processes inherent in a space launch program , but it seems clear that iran has a dedicated space launch effort and it is not simply a cover for icbm development . since 1999 , the u.s. intelligence community ( ic ) has assessed that iran could test an icbm by 2015 with sufficient foreign assistance , especially from a country such as china or russia ( whose support has reportedly diminished over the past decade ) . it is increasingly uncertain whether iran will be able to achieve an icbm capability by 2015 for several reasons : iran does not appear to be receiving the degree of foreign support many believe would be necessary , iran has found it increasingly difficult to acquire certain critical components and materials because of sanctions , and iran has not demonstrated the kind of flight test program many view as necessary to produce an icbm . this report will be updated regularly .
