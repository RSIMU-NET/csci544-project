federal agencies can provide additional compensation by using seven broadly available special payment authorities to recruit and retain employees to address needed skills . though special payments can help fill mission - critical skills gaps , agencies also face constrained budgets , which underscores the importance of cost - effective use of authorities . opm and the chco council play important roles in assuring effective federal human capital management . gao was asked to examine agency use , challenges , and improvements needed , if any . this report 1 ) describes chco agencies ' use of special payment authorities in fiscal years 2014-2016 ; 2 ) assesses to what extent chco agencies examined effectiveness ; and 3 ) evaluates how opm has helped agencies address recruitment and retention needs . gao obtained information from chco agencies on use of authorities through a questionnaire . gao also analyzed opm personnel data and agency documents , and interviewed agency officials . generally , federal agencies have seven broadly available government - wide special payment authorities to help address recruitment and retention challenges . chief human capital officer ( chco ) council agencies reported using these authorities to varying degrees but overall for few employees in fiscal years 2014-2016. for example , in fiscal year 2016 , less than 6 percent of the over 2 million chco agencies ' employees received compensation from at least one of the authorities ( see figure ) . the two most frequently used — special rates and retention incentives — were used for over 74,000 employees and over 13,000 employees , respectively , each year . the least - used — critical position pay — was used for as few as seven employees a year . chco agencies also reported using the range of authorities to help address skills gaps , particularly for science , technology , engineering , and mathematics occupations . chco agency employees receiving special payments , fiscal year 2016 chco agencies reported that these authorities had positive impacts — such as on - staff retention and applicant quality — but had few documented effectiveness assessments . nine of 10 agencies that reported having documented assessments provided them , but gao found that only 3 had information on effectiveness , such as its impact on meeting staffing needs . the office of personnel management ( opm ) collects agency data on use but has not tracked data to analyze how much authorities help agencies improve recruitment and retention government - wide . opm may be missing opportunities to promote strategic use by providing guidance and tools on assessing effectiveness . for example , opm has not explored reasons for trends in use of critical position pay or consistently shared best practices and innovative ways to use authorities . without tracking data and providing guidance to help agencies assess effectiveness , opm will be unable to determine whether use of special payment authorities helps agencies to improve recruitment and retention . gao is making three recommendations , including that opm should work with the chco council on tracking data and providing guidance and tools to assess effectiveness of authorities , among others . opm concurred or partially concurred with all recommendations , and described planned steps to implement them .
