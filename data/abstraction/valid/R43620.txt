the central american nation of panama has had five successive elected civilian governments since its return to democratic rule in 1989 , and a sixth is scheduled to assume power on july 1 , 2014 with the inauguration of current vice president juan carlos varela as president . hailing from the center - right paname√±ista party , varela won the may 4 , 2014 presidential election with 39 % of the vote in a three - candidate race . significantly , varela defeated the candidate of the ruling democratic change party of current president ricardo martinelli , who was constitutionally prohibited from running for reelection . elected in 2009 , martinelli remained generally popular during his presidency despite criticism at various junctures for his combative style of governing . nevertheless , his popularity ultimately was not enough to convince voters to support his party 's candidate . one controversy that emerged in the campaign was that martinelli 's wife became his party 's vice presidential candidate . this led to some critics complaining of an attempt by martinelli to extend his influence in the next government . panama 's largely services - based economy has been booming in recent years , spurred on by several large infrastructure projects , including , most significantly , the panama canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is expected to be completed in early 2016. a challenge for the varela government will be how to contend with slower economic growth rates as the canal expansion project winds down . another challenge for the government is making more headway in combating poverty and inequality in panama , which still remain relatively high . u.s. relations the united states has close relations with panama , stemming in large part from the extensive linkages developed when the panama canal was under u.s. control and panama hosted major u.s. military installations . relations have been strengthened by a bilateral free trade agreement that entered into force in october 2012. as noted by the state department , panama 's central location in the hemisphere , its transportation infrastructure ( most notably the canal ) , and its financial sector make it an important hub for global trade and a key u.s. strategic partner , but these same characteristics also make panama vulnerable to drug trafficking , money laundering , and organized criminal activity . since panama is relatively well developed economically compared to its central american neighbors , the united states provides just small amounts of bilateral assistance to panama . nevertheless , the country receives additional assistance through the central american regional security initiative ( carsi ) , a u.s. regional security program begun in fy2008 to help central american states reduce drug trafficking while advancing citizen security . panama 's anti - drug cooperation with the united states is strong . while the country has made progress in improving its anti - money laundering regime , there are several factors that hinder the country 's efforts to combat such activity . the panama canal expansion project , which will accommodate a new generation of massive container ships , is expected to reduce shipping rates between asia and the u.s. gulf and east coasts , resulting in increased canal transits and trade . a number of u.s. ports have begun readying themselves in order to take advantage of the expansion . this report provides background on the political and economic situation in panama and u.s. - panama relations . an appendix provides links to selected u.s. government reports on panama . for additional information , see crs report r41731 , central america regional security initiative : background and policy issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] . for further historical background , see the following two archived crs reports : crs report rl30981 , panama : political and economic conditions and u.s. relations through 2012 , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report rl32540 , the u.s. - panama free trade agreement .
