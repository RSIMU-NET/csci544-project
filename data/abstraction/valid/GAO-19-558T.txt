the tax gap — the difference between tax amounts that taxpayers should have paid and what they actually paid voluntarily and on time — has been a persistent problem for decades . the tax gap estimate is an aggregate estimate of the five types of taxes that irs administers — individual income , corporation income , employment , estate , and excise taxes . for each tax type , irs attempts to estimate the tax gap based on three types of noncompliance : underreporting of tax liabilities on timely filed tax returns ; underpayment of taxes due from timely filed returns ; and nonfiling , when a taxpayer fails to file a required tax return on time or altogether . this testimony discusses factors contributing to the tax gap and strategies to reduce it . this testimony is based on prior gao reports on the tax gap and enforcement of tax laws , including those with open recommendations or matters for congressional consideration that could help reduce the tax gap . enforcement of tax laws has been on gao 's high risk list since its inception in 1990 , and gao has made various recommendations to irs and suggestions to congress to reduce the tax gap that have resulted in improvements . for example , gao recommended that irs consider comparing individuals ' tax returns with the information educational institutions report to verify taxpayers ' education tax benefits claims and suggested that congress require brokers to report to both taxpayers and irs the adjusted cost of the securities sold by taxpayers . these actions resulted in billions of dollars in additional revenue . the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) latest tax gap estimate found that taxpayers voluntarily and timely paid about 81.7 percent of owed taxes for tax years 2008-2010 , leaving an annual gross tax gap of $ 458 billion . irs estimated a net tax gap — after late payments and enforcement actions — of $ 406 billion . gao 's work has found that three important factors contribute to the tax gap . limited third party information reporting . the extent to which individual taxpayers accurately report their income is closely aligned with whether third parties ( e.g . , employers ) report income ( e.g . , wages ) to them and to irs . irs resource tradeoffs . irs 's budget and staffing levels have fallen over the past decade , and irs faces increasing responsibilities , such as implementing public law 115-97 — commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act — which involved significant changes to tax law . tax code complexity . the federal tax system contains complex rules that may be necessary to appropriately target tax policy goals ; however , this can engender errors and lead to underpaid taxes . gao 's work has demonstrated that no single approach will fully and cost - effectively address noncompliance since the problem has multiple causes and spans different types of taxes and taxpayers . in light of these challenges , gao has made numerous recommendations to irs — some of which have not yet been implemented — such as developing and documenting a strategy that outlines how irs will use data to update compliance approaches to help address the tax gap . reducing the tax gap will also require targeted legislative actions . for example , expanding third - party information reporting could increase voluntary compliance and providing irs with the authority to regulate paid tax return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax returns they prepare .
