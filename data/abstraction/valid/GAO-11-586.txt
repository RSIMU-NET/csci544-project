the united states department of agriculture 's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) is responsible for administering billions of dollars annually in program benefits to farmers and ranchers . since 2004 , fsa has been planning to modernize its information technology ( it ) systems that process these benefits with the modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) program . gao was asked to determine the scope and status of midas , whether midas has appropriate program management , and whether midas has appropriate executive oversight and governance . to do so , gao reviewed relevant department guidance and program documents and interviewed usda officials . fsa plans to modernize the systems supporting its 37 farm programs with midas . the implementation cost estimate is approximately $ 305 million , with a life cycle cost of approximately $ 473 million . however , the implementation cost estimate is uncertain because it has not been updated since 2007 and does not include cost elements that have since been identified , such as the selection of a commercial enterprise resource planning product . following completion of its initial phase of program planning in october 2010 , midas entered its second of four phases -- proof of concept and system design . however , the schedule for this phase , which was to be completed in october 2011 , is now uncertain . while fsa officials report that the proof of concept activities are proceeding as scheduled , they have delayed a requirements review milestone until december 2011 and have not yet set a new date for the design review . as a result , the completion date for the second phase and its impact on subsequent phases is uncertain . fsa officials plan to revisit the cost and schedule estimates after completing requirements definition . fsa 's program management approach includes many leading practices , but could be strengthened . for example , prior to the proof of concept and system design phase , plans were in place for organizational change and communication , requirements management , and risk . however , a few practices were either partially addressed or not addressed at all in program plans or in the implementation of those plans . for example , an integrated team has not yet been formed with representatives from it programs that midas depends on for its success . moreover , the plans do not explicitly call for , and fsa has not produced , a schedule that reflects dependencies with those programs , and risks are not being regularly tracked as planned . fsa 's uneven adoption of leading practices is likely to limit the agency 's effectiveness in managing system development , and thus its ability to deliver system capabilities on time and within budget . executive - level governance for midas has not been clearly defined and does not fully follow department it investment management guidance . specifically , oversight and governance has been assigned to several department and agency bodies , but roles and escalation criteria are not clearly defined among them . department officials reported that department guidance is being followed for monthly status reviews , but not for department - level reviews at key decision points . the lack of clarity and definition for the roles of the governance bodies could result in duplication or voids in program oversight , as well as wasted resources . moreover , because midas is not being governed according to the department 's investment guidance , the department may not be rigorously monitoring and managing the program and its risks , and may not have the information it needs to make timely and appropriate decisions to ensure the success of midas . gao is recommending that usda update cost and schedule estimates , address management weaknesses in plans and program execution , and clarify the roles and coordination among governance bodies . usda agreed with gao 's recommendations and described plans to address them .
