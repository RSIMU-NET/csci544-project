the land and water conservation fund ( lwcf ) act of 1965 ( p.l . 88-578 ) created the lwcf in the treasury as a funding source to implement the outdoor recreation goals set out by the act . the lwcf act authorizes the fund to receive $ 900 million annually , with the monies available only if appropriated by congress ( i.e . , discretionary appropriations ) . the fund also receives mandatory appropriations under the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 ( gomesa ) . the level of annual appropriations for the lwcf has varied since the origin of the fund in fy1965 . the lwcf act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes . of the total made available through appropriations or deposits under gomesa , not less than 40 % is to be used for `` federal purposes '' and not less than 40 % is to be used to provide `` financial assistance to states . . the act lists the federal purposes for which the president is to allot lwcf funds `` unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation act making them available . . these purposes primarily relate to acquisition of lands and waters ( and interests therein ) by the federal government . with regard to state purposes , the act authorizes a matching grant program to states for outdoor recreation purposes . throughout the lwcf 's history , appropriations acts typically have provided funds for land acquisition and outdoor recreational grants to states . beginning in fy1998 , appropriations also have been provided each year ( except fy1999 ) to fund other purposes related to natural resources . the extent to which the lwcf should be used for purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states , and which other purposes should be funded from the lwcf , continue to be the subject of legislation and debate in congress . in the past few decades , presidents have sought lwcf funds for a variety of other purposes . congress chooses which if any of these requests to fund , and has chosen programs not sought by the president for a particular year . among other programs , appropriations have been provided for facility maintenance of the land management agencies , ecosystem restoration , the historic preservation fund , the payments in lieu of taxes program , the forest legacy program , state and tribal wildlife grants ( under the fish and wildlife service ) , the cooperative endangered species conservation fund , u.s. geological survey science and cooperative programs , and bureau of indian affairs indian land and water claim settlements . since fy1998 , a total of $ 2.7 billion has been appropriated for other purposes , of a total lwcf appropriation of $ 18.9 billion over the history of the fund . the fish and wildlife service and the forest service have received the largest shares of the total appropriations for other purposes , about $ 1.4 billion ( 53 % ) and $ 1.0.billion ( 38 % ) , respectively , from fy1998 to fy2019 . several agencies shared the remaining $ 0.2 billion ( 9 % ) of the appropriations . both the dollar amounts and the percentages of annual lwcf appropriations for other purposes have varied widely since fy1998 . the dollar amounts have ranged from $ 0 in fy1999 to $ 456.0 million in fy2001 . the percentage of annual funds provided for other purposes ranged from 0 % in fy1999 to a high of 59 % in both fy2006 and fy2007 . in some years , the appropriation for other purposes was significantly less than the administration requested . for instance , for fy2008 , the george w. bush administration sought $ 313.1 million ; the appropriation was $ 101.3 million . the appropriation for other purposes last exceeded $ 100.0 million in fy2010 , and most recently was $ 93.3 million , in fy2019 . prior to fy2008 , several other purposes typically were funded each year from lwcf . since fy2008 , funds have been appropriated annually only for grants under two programs : forest legacy and cooperative endangered species conservation fund . these two programs and a third grant program — state and tribal wildlife grants — have received more than three - quarters ( $ 2.1 billion , 79 % ) of the total appropriation for other purposes since fy1998 .
