pirate attacks in the waters off somalia and the horn of africa , including those on u.s. - flagged vessels , have brought renewed international attention to the long - standing problem of maritime piracy . according to the international maritime bureau ( imb ) , at least 219 attacks occurred in the region in 2010 , with 49 successful hijackings . somali pirates have attacked ships in the gulf of aden , along somalia 's eastern coastline , and outward into the indian ocean . using increasingly sophisticated tactics , these pirates now operate as far east as the maldives in good weather , and as far south as the mozambique channel . hostage taking for ransom has been a hallmark of somali piracy , and the imb reports that more hostages , over 1,180 , were taken at sea in 2010 than any year since records began ; over 86 % of those were taken by somali pirates . the increase in pirate attacks off the horn of africa is directly linked to continuing insecurity and the absence of the rule of law in war - torn somalia . the absence of a functioning central government there provides freedom of action for pirates and remains the single greatest challenge to regional security . the lack of law enforcement capacity creates a haven where pirates hold hostages during ransom negotiations that can last for months . some allege that the absence of somali coastal security authorities has allowed illegal international fishing and maritime dumping to go unchecked , which in turn has undermined coastal communities ' economic prospects , providing economic or political motivation to some pirates . the apparent motive of most pirate groups , however , is profit , and piracy has proven to be lucrative . somalia 's `` pirate economy '' has grown substantially in the past two years , with ransoms now averaging more than $ 5 million . these revenues may further exacerbate the ongoing conflict and undermine regional security . the annual cost of piracy to the global economy ranges from $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion , by some estimates . the u.n security council has issued a series of resolutions since 2008 to facilitate an international response , which is coordinated by a multilateral contact group . the council has authorized international navies to counter piracy both in somali territorial waters and ashore , with the consent of somalia 's transitional federal government ( tfg ) , and has also authorized , as an exemption to the u.n. arms embargo on somalia , support for the tfg security forces . counter - piracy patrols by multinational naval forces near somalia are intended to complement mariners ' self - protection measures . increased patrols and proactive efforts by ships have reduced attacks in the gulf of aden , but the u.n. secretary - general warns that `` while the effectiveness of naval disruption operations has increased and more pirates have been arrested and prosecuted , this has not stopped piracy . the trend of the increased levels of violence employed by the pirates as well as their expanding reach is disconcerting . . some suggest that a perception of impunity exists among pirates and financiers ; 9 out of 10 somali pirates apprehended by naval patrols are reportedly released because no jurisdiction is prepared to prosecute them . the united states has sought to prevent , disrupt , and prosecute somali piracy through a range of interagency and multilateral coordination and enforcement mechanisms . the obama administration has initiated a new `` dual track '' policy toward somalia , where some contend that international efforts to build a credible central authority have failed . congress has examined options to address piracy both diplomatically and militarily . congress appropriates funding and provides oversight for policy initiatives with implications for piracy in the region , including maritime security assistance to regional governments , support to peacekeeping operations in somalia , and funding for u.s. navy operations . congress continues to debate options for addressing pirate safe havens and improving the prospects for prosecution of pirate suspects .
