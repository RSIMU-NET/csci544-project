although the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property , intellectual property protection in parts of the world is inadequate . as a result , u.s. goods are subject to piracy and counterfeiting in many countries . a number of u.s. agencies are engaged in efforts to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . this testimony , based on a recent gao report , describes u.s agencies ' efforts , the mechanisms used to coordinate these efforts , and the impact of these efforts and the challenges they face . u.s. agencies undertake policy initiatives , training and assistance activities , and law enforcement actions in an effort to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . policy initiatives include assessing global intellectual property challenges and identifying countries with the most significant problems -- an annual interagency process known as the `` special 301 '' review -- and negotiating agreements that address intellectual property . in addition , many agencies engage in training and assistance activities , such as providing training for foreign officials . finally , a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions , such as criminal investigations involving foreign parties and seizures of counterfeit merchandise . agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts , although the mechanisms ' usefulness varies . formal interagency meetings -- part of the u.s. government 's annual special 301 review -- allow agencies to discuss intellectual property policy concerns and are seen by government and industry sources as rigorous and effective . however , the national intellectual property law enforcement coordination council , established to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement , has struggled to find a clear mission , has undertaken few activities , and is generally viewed as having little impact . u.s. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas , but enforcement in many countries remains weak , and further u.s. efforts face significant challenges . for example , competing u.s. policy objectives take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions . further , other countries ' domestic policy objectives can affect their `` political will '' to address u.s. concerns . finally , many economic factors , as well as the involvement of organized crime , hinder u.s. and foreign governments ' efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property abroad .
