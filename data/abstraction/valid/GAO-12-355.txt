gao has long expressed concern that increases in medicare spending are unsustainable and do not necessarily enhance health care quality . traditional medicare provider payment systems reward the volume of services instead of the quality or efficiency of care by paying physicians for each service provided . some health systems , which can be hospitals , physicians , health plans , or a combination , use financial incentive programs to reward physicians for improving quality and efficiency with the goal of better outcomes for patients and savings for hospitals and payers . federal laws that protect patients and the integrity of federal programs , including medicare , limit health systems ability to implement financial incentive programs . these fraud and abuse laws include the physician self - referral law , or stark law ; the anti - kickback statute ; and the civil monetary penalties ( cmp ) law . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and the office of inspector general ( oig ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of justice oversee and enforce these laws . gao examined how federal fraud and abuse laws affect the implementation of financial incentive programs , stakeholders perspectives on their ability to implement these programs , and alternative approaches through which hhs has approved implementation of these programs . gao analyzed relevant laws and agency guidance and documentation ; and interviewed agency officials , legal experts , and provider stakeholders . certain financial incentive programs are permitted within the framework of federal fraud and abuse laws , but stakeholders gao spoke with reported that the laws , regulations , and agency guidance have created challenges for program design and implementation . the stark law and anti - kickback statute , which restrict financial relationships among providers , have statutory and regulatory exceptions and safe harbors , respectively , that permit financial incentive programs that meet specific criteria . however , there are no exceptions or safe harbors specifically for financial incentive programs intended to improve quality and efficiency , and legal experts reported that the constraints of existing exceptions and safe harbors make it difficult to design and implement a comprehensive program for all participating physicians and patient populations . the cmp law prohibits hospitals from paying physicians to reduce or limit services , and oig has interpreted the law to apply to the reduction or limitation of any services , whether or not those services are medically necessary . the cmp law does not include statutory exceptions to this prohibition , and oig does not have the authority to create exceptions through regulation . through its advisory opinion process , oig , however , has indicated that it would not impose sanctions for specific financial incentive programs that otherwise violated the cmp law but presented a low risk of fraud and abuse . legal experts stated that innovative arrangements are difficult to structure and that the advisory opinion process is burdensome . through alternative approaches , hhs has approved implementation of otherwise prohibited financial incentive programs that incorporate safeguards , under its statutory authority to conduct demonstrations and other initiatives . specifically , cms has conducted demonstration projects to test financial incentive programs that reward quality and efficiency . these demonstration projects included safeguards , such as linking payments to quality measures , to protect program and patient integrity . cms has incorporated safeguards into the medicare shared savings program , which allows eligible providers to participate as accountable care organizations to share savings with the medicare program . as specifically authorized for the medicare shared savings program , cms and oig will waive fraud and abuse laws for , among other things , the distribution of shared savings in the medicare shared savings program , subject to certain requirements . the center for medicare and medicaid innovation within cms is also implementing programs to test financial incentives . gaos work suggests that stakeholders concerns may hinder implementation of financial incentive programs to improve quality and efficiency on a broad scale . stakeholdersgovernment agencies and health care providerslikely will continue to have different perspectives about the optimal balance between innovative approaches to improve quality and lower costs and retaining appropriate patient safeguards . hhs reviewed a draft of this report and in its written comments , clarified its position on cmss authorities to create exceptions and issue waivers to permit certain financial incentive programs , noting that its authority to issue waivers is broader than its authority to create stark exceptions . we modified the draft to reflect the departments position .
