since the 1998 east africa bombings , u.s. diplomatic personnel working overseas have faced increasing threats to their safety and security . state has built many new embassies and consulates since 1998 and enhanced security measures at others . increased security at such facilities has raised concerns that residences , schools , and other places where u.s. diplomatic personnel and their families congregate may be viewed by terrorists as more attractive “ soft targets. ” gao was asked to review the security of residences and other soft targets overseas . gao evaluated how state assesses risks to u.s. diplomatic residences overseas ; the timeliness , clarity , and consistency of residential security standards ; how state addresses security vulnerabilities at residences ; and how state manages risks to other soft targets . gao reviewed agency documents ; met with officials in washington , d.c. ; and conducted fieldwork at a judgmental sample of seven higher - threat , higher - risk posts in four of state 's six geographic regions . this is the public version of a sensitive but unclassified report issued in june 2015. the department of state ( state ) conducts a range of activities to assess risks to residences overseas . for instance , state tracks information on overseas residences in its property database , establishes threat levels at overseas posts , develops security standards for different types of residences and threat levels , and requires posts to periodically conduct residential security surveys . however , 17 of the 68 surveys for residences gao reviewed were untimely or missing . without up - to - date security surveys of all its overseas residences , state 's ability to identify and address vulnerabilities or make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for security upgrades is limited . state has taken steps to update its residential security standards ; however , these updates have not been timely , and the standards are difficult to use . according to state officials , updating residential security standards should take about 75 days , but all three updates since 2005 took more than 3 years each . state is making efforts to improve the timeliness of such updates in response to a prior gao recommendation . in addition , while federal internal control standards state that policy standards should be clear and consistent to support good decision making , state 's standards and other security - related guidance for residences have gaps and inconsistencies , complicating posts ' efforts to determine and apply the appropriate security measures and potentially leaving some residences at risk . state addresses security vulnerabilities at residences by installing various upgrades intended to help residences meet security standards , but 38 of the 68 residences gao reviewed did not meet all applicable standards . for example , 8 residences did not meet the standards for perimeter barriers . when residences do not and can not meet all applicable security standards , posts are required to request exceptions , which identify steps the posts will take to mitigate vulnerabilities . however , state had an exception on file for only 1 of the 38 residences that did not meet all applicable standards . as a result , state lacks key information that could provide it with a clearer picture of security vulnerabilities at residences and enable it to make better risk management decisions . state manages risks to schools and other soft targets overseas in several ways , but its efforts may be constrained by limited awareness of relevant guidance and tools . in fiscal years 2010 through 2015 , state awarded almost 400 grants in total for security upgrades at schools and other soft targets . while federal internal control standards call for timely communication of relevant information to staff responsible for program objectives , officials at most of the posts gao visited were unaware of some guidance and tools for securing schools and other soft targets . as a result , state may not be fully leveraging existing programs and resources for addressing security needs at these facilities . gao recommends that state , among other things , institute procedures to ensure residential security surveys are completed as required , clarify its standards and security - related guidance for residences , develop procedures to ensure residences either meet standards or have exceptions on file , and take steps to ensure posts are aware of existing guidance and tools regarding the security of schools and other soft targets . state concurred with all of gao 's recommendations .
