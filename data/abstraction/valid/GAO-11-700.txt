cyclone nargis hit burma 's impoverished irrawaddy delta on may 2 , 2008 , leaving nearly 140,000 people dead or missing and severely affecting about 2.4 million others , according to the un . the burmese military government initially blocked most access to the affected region ; however , amid international pressure , it slowly began allowing international aid workers entry into the region . since 1997 , the united states has imposed sanctions to prohibit , among other things , the exportation of financial services to burma and transactions with burmese officials . in response to a congressional mandate , gao described the assistance un and u.s. agencies have provided in response to cyclone nargis , assessed usaid actions to help ensure funds are used as intended and do not benefit sanctioned entities , and described the challenges responders experienced and the lessons learned . gao reviewed financial and program documents ; interviewed u.s. , un , and nongovernmental organization ( ngo ) officials ; and traveled to thailand and burma . un and u.s. agencies provided about $ 335 million for emergency response and recovery activities after cyclone nargis . of that total , 11 un agencies obligated roughly $ 288 million for assistance in various sectors , including food , health , water and sanitation , and agriculture . the u.s. government provided about $ 38 million of the un 's total as part of its roughly $ 85 million in obligations for emergency response and longer - term recovery activities . of the $ 85 million u.s. response , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , which led u.s. efforts , obligated about $ 72 million . the department of defense obligated about $ 13 million to procure and deliver emergency relief supplies . usaid took actions to help ensure u.s. funds were used as intended and did not benefit sanctioned entities , but had some monitoring weaknesses . usaid took actions prior to the delivery of assistance , including selecting partners experienced in working with usaid and in burma and providing extra guidance to help ensure funds were not misused . to monitor assistance , usaid has conducted some site visits . however , usaid 's monitoring contains little financial oversight and we found that two grantees charged usaid for unapproved international travel . also , in some cases site visits were not sufficiently documented . usaid relies on external audits of grantees , but relevant usaid staff were not aware of audit findings related to one grantee 's cash payments to villagers in burma . the grantee subsequently addressed the audit findings . lastly , u.s. and un agencies said they examined reports of misuse of assistance in their programs and found no evidence that assistance had been misused . gao 's review of 16 after - action reports from donors , ngos , and un agencies , showed that those responding to cyclone nargis experienced similar challenges and developed lessons learned in four main areas : access , coordination , implementation , and limited in - country disaster response capacity . responders found it difficult to reach affected areas because the burmese government limited their travel and the infrastructure was poor . responders also had difficulty coordinating between headquarters and field offices for several reasons , including limited telecommunication services . a u.s. report highlighted coordination challenges amongst u.s. agencies , stating that agencies ' conflicting agendas resulted in difficulties related to the appropriateness , timing , procurement , and distribution of aid . implementation challenges include supplies that were incompatible with local conditions , such as medicines with instructions printed in non - burmese languages and difficulties monitoring aid . capacity challenges included a lack of experienced disaster specialists in burma , which resulted in nonqualified individuals being placed in positions out of necessity . to address some of these challenges , reports suggested that organizations increase support staff and use the same reporting systems . other reports prioritized involving local communities in decision making and improving emergency preparedness and local response capacity . gao recommends that the administrator of usaid take four actions to improve the management of grants related to burma , including enhancing financial monitoring and reinforcing the requirement to document site visits , and review the questionable costs for international travel gao identified . usaid concurred with gao 's recommendations .
