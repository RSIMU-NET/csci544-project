central america faces significant security challenges . criminal threats , fragile political and judicial systems , and social hardships such as poverty and unemployment contribute to widespread insecurity in the region . consequently , improving security conditions in these countries is a difficult , multifaceted endeavor . since u.s. drug demand contributes to regional security challenges and the consequences of citizen insecurity in central america are potentially far - reaching — as demonstrated by the increasing number of migrants , asylum seekers , and refugees arriving at the u.s. border — the united states is collaborating with countries in the region to implement and refine security efforts . criminal threats well - financed drug trafficking organizations , gangs , smugglers , and other criminal groups are threating citizen security and the rule of law in central america . the isthmus has become a major transshipment point for illicit drugs as counternarcotics efforts in colombia and mexico have disrupted other trafficking routes to the united states . at the same time , clashes between street gangs have paralyzed cities and intensified violence . several central american countries now have homicide rates that are among the highest in the world . the resulting desperation has created opportunities for smugglers and traffickers to prey on central americans attempting to travel , or to send their children , to the united states . social and political factors throughout central america , underlying social conditions and structural weaknesses in governance inhibit efforts to improve security . persistent poverty , inequality , and unemployment leave large portions of the population susceptible to crime . given the limited opportunities other than emigration available to the expanding youth populations in central america , young people are particularly vulnerable . the failure to fully implement post - conflict institutional reforms that were initiated in several countries in the 1990s has left police , prisons , and judicial systems weak and susceptible to corruption . recent scandals that have led to the resignations of the president of guatemala and senior officials in honduras demonstrate the extent to which criminality has infiltrated state institutions . central american security policies central american governments have attempted to improve security conditions in a variety of ways . the honduran government has taken a hardline approach to crime , deploying military forces to carry out policing functions . the salvadoran government is pursuing similar policies after the truce it brokered between criminal gangs broke down . the guatemalan government has also embraced a larger role for the military in public security while simultaneously working with the u.n. - backed international commission against impunity in guatemala ( cicig ) to strengthen its investigative and prosecutorial capacities and root out corruption . other central american governments have emphasized modern policing strategies and prevention activities , such as programs that focus on strengthening families of at - risk youth . recognizing the transnational nature of the threats they face , central american governments have also sought to improve regional security cooperation . u.s. assistance since fy2008 , the u.s. government has supported security efforts in central america through the central america regional security initiative ( carsi ) . the initiative provides the seven nations of the isthmus with equipment , training , and technical assistance to support immediate law enforcement operations . carsi is also designed to strengthen the long - term capacities of central american governments to address security challenges and the underlying social and political factors that contribute to them . since fy2008 , congress has appropriated nearly $ 1.2 billion for central america through carsi . as of the end of fy2015 , $ 457 million of the funds allocated to carsi had been expended . the obama administration requested $ 286.5 million for carsi in fy2016 as part of a broader $ 1 billion request to support a new `` u.s. strategy for engagement in central america . . although the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 ( h.r . 2029 ) would not fully fund the administration 's request for central america , it would provide $ 750 million for the region , including $ 348.5 million for carsi . the bill would also place a number of conditions on the assistance , requiring governments in the region to take steps to improve border security , combat corruption , increase revenues , and address human rights concerns , among other actions .
