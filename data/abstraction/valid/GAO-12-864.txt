about 9 million of medicare 's over 48 million beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid because they meet income and other criteria . these dual - eligible beneficiaries have greater health care challenges than other medicare beneficiaries , increasing their need for care coordination across the two programs . in addition to meeting all the requirements of other ma plans , d - snps are required by cms to provide specialized services targeted to the needs of dual - eligible beneficiaries as well as integrate benefits or coordinate care with medicaid services . gao was asked to examine d - snps ' specialized services to dual - eligible beneficiaries . gao analyzed the characteristics of dual - eligible beneficiaries in d - snps and other ma plans , reviewed differences in specialized services between d - snps and other ma plans , and reviewed how d - snps work with state medicaid agencies to enhance benefit integration and care coordination . gao analyzed cms enrollment , plan benefit package , projected revenue , and beneficiary health status data ; reviewed 15 d - snp models of care and 2012 contracts with states ; and interviewed representatives from 15 d - snps and medicaid agency officials in 5 states . about 9 percent of the dual - eligible population is enrolled in 322 medicare dual - eligible special needs plans ( d - snp ) , a type of medicare advantage ( ma ) plan . all dual - eligible beneficiaries are low income , but those in d - snps tended to have somewhat different demographic characteristics relative to those dual - eligible beneficiaries in other ma plans . on the basis of the most current data available ( 2010-2011 ) , compared to those in other ma plans , dual - eligible beneficiaries in d - snps were more frequently under age 65 and disabled , more likely to be eligible for full medicaid benefits , and more frequently diagnosed with a chronic or disabling mental health condition . in spite of these differences , the health status of d - snp enrollees as measured by their expected cost to medicare was similar to the health status of dual - eligible enrollees in other ma plans in 2010. d - snps provide fewer supplemental benefits -- benefits not covered by medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) -- on average , than other ma plans . of the 10 supplemental benefits offered by more than half of d - snps , 7 were offered more frequently by other ma plans and 3 were offered more frequently by d - snps . yet d - snps spent proportionately more of their rebate -- additional medicare payments received by many plans -- to fund supplemental benefits compared to other ma plans , and less to reduce medicare cost - sharing , which is generally covered by medicaid . the models of care gao reviewed , of 107 submitted for 2012 , described in varying detail how the d - snp planned to provide specialized services , such as health risk assessments , and meet other requirements , such as measuring performance . however , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , which administers medicare and oversees medicaid , did not require d - snps to use standardized measures in the models of care , which would make it possible to compare the performance of d - snps . while d - snps are not required to report that information to cms , such information would be useful for future evaluations of whether d - snps met their intended results , as well as for comparing d - snps . cms stated that contracts between d - snps and state medicaid agencies are an opportunity to increase benefit integration and care coordination . our review of the contracts indicated only about one - third of the 2012 contracts contained any provisions for benefit integration , and only about one - fifth provided for active care coordination between d - snps and medicaid agencies , which indicates that most care coordination was done exclusively by d - snps , without any involvement of state medicaid agencies . however , some d - snp contracts with state medicaid agencies specified that the agencies would pay the d - snps to provide all or some medicaid benefits . representatives from the d - snps and medicaid officials from the states gao interviewed expressed concerns about the contracting process , such as limited state resources for developing and overseeing contracts , as well as uncertainty about whether congress will extend d - snps as a type of ma plan after 2013 , and the implementation of other initiatives to coordinate medicare and medicaid benefits for dual - eligible beneficiaries that could replace d - snps . to increase d - snps ' accountability , gao recommends improving d - snp reporting of services provided to dual - eligible beneficiaries and making this information available to the public . in its comments on a draft of gao 's report , cms generally agreed with our recommendations .
