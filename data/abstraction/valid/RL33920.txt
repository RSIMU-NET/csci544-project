funding authorization for aviation programs set forth in vision 100 â€” century of aviation reauthorization act ( p.l . 108-176 ) and authorization for taxes and fees that provide revenue for the aviation trust fund expired at the end of fy2007 . while federal aviation administration ( faa ) reauthorization legislation was considered during the 110th congress , the only related legislation enacted consisted of several short term extensions for aviation trust fund revenue collections and aviation program authority . the federal aviation administration extension act , part ii ( p.l . 110-330 ) extends these authorizations until march 31 , 2009 , thus carrying the issue of faa reauthorization over to the 111th congress . consideration of faa reauthorization during the 110th congress began with the introduction of the faa 's reauthorization proposal , entitled the next generation air transportation system financing reform act of 2007 ( h.r . 1356 / s . 1076 , introduced by request ) , which recommends a new system for financing aviation system costs through direct user fees and increased fuel taxes . the faa proposal would also allow airports to increase passenger facility charges ( pfc ) , and includes initiatives to simplify the apportionment of airport grants . the proposal also seeks to better integrate development of the next generation air transportation system ( ngats ) into ongoing planning and acquisition activities , and would allow airport and private investment in certain aviation facilities and services . the faa proposal would authorize funding for research on aviation noise , air emissions , and water quality impacts , and seeks to modify the essential air service program ( eas ) . the aviation investment and modernization act of 2007 ( s. 1300 ; s.rept . 110-144 ) proposes a four - year authorization with modest overall budget increases and larger increases specifically for facilities and equipment ( f & e ) modernization . s. 1300 proposes a $ 25 surcharge for certain flights and retention of existing taxes and fees . s. 1300 would establish a modernization oversight board and would set up offices at each federal agency supporting ngats for defining agency resources and budgetary commitments to air traffic modernization . s. 2345 , introduced by the senate finance committee , may be considered as the revenue title of the overall bill , and modifies certain aviation taxes and fees as a possible alternative to the $ 25 surcharge proposal . the faa reauthorization act of 2007 ( h.r . 2881 ) seeks higher spending authorizations for f & e compared to s. 1300. while the bill does not propose any direct user - fee mechanisms , it proposes modest increases to existing aviation fuel taxes . the overall legislation also seeks to increase accountability and coordination of ngats planning and implementation . an amendment agreed to would create a binding arbitration process to resolve labor negotiations impasses , and would apply this process to settle the current impasse between the faa and air traffic controllers . this report will not be updated .
