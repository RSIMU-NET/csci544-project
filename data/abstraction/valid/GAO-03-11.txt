in recent years , local school districts and traditional public schools have taken various initiatives to improve failing schools . school districts and charter schools are increasingly contracting with private , for - profit companies to provide a range of education and management services to schools . in the district of columbia , some public schools contract with three such companies : edison schools , mosaica education , and chancellor beacon academies . these three companies have programs that consist of both management services , such as personnel , and educational services , which they offer to schools across the nation ; in the district , most of the schools managed by these companies have either adopted selected elements of their companies ' programs or chosen other educational programs . each company provides services such as curriculum , assessments , parental involvement opportunities , and student and family support . little is known about the effectiveness of these companies ' programs on student achievement , parental satisfaction , parental involvement , or school climate because few rigorous studies have been conducted . although the companies publish year - to - year comparisons of standardized test scores to indicate that students in schools they manage are making academic gains , they do not present data on comparable students who are not in their programs , a necessary component of a program effectiveness study .
