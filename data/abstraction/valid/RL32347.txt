earth penetrator weapons , often called `` bunker busters , '' burrow into the ground some tensof feet before detonating , greatly increasing their ability to destroy buried targets . the united stateshas several types of conventional earth penetrators . the current u.s. nuclear earth penetrator , theb61-11 bomb , can not penetrate certain types of terrain in which hardened underground facilities maybe located , so the air force and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) are studyinga more effective penetrator , the robust nuclear earth penetrator ( rnep ) . while secretary of defense rumsfeld said in 2003 that rnep was a study , nnsa 's fy2005budget document showed a five - year total of $ 484.7 million if rnep were to proceed beyond thestudy phase . nnsa said no decision had been made to proceed , and out - year figures were shownto meet congressionally - mandated budgeting requirements and were not a request . rnep requestsare , of course , subject to congressional approval , rejection , or modification . the five - year figuresparked congressional debate . the fy2005 national defense authorization act contained the fullrnep request , $ 27.6 million . the house and senate both rejected amendments to that bill thatwould have eliminated rnep funds . however , p.l . 108-447 , the fy2005 consolidatedappropriations act , appropriated no funds for rnep . as a result , nnsa could not work on rnepin fy2005 . the fy2006 rnep request was $ 4.0 million for nnsa for studies , and $ 4.5 million for thedepartment of defense ( dod ) to study integrating rnep onto the b - 2 bomber . the house passedthe fy2006 energy and water development appropriations bill , h.r . 2419 , with nonnsa rnep funds . the house passed the fy2006 national defense authorization bill , h.r . 1815 , providing the requested dod funds and transferring the nnsa funds todod . the house appropriations committee 's mark of h.r . 2863 , the fy2006 dodappropriations bill , provided $ 4.0 million for a conventional ( nonnuclear ) penetrator study . committee staff indicated that the bill included the $ 4.5 million for dod , and that the committee'sintent was that dod use the money to study integration of a conventional penetrator onto the b - 2 . the bill as passed by the house retained these provisions . the senate armed services committee'smark of s. 1042 , the fy2006 national defense authorization bill , recommendedproviding the nnsa funds as requested but denying the dod funds on grounds that the dodprogram should await completion of nnsa 's feasibility study . the senate provided $ 4.0 millionfor nnsa for rnep in h.r . 2419 , rejecting an amendment by senator feinstein to deletethe funds . the senate appropriations committee 's mark of h.r . 2863 recommendedeliminating dod funds requested for rnep . on october 25 , senator domenici said that nnsa haddropped its rnep request and planned to focus earth penetration on conventional weaponstechnology , so , he said , energy and water conferees agreed to drop funding for rnep . h.r.1815 as signed into law ( p.l . 109-360 ) provided no funds for rnep , but $ 4.0 million fordod for a conventional penetrator study . for fy2007 , nnsa requested no funds for rnep , and has closed out the project . accordingly , this report will not be updated further .
