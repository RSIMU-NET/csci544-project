health care reform is at the top of the domestic policy agenda for the 111th congress , driven by concerns about the growing ranks of the uninsured and the unsustainable growth in spending on health care and health insurance . but efforts to improve access to care and control rising health care costs also will require changes to the health care delivery system . experts point to a growing body of evidence of the health care system 's failure to consistently provide high - quality care to all americans . major challenges to the delivery of high - quality care include improving patient safety by eliminating medical errors , eradicating disparities in care , reducing the burden of chronic disease , and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care that compromises quality , drives up costs , and neglects the needs of patients . the health reform debate has embraced a number of proposals to address these challenges and improve the delivery of health care services . they include initiatives to encourage individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles , and to change the way that physicians and other providers treat and manage disease . delivery reform proposals focus on expanding the primary care workforce , encouraging the use of clinical preventive services , and strengthening the role of chronic care management . however , health care delivery reform can not happen unless mechanisms are in place to drive change in the systems of care . key drivers include performance measurement and the public dissemination of performance information , comparative effectiveness research , adoption of health information technology , and , most importantly , the alignment of payment incentives with high - quality care . congress took an important first step toward reforming the health care delivery system when it enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) in february 2009. arra included $ 1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research and established an interagency advisory panel to help coordinate and support the research . it also incorporated the health information technology for economic and clinical health ( hitech ) act , which is intended to promote the widespread adoption of health information technology ( hit ) for the electronic sharing of clinical data among hospitals , physicians , and other health care stakeholders . the health reform legislation ( h.r . 3200 ) introduced in the house and approved by the committees on ways and means , energy and commerce , and education and labor includes numerous provisions intended to increase the primary care and public health workforce , promote preventive services , and strengthen quality measurement , among other things . h.r . 3200 would amend and expand on many of the existing health workforce programs authorized under title vii ( health professions ) and title viii ( nursing ) of the public health service act ( phsa ) . it would create a public health workforce corps and establish a new loan repayment program , modeled on the national health service corps ( nhsc ) , for individuals who agree to practice in medically underserved areas with unmet health care needs . the house bill also would make a number of changes to the medicare graduate medical education ( gme ) program , which subsidizes medical residency programs , in part to encourage the training of more primary care physicians . in addition , h.r . 3200 would bolster quality improvement activities , including performance measurement , and broaden medicare and medicaid coverage of clinical preventive services . the legislation would establish a multi - billion dollar public health investment fund to provide additional funding for these and other new programs and activities .
