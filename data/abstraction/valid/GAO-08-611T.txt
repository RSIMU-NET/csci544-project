because advisory committees provide input to federal decision makers on significant national issues , it is essential that their membership be , and be perceived as being , free from conflicts of interest and balanced as a whole . the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) was enacted in 1972 , in part , because of concerns that special interests had too much influence over federal agency decision makers . the general services administration ( gsa ) develops guidance on establishing and managing faca committees . the office of government ethics ( oge ) develops regulations and guidance for statutory conflict - of - interest provisions that apply to some advisory committee members . as requested , this testimony discusses key findings and conclusions in our 2004 report , federal advisory committees : additional guidance could help agencies better ensure independence and balance ; gao 's recommendations to gsa and oge and their responses ; and potential changes to faca that could better ensure the independence and balance of advisory committees . for our 2004 work , we reviewed policies and procedures issued by gsa , oge , and nine federal agencies that sponsor many committees . for this testimony , we obtained information from gsa and oge on actions they have taken to implement our recommendations ; we also reviewed data in gsa 's faca data base on advisory committee appointments . in 2004 , gao concluded that additional governmentwide guidance could help agencies better ensure the independence of federal advisory committee members and the balance of federal advisory committees . for example , oge guidance to federal agencies did not adequately ensure that agencies appoint individuals selected to provide advice on behalf of the government as `` special government employees '' subject to conflict - of - interest regulations . further , gao found that some agencies were inappropriately appointing most or all members as `` representatives '' -- expected to reflect the views of the entity or group they are representing and not subject to conflict - of - interest reviews -- even when the agencies call upon the members to provide advice on behalf of the government and thus should have been appointed as special government employees . in addition , gsa guidance to federal agencies and agency - specific policies and procedures needed to be improved to better ensure that agencies collect and evaluate information , such as previous or ongoing research , that could be helpful in determining the viewpoints of potential committee members regarding the subject matters being considered and in ensuring that committees are , and are perceived as being , balanced . gao also identified several promising practices for forming and managing federal advisory committees that could better ensure that committees are independent and balanced as a whole , such as providing information on how the members of the committee are identified and screened and indicating whether the committee members are providing independent or stakeholder advice . to help improve the effectiveness of federal advisory committees so that members are , and are perceived as being , independent and committees as a whole are properly balanced , gao made 12 recommendations to gsa and oge to provide additional guidance to federal agencies under three broad categories : the appropriate use of representative appointments ; information that could help ensure committees are , in fact , and in perception , balanced ; and practices that could better ensure independence and balanced committees and increase transparency in the federal advisory process . gsa and oge implemented our recommendations to clarify the use of representative appointments . however , current data on appointments indicate that some agencies may continue to inappropriately use representatives rather than special government employees on some committees . further , gsa said it agrees with gao 's other recommendations , including those relating to committee balance and measures that would promote greater transparency in the federal advisory committee process , but has not issued guidance in these areas as recommended , because of limitations in its authority to require agencies to comply with its guidance . in light of indications that some agencies may continue to use representative appointments inappropriately and gsa 's support for including gao 's 2004 recommendations in faca -- including those aimed at enhancing balance and transparency -- the subcommittee may wish to incorporate the substance of gao 's recommendations into faca as it considers amendments to the act .
