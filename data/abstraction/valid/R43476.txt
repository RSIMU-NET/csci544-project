until recently , the economy and labor market were experiencing an unusually slow recovery from the longest and deepest recession since the great depression compared to other expansions since world war ii . the rapid decline in the unemployment rate from 7.9 % in january to 6.7 % in december 2013 ( where it remained in the first quarter of 2014 ) would seem to indicate that the labor market is returning to normal . the current unemployment rate is only 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points higher than the consensus range of full employment . unusually , the unemployment rate may not currently be a good proxy for the overall state of the labor market or economy . some of the decline in the unemployment rate in 2013 is attributable to a recovery in employment , but some is attributable to workers dropping out of the labor force . the labor force participation rate has continued to fall during the recovery and is at its lowest level since the 1970s . in fact , it has fallen more in the past five years than at any time since data have been collected . studies have identified multiple reasons for the decline . some workers have left the labor force because they have become discouraged and given up on seeking employment . others have left for reasons stemming from long - term trends that are unrelated to the recession , such as age or enrollment in school or training . this trend could reverse — for example , more workers returned to the labor force than found jobs in the first quarter of 2014 , which prevented the unemployment rate from falling . other evidence also points to more slack in the economy than the headline unemployment rate suggests . economic output and employment have grown since mid - 2009 and 2010 , respectively , but at relatively sluggish rates . the long - term unemployment rate and youth unemployment rates have fallen only modestly since the recession ended and are still at historically high levels . inflation has remained slightly lower than the federal reserve 's ( fed 's ) goal of 2 % . these other economic indicators could be sending a misleading signal about significant slack in the economy , however , if the economy 's potential capacity has been eroded by structural changes or by the length and depth of the great recession . cyclical deterioration in the u.s. labor market is usually considered temporary — recessions are thought to have no lasting effect on overall employment and unemployment rates . this recession could cause a departure from conventional wisdom if labor market problems that started as cyclical persisted so long that they became structural . for example , long - term unemployment could have caused workers ' skills to erode , which would then prevent them from finding a job when the economy recovered . congress conducts fiscal policy and oversees the fed 's implementation of monetary policy , the two tools of macroeconomic stabilization . policy makers are grappling with the transition from the highly expansionary monetary and fiscal policy put in place during the great recession . many economists advocate reducing the budget deficit only when the economy is at or near full employment . likewise , the fed has stated that it would begin to raise interest rates once the economy is near full employment . if the economy remains far from full employment , then declining unemployment would not yet call for a tightening of monetary and fiscal policy . alternatively , if lower unemployment is being driven by a cyclical upswing and the economy is now closer to full employment than historical experience would predict , policy would likely need to be tightened sooner in order to avoid rising inflation . it would also suggest that structural policies ( e.g . , those that increase the incentives to hire , seek work , delay retirement , or train ) would be more effective at improving labor market conditions than counter - cyclical monetary and fiscal policies .
