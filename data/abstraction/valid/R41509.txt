the bureau of land management ( blm ) conducts land exchanges with other land owners to acquire and dispose of land . the agency is authorized to conduct land exchanges under the federal land policy and management act ( flpma ) of 1976. additionally , congress sometimes enacts legislation authorizing and governing specific land exchanges . flpma governs how administrative exchanges are to occur . for instance , land exchanges must be in the public interest , and the federal and nonfederal lands in the exchange are to be in the same state . further , the values of the lands exchanged are to be equal , although payments to equalize value may be made under specified terms . typically , blm and the other parties share equally in the administrative costs . while some exchanges involve single parcels , assembled land exchanges consist of a consolidation of multiple parcels for one or more exchanges over time . lands acquired by blm by exchange become public lands managed under existing authorities . the land exchange process generally has five phases : development of an exchange proposal , feasibility evaluation , processing and documentation , decision analysis and approval , and title transfer . each phase typically involves multiple actions . for example , processing and documentation includes title review ; public notice and comment ; identification and resolution of environmental issues ; assessments of mineral , cultural , and other resources ; native american consultations ; threatened and endangered species consultations ; and preparation of land appraisals . the appraisal and environmental analysis often are the most challenging and time - consuming parts of the process . legislated exchanges generally follow this process as well , unless otherwise directed by congress . in the past , some blm land exchanges were controversial . concerns during the 2000-2009 decade centered on benefits to the public , determinations of market value , contradictions in policies and procedures , delays in appraisals , and various aspects of the exchange process . these topics were the subject of various governmental and nongovernmental reports , for instance by the government accountability office ( 2000 , 2006 , and 2009 ) , the appraisal foundation ( 2002 ) , interior appropriators ( 2009 ) , and the office of inspector general of the department of the interior ( doi , 2009 ) . in response , blm and doi implemented changes to the appraisal and exchange processes . for instance , blm formed and adopted the recommendations of the appraisal and exchange workgroup . later , blm also issued instruction memoranda on land exchanges containing additional policies and guidance . as another example , the secretary of the interior changed the organization and operation of the appraisal services function . a key issue for congress is the extent to which the reforms to the exchange process and appraisal function addressed perceived problems and improved land transactions . other issues for congress are whether to amend blm 's exchange authority or to discontinue blm 's administrative exchanges . opponents of exchanges view them as inherently difficult and thus favor other authorities to sell or exchange land . supporters continue to view administrative exchanges as useful to change the `` checkerboard '' pattern of land ownership in the west and to increase the efficiency of land management while decreasing management costs .
