roughly every five years , congress debates and revises omnibus legislation governing federal farm policy . commodity provisions in the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) expire in 2012 , and congress is currently reviewing u.s. farm policy . the collection of federal farm programs , which make payments to farmers and landlords , is often referred to by the broader farming community as the `` farm safety net . . some programs such as `` counter - cyclical payments '' ( which rise when crop prices decline ) contain elements of a safety net â€” which is usually intended to protect recipients against economic risks . other farm program payments , such as direct ( fixed ) payments , are made irrespective of market prices . as provided under the 2008 farm bill and other legislation , farm safety net programs can be divided into three main categories . commodity programs provide income support and attempt to address farm price or revenue risks for selected field crops . risk management ( primarily crop insurance ) provides protection from declines in yield or revenue for a much broader set of commodities , including many field and specialty crops and some livestock . supplemental disaster assistance is available for most agricultural commodities ( crops and livestock ) when weather - related production losses are not covered by other programs . many policymakers and farmers consider federal support of farm businesses necessary for their financial survival , given the unpredictable nature of agricultural production and markets . in contrast , many environmental groups and budget hawks argue that farm subsidies encourage overproduction on environmentally fragile land and are a market - distorting use of tax dollars . historically , federal programs have primarily benefitted farmers ( and landowners ) of the major crops , such as wheat , corn , cotton , and sugar , with policy constructed over many decades by modifying or adding programs . as a result , programs sometimes overlap or work at cross purposes , generating criticism that they are not well integrated , cost too much , or do not provide adequate risk protection . additional potential issues for congress in the next farm bill debate include the extent of the current commodity coverage , program complexity and its impact on participation and effectiveness , and the effect of biofuel subsidies on agriculture . the current federal budget situation is likely to prevent any increase in overall spending on a 2012 farm bill . thus , the level of funding in the congressional budget office ( cbo ) baseline budget for agricultural programs will be of paramount importance . combined outlays for farm safety net programs have averaged $ 15.7 billion per year during fy2003 to fy2010 , with a high of $ 20.5 billion in fy2006 and a low of $ 12.2 billion in fy2008 . cbo 's projected annual average for fy2011-fy2020 is $ 14.8 billion . with crop prices relatively high , counter - cyclical support has declined in recent years while crop insurance outlays ( which are directly related to crop prices ) have increased sharply . the pool of money for any changes to the farm safety net will likely come from the existing baseline for the commodity programs and the crop insurance program . a constraint affecting future u.s. policy choices is the broad set of rules of the world trade organization ( wto ) , which the united states , as a founding member , has agreed to abide by . farm bill proposals , if implemented , will affect u.s. commitments , mainly through cost , program design , implementation , and market effects . under the wto agreement on agriculture , the united states is committed to spending no more than $ 19.1 billion per year on `` amber box '' support ( programs considered to be the most trade distorting ) . the wto compatibility of any new proposal , such as a whole - farm safety net program , would depend on how its provisions mesh with wto criteria for loss triggers , payment levels , and production and trade effects .
