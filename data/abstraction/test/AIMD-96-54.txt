pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the defense business operations fund 's ( dbof ) cash management practices , focusing on : department of defense ( dod ) efforts to manage cash ; and ways dod could provide additional management oversight . gao found that : dbof cash management problems persist and reflect long - standing dod financial management weaknesses ; dbof managers do not have timely , accurate , and complete data on individual business areas ' cash balances and do not fully disclose adjustments to account balances in their monthly financial reports ; the defense finance and accounting service consistently has the most severe problems in accurately accounting for and reporting the navy 's cash balances , but it is developing reporting procedures to identify monthly cash balances in each business area ; collection and disbursement data can not be provided more promptly until dbof financial systems and processes are improved ; dod continues to rely on advance billing to supply cash for day - to - day operations , but billing and collection problems have resulted in billions of dollars in outstanding accounts receivable ; dod needs to enhance accountability and employ tools to effectively manage its cash to prevent inaccurate , untimely , and incomplete cash balances , collections , and disbursements when new financial systems are implemented ; and if cash management practices do not change , dod could require excessive cash amounts to maintain ongoing dbof operations , violate the antideficiency act , and limit its opportunities to fulfill dbof objectives .
