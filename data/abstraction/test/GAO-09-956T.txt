the small business innovation development act of 1982 established the small business innovation research program ( sbir ) to stimulate technological innovation , use small businesses to meet federal research and development ( r & d ) needs , foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r & d . since the program 's inception , gao has conducted numerous reviews of the sbir program . this statement summarizes gao 's past findings on the sbir program 's successes and challenges , data collection issues that affect program monitoring and evaluation , and how agencies make eligibility determinations for the program . gao is not making any new recommendations in this statement . between july 1985 and june 1999 , gao found that the sbir program was achieving its goals to enhance the role of small businesses in federal r & d , stimulate commercialization of research results , and support the participation of small businesses owned by women and / or disadvantaged persons . more specifically , gao found that throughout the life of the program , awards have been based on technical merit and are generally of good quality . in addition , the sbir program successfully attracts many qualified companies , has had a high level of competition , consistently has had a high number of first - time participants , and attracts hundreds of new companies annually . further , sbir has helped serve agencies ' missions and r & d needs ; although gao found that agencies differ in the emphasis they place on funding research to support their mission versus more generalized research . during these reviews gao also identified areas of weakness and made recommendations that could strengthen the program further . many of these recommendations have been either fully or partially addressed by the congress in various reauthorizations of the program or by the agencies themselves . for example , in 2005 , gao found that the issue of how to assess the performance of the sbir program remains somewhat unresolved after almost two decades , and identified data and information gaps that make assessment of the sbir program a challenge . many of the solutions to improve the sbir program could be addressed , in part , by collecting better data and establishing a government - use database , so that sba and participating agencies can share information and enhance their efforts to monitor and evaluate the program . however , in 2006 , gao reported that sba was 5 years behind schedule in complying with a congressional mandate to develop a government - use database that could facilitate agencies ' monitoring and evaluation efforts . moreover , the information that sba was collecting for the database was incomplete and inconsistent , thereby limiting its usefulness . in 2006 , sba told gao that it expected to have the government - use database operational early in fiscal year 2007. however , the database did not become operational until october 2008 and currently contains 2 years of new data , according to an sba official . the database also does not permit information to be entered in an inconsistent format . in 2006 , gao also found that sba , nih , and dod focus on a few select criteria to determine the eligibility of applicants for sbir awards . gao reported that both nih and dod largely relied on applicants to self - certify that they met all of the sbir eligibility criteria as part of their sbir applications , although both made additional efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information when they observed discrepancies in the applications . when the agencies were unable to verify the eligibility of an applicant , they referred the application to sba for an eligibility determination . gao found that when sba finds an applicant to be ineligible for the sbir program , it places this information on its web site but does not consistently identify that the ineligibility determination was made for the sbir program .
