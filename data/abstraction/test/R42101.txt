delegations from more than 190 countries and regions meet from november 28 to december 9 , 2011 , in durban , south africa , to continue discussions of how to address climate change under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) . the year 2012 will mark both the 20th anniversary of the opening for signature of the unfccc in rio de janeiro in 1992 and the end of the first `` commitment period '' ( 2008-2012 ) of the unfccc 's subsidiary kyoto protocol . in 2010 , the conference of the parties ( cop ) to the unfccc adopted a set of decisions referred to as the `` cancun agreements . . these embody pledges to abate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions made by all major emitting parties ; reporting and review systems to ensure `` transparency '' of implementation ; a new green climate fund and a technology mechanism ; and restatement of pledges by the wealthiest countries to mobilize financing for adaptation , mitigation , technology , and capacity - building : pledges approaching $ 30 billion during 2010-2012 , and a goal of approaching $ 100 billion annually by 2020. parties agreed that funding would come from public and private , bilateral and multilateral , and alternative sources . the most vulnerable developing countries have priority for the 2010-2012 funds . parties meeting in durban , south africa , will seek agreements that would clarify and carry out the cancun agreements . the dialogues particularly regard any second commitment period of the kyoto protocol , establishment of the green climate fund and technology mechanism ; and guidelines for the reporting and review mechanisms . this report provides context for the discussions that will ensue in the durban conference , then outlines the main issues and expectations for decisions by the parties . many see agreement on a new commitment period for ghg abatement under the kyoto protocol as key to almost all other decisions . notably , delegations from china , india , and some other middle - income countries say they will not discuss their own possible ghg abatement commitments until the highest - income `` annex i '' parties meet their existing commitments and sign up to further reductions under the kyoto protocol . on the other hand , canada , japan , and russia have stated they will not offer ghg reductions except in an agreement that includes legally binding commitments from all major emitters ( including china , the united states , and others ) . the united states , which declined to ratify the kyoto protocol , has no quantitative and binding ghg commitments . the absence of commitments from the top three global ghg emitters ( china , the united states , and india ) is a matter of consternation among many delegations . in durban , the parties may agree on rules to establish the climate green fund , the standing committee on finance , the adaptation committee , the technology committee , and clean technology centre , and additional decisions to promote mitigation of greenhouse gases and adaptation to impacts of climate change . a proposal exists , but seems unlikely to be adopted , to set a mandate to negotiate by 2015 a new global agreement that would take effect by 2020 .
