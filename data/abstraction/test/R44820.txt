the growth of the international insurance market and trade in insurance products and services has created opportunities and new policy issues for u.s. insurers , congress , and the u.s. financial system . insurance regulation is centered on the states , with the federal government having a limited role . while the risks of loss and the regulation may be local , the business of insurance , as with many financial services , has an increasingly substantial international component as companies and investors look to grow and diversify . the 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank ; p.l . 111-203 ) enhanced the federal role in insurance markets through several provisions , including the financial stability oversight council 's ( fsoc 's ) ability to designate insurers as systemically important financial institutions ( sifis ) ; federal reserve oversight of sifis and insurers with depository affiliates ; and the creation of a federal insurance office ( fio ) inside the department of the treasury . alongside fio , dodd - frank defined a new class of international insurance agreements called covered agreements for recognition of prudential measures which the fio and the united states trade representative ( ustr ) may negotiate with foreign entities . although not a regulator , fio has the authority to monitor the insurance industry and limited power to preempt state laws in conjunction with covered agreements . dodd - frank requires congressional consultations and a 90-day layover period for covered agreements , but such agreements do not require congressional approval . international insurance stakeholders and concerns the international response to the financial crisis included the creation of a financial stability board ( fsb ) , largely made up of various countries ' financial regulators , and increasing the focus of the international association of insurance supervisors ( iais ) on creating regulatory standards , especially relating to insurer capital levels . the federal reserve and the fio have assumed roles in the iais , whereas previously the individual states and the u.s. national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) had been the only u.s. members . any agreements reached under the fsb or iais would have no legal impact in the united states until adopted in regulation by federal or state regulators or enacted into federal or state statute . congress has little direct role in international regulatory cooperation agreements such as those reached at the fsb or iais . the federal involvement in insurance issues has created friction both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities , and it has been a subject of congressional hearings and legislation . the first covered agreement , between the united states and the european union ( eu ) , went into effect on september 22 , 2017. the agreement was largely rejected by the states and the naic , with the insurance industry split in its support , or lack thereof , for the agreement . treasury and ustr announced a second covered agreement , with the united kingdom ( uk ) , on december 11 , 2018 , which is currently in the layover period before congress . issues for congress the 115th congress enacted legislation addressing international insurance issues in p.l . 115-174 , with additional proposals included in h.r . 4573 , s. 488 , s. 1360 , h.r . 3861 , and h.r . 3762. congressional interest in international insurance issues focused on ( 1 ) the covered agreement addressing the eu and uk treatment of u.s. insurers and the u.s. state requirements for reinsurance collateral and ( 2 ) the potential impact of international organizations and standards on the united states .
