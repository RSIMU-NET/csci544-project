the food security act of 1985 ( p.l . 99-198 , 1985 farm bill ) included a number of significant agricultural conservation provisions designed to reduce farm production and conserve soil and water resources . many of the provisions remain in effect today , including the two compliance provisions â€” highly erodible land conservation ( sodbuster ) and wetland conservation ( swampbuster ) . the two provisions , collectively referred to as conservation compliance , require that in exchange for certain u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) program benefits , a producer agrees to maintain a minimum level of conservation on highly erodible land and not to convert wetlands to crop production . conservation compliance affects most usda benefits administered by the farm service agency ( fsa ) and the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) . these benefits can include commodity support payments , disaster payments , farm loans , and conservation program payments , to name a few . if a producer is found to be in violation of conservation compliance , then a number of penalties could be enforced . these penalties range from temporary exemptions that allow the producer time to correct the violation , to a determination that the producer is ineligible for any usda farm payment and must pay back current and prior years ' benefits . a controversial issue in the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) debate was whether federal crop insurance subsidies should be included on the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands . ultimately the 2014 farm bill did add federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of benefits that could be lost , but created separate considerations when addressing compliance violations and the loss of federal crop insurance premium subsidies compared with the loss of other farm program benefits . how compliance is calculated , where compliance provisions apply , and traditional exemptions and variances were not amended . the 2014 farm bill also extended limited protection for native sod in select states . the levels of interest and debate generated by the changes to conservation compliance in the 2014 farm bill are likely to continue with implementation , raising additional questions and oversight in congress . recent concerns about a growing backlog of wetland determinations in the northern plains and approaching compliance deadlines for crop insurance policyholders have been raised . additionally , the reduction in soil erosion from highly erodible land conservation continues , but at a slower pace than following the enactment of the 1985 farm bill . the leveling off of erosion reductions leaves broad policy questions related to conservation compliance , including whether an acceptable level of soil erosion on cropland has been achieved ; whether additional reductions could be achieved , and , if so , at what cost ; and how federal farm policy could encourage additional reductions in erosion .
