dba requires u.s. government contractors to buy workers ' compensation insurance for most employees working overseas . the cost of this insurance , if allowable under federal regulations , is generally reimbursable under government contracts . from 1992 until 2012 , state had a contract with a single insurer to supply all state 's contractors working overseas with dba insurance . in july 2012 , state 's single insurer program ended after state unsuccessfully sought to solicit a new dba single insurer agreement and state transitioned to a system requiring its contractors to obtain dba insurance on the open market . however , concerns were raised about the transition and its impact on state 's costs and on small businesses ' competitiveness . to address these objectives , gao was asked to review state 's transition . this report assesses state 's management of the transition to an open market system , the change 's effect on contractors ' premium rates , and the change 's effect on small businesses . gao analyzed state documents ; reviewed federal and state contracting regulations ; analyzed premium rate data and federal contracting data ; and interviewed officials from state , the insurance industry , and contracting firms . the department of state ( state ) did not follow leading acquisition practices in transitioning from a single insurer defense base act ( dba ) program to an open market system . leading practices emphasize adequately documenting market research , allowing enough time to complete a solicitation , and collecting and analyzing data to select among alternatives , but state took limited measures to document the market research it performed and had little time to complete its 2012 solicitation . state included provisions in the solicitation to which insurers strongly objected , received no offers , and had to cancel the solicitation 3 days before its existing single insurer contract was to expire . as a result , state had to quickly transition to an open market system without weighing the relative costs and benefits to determine which insurance system best served its needs . until state conducts such an evaluation , it can not be assured that the open market system is the better alternative , and unless state incorporates leading practices into any future single insurer solicitations , it risks a similar outcome . gao found that state contractors ' dba premiums increased following the transition , but the increases were in a range similar to those likely to have occurred if state had continued its single insurer program . for example , median dba premium rates increased by $ 1.98 per $ 100 of payroll . gao analysis also shows that the increase in dba premium rates after the transition was in a range comparable to the increase in dba premium rates requested by state 's single dba insurer , which said it had lost money under the prior contract . existing data do not show a clear effect on small businesses resulting from state 's transition to an open market system , but insurers and contractors have expressed concern that the change has had or could have an adverse effect . gao analysis of federal procurement data from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 found a decrease in the percentage of contracts awarded to small businesses , but gao could not link this to state 's transition . information gao gathered from insurance industry officials and contractors shows that there is a potential for adverse effects , for example , denial of coverage and higher effective premium rates . state 's policy is to maximize opportunities for small businesses , but it has not assessed whether its transition to an open market dba system is affecting those opportunities . without such an assessment , state can not be assured that it is meeting its policy goal of maximizing opportunities for small businesses . state should determine whether an open market system best suits its needs , incorporate leading practices into any future single insurer solicitation , and assess the effects of its transition on small businesses . state concurred with gao 's recommendations .
