for more than two decades , the u.s. government has been broadcasting to cuba to break the cuban government 's information blockade and promote democracy in cuba . over this period , questions have been raised regarding the quality and effectiveness of these broadcasts . gao was asked to examine the office of cuba broadcasting 's ( ocb ) broadcasting approach and what is known about its audience ; how the broadcasting board of governors ( bbg ) -- which oversees u.s. government broadcasting -- and ocb ensure compliance with journalistic principles ; steps taken to ensure adherence to domestic and international broadcasting laws , agreements , and standards ; and steps bbg and ocb have taken to address management challenges . gao analyzed documentation related to strategic planning , audience research , oversight , and operations and interviewed officials from bbg , bbg 's international broadcasting bureau ( ibb ) , ocb , state , and other agencies . ocb broadcasts radio and tv marti through multiple transmission methodsthat face varying levels of jamming by the cuban government . while there are no nationally representative data and some surveys of recent cuban emigres suggest a larger audience , the best available research suggests that radio and tv marti 's audience is small . specifically , less than 2 percent of respondents to telephone surveys since 2003 reported tuning in to radio or tv marti during the past week . despite the importance of audience research , we found minimal sharing of such research among available sources . because of limitations in the audience research data , decisionmakers lack basic information to help assess the relative success or return on investment from each of ocb 's transmission methods . bbg 's ibb -- which directly oversees ocb -- has established an annual program review process that serves as the main mechanism for assessing ocb 's compliance with journalistic standards . while ibb officials report that the quality of ocb programming has improved in recent years , ibb reviews since 2003 have recommended improving adherence to certain journalistic standards , particularly in the areas of balance and objectivity . ibb 's process provides useful feedback , but we found weaknesses such as limited training and operational guidance for staff conducting the reviews . ocb and ibb have taken steps to ensure that u.s. broadcasting adheres to relevant laws and standards , but some concerns remain . to comply with u.s. law , they have taken steps to minimize the domestic dissemination of ocb programming ; however , ocb broadcasts reach u.s. audiences in several ways , such as through the internet . in addition , a commercial tv station contracted to broadcast ocb programming showed some inappropriate advertisements during ocb programs . furthermore , an international body found that ocb 's tv broadcasts cause harmful interference to cuban broadcasts , but the u.s. government has not taken steps to address this issue . despite some efforts by bbg and ocb , oversight entities have identified problems such as poor communication by ocb management and low employee morale . for example , ocb lacks formal mechanisms for communicating with or obtaining information from employees .
