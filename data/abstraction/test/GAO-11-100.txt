the national nuclear security administration 's ( nnsa ) tritium readiness program aims to establish an assured domestic source of tritium -- a key isotope used in nuclear weapons -- in order to maintain the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile . because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent annually , it must be periodically replenished in the stockpile . however , since 2003 , nnsa 's efforts to produce tritium have been hampered by technical challenges . in this context , gao was asked to determine the extent to which nnsa has been able to overcome technical challenges producing tritium , determine the extent to which nnsa is able to meet current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , and assess the management of nnsa 's tritium readiness program . to do this , gao visited facilities involved in tritium production and reviewed tritium requirements established by nnsa and the department of defense , among other things . nnsa has been unable to overcome the technical challenges it has experienced producing tritium . to produce tritium , stainless steel rods containing lithium aluminate and zirconium -- called tritium - producing burnable absorber rods ( tpbar ) -- are irradiated in the tennessee valley authority 's ( tva ) watts bar 1 commercial nuclear power reactor . despite redesigns of several components within the tpbars , tritium is still leaking -- or `` permeating '' -- out of the tpbars into the reactor 's coolant water at higher - than - expected rates . because the quantities of tritium in the reactor coolant are approaching regulatory limits , tva has been significantly restricting the number of tpbars that it will allow nnsa to irradiate in each 18-month reactor fueling cycle , and , consequently , nnsa has not been producing as much tritium as it planned . nnsa and tva officials are continuing to develop plans to increase the number of tpbars that will be irradiated , as well as , if necessary , the number of reactors participating in the program . however , these plans have not been coordinated with the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , which ultimately must approve any changes to the operation of the tva reactors . nnsa currently meets the nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , but its ability to do so in the future is in doubt . nnsa officials told us that they will be able to meet future requirements through a combination of harvesting tritium obtained from dismantled nuclear warheads and irradiating tpbars . although the number of nuclear weapons in the u.s. stockpile is decreasing , these reductions are unlikely to result in a significant decrease of tritium requirements and will not eliminate the need for a reliable source of new tritium because of the need to periodically replenish it in the remaining nuclear weapons stockpile due to tritium 's decay . while nnsa has not , to date , been required to use tritium from a reserve that it maintains , use of this reserve in the relatively near future may be necessary if nnsa is unable to increase tritium production beyond its current level . although nnsa has attempted to ensure a reliable long - term supply of tritium , gao 's review found two problems with nnsa 's management of the tritium readiness program . first , nnsa could not provide us with evidence that it adhered to the appropriate contracting procedures when purchasing components and services for the program . second , due to , among other things , the way the program 's contracts with its suppliers are structured , the program is spending its funds more slowly than planned and is accumulating large unexpended balances . the program is subject to thresholds established by the department of energy of acceptable levels of unexpended funds that may be carried over from one fiscal year to the next . however , the program exceeded these thresholds by more than $ 48 million in 2008 and by more than $ 39 million in 2009. while large unexpended balances are not necessarily an indication that the program is being mismanaged , it does indicate that the program is requesting more funding than it needs on an annual basis -- funds that could be appropriated for other purposes . gao recommends that nnsa develop a plan to manage tritium releases from reactors , analyze alternatives to its current tritium production strategy , ensure its contracting complies with appropriate contracting procedures , and ensure its future budget requests account for the program 's large unexpended balances . nnsa generally agreed with our recommendations .
