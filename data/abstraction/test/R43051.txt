in 1978 , the department of the interior ( department ) adopted a final rule setting forth the process by which a group may be recognized ( also acknowledged ) as an indian tribe by the department . prior to that time , the department made decisions on an ad hoc basis . however , in the wake of the treaty fishing rights case united states v. washington and eastern land claims , more groups started seeking recognition as indian tribes , and the department could no longer manage the recognition requests on a case - by - case basis . the acknowledgement process , codified in 25 c.f.r . part 83 , sets forth a uniform process and uniform criteria for acknowledging that groups exist as indian tribes . the key to federal acknowledgment under the current regulations is continuous political existence of an indian group from historical times to the present . the federal acknowledgment process does not create tribes , and it does not give groups sovereignty . rather , it acknowledges a political entity that already exists . to do this , 25 c.f.r . section 83.7 provides seven mandatory criteria that groups must satisfy in order to establish that they exist and have existed as an autonomous political entity . first , in order to be acknowledged , a group must establish that it has been identified as an indian entity from 1900 to the present . second , it must establish that it has existed as a community from historical times to the present . third , it must establish that it has exercised political control over its members from historical times to the present . fourth , the group must provide a copy of its governing document , including membership criteria . fifth , the group must establish that its members descend from a historical indian tribe or historical indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity . sixth , the membership must be composed principally of persons who are not members of a federally recognized tribe . finally , the group must establish that it is not the subject of congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the federal - tribal relationship . the current regulations assign responsibility to the assistant secretary â€” indian affairs ( assistant secretary ) to issue initial proposed findings and then final determinations . the office of federal acknowledgment ( ofa ) makes recommendations to the assistant secretary on the proposed findings and the final determinations . a final determination may be appealed on limited grounds to the interior board of indian appeals . acknowledgment as an indian tribe means that the group becomes a federally recognized tribe with which the united states has a government - to - government relationship . this relationship makes the tribe and its members eligible for certain benefits , as well as subject to certain protections . it also means that the tribe may exercise jurisdiction over its territory and members generally free from state law , subject to limitations of federal law . after years of criticism of the acknowledgment process , the department of the interior has proposed several changes to the acknowledgment regulations . first , the proposed rule would change some of the criteria . second , the proposed rule would assign responsibility for the proposed findings to ofa but keep responsibility for the final determinations with the assistant secretary . in rendering the proposed finding , ofa would consider the criteria in stages . petitioners could appeal a negative proposed finding at any of the stages . the appeal would be heard by a judge within the office of hearings and appeals ( oha ) who would issue a recommended decision for the assistant secretary to consider in issuing the final determination . the assistant secretary 's decision would be final for the department .
