in march 2008 , gao designated the 2010 census a high - risk area in part because of information technology ( it ) shortcomings and uncertainty over the ultimate cost of the census , now estimated at around $ 15 billion . the u.s. census bureau ( bureau ) has since made improvements to various it systems and taken other steps to mitigate the risks to a successful census . however , last year , gao noted that a number of challenges and uncertainties remained , and much work remained to be completed under very tight time frames . as requested , this testimony provides an update on the bureau 's readiness for an effective headcount , covering the reliability of key it systems ; a broad range of activities critical to an effective headcount , some of which were problematic in either earlier 2010 operations or in the 2000 census , and the quality of the bureau 's cost estimates . the testimony is based on previously issued and ongoing gao work . overall , the bureau 's readiness for a successful headcount is mixed . on the one hand , performance problems continue to plague a work flow management system essential for the bureau 's field operations and a payroll processing system that will be used to pay more than 600,000 temporary workers . both systems have not yet demonstrated the ability to function reliably under full operational loads , and the limited amount of time that remains to address their shortcomings creates a substantial challenge for the bureau . aside from the mail response , which is outside of the bureau 's direct control , the difficulties facing these two automated systems represent the most significant risk , jeopardizing the cost and quality of the enumeration . on the other hand , the rollout of other key enumeration activities is generally on track , and the bureau has taken action to address some previously identified problems . for example , the bureau has taken steps to reduce the number of temporary workers with unreadable fingerprint cards , a problem that affected an earlier field operation . among other actions , the bureau plans to digitally capture a third and fourth set of fingerprints if the first two sets can not be read for background security checks . the bureau 's 2010 census communications campaign is also more robust than the one used in the 2000 census . key differences from the 2000 campaign include increased partnership staffing , expanded outreach to partner organizations , targeted paid advertising based on market and attitudinal research , and a contingency fund to address unexpected events . to increase participation rates , the bureau plans to mail a second , replacement questionnaire to census tracts that had low or moderate response rates in the 2000 census . to help ensure that hard - to - count populations are enumerated , the bureau plans to employ several initiatives . for example , service based enumeration is designed to count people who lack permanent shelter at soup kitchens , mobile food vans , and other locations where they receive services . the be counted program is designed to reach those who may not have received a census questionnaire . to help ensure a complete count of areas along the gulf coast , the bureau is hand delivering an estimated 1.2 million census forms in areas that were devastated by hurricanes katrina , rita , and ike . in addition , the bureau re - examined its cost estimate for nonresponse follow - up , the largest and most costly field operation where census workers follow up in person with nonresponding households . the bureau provided a range of estimates , with $ 2.3 billion as the mid - point . however , the bureau 's analyses of cost are not complete . according to the bureau , it continues to reexamine the cost of two other operations related to nonresponse follow - up . moving forward , it will be important for the bureau to quickly identify the problems affecting key it systems and test solutions . further , given the complexity of the census and the likelihood that other glitches might arise , it will be important for the bureau to stay on schedule , monitor operations , and have plans and personnel in place to quickly address operational issues .
