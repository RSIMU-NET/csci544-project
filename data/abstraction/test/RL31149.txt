for at least a decade , the use of snowmobiles in yellowstone and other national parks has been controversial because of the potential impacts on wildlife and , until recently , the absence of standards for snowmobile emissions and noise . the national park service has attempted to address the issue by developing winter use plans that establish regulations and limits at individual park units . these plans have been the subject of numerous legal challenges . on september 15 , 2008 , the u.s. district court for the district of columbia vacated the national park service 's most recent winter use plan for yellowstone national park . the plan would have allowed up to 540 snowmobiles per day into the park beginning in the 2008-2009 winter season , provided that they met noise and emission standards and that the riders were accompanied by commercial guides . the nps plan was opposed by environmental groups and the vast majority of public commenters . with the rule vacated , it is unclear what limits will apply in the coming winter season . current model snowmobiles emit significant quantities of pollution . in one hour , a new model snowmobile emits as much hydrocarbon as a 2008 model auto emits in about four years ( 54,000 miles ) of driving . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) promulgated regulations limiting air emissions from snowmobiles in 2002 , but the regulations have the effect of allowing the machines to emit as much hydrocarbon pollution in a day as a new auto emits in its lifetime . snowmobiles also emit significant amounts of noise . epa has no snowmobile noise standards . the national park service has allowed snowmobile use in 43 units of the national park system , in many cases in apparent violation of executive orders from the nixon and carter years . outside of alaska ( where snowmobiles are permitted in most national parks by law ) , the most popular national park for snowmobiling has been yellowstone , which saw more than 87,000 snowmobile visits in the 2001-2002 winter season . under the clinton administration , the park service decided that the emissions and noise from snowmobiling were incompatible with protecting the park , and promulgated rules that would have phased out snowmobiles from yellowstone by the winter of 2003-2004. the bush administration revisited these rules and announced modifications in march 2003 that would have allowed continued use of snowmobiles . the 2003 rules and the clinton administration action have been the subject of conflicting court rulings : a federal court in wyoming has vacated and remanded the clinton administration 's phaseout , while a d.c. federal court has vacated and remanded the bush administration rules . for the last four winters , yellowstone and two neighboring park units have operated under a temporary plan that permits 720 snowmobiles per day in yellowstone , but sets standards for their emissions and requires snowmobilers to be accompanied by commercial guides . under these rules , snowmobile visits have declined by two - thirds . efforts to reduce snowmobile emissions and noise remain contentious . this report discusses snowmobile access to the parks , snowmobile emissions , epa 's emission standards , and congressional efforts to address these issues .
