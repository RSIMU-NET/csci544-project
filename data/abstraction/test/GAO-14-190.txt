aerial refueling allows u.s. military aircraft to fly farther , stay airborne longer , and transport more weapons , equipment , and supplies . yet the mainstay of the u.s. tanker forces — the kc - 135 stratotanker — is over 50 years old . it is increasingly costly to support and its age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet . as a result , the air force initiated the $ 51 billion kc - 46 program to replace the aerial refueling fleet . the program plans to produce 18 tankers by 2017 and 179 aircraft in total . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 mandated gao to annually review the kc - 46 program through 2017. this report addresses progress made in 2013 toward cost , schedule , and performance goals , development challenges , if any , and steps to address them , and progress made in manufacturing the aircraft . to do this , gao reviewed key program documents and discussed development and production plans and results with officials from the kc - 46 program office , other defense offices , and the prime contractor , boeing . the kc - 46 program has made good progress over the past year — acquisition costs have remained relatively stable , the critical design review was successfully completed , the program is on track to meet performance parameters , and the contractor started building development aircraft . as shown , total program acquisition costs — which include development , production , and military construction costs — and unit costs have changed less than 1 percent since february 2011. as of december 2013 , boeing had about $ 75 million of its management reserves remaining to address identified , but unresolved development risks . there are indications that the start of initial operational test and evaluation , which is scheduled for may 2016 , may slip 6 to 12 months . according to the director of operational test and evaluation , more time may be needed to train aircrew and maintenance personnel and verify maintenance procedures . the program released over 90 percent of the kc - 46 design drawings at the critical design review , indicating that the design is stable . overall , development of about 15.8 million lines of software code is progressing mostly according to plan . the next 12 months will be challenging as the program must complete software development , verify that the software works as intended , finalize developmental flight test planning , and begin developmental flight tests . software problem reports are increasing and boeing could have difficulty completing all testing if more retests are needed than expected . developmental flight testing activities are also a concern due to the need for extensive coordination among government agencies , the need for timely access to receiver aircraft ( aircraft the kc - 46 will refuel while in flight ) , and the aggressive test pace . the program office is conducting test exercises to mitigate risks and working with navy and united kingdom officials to finalize agreements to have access to necessary receiver aircraft . the program has also made progress in ensuring that the kc - 46 is ready for low rate initial production in 2015. boeing has started manufacturing all four development aircraft on schedule . the program office has identified its critical manufacturing processes and verified that the processes are capable of producing key military subsystems in a production representative environment . in addition , the program has established a reliability growth curve and will begin tracking its progress towards reaching reliability goals once testing begins . boeing is experiencing some manufacturing delays due to late supplier deliveries on the first aircraft and parts delays for a test article of a critical aerial refueling subsystem , but the program has not missed any major milestones . gao recommends that the air force determine the likelihood and potential effect of delays on total development costs , and develop mitigation plans , as needed , related to potential delays . dod concurred with the recommendation .
