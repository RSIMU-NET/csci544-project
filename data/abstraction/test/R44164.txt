the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) was comprehensively reauthorized by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l . 114-95 ) on december 10 , 2015. the title i - a program is the largest grant program authorized under the esea and is funded at $ 14.9 billion for fy2016 . it is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other students attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low - income families . under current law , the u.s. department of education ( ed ) determines title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) based on four separate funding formulas : basic grants , concentration grants , targeted grants , and education finance incentive grants ( efig ) . annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year 's title i - a appropriation to be allocated to leas and states under each of these formulas . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a `` formula child count , '' consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an `` expenditure factor '' based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor . these maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula , taking into account a variety of state and lea minimum grant and `` hold harmless '' provisions . in general , leas must have a minimum number of formula children and / or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific title i - a formula . some leas may qualify for a grant under only one formula , while other leas may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas . this report provides a general overview of the key components of each of the formulas .
