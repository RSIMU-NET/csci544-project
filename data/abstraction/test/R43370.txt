eligibility for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) benefits are based on a worker 's insured status , and payment levels are associated with the individual 's career earnings under covered employment . monthly payments are calculated using a formula that takes into account the period of employment , a worker 's average earnings over that period , and the application of `` dropout years . . to be insured for ssdi benefits , a claimant must have worked a minimum amount of time in covered employment . first , a worker must be `` fully insured , '' which requires one quarter of coverage for each calendar year after the age of 21 , with a minimum of six quarters and a maximum of 40 quarters . in 2014 , each quarter of coverage requires $ 1,200 in earnings . second , a recency of work test requires 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of a disability ; that is generally five years of work in the last 10 , although fewer quarters are required for younger workers . in calculating the ssdi benefit level , up to five years of a worker 's lowest years of earnings are eliminated or `` dropped '' to minimize the effect of lower years of earnings on monthly payments . an eligible worker who becomes disabled has one year of earnings dropped ( via the disability dropout year provision ) for every five years of earnings , known as the one - for - five rule . a separate childcare dropout year ( cdy ) provision also disregards from benefit calculations up to two years in which a beneficiary received no income during periods when he or she was caring for a young child . the number of cdys applied to a benefit calculation may be offset by the number of disability dropout years applied and vice versa . the cdy provision largely benefits a small subset of ssdi recipients with lower career earnings . this report provides ( 1 ) an overview of the ssdi program and how workers become insured for ssdi benefits , ( 2 ) an explanation of how benefit payments are calculated , and ( 3 ) a description of how the dropout year provisions affect the calculation of disability benefit payments . the report concludes with a brief analysis of the earnings of disabled workers that have been credited with cdys .
