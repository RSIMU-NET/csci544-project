since at least the 1980s , the border has played a central role in u.s. policy discussions . policymakers have for years debated the best strategy for providing border protection . what has emerged from these efforts has been a generally agreed upon framework of mission and goals . however , some question whether the strategy has been sufficiently mapped out in a comprehensive fashion . the broad framework currently in place is generally supported by a collection of agency or function - specific strategic elements that show some commonalities . for congressional policymakers , the current state of border protection strategy presents at least three questions : ( 1 ) what does the current border protection framework consist of ? . ( 2 ) is it working ? . and ( 3 ) are there more effective alternatives to achieve border protection ? . this report addresses these three questions through two competing models for conceptualizing a border protection system , through the analysis of existing documentation and data , and through the presentation of various legislative options . for critics and advocates of u.s. border protection policy , there are a host of competing policy alternatives for how to effectively protect the border . while some individuals want more enforcement and stricter admission criteria , others want to lessen these restrictions . ultimately , the policy choices are rooted in competing visions of what u.s. border policy should look like . these visions can be grouped into at least two camps : ( 1 ) the unilateral security model based on a metaphorical `` fortress '' and ( 2 ) an interdependence ( or cooperation - based ) model based on a metaphorical `` complex organism . . the current border protection framework can be understood as consisting of a mission , three goals , and five strategic elements . the mission is securing and managing the u.s. border . the current border protection framework can be summarized as obtaining effective control of the borders , safeguarding lawful trade and travel , and identifying and disrupting transnational criminal organizations . finally , the five strategic elements to achieve these goals consist of department of homeland security leadership , deployment of layered security , maximizing domain awareness , promotion of a shared agency culture , and expansion of the border through international and domestic partnerships . analysis of available data suggests that despite some support for the viability of the current border protection approach in its present state , it is not seemingly providing sufficient deterrence to overcome labor market demand for illegal workers . yet , definitive conclusions of effectiveness can not be made because the current border protection operation is an incomplete version of what policymakers envisioned . the border protection framework goals are necessarily vague , as the breadth of the threats and activities at the border are wide . but these goals are rooted in the notion that a strategy based on enforcement can ultimately prevent or deter most actions that are undesirable . this assumption has been the source of much debate and continues to be the source of skepticism in certain circles . as suggested above , few conclusive claims about the effectiveness of the current border protection framework can be made . yet , even if enforcement - only measures do provide some level of deterrence and prevention against border violations , these efforts are both costly and do not necessarily address the underlying causes of such activities . moreover , they can have unintended consequences . this report will not be updated .
