federal law encourages individuals to save for retirement through tax incentives for 401 plans and iras — the predominant forms of retirement savings in the united states . in 2017 , u.s. plans and iras reportedly held investments worth nearly $ 17 trillion dollars . federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances . dol and irs oversee 401 plans , and collect annual plan data — including financial information — on the form 5500. for both iras and 401 plans , gao was asked to examine : the incidence and amount of early withdrawals ; factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early ; and policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals . to answer these questions , gao analyzed data from irs , the census bureau , and dol from 2013 ( the most recent complete data available ) ; and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature , including representatives of companies sponsoring 401 plans , plan administrators , subject matter experts , industry representatives , and participant advocates . in 2013 individuals in their prime working years ( ages 25 to 55 ) removed at least $ 69 billion ( + / - $ 3.5 billion ) of their retirement savings early , according to gao 's analysis of 2013 internal revenue service ( irs ) and department of labor ( dol ) data . withdrawals from individual retirement accounts ( ira ) — $ 39.5 billion ( + / - $ 2.1 billion ) — accounted for much of the money removed early , were equivalent to 3 percent ( + / - 0.15 percent ) of the age group 's total ira assets , and exceeded their ira contributions in 2013. participants in employer - sponsored plans , like 401 plans , withdrew at least $ 29.2 billion ( + / - $ 2.8 billion ) early as hardship withdrawals , lump sum payments made at job separation ( known as cashouts ) , and loan balances that borrowers did not repay . hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent ( + / - 0.06 percent ) of the age group 's total plan assets and about 8 percent ( + / - 0.9 percent ) of their contributions . however , the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans can not be determined because the form 5500 — the federal government 's primary source of information on employee benefit plans — does not capture these data . stakeholders gao interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals ' pressing financial needs , such as out - of - pocket medical costs , as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings . stakeholders said that certain plan rules , such as setting high minimum loan thresholds , may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need . stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals , such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans , as relevant factors . stakeholders gao interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long - term retirement savings . for example , plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation , restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions , allowing partial distributions at job separation , and building emergency savings features into plan designs , could help preserve retirement savings ( see figure ) . however , they noted , each strategy involves tradeoffs , and the strategies ' broader implications require further study . gao recommends that , as part of revising the form 5500 , dol and irs require plan sponsors to report the incidence and amount of all 401 plan loans that are not repaid . dol and irs neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation .
