pursuant to congressional requests , gao reviewed bank and thrift sales of mutual funds , focusing on : the extent and nature of bank and thrift mutual fund sales activities ; banks ' and thrifts ' disclosure of their mutual fund sales practices ; and the regulatory framework for overseeing bank and thrift mutual fund operations . gao found that : as of the end of 1993 , about 2,300 banks and thrifts were involved in mutual fund sales and about 114 institutions had established their own mutual funds ; during the 5 previous years , the value and numbers of bank - owned funds grew faster than the mutual fund industry as a whole and banks and thrifts became major sellers of nonproprietary funds ; banks and thrifts sell mutual funds to retain customers and increase fees ; in february 1994 , bank regulators issued guidelines on policies and procedures that financial institutions are to follow in selling nondeposit investment products due to their concern that banks and thrifts are not disclosing the risks of investing in mutual funds ; gao visits to selected banks and thrifts in 1994 disclosed that only about one - third of the institutions followed the disclosure guidelines , while nearly one - fifth of the institutions failed to disclose any risks ; the bank regulators are including steps in their examinations to assess how well these institutions are complying with the guidelines ; the existing regulatory framework is inadequate to deal with the rapid increase in banks ' and thrifts ' involvement in securities sales and management ; banks that directly sell to customers are predominantly regulated by bank regulators , while securities regulators mainly oversee banks which sell or advise through affiliates or third party brokers ; the existing regulatory framework could lead to inconsistent or overlapping regulatory treatment of the same activity and to conflict among the regulators ; and conflicts of interest may arise between banks ' mutual fund activities and traditional banking functions .
