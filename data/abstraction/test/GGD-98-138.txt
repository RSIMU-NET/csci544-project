gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) efforts to have its information systems function correctly when processing dates beyond december 31 , 1999 , focusing on : irs ' progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in gao 's year 2000 assessment guide ; the risks irs faces to completing the year 2000 effort on time ; and risks to the continuity of irs operations in the event of year 2000-induced system failures . gao noted that : according to irs , before january 1999 , it needs to complete 12 steps of its 14-step process for converting : the applications for its existing systems ; the telecommunications networks ; and systems software and hardware for mainframes , minicomputers / file servers , and personal computers ; in addition , before january 1999 , irs needs to : ensure that external data exchanges will be year 2000 compliant ; implement the integrated submission and remittance processing system and , at a minimum , the year 2000 portions of mainframe consolidation ; and modify application software to implement tax law changes for the 1999 and 2000 filing seasons ; if these efforts are not completed , irs ' tax processing and collection systems may fail to operate or may generate millions of erroneous tax notices , refunds , interest calculations , and account adjustments ; for the conversion of its existing systems , irs has made more progress on its applications than on its information systems infrastructure ; specifically , as of april 24 , 1998 , irs reported that it had completed the first 12 steps of its 14-step conversion process for applications for about 46 percent of the 127 systems it has deemed as mission - critical ; irs expects to convert the applications for the remaining 54 percent of the mission - critical systems by january 1999 ; the two major systems replacement efforts , which are also expected to follow irs ' 14-step conversion process , are experiencing some schedule slippages ; irs officials said they expect to complete the year 2000 portions of the mainframe consolidation by the original completion date of december 1998 ; gao identified two risk areas for irs ' year 2000 effort : the lack of an integrated master conversion and replacement schedule ; and a limited approach to contingency planning ; since gao 's briefing , irs has decided to have a contractor develop an integrated schedule of its year 2000-related efforts , including making all of the necessary tax law changes for 1999 ; irs officials said they hope to have a baseline , master integrated schedule in june 1998 ; and in part , due to irs officials ' concerns that the same resources that are doing year 2000 conversion work would be needed to do contingency planning , irs officials decided to develop a process that would minimize the number of contingency plans that would have to be developed .
