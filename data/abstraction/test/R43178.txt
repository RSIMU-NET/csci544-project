the passage of the 1996 telecommunications act ( p.l . 104-104 ) resulted in a major revision of the communications act of 1934 ( 47 u.s.c . 151 et seq . ) . to address the emergence of competition in what were previously considered to be monopolistic markets . since its passage , however , the advancement of broadband technology to supply data , voice , and video ; the growing convergence of the telecommunications and media sectors ; and the growth in demand for usable radio - frequency spectrum has led to a consensus that the laws that govern these sectors have become inadequate to address this rapidly changing environment and have , according to a growing number of policymakers , made it necessary to consider revising the current regulatory framework . this report provides an overview of selected topics that , while far from a definitive list , provide a broad overview of issues that are central to the telecommunications / media convergence debate . the issues covered in this report include broadband deployment , broadband regulation and access , broadcast media ownership rules , funding for the corporation for public broadcasting , emergency communications , legal issues regarding facilities siting , federal communications commission oversight and reform , internet governance and the domain name system , reauthorization of statutory copyright and communications provisions in the satellite television extension and localism act , spectrum policy and wireless broadband deployment , and universal service fund reform . rather than addressing the specific legislative , regulatory , and industry activities , this report provides an overview of these major issues . the crs products listed under `` for further information , '' found at the end of each issue topic , should be used to expand upon the issue , provide an update of relevant events , track congressional activity , and identify crs analysts who are knowledgeable in these issue areas . this report will be updated occasionally .
