to discharge its constitutional duties , congress depends on information obtained from theexecutive branch . domestic and national security information is provided through agency reportsand direct communications from department heads , but lawmakers also receive information directlyfrom employees within the agencies . they take the initiative in notifying congress , its committees , and members of congress about alleged agency illegalities , corruption , and waste within the agency . this type of information comes from a group known as whistleblowers . through such techniques as `` gag orders '' and nondisclosure agreements , presidents haveattempted to block agency employees from coming directly to congress . in response , congress hasenacted legislation in an effort to assure the uninterrupted flow of domestic and national securityinformation to lawmakers and their staffs . members of congress have made it clear they do not wantto depend solely on information provided by agency heads . overall , the issue has been how toprotect employees who are willing to alert congress about agency wrongdoing . the first procedures enacted to protect agency whistleblowers appeared in the civil servicereform of 1978. it also contained language that excluded protections to whistleblowers who workin federal agencies involved in intelligence and counterintelligence . in 1989 , congress passed thewhistleblower protection act in an effort to strengthen statutory protections for federal employeeswho assist in the elimination of fraud , waste , abuse , illegality , and corruption . that statute continuedthe exemption for national security information . it did not authorize the disclosure of anyinformation by an agency or any person that is ( 1 ) specifically prohibited from disclosure by anyother provision of law , or ( 2 ) `` specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in theinterest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs . . several statutes apply expressly to national security information . congress has passed aseries of laws known collectively as the military whistleblowers protection act , under whichmembers of the military may give information to members of congress . it also passed theintelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 to encourage the reporting tocongress of wrongdoing within the intelligence agencies . in crafting this legislation , congress hassought to balance its need for information with national security requirements , giving intelligencecommunity whistleblowers access to congress only through the intelligence committees . for legalanalysis see crs report 97-787 , whistleblower protections for federal employees , by l. paigewhitaker and michael schmerling . this report will be updated as events warrant .
