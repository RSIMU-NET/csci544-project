the department of defense ( dod ) spends billions of dollars annually to build and maintain information technology ( it ) systems intended to support its mission . for decades , dod has been challenged in modernizing its systems environment to reduce duplication and increase integration . such modernizations can be guided by an enterprise architecture -- a blueprint that describes an organization 's current and target state for its business operations and supporting it systems and a plan for transitioning between the two states . dod has long sought to employ enterprise architectures and has defined an approach for doing so that depends in large part on the military departments developing architectures of their own . in light of the critical role that military department enterprise architectures play in dod 's overall architecture approach , gao was requested to assess the status of the departments of the air force , army , and navy ( don ) enterprise architecture programs . to do so , gao obtained and analyzed key information about each department 's architecture relative to the 59 core elements contained in stages 1 through 6 of gao 's enterprise architecture management maturity framework . while air force , army , and don each have long - standing efforts to develop and use enterprise architectures , they have much to do before their efforts can be considered mature . gao 's enterprise architecture management framework provides a flexible benchmark against which to plan for and measure architecture program maturity and consists of 59 core elements arranged into a matrix of seven hierarchical stages . the air force has fully satisfied 20 percent , partially satisfied 47 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of gao 's framework elements . the army has fully satisfied 12 percent and partially satisfied 42 percent of the elements , with the remaining 46 percent not satisfied . finally , don has satisfied 27 percent , partially satisfied 41 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of the framework elements . with respect to stages 1 through 6 of gao 's architecture framework , the military departments have generally begun establishing institutional commitments to their respective enterprise architecture efforts ( stage 1 ) , not established the management foundations necessary for effective enterprise architecture development and use ( stage 2 ) , begun developing initial enterprise architecture content ( stage 3 ) , not completed and used their initial enterprise architecture versions to achieve results ( stage 4 ) , not expanded and evolved the development and use of their respective architectures to support institutional transformation ( stage 5 ) , and taken limited steps to continuously improve their respective architecture programs and use their architectures to achieve corporate optimization ( stage 6 ) . officials at the military departments stated that they have been limited in their ability to overcome long - standing enterprise architecture management challenges , including receiving adequate funding and attaining sufficient senior leadership understanding . nevertheless , dod has been provided with considerable resources for its it systems environment , which consists of 2,324 systems . specifically , dod receives over $ 30 billion each year for this environment . without fully developed and effectively managed enterprise architectures and a plan , the air force , army , and don lack the necessary road maps for transforming their business processes and modernizing their hundreds of supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability . what this means is that dod , as a whole , is not as well positioned as it should be to realize the significant benefits that a well - managed federation of architectures can afford its systems modernization efforts , such as eliminating system overlap and duplication . because dod is provided with over $ 30 billion each year for its it systems environment , the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its it investments is significant . gao recommends that the military departments each develop a plan for fully satisfying the elements of gao 's framework . dod and army concurred and the air force and don did not . in this regard , dod stated that air force and don do not have a valid business case that would justify the implementation of all the elements . however , gao continues to believe its recommendation is warranted .
