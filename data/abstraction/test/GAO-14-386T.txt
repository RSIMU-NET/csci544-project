while some internet pharmacies are legitimate businesses that offer consumers a safe and convenient way to purchase their prescription drugs , the fda and nabp have reported that thousands are fraudulent enterprises . among other things , these rogue internet pharmacies often sell counterfeit or otherwise substandard drugs . consumers have experienced health problems as a result of purchasing drugs from rogue internet pharmacies , and the proliferation and patronage of such entities has rendered them a public health threat . a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for administering and enforcing laws related to internet pharmacies , including fda , doj , cbp , and ice , as well as state boards of pharmacy . this statement is based on gao 's july 2013 report , entitled internet pharmacies : federal agencies and states face challenges combating rogue sites , particularly those abroad ( gao - 13-560 ) . in this report , gao identified how rogue sites violate federal and state laws , challenges federal agencies face in investigating and prosecuting operators , efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and efforts to educate consumers about the risks of purchasing prescription drugs online . to conduct this work , gao interviewed officials from federal agencies , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency data and documents . gao also interviewed officials from stakeholders including nabp , drug manufacturers , and companies that provide services to internet businesses . although the exact number of rogue internet pharmacies is unknown , one estimate suggests that there were over 36,000 in operation as of february 2014 , and these rogue sites violate a variety of federal laws . most operate from abroad , and many illegally ship prescription drugs into the united states that have not been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) , including drugs that are counterfeit or are otherwise substandard . many also illegally sell prescription drugs without a prescription that meets federal and state requirements . foreign rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated methods to evade scrutiny by customs officials and smuggle drugs into the country . their operators also often violate other laws , including those related to fraud and money laundering . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting those involved . according to federal agency officials , piecing together rogue internet pharmacy operations can be difficult because they may be composed of thousands of related websites , and operators take steps to disguise their identities . officials also face challenges investigating and prosecuting operators because they are often located abroad in countries that are unable or unwilling to aid u.s. agencies . the department of justice ( doj ) may not prosecute such cases due to competing priorities , the complexity of these operations , and challenges related to bringing charges under some federal laws . despite these challenges , federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions , fines , and asset seizures from rogue internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them . fda and other federal agencies have also collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to disrupt rogue internet pharmacy operations . for example , fda took action against 1,677 rogue internet pharmacy websites in 2013 as part of a worldwide enforcement initiative . other federal agencies such as u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) have also taken actions — for example , by interdicting counterfeit drug shipments from rogue internet pharmacies at the border . fda and others have taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of buying prescription drugs from rogue internet pharmacies . fda recently launched a national campaign to raise public awareness about the risks of purchasing drugs online , and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) posts information on its website about how to safely purchase drugs online . however , rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated marketing methods to appear legitimate , making it hard for consumers to differentiate between legitimate and rogue sites . nabp 's recent analysis shows that 97 percent of the over 10,000 internet pharmacies that it reviewed were out of compliance with laws or industry standards . some rogue sites seek to assure consumers of the safety of their drugs by purporting to be “ canadian ” despite being located elsewhere or selling drugs sourced from other countries .
