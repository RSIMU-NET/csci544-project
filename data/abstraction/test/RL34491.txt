the senate frequently enters into unanimous consent agreements ( sometimes referred to as `` uc agreements '' or `` time agreements '' ) that establish procedures for the consideration of legislation that the senate is considering or will soon consider . in recent practice , such unanimous consent agreements have sometimes included a provision that would require a 60-vote threshold to be met for amendments or legislation to be considered agreed to , rather than the simple majority ordinarily required . these amendments or measures may be of a controversial nature with the potential for causing a filibuster . by incorporating a 60-vote threshold , such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements imposed by senate rule xxii for invoking cloture , while preserving the same requirement for super - majority support . this report will be updated each session of congress .
