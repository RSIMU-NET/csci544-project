data mining has become one of the key features of many homeland security initiatives . often used as a means for detecting fraud , assessing risk , and product retailing , data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown , valid patterns and relationships in large data sets . in the context of homeland security , data mining can be a potential means to identify terrorist activities , such as money transfers and communications , and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves , such as through travel and immigration records . while data mining represents a significant advance in the type of analytical tools currently available , there are limitations to its capability . one limitation is that although data mining can help reveal patterns and relationships , it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patterns . these types of determinations must be made by the user . a second limitation is that while data mining can identify connections between behaviors and / or variables , it does not necessarily identify a causal relationship . successful data mining still requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output . data mining is becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors . industries such as banking , insurance , medicine , and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs , enhance research , and increase sales . in the public sector , data mining applications initially were used as a means to detect fraud and waste , but have grown to also be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance . however , some of the homeland security data mining applications represent a significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed . some efforts that have attracted a higher level of congressional interest include the terrorism information awareness ( tia ) project ( now - discontinued ) and the computer - assisted passenger prescreening system ii ( capps ii ) project ( now - canceled and replaced by secure flight ) . other initiatives that have been the subject of congressional interest include the multi - state anti - terrorism information exchange ( matrix ) , the able danger program , the automated targeting system ( ats ) , and data collection and analysis projects being conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) . as with other aspects of data mining , while technological capabilities are important , there are other implementation and oversight issues that can influence the success of a project 's outcome . one issue is data quality , which refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data being analyzed . a second issue is the interoperability of the data mining software and databases being used by different agencies . a third issue is mission creep , or the use of data for purposes other than for which the data were originally collected . a fourth issue is privacy . questions that may be considered include the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data , whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed , and possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives . it is anticipated that congressional oversight of data mining projects will grow as data mining efforts continue to evolve . this report will be updated as events warrant .
