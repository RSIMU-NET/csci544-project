for the president 's budget for fiscal year 2005 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) stated that of the nearly 1,200 major information technology ( it ) projects in the budget , it had placed approximately half -- 621 projects , representing about $ 22 billion -- on a management watch list , composed of mission - critical projects with identified weaknesses . gao was asked to describe and assess omb 's processes for placing projects on its management watch list and following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list . for the fiscal year 2005 budget , omb developed processes and criteria for including it investments on its management watch list . in doing so , it identified opportunities to strengthen investments and promote improvements in it management . however , it did not develop a single , aggregate list identifying the projects and their weaknesses . instead , omb officials told gao that to identify it projects with weaknesses , individual omb analysts used scoring criteria that the office established for evaluating the justifications for funding that federal agencies submit for major projects . these analysts , each of whom is typically responsible for several federal agencies , were then responsible for maintaining information on these projects . to derive the total number of projects on the list that omb reported for fiscal year 2005 , omb polled its individual analysts and compiled the result . however , omb officials told gao that they did not compile a list that identified the specific projects and their identified weaknesses . the officials added that they did not construct a single list because they did not see such an activity as necessary . thus , omb has not fully exploited the opportunity to use the list as a tool for analyzing it investments on a governmentwide basis . omb had not developed a structured , consistent process for deciding how to follow up on corrective actions that its individual analysts asked agencies to take to address weaknesses associated with projects on its management watch list . according to omb officials , decisions on follow - up and monitoring of progress were typically made by the staff with responsibility for reviewing individual agency budget submissions , depending on the staff 's insights into agency operations and objectives . because it did not consistently require or monitor follow - up activities , omb did not know whether the project risks that it identified through its management watch list were being managed effectively , potentially leaving resources at risk of being committed to poorly planned and managed projects . in addition , because it did not consistently monitor the follow - up performed on projects on the management watch list , omb could not readily tell gao which of the 621 projects received follow - up attention . thus , omb was not using its management watch list as a tool in setting priorities for improving it investments on a governmentwide basis and focusing attention where it was most needed .
