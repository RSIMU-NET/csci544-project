communications between congressional committees and constituents and stakeholder groups have changed with the development of social networking services . many committees now use email , official websites , blogs , youtube channels , twitter , facebook , and other services — technologies that were either nonexistent or not widely available until recently — to communicate with members of congress , constituents , and stakeholder groups . social networking services have arguably served to enhance the ability of congressional committees to reach members of congress , constituents , and stakeholder groups and to widely disseminate committee actions and announcements . in addition , electronic communication technology has reduced the marginal cost of communication ; unlike postal letters , social media can reach a large audience for a fixed cost . these advances are altering how members organize and manage their personal and committee offices and impacting the ability of members to gather support for political and policy goals . perhaps most importantly , they may transform the very nature of representation in the united states . this report examines committee adoption and use of two social networking services : twitter and facebook . the report analyzes data on committee use of twitter and facebook collected by an academic institution in collaboration with the congressional research service during a 4½ - month period between june and october 2013. this report analyzes the following questions related to committee use of twitter and facebook : how many committees have adopted twitter and facebook ? . how widely are committee social media accounts followed ? . how much are committees using twitter and facebook ? . what are committees tweeting and posting about ? . are committees interacting with other users on twitter and facebook ? . this report provides a snapshot of a dynamic process . as with any new technology , the number of committees using twitter and facebook , and the patterns of use , may change rapidly in short periods of time . as a result , the conclusions drawn from these data can not be easily generalized or used to predict future behavior . finally , the report examines the possible implications of committees using twitter and facebook . the analysis focuses on interaction between committees and the public , real - time communications and changes in constituent feedback , and outreach to the public through social media .
