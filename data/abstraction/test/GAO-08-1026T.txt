over the past 15 years , legislative and executive branch reform efforts have attempted to shift the focus of federal government management from a preoccupation with activities to the results or outcomes of those activities . based on over a decade of work in this area , gao has found a transformation in the capacity of the federal government to manage for results , including an infrastructure of outcome - oriented strategic plans , performance measures , and accountability reporting that provides a solid foundation for improving the performance of federal programs . however , agencies have made less progress in getting their managers ' to use performance information in their decision making . gao was asked to testify on the preliminary results of ongoing work looking at trends in federal managers ' use of performance information to manage , both governmentwide and at the agency level ; how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve results ; and lessons learned from prior management reforms for the next administration . our statement is based on prior gao reports and surveys we conducted in 1997 , 2000 , 2003 , and 2007. for the results of our 2007 survey , see e - supplement gao - 08-1036sp . gao will be issuing a report at a later date that will explore the use of performance results in management decision making at selected agencies . according to gao surveys , since 1997 significantly more federal managers report having performance measures for the programs they manage . however , despite having more performance measures available , federal managers ' reported use of performance information in management decision making has not changed significantly . for the collection of performance information to be considered more than meaningless paperwork exercises , it must be useful to and used by federal decision makers at all levels -- including congress . to reach this state , gao believes that the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last 10 years : demonstrate leadership commitment to results - oriented management ; develop a clear `` line of sight '' linking individual performance with organizational results ; and build agency capacity to collect and use performance information . in addition to encouraging agencies to employ these practices , the next administration should : adopt a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance ; improve the relevance of performance information to congress ; and build agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making .
