the united states has had a military alliance with south korea ( r.o.k . ) . and important interests in the korean peninsula since the korean war of 1950-1953. many u.s. interests relate to communist north korea . since the early 1990s , the issue of north korea 's development of nuclear weapons has been the dominant u.s. policy concern . experts in and out of the u.s. government believe that north korea has produced plutonium for at least six atomic bombs . north korea tested nuclear devices in october 2006 and may 2009. in 2007 , a six party negotiation ( among the united states , north korea , china , south korea , japan , and russia ) produced agreements that resulted in a disablement of north korea 's main nuclear reactor and u.s. removal of north korea from the u.s. list of state sponsors of terrorism . in april 2009 , north korea rejected six party talks . the obama administration began bilateral talks with north korea in december 2009 aimed at returning north korea to the six party talks ; north korea demanded first a lifting of u.n. sanctions and negotiation of a u.s. - north korean peace treaty . other north korean policies affect u.s. interests . north korean exports of counterfeit u.s. currency and u.s. products produce upwards of $ 1 billion annually for the north korean regime . north korea earns considerable income from sales of missiles and missile and nuclear technology cooperation with iran and syria . it has developed short - range and intermediate - range missiles , but it has so far failed to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile . it is estimated to have sizeable stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons . pyongyang 's main goal of its nuclear program appears to be the development of nuclear warheads that can be mounted on its missiles . north korean involvement in international terrorism has included the kidnapping of japanese citizens , reportedly arms and training to the hezbollah and tamil tigers terrorist groups , and cooperation with the iranian revolutionary guards in development of missiles and nuclear weapons . u.s. human rights groups are involved in responding to the outflow of tens of thousands of north korean refugees into china , due to severe food shortages inside north korea and the repressive policies of the north korean regime . u.s. and international food aid to north korea has been provided since 1995 , but north korea rejected south korean food aid in 2008 and expelled u.s. food aid workers in march 2009. north korea faces severe food shortages in 2010. south korea followed a conciliation policy toward north korea under the administrations of kim dae - jung and roh moo - hyun ; but president lee myung - bak , elected in december 2007 , linked south korean aid to north korea , including food aid , to the nuclear and other policy issues . north korea responded by cutting off most contacts with the lee government until august 2009. north korea then made overtures to south korea , probably because of its worsening food situation . the united states signed a free trade agreement ( fta ) with south korea ( the seventh - largest u.s. trading partner ) in 2007. there is substantial opposition to the fta in congress . the obama administration has called for renegotiation on the automobile provisions and additional south korean measures to open the r.o.k . market to imports of u.s. beef . the u.s. - r.o.k . military alliance appears to function well . it is dealing with several issues of change : relocations of 28,500 u.s. forces within south korea ; construction of new bases ; the creation of separate u.s. and south korean military commands in 2012 ; possible future withdrawals of u.s. ground forces to u.s. conflict areas ; an r.o.k . military contribution to afghanistan ; and south korean financial support for u.s. forces .
