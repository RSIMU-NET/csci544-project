as congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control ( i.e . , border security and interior enforcement ) , legal reform ( i.e . , temporary and permanent admissions ) , and the resolution of unauthorized alien residents , concerns arise over the capacity of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to identify and remove temporary aliens on nonimmigrant visas who fail to depart after their visas expire . it is estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally ( with fraudulent documents or bypassing immigration inspections ) . the most recent estimate ( published in 2013 ) is that 11.7 million foreign nationals resided in the united states without authorization in 2012. dhs does not have reliable data on emigration and nonimmigrant departures from the united states . as a consequence , reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available . over the years , the overstay estimates ranged from 31 % to 57 % of the unauthorized population ( depending on methodology ) . a 2013 study of visa overstays from 2000 to 2009 estimated that total nonimmigrant overstays to the united states dropped from 705,000 per year to 190,000 per year , or about 73 % , over the decade . as of june 2013 , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) reported that dhs 's unmatched arrival - departure records totaled more than 1 million ; however , the failure of dhs to consistently update the alien 's record — for example , if the authorized period of admission is extended , if deferred departure is granted , or if the immigration status changes — is a major factor that prevents dhs from calculating reliable estimates of overstays .
