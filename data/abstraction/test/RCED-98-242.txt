pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the minerals management service 's ( mms ) efforts to revise its regulations for valuing oil from federal leases , focusing on : the information used by mms to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations ; how mms has addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing these regulations ; and the feasibility of the federal government 's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , as indicated by existing studies and programs . gao noted that : in justifying the need to revise its oil valuation regulations , mms relied heavily on the findings and recommendations of an interagency task force -- composed of representatives from mms and the departments of commerce , energy , justice , and the interior -- assembled in 1994 by interior to study the value of oil produced from federal leases in california ; the task force concluded that the major oil companies ' use of posted prices in california to calculate federal royalties was inappropriate and recommended that the federal oil valuation regulations be revised ; mms subsequently determined that in other parts of the country as well , posted prices should not be used as the basis to calculate royalties on oil from federal leases ; beginning in 1995 , mms solicited public comments on the proposed regulations in five federal register notices ; it solicited comments in each notice and revised its proposed regulations three times in response to the comments received ; however , the agency did not agree with all the comments it received and in these cases provided reasons for not incorporating the suggested changes , noting that it planned to seek input on this issue through other means ; in total , the agency asked for comments on 39 major issues and received 183 letters from states , representatives of the oil industry , and other parties ; on its most recent revision of the proposed regulations , the agency received 34 comments but has not yet publicly addressed them ; information from studies of royalties in kind , as well as specific royalty - in - kind programs operated by various entities , indicates that it would not be feasible for the federal government to take its oil and gas royalties in kind except under certain conditions ; these conditions include having relatively easy access to pipelines to transport the oil and gas , leases that produce relatively large volumes of oil and gas , competitive arrangements for processing gas , and expertise in marketing oil and gas ; however , these conditions are currently lacking for the federal government and for most federal leases ; and specifically , the federal government does not have relatively easy access to pipelines , has thousands of leases that produce relatively low volumes , has many gas leases for which competitive processing arrangements do not exist , and has limited experience in oil and gas marketing .
