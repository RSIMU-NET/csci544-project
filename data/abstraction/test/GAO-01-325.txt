more than half the estimated 220 million acres of marshes , bogs , swamps , and other wetlands in the united states during the colonial times , have disappeared , and others have become degraded . this decline is due , primarily , to farming and development . developers whose projects may harm wetlands must , according to environmental regulations , first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable . if harmful impacts are unavoidable , the developer must compensate by restoring a former wetland , enhancing a degraded wetland , creating a new wetland , or preserving an existing wetland . such mitigation efforts can occur under the following three types of arrangements : mitigation banks , under which for - profit companies restore wetlands under army corps of engineers agreements and then sell credits for these wetlands to developers ; in - lieu - fee arrangements under which developers pay public or non - profit organizations fees for establishing wetland areas , usually under formal corps agreements ; and ad hoc arrangements , under which developers pay individuals or companies to perform the mitigation . this report , determines the extent to which the in - lieu - fee option has been used to mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands , the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its intended purpose of mitigating such impacts , and in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers ' mitigation business . this report also discusses the use of ad hoc arrangements as a mitigation option . most of the arrangements were designed to use fees received from developers to restore , enhance , or preserve wetlands , with a few arrangements designed to allow wetlands to be created . during fiscal years 1998 through 2000 , developers used the in - lieu - fee option to fulfill mitigation requirements for more than 580 acres of adversely affected wetlands , and paid more than $ 39.5 million to in - lieu - fee organizations . the extent to which the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its purpose of mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands is uncertain . although corps officials in 11 of the 17 districts with the in - lieu - fee option said that the number of wetland acres restored , enhanced , created , or preserved by in - lieu - fee organizations equaled or exceeded the number of wetland acres adversely affected , data submitted by more than half of those districts did not support these claims . officials in 9 of the 17 districts said that functions and economic values lost from the adversely affected wetlands were replaced at the same level or better through in - lieu - fee mitigation , but officials in more than half of those districts also acknowledged that they have not tried to assess whether mitigation efforts have been ecologically successful . as a result , the corps can not be certain that in - lieu - fee mitigation has been effective . corps district officials in 9 of the 17 districts with the in - lieu - fee option said that organization and mitigation banks were competing with each other by providing similar mitigation services in the same geographic area . no competition existed in 5 of the 17 districts because either no mitigation banks were available , or in - lieu - fee organizations and mitigation banks provided different services , or served different geographic areas . gao found that hoc arrangements typically were for one - time projects without a formal agreement . oversight of mitigation affairs was lacking in almost half of the districts using such arrangements . corps districts disagreed on whether responsibility for the ecological success of ad hoc mitigation rests with the ad hoc fund recipient or the developer .
