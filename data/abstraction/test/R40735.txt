u.s. international competitiveness has been a topic of heated debate in recent years . in this debate it has been argued that the decline in performance of u.s. firms stems , at least in part , from problems with the federal tax system . in support of these claims , comparisons are often made between provisions of the u.s. tax code and those of the nation 's trading partners — with selected differences offered as explanations for unsatisfactory outcomes . one common argument made by advocates of this position is that the united states ' reliance on direct taxes ( such as income and payroll taxes ) provides a disadvantage when trading with countries that have indirect taxes ( such as a value - added tax or vat ) . this argument follows from the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) allowance for border tax adjustments ( the rebate of indirect taxes on exports and the imposition of indirect taxes on imports ) on indirect taxes , but not for direct taxes . according to this argument , u.s. companies are at a competitive disadvantage because they can not make use of border tax adjustments like many of their international competitors . almost since its inception in 1967 , this provision has been characterized as an export subsidy and as a source of competitive disadvantage . beginning in the johnson administration , high - level discussions have been held concerning this matter . in addition , congress has also instructed u.s. trade negotiators to address this perceived distortion as part of granting fast - track trade authorization in 1974 , 1988 , and 2002. congressional interest in this debate continues today with the introduction of the border tax fairness act ( s. 1043 ) and the border tax equity act of 2009 ( h.r . 2927 ) . in addition to directing u.s. trade negotiators to address this perceived distortion , the acts would impose taxes on imports from countries with border tax adjustments and compensate exporters for border taxes paid . some assert that these provisions would redress issues of u.s. competitiveness ; others maintain this is not the case . economists have long recognized that border tax adjustments have no effect on a nation 's competitiveness . border tax adjustments have been shown to mitigate the double taxation of cross - border transactions and to provide a level playing field for domestic and foreign goods and services . hence , in the absence of changes to the underlying macroeconomic variables affecting capital flows ( for example , interest rates ) , any changes in the product prices of traded goods and services brought about by border tax adjustments would be immediately offset by exchange - rate adjustments . this is not to say , however , that a nation 's tax structure can not influence patterns of trade or the composition of trade . this report explains these common economic findings on the effect of border tax adjustments on international competitiveness , through two perspectives on the issue — first through a discussion on the neutrality of border tax adjustments with respect to cross - border trade and secondly using economic theory to explain the effect of border tax adjustments on the u.s. balance of trade . as a prelude to these explanations , the report begins with a brief explanation of vats and border tax adjustments . this report will be updated as legislative events warrant .
