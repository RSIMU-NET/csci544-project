one of the majority party 's prerogatives is writing the house rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber 's rules on the day the new house convenes . it is a feature of the house that it must adopt rules at the convening of each congress . while each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous congress , each new house also adopts changes to those rules . institutional and political developments during the democratic majority , particularly during the 103rd congress , were a prelude to the rules changes made by the republicans when they took control of the house in the 104th congress . rules changes made at the convening of the 104th congress addressed most aspects of the committee system : decision - making autonomy , jurisdictions , internal committee procedures and structure , and staff . rules changes for the 104th congress and after also addressed most aspects of legislation deliberations on the house floor and organization of the chamber . for example , the minority was guaranteed the ability to offer the motion to recommit with instructions , commemorative legislation was banned , the names of signatories of discharge petitions were publicized , provisions were made for convening a house with a reduced membership due to a terrorist attack , and the speaker was subjected to a term limit that was later repealed . two of the eight goals of the republicans ' 1994 contract with america dealt with budgetary legislation . house rules were changed to require a three - fifths vote to pass a federal income tax rate increase , and cost estimates replaced baselines as the preferred way of understanding the year - to - year changes in federal spending . rules changes in the administration of the house were extensive . offices were abolished and others created . responsibilities were shifted and accountability clarified . rules changes affecting ethical standards were largely technical , with most major changes taking place through freestanding and other legislation . the house rules changes made starting in the 104th congress reflected a republican frame of reference that was built over many years as the minority party . most rules , however , did not change , either at all or substantially , since they had evolved over decades to support the majority in its organization and operation of the house . rules changes do not necessarily enable a majority to pass legislation , to overcome voter sentiments , or to work smoothly with the minority . rules facilitate the majority 's organization and operation of the house ; they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the house or what outcomes can be achieved . this report describes and analyzes only rules changes made on the opening day of a new congress , but it references in footnotes selected other legislation and actions that also changed or affected house rules during the 104th congress and during subsequent congresses . this report is the first in a series on house rules changes at the beginning of a congress . for changes in the 110th , 111th , and 112th congresses , see crs report r42395 , a retrospective of house rules changes since the 110th congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] . this report will not be updated .
