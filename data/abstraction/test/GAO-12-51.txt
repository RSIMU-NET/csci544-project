the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) pays plans in medicare advantage ( ma ) the private plan alternative to medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) a predetermined amount per beneficiary adjusted for health status . to make this adjustment , cms calculates a risk score , a relative measure of expected health care costs , for each beneficiary . risk scores should be the same among all beneficiaries with the same health conditions and demographic characteristics . policymakers raised concerns that differences in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs could lead to inappropriately high ma risk scores and payments to ma plans . cms began adjusting for coding differences in 2010. gao estimated the impact of any coding differences on ma risk scores and payments to plans in 2010 and evaluated cmss methodology for estimating the impact of these differences in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012. to do this , gao compared risk score growth for ma beneficiaries with an estimate of what risk score growth would have been for those beneficiaries if they were in medicare ffs , and evaluated cmss methodology by assessing the data , study populations , study design , and beneficiary characteristics analyzed . gao found that diagnostic coding differences exist between ma plans and medicare ffs . using data on beneficiary characteristics and regression analysis , gao estimated that before cmss adjustment , 2010 ma beneficiary risk scores were at least 4.8 percent , and perhaps as much as 7.1 percent , higher than they likely would have been if the same beneficiaries had been continuously enrolled in ffs . the higher risk scores were equivalent to $ 3.9 billion to $ 5.8 billion in payments to ma plans . both gao and cms found that the impact of coding differences increased over time . this trend suggests that the cumulative impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 could be larger than in 2010. in contrast to gao , cms estimated that 3.4 percent of 2010 ma beneficiary risk scores were attributable to coding differences between ma plans and medicare ffs . cmss adjustment for this difference avoided $ 2.7 billion in excess payments to ma plans . cmss 2010 estimate differs from gaos in that cmss methodology did not include more current data , did not incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences over time , and did not account for beneficiary characteristics other than age and mortality , such as sex , health status , medicaid enrollment status , beneficiary residential location , and whether the original reason for medicare entitlement was disability . cms did not update its coding adjustment estimate in 2011 and 2012 to include more current data , to account for additional years of coding differences , or to incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences . by continuing to implement the same 3.4 percent adjustment for coding differences in 2011 and 2012 , cms likely underestimated the impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 , resulting in excess payments to ma plans . gaos findings underscore the importance of both cms continuing to adjust risk scores to account for coding differences and ensuring that those adjustments are as complete and accurate as possible . in its comments , cms stated that it found our findings informative . cms did not comment on our recommendation . gao recommends that cms should improve the accuracy of its ma risk score adjustments by taking steps such as incorporating adjustments for additional beneficiary characteristics , using the most current data available , accounting for all relevant years of coding differences , and incorporating the effect of coding difference trends .
