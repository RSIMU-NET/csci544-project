encouraging a clearer and closer link between budgeting and planning is essential to improving federal management and instilling a greater focus on results . through work at various levels within the organization , this report on the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) -- and its two companion studies on the administration for children and families ( gao - 03-09 ) and the veterans health administration ( gao - 03-10 ) -- documents what managers considered successful efforts at creating linkages between planning and performance information to influence resource choices and the challenges managers face in creating these linkages . although in differing stages of implementation throughout nrc , nrc designed the planning , budgeting , and performance management process ( pbpm ) to better integrate its strategic planning , budgeting , and performance management processes . pbpm links four individual components : setting the agency 's strategic direction , determining activities and performance targets of component offices and related resources , executing the budget and monitoring performance targets and taking corrective actions , if needed , to achieve those targets , and assessing agency progress toward achieving its goals . gao 's report provides examples of how the pbpm framework can influence budget formulation and execution decisions . these examples show how nrc informs its resource allocation decisions by providing strategic direction to operating units prior to budget formulation , how operating units that have implemented these processes link strategic direction to budgets through tools that set priorities and assign resources to office activities to accomplish these priorities , and how operating units monitor performance targets and make adjustments as necessary during budget execution . in addition , agency managers have told gao that pbpm also promotes agencywide coordination of budget formulation and execution decisions by providing a common language and common goals . integrating budget and planning processes and improving performance management in nrc is an ongoing effort that includes addressing a series of challenges . they are creating performance measures that balance competing goals and keep performance measures current , associating resource requests with outcomes , standardizing pbpm practices and techniques but still allowing some flexibility among offices to tailor the process to their needs , developing the assessment component , and committing significant effort to maintain pbpm . in addition , nrc must continue developing a cost accounting system to support pbpm .
