the u.s. dept . of agriculture 's ( usda ) risk management agency ( rma ) administers the federal crop insurance program in partnership with private insurers . in 2005 , the program cost $ 2.7 billion , including an estimated $ 117 million in losses from fraud , waste , and abuse . the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 ( arpa ) provided new tools to monitor and control abuses , such as providing rma sanction authority to address program abuse and having usda 's farm service agency ( fsa ) inspect farmers ' fields . this testimony is based on gao 's september 30 , 2005 , report , crop insurance : actions needed to reduce program 's vulnerability to fraud , waste , and abuse ( gao - 05-528 ) . gao assessed usda 's processes to address fraud , waste , and abuse , and the extent to which the program 's design makes it vulnerable to abuse . rma has taken a number of steps to improve its procedures and processes to address fraud , waste and abuse in selling and servicing crop insurance policies and has reported more than $ 300 million in savings from 2001 to 2004. however , rma is not effectively using all of its tools . gao identified weaknesses in four key areas . first , fsa inspections during the growing season are not being used to maximum effect . between 2001 and 2004 , fsa conducted only 64 percent of the inspections rma had requested . without inspections , farmers may falsely claim crop losses . second , rma 's data analysis of the largest farming operations is incomplete . according to gao 's analysis , in 2003 about 21,000 of the largest farming operations in the program did not report individuals or entities with an ownership interest in these operations as required . without this information rma was unaware of ownership interests that could help it prevent potential program abuse . fsa did not give rma access to the data needed to identify such individuals or entities . usda should be able to recover up to $ 74 million in improper claims payments . third , rma is not effectively overseeing insurance companies ' efforts to control program abuse . gao 's review of 120 cases showed that companies did not complete all of the required quality assurance reviews of claims and those that were conducted were largely paper exercises . fourth , rma has infrequently used its new sanction authority to address program abuse . rma has not issued regulations to implement its new sanction authority under arpa and imposed only 114 sanctions from 2001 through 2004 , although it annually identifies about 3,000 questionable claims , not all of which are necessarily sanctionable . rma 's regulations to implement the crop insurance program , as well as some statutory requirements , create program design problems that hinder rma 's efforts to reduce program abuse . for example , rma 's regulations allow farmers to insure fields individually rather than all fields combined . this option enables farmers to `` switch '' reporting of yield among fields to either make false claims or build up a higher yield history on a field to increase its eligibility for higher insurance guarantees . high premium subsidies , established by statute , may also limit rma 's ability to control program abuse because the subsidies shield farmers from the full effect of paying higher premiums associated with frequent claims . eight recent crop insurance fraud cases , investigated by usda 's office of inspector general and resulting in criminal prosecutions between june 2003 and april 2005 , reflect the issues gao noted . these cases show how farmers , sometimes in collusion with insurance agents and others , falsely claim prevented planting and low production . several of these cases also demonstrate the importance of having fsa and rma work together to identify and share information on questionable farming practices / activities .
