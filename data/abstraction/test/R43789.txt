the adult education and family literacy act ( aefla ) is the primary federal legislation that supports basic education for out - of - school adults . commonly called `` adult education , '' the programs and activities funded by aefla typically support educational services at the secondary level and below , as well as english language training . actual educational services are typically provided by local entities . aefla was created by title ii of the workforce investment act of 1998 ( wia ; p.l . 105-220 ) . the authorization of appropriations under wia lapsed after fy2003 , though the program continued to be funded through the appropriations process . in 2014 , aefla was reauthorized by title ii of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2014 ( wioa , p.l . 113-128 ) . this report will discuss aefla as amended by wioa . wioa made a number of changes to the authorizing law but maintained the program 's primary function of authorizing federal grants to state agencies for adult education activities . state agencies may use a portion of federal funds for statewide activities , but the bulk of their grants must be subgranted to local providers . eligible local providers include local educational agencies , institutions of higher education , community - based organizations , and other qualified entities . under wioa , federal aefla grants are allotted to states via two formula grants : 88 % of state grant funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state 's relative share of adults who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and who are not enrolled in school . these funds may support basic education services , coursework toward a secondary school diploma or equivalent , english language training or other adult education services . 12 % of funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state 's relative share of immigrants who were admitted for legal permanent residence in past years . these funds support `` integrated english literacy and civics education '' for english language learners . wioa requires that state agency grantees submit and have an approved unified state plan that aligns adult education with other core wioa programs to meet local labor force needs . state grantees must also report on program performance using a set of metrics that applies across core wioa programs , including adult education . while the large majority of annual appropriations support grants to state agencies , statute reserves 2 % of annual aefla appropriations for national leadership activities . these national activities include technical support for state agencies and assistance in meeting the performance accountability requirements of wioa . congress appropriated $ 578 million for aefla - authorized activities in fy2014 . wioa authorizes the same appropriation level for fy2015 . between fy2015 and fy2020 , wioa authorizes annual increases in aefla appropriations , with an authorization level of $ 679 million in fy2020 .
