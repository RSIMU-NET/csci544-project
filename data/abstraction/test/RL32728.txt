the public utility holding company act of 1935 ( puhca ) and the federal power act ( fpa ) were enacted to eliminate unfair practices and other abuses by electricity and gas holdingcompanies by requiring federal control and regulation of interstate public utility holding companies . prior to puhca , electricity holding companies were characterized as having excessive consumerrates , high debt - to - equity ratios , and unreliable service . puhca remained virtually unchanged for50 years until enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978. purpa was , in part , intended to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and toprovide equitable rates to electric consumers . qualifying facilities ( qfs ) are exempt from regulationunder puhca and the fpa . electricity regulation was changed again in 1992 with passage of the energy policy act ( epact ) . the intent of title 7 of epact is to increase competition in the electric generating sectorby creating new entities , called `` exempt wholesale generators '' ( ewgs ) , that can generate and sellelectricity at wholesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca . this title also providesewgs with a way to assure transmission of their wholesale power to their purchasers . the effect ofthis act on the electric supply system has been more far - reaching than purpa . on april 24 , 1996 , the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) issued orders 888and 889. ferc issued these rules to remedy undue discrimination in transmission services ininterstate commerce and provide an orderly and fair transition to competitive bulk power markets.order 2000 , issued december 20 , 1999 , established criteria for forming transmission organizations . comprehensive electricity legislation may involve several components . the first is puhcareform . some electric utilities want puhca changed so they can more easily diversify their assets . state regulators have expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses , including cross - subsidization . consumer groups have expressed concern that a repeal of puhcacould exacerbate market power abuses in a monopolistic industry where true competition does notyet exist . the second issue is purpa 's requirement that utilities purchase power from qfs . manyinvestor - owned utilities support repeal of these mandatory purchase provisions . they argue that theirstate regulators ' `` misguided '' implementation of purpa has forced them to pay contractually highprices for power that they do not need . opponents of this legislation argue that it would decreasecompetition and impede development of renewable energy . the third main issue is reliability . without mandatory and enforceable reliability standards , proponents argue that reliability of the electric power system will not be at acceptable levels . opponents say these standards are unnecessary . this report will be updated as events warrant .
