for many years , gao has reported that weaknesses in information security are a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences -- such as intrusions by malicious users , compromised networks , and the theft of personally identifiable information -- and has identified information security as a governmentwide high - risk issue . concerned by reports of significant vulnerabilities in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act of 2002 ( fisma ) , which permanently authorized and strengthened the information security program , evaluation , and reporting requirements for federal agencies . in this testimony , gao discusses security incidents reported at federal agencies , the continued weaknesses in information security controls at major federal agencies , agencies ' progress in performing key control activities , and opportunities to enhance fisma reporting and independent evaluations . to address these objectives , gao analyzed agency , inspectors general ( ig ) , and gao issued and draft reports on information security . federal agencies have recently reported a spate of security incidents that put sensitive data at risk . personally identifiable information about millions of americans has been lost , stolen , or improperly disclosed , thereby exposing those individuals to loss of privacy , identity theft , and financial crimes . the wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft , computer intrusions , and privacy breaches underscore the need for improved security practices . as illustrated by these security incidents , significant weaknesses in information security controls threaten the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations , assets , and personnel of federal agencies . almost all of the major federal agencies had weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls . most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent , limit , or detect access to computer networks , systems , or information . for example , agencies did not consistently identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access , apply encryption to protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices , and restrict physical access to information assets . in addition , agencies did not always manage the configuration of network devices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity , such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely manner ; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction ; and maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information systems . an underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully or effectively implemented agencywide information security programs . nevertheless , federal agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements . however , igs at several agencies sometimes disagreed with the agency 's reported information and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities . further , opportunities exist to enhance reporting under fisma and the independent evaluations completed by igs .
