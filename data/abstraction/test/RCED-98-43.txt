pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed various issues concerning the role of certain power marketing administrations ( pma ) and other federal agencies in restructuring electricity markets , focusing on : whether the government operates them and the related electric power assets in a businesslike manner ; and options that congress and other policymakers can pursue to address concerns about the pmas ' role in restructuring markets and about their management . gao noted that : although federal laws and regulations generally require that the pmas recover the full costs of building , operating , and maintaining the federal power plants and transmission assets , in some cases federal statues and the department of energy 's rules are ambiguous about or prohibit the recovery of certain costs ; as gao reported in september 1997 , for fiscal years 1992 through 1996 , the federal government incurred a net cost of $ 1.5 billion from its involvement in the electricity - related activities of the southeastern , southwestern , and western area power administrations ; the $ 1.5 billion was the amount by which the full costs of providing electric power exceeded the revenues from the sale of power ; the availability of federal power plants to generate electricity is below that of nonfederal plants because the federal plants are aging and because the federal planning and budgeting processes , as implemented , do not always ensure that funds are available to make repairs when needed ; the resulting declines in performance decrease the marketability of federal power ; to mitigate these funding delays , the bureau of reclamation , army corps of engineers , pmas and their preference customers have negotiated or are negotiating agreements whereby customers pay for needed repairs in advance ; the net cost to the treasury and the decreased generating availability of the federal power plants -- when combined with the competitive pressures on all electricity suppliers to decrease their rates and the need to recoup some federal hydropower projects ' environmental costs -- create varying degrees of risk that some of the federal investment in certain hydropower plants and facilities will not be repaid ; although the recovery of most of the federal investment in southeastern 's , southwestern 's , and western 's hydropower - related facilities is relatively secure , up to $ 1.4 billion out of about $ 7.2 billion of the federal investment in the electricity - related assets of these pmas is at some risk of nonrecovery ; and three general options are available for the bureau , the corps , southeastern , southwestern , and western to address their roles in emerging restructured electricity markets : the bureau and the corps could continue generating and the pmas could continue marketing power as in the past ; the current ownership structure could be maintained while improving how the federal assets are managed and operated ; and the federal government could divest the pmas ; the pmas and the generating assets ; or the pmas , the generating assets , and the dam reservoirs .
