in july 2015 , multilateral talks with iran culminated in an agreement called the jcpoa , through which iran committed to limits on its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions put in place by the united states and other nations . iaea , an independent international organization that administers safeguards designed to detect and deter the diversion of nuclear material for nonpeaceful purposes , was requested to verify and monitor iran 's implementation of these commitments . the u.s. department of state coordinates the united states ' financial and policy relationship with iaea . gao was asked to review the authorities and resources iaea has to carry out its activities regarding the jcpoa . this report , which updates the preliminary findings from an interim report released in february 2016 ( gao - 16-417 ) , examines the jcpoa commitments that iaea has been asked to verify and monitor and its authorities to do so , the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor those jcpoa commitments , and potential challenges and mitigating actions iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying and monitoring the jcpoa . gao analyzed the jcpoa and key iaea documents and interviewed current and former iaea officials , u.s. government officials , national laboratory representatives , and experts from research institutions . as outlined in the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) was asked to verify and monitor iran 's implementation of a range of nuclear - related commitments . iaea is using its safeguards authorities and conducting additional activities agreed to by iran under the jcpoa to do so . iran 's commitments include limits on uranium enrichment levels and on enriched uranium inventories . iaea is verifying and monitoring iran 's implementation of these commitments through a range of activities conducted by its safeguards department , such as inspecting iran 's nuclear facilities , analyzing environmental samples , and monitoring iran 's uranium mines and mills . under the jcpoa , iran agreed to provisionally apply the additional protocol , an agreement that will give iaea 's inspectors access to an expanded range of locations , including where the agency seeks assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities . the jcpoa also includes a mechanism in which participants to the agreement commit to resolve an access request from the agency within 24 days after the request is made . iaea has identified the financial , human , and technical resources necessary to verify and monitor iran 's nuclear - related commitments in the jcpoa . iaea has estimated that it needs approximately $ 10 million per year for 15 years in additional funding above its current safeguards budget for jcpoa verification . according to iaea documents , this $ 10 million will be entirely funded through extra - budgetary contributions through 2016. iaea officials said that the agency intends to propose that of the $ 10 million approximately $ 5.7 million for all additional protocol activities and inspector costs attributable to the jcpoa be funded through iaea 's regular budget after 2016 ; approximately $ 4.4 million will be supported through extra - budgetary contributions from member states , such as the united states . iaea also plans to transfer 18 experienced inspectors to its office of safeguards verification in iran from other safeguards divisions and to hire and train additional inspectors . according to iaea officials , existing safeguards technical resources are sufficient to implement the jcpoa . iaea may face potential challenges in verifying and monitoring iran 's implementation of certain nuclear - related commitments in the jcpoa . according to current and former iaea and u.s. officials and expert organizations , these potential challenges include integrating jcpoa - related funding into iaea 's regular budget and managing human resources in the safeguards program , access challenges depending on iran 's cooperation and the untested jcpoa mechanism to resolve access issues , and the inherent challenge of detecting undeclared nuclear materials and activities . iaea has identified mitigating actions , such as utilizing remote monitoring and cost - free experts to address potential understaffing of iaea safeguards activities in other countries as additional experienced inspectors are transferred to work on iran - related safeguards . in addition , according to iaea and u.s. officials as well as a former iaea official gao interviewed , iaea has improved its capabilities in detecting undeclared activity . for example , according to u.s. officials , iaea has adapted its inspector training program to focus on potential indicators of undeclared activities . gao is not making any recommendations .
