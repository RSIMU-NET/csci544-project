the environmental protection agency ( epa ) performs limited oversight of states ' processes for verifying the accuracy of large industrial facilities ' emissions reports . epa 's data show that most emissions determinations from large sources are based on generic emissions factors . although epa allows facilities to estimate their emissions in this manner , epa officials generally consider direct methods to be more reliable . the accuracy of these reports is important because they influence the financing of states ' regulatory programs through fees and the development of emissions inventories , which , in turn , help regulators to develop control strategies and establish permit limits . furthermore , steps taken to assess the accuracy of these reports , such as more thoroughly reviewing the supporting information , could improve compliance with clean air act requirements . for example , a more thorough review of the information underlying a facility 's emission reports , or a more systematic comparison of these reports over time , could identify increased emissions . such indications could , in turn , trigger a review of compliance with new source review requirements , an area in which epa found widespread noncompliance in four industries . in the four states that gao reviewed , the states that had done the most detailed reviews found widespread inaccuracies . although it is taking steps to improve its overall compliance monitoring strategy , epa does not plan to evaluate states ' processes for verifying emissions reports from large facilities .
