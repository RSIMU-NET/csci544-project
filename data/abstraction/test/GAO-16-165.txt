the mining law of 1872 encouraged development of the west by opening up federal land to exploration , extraction , and development of hardrock minerals such as gold , silver , and copper . because mining creates the potential for serious health , safety , and environmental hazards , blm and the forest service have processes for reviewing mine plans submitted by operators to help prevent and mitigate these hazards . a mine plan details the proposed mine 's operations , such as the methods for mining and reclaiming the site once operations have concluded . gao was asked to assess the mine plan review process . this report examines the number of mine plans blm and the forest service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , among other things , and challenges that have affected the length of time for blm and the forest service to complete the review process , as well as actions these agencies have taken to address these challenges . gao obtained and analyzed mine plan review data from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , and interviewed agency officials in 23 offices , representing the 12 western states where hardrock mining occurs . the results are not generalizable to all locations conducting mine plan reviews . from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , the department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) and the department of agriculture 's forest service approved 68 mine plans of operation . the length of time it took the agencies to approve the mine plans ranged from about 1 month to over 11 years , and averaged approximately 2 years . of the 68 approved mine plans , 13 had not begun operations as of november 2015. agency officials attribute this to difficulties mine operators may face , such as obtaining other required federal and state permits . blm and forest service officials gao interviewed said they experienced 13 key challenges that affected the length of time to review hardrock mine plans . the two most frequently cited were the low quality of information operators provided in their mine plans and the agencies ' limited allocation of resources for their hardrock mining programs . to address the low quality of information in mine plans , some blm and forest service officials held pre - mine plan submittal meetings with operators . however , officials do not always do so because blm does not have specific guidance on how to implement these meetings , and forest service does not have any guidance instructing them to do so . federal standards for internal control state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals . without taking further actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions , blm and the forest service may be missing opportunities to help expedite the review process . to address the limited allocation of resources , blm and forest service officials are leveraging existing resources by collaborating with other agencies , among other actions , but neither agency has fully used its authority to collect fees for conducting mine plan reviews as authorized by law . in addition , forest service is not authorized to retain these fees , as blm is , but has not proposed the legislative changes that would allow it to retain fees , as is suggested by office of management and budget guidance . blm officials said the agency has not prioritized cost recovery for certain types of environmental analyses , and forest service officials were unaware of these authorities . by not using these authorities , blm and forest service may be missing opportunities to expedite the mine plan review process . gao recommends , among other things , that the agencies take actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions and seek additional recovery of the costs associated with conducting mine plan reviews . the agencies generally concurred with these recommendations .
