the agriculture appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , except for the forest service . it also funds the food and drug administration ( fda ) and — in even - numbered fiscal years — the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) . ( for cftc , the agriculture appropriations subcommittee has jurisdiction in the house but not in the senate . ) . agriculture appropriations include both mandatory and discretionary spending . discretionary amounts , though , are the primary focus during the bill 's development , since mandatory amounts are generally set by authorizing laws such as the farm bill . the largest discretionary spending items are the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) ; agricultural research ; fda ; rural development ; foreign food aid and trade ; farm assistance programs ; food safety inspection ; conservation ; and animal and plant health programs . the main mandatory spending items are the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , child nutrition , crop insurance , and the farm commodity and conservation programs paid by the commodity credit corporation . the fy2017 appropriation for agriculture and related agencies was enacted on may 5 , 2017 , as part of the consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 115-31 , division a ) . the fiscal year started on october 1 , 2016 , under continuing resolutions ( crs ) that continued fy2016 funding with a few exceptions . the house and the senate appropriations committees reported their fy2017 agriculture appropriations bills ( h.r . 5054 , s. 2956 ) in april and may 2016. the discretionary total of the enacted appropriation is $ 20.877 billion , which is $ 623 million less than enacted in fy2016 ( - 2.9 % ) . it achieves this primarily by increasing budgetary offsets over the fy2016 level through greater rescissions of prior appropriations and greater scorekeeping adjustments . however , the budget authority for fy2017 provided to agencies in the major titles of the bill actually increases by $ 462 million compared to fy2016 . increases primarily include $ 163 million more for discretionary conservation programs than in fy2016 , $ 119 million more for rural development , $ 65 million more for discretionary domestic nutrition programs , $ 52 million more for animal and plant health programs , $ 51 million more for agricultural research programs , $ 42 million more for the food and drug administration , $ 29 million more for the farm service agency , $ 20 million more for usda administrative facilities , and $ 17 million more for food safety inspections . reductions primarily come from a rescission of unused domestic nutrition assistance funding ( $ 850 million rescission ) , supplemental funding for international food aid ( $ 116 million less than in fy2016 ) , agricultural research facilities ( $ 112 million less ) , greater use of a disaster designation that does not count against budget caps ( $ 76 million extra offset ) , and disaster assistance ( $ 38 million less ) . the appropriation also carries mandatory spending that totaled about $ 132.5 billion . the overall total of the fy2017 agricultural appropriation therefore exceeded $ 153 billion .
