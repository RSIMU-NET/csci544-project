children 's deaths from maltreatment are especially distressing because they involve a failure on the part of adults who were responsible for protecting them . questions have been raised as to whether the federal national child abuse and neglect data system ( ncands ) , which is based on voluntary state reports to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , fully captures the number or circumstances of child fatalities from maltreatment . gao was asked to examine the extent to which hhs collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment , the challenges states face in collecting and reporting this information to hhs , and the assistance hhs provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child maltreatment fatalities . gao analyzed 2009 ncands data -- the latest data available -- conducted a nationwide web - based survey of state child welfare administrators , visited three states , interviewed hhs and other officials , and reviewed research and relevant federal laws and regulations . more children have likely died from maltreatment than are counted in ncands , and hhs does not take full advantage of available information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment deaths . ncands estimated that 1,770 children in the united states died from maltreatment in fiscal year 2009. according to gao 's survey , nearly half of states included data only from child welfare agencies in reporting child maltreatment fatalities to ncands , yet not all children who die from maltreatment have had contact with these agencies , possibly leading to incomplete counts . hhs also collects but does not report some information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment fatalities that could be useful for prevention , such as perpetrators ' previous maltreatment of children . the national center for child death review ( nccdr ) , a nongovernmental organization funded by hhs , collects more detailed data on circumstances from 39 states , but these data on child maltreatment deaths have not yet been synthesized or published . states face numerous challenges in collecting child maltreatment fatality data and reporting to ncands . at the local level , lack of evidence and inconsistent interpretations of maltreatment challenge investigators -- such as law enforcement , medical examiners , and child welfare officials -- in determining whether a child 's death was caused by maltreatment . without medical evidence , it can be difficult to determine that a child 's death was caused by abuse or neglect , such as in cases of shaken baby syndrome , when external injuries may not be readily visible . at the state level , limited coordination among jurisdictions and state agencies , in part due to confidentiality or privacy constraints , poses challenges for reporting data to ncands . hhs provides assistance to help states report child maltreatment fatalities , although states would like additional help . for example , hhs hosts an annual ncands technical assistance conference , provides individual state assistance , and , through nccdr , has developed resources to help states collect information on child deaths . however , there has been limited collaboration between hhs and nccdr on child maltreatment fatality information or prevention strategies to date . state officials indicated a need for additional information on how to coordinate across state agencies to collect more complete information on child maltreatment fatalities . states are also increasingly interested in collecting and using information on near fatalities from maltreatment . gao recommends that the secretary of hhs take steps to further strengthen data quality , expand available information on child fatalities , improve information sharing , and estimate the costs and benefits of collecting national data on near fatalities . in its comments , hhs agreed with gao 's findings and recommendations and provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
