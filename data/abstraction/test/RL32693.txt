distributional issues often lie at the center of tax policy debates . distributional analysis may address several issues : how should the tax burden be distributed or , are progressive ( increasing as a share of income as income rises ) taxes justified ? . what is the estimated distribution of the current system ? . how does a particular proposal change that distribution ? . unlike many analyses that study optimal behavior related to allocative issues and economic efficiency , economic analysis can not be used to answer the questions of how the tax burden should be distributed . such an answer would depend on social preferences . economic analysis can , however , identify trade - offs and frame the issue analytically . for example , a number of plausible answers to this question could justify progressive tax structures . methodological issues , such as the income classifier , the unit of analysis , and assumptions regarding incidence all affect the estimates of the distribution of the current tax burden . yet all show a similar qualitative result : the federal tax system is progressive throughout its range , although it tends to get much flatter at the top . this pattern is primarily due to the individual income tax , which is quite progressive , and actually provides subsidies at lower - income levels . the other major tax is the payroll tax , which is a larger burden than the individual income tax for more than 80 % of the population . this tax is first progressive and then regressive ( effective tax rates fall with income ) . the corporate income and the estate taxes , while much smaller , are also progressive , whereas excise taxes are regressive . this overall progressive pattern has been in place historically , and is expected to continue in the future , although effective tax rates are currently low compared with other periods . unlike the federal tax system , state and local taxes tend to be regressive . thus , a progressive federal tax system would be necessary to prevent overall u.s. taxes from being regressive . the combined taxes appear slightly progressive . looking at taxes from a lifetime perspective would move the system more toward a proportional tax because average lifetime incomes reduces the variability of income . studies have suggested that overall lifetime taxes are roughly proportional to income . many different measures have been used to characterize the effects of a particular tax change on the distribution of income . a very different impression of tax changes may be obtained depending on the measure used . one popular measure , the percentage change in tax , can be misleading , because as taxes become very small even a negligible absolute change in taxes leads to a very large percentage change . for measuring the relative distribution of income , percentage change in disposable income provides a better measure of how resources are distributed . by this measure , the recent tax cuts made incomes less equal . this report will not be updated .
