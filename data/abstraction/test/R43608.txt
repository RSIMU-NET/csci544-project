high - frequency trading ( hft ) is a broad term without a precise legal or regulatory definition . it is used to describe what many characterize as a subset of algorithmic trading that involves very rapid placement of orders , in the realm of tiny fractions of a second . regulators have been scrutinizing hft practices for years , but public concern about this form of trading intensified following the april 2014 publication of a book by author michael lewis . the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , department of justice ( doj ) , securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , office of the new york attorney general , and massachusetts secretary of commerce have begun hft - related probes . critics of hft have raised several concerns about its impact . one criticism relates to its generation of so - called phantom liquidity , in which market liquidity that appears to be provided by hft may be fleeting and transient due to the posting and then almost immediate cancellation of trading orders . another concern is that hft firms may engage in manipulative strategies that involve the use of quote cancellations . in addition , some observers allege that hft firms are often involved in front - running whereby the firms trade ahead of a large order to buy or sell stocks based on nonpublic market information about an imminent trade . another criticism is that hft has increased the level of potential market systemic risk whereby shocks to a small number of active hft traders could then detrimentally affect the entire market . a related concern is whether hft could exacerbate market volatility . these concerns have percolated since the `` flash crash '' of may 6 , 2010 , when the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) fell by roughly 1,000 points in intraday trading — the largest one - day decline in the history of the djia . the crash was analyzed in an investigative report by the sec and cftc which , among other factors , looked at the role hft may have played . the report determined that hft was not the cause but may have exacerbated the crash . another area of criticism is that hft often involves two - tiered markets in which hft firms pay extra for the right to access data feeds or to collocate their servers within exchanges ' servers — all of which is designed to give some traders an advantage over others . hft 's supporters argue that the increased trading provided by hft adds market liquidity and reduces market volatility . they contend that hft is a technological innovation that is the latest evolutionary stage in a long history of securities market making and assert that hft has reduced the bid - ask spreads in stock trading , thereby lowering trading costs . congressional interest in hft and the flash crash has manifested itself in the 113th congress both legislatively and in the congressional oversight of the sec and cftc . legislatively , s. 410 ( harkin ) , h.r . 880 ( defazio ) , and h.r . 1579 ( ellison ) would levy taxes on various financial trades , including trades conducted by hft traders . h.r . 2292 ( markey ) would require the cftc to provide a regulatory definition of hft in the derivatives markets it oversees and require those who do hft to register with the cftc . in june 2014 , sec chairman mary jo white announced that in response to concerns over `` aggressive , destabilizing trading strategies in vulnerable market conditions , '' the agency was pursuing several hft - related reform proposals , including requiring unregistered hft firms to register with the sec . this report provides an overview of hft in the equities and derivatives markets regulated by the sec and cftc . it also examines the flash crash of 2010 and the role that hft may have played as well as recent regulatory developments .
