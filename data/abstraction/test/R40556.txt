as of the date of this report , members in the 111th congress have introduced nine stand - alone proposals that would control greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions . the proposals offered to date would employ market - based approaches — either a cap - and - trade or carbon tax system , or some combination thereof — to reduce ghg emissions . the legislative proposals are varied in their overall approaches in controlling ghg emissions . some control emissions by setting a quantity ( or cap ) ; others control emissions by setting a price ( or tax / fee ) . in addition , the proposals differ in their inclusion of particular design elements , such as whether or not to allow offsets ( emission reduction opportunities from economic sectors not directly addressed by the primary approach ) . h.r . 2454 , the american clean energy and security act of 2009 ( waxman / markey ) , and s. 1733 , the clean energy jobs and american power act ( kerry / boxer ) , have been the primary energy and climate change legislative vehicles in the 111th congress . on june 26 , 2009 , the house passed h.r . 2454. on november 5 , the committee approved senator boxer 's `` manager 's amendment '' as a substitute , and ordered s. 1733 reported . in addition to establishing a cap - and - trade system to regulate ghg emissions , both h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 would address energy efficiency , renewable energy , and other energy topics . other proposals — h.r . 1862 ( van hollen ) and h.r . 1666 ( doggett ) — would control emissions by limiting quantity , but would differ in their structure and implementation . three of the proposals — h.r . 594 ( stark ) , h.r . 1337 ( larson ) , and h.r . 2380 ( inglis ) — would use a carbon tax approach to address carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions from fossil fuel combustion . other proposals do not fit precisely into either a price or quantity control category . h.r . 1683 ( mcdermott ) would establish a program that may be described as a dynamic carbon tax : its tax rate would be linked with annual emission allocations ( or caps ) . s. 2877 ( cantwell ) would establish a co2 emission control program on fossil fuel producers and importers . although the bill would limit the number of carbon shares auctioned each year , the auctions would include a price safety valve , allowing for the purchase of additional shares . to counter the emissions from these additional shares ( above the cap ) , the price safety - valve revenues would be used to support mitigation efforts outside of the emission control program . on may 12 , 2010 , senators kerry and lieberman released a draft of new climate change legislation . a comprehensive energy and climate change policy proposal , the draft would set ghg reduction goals similar to those of h.r . 2454. the proposal would employ a market - based cap - and - trade scheme for electric generators and industry with a separate set - price mechanism to allocate allowances to cover transportation fuels . a key element in ghg emission reduction bills is how , to whom , and for what purpose the value of emission allowances or carbon tax revenue would be distributed . the distribution strategy is a critical policy decision , because it would affect ( 1 ) the overall cost of the program and ( 2 ) how program costs are distributed throughout the economy . in the early years of the program , h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 would distribute allowances at no cost to both covered and non - covered entities to support various policy objectives . in addition , an increasing percentage of the allowances would be sold through auction . as with the distribution of no - cost allowances , auction revenues would be used to further various policy objectives .
