on january 25 , 2017 , president donald j. trump issued executive order ( eo ) 13768 , `` enhancing public safety in the interior of the united states . . among other things , the eo raises questions regarding whether , and to what extent , federal agencies will withhold federal grant funds that would have otherwise been awarded to a designated `` sanctuary jurisdiction . . under the eo , the secretary of homeland security ( secretary ) is directed to designate a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction at his discretion , and to the extent consistent with law , for those jurisdictions found to have willfully refused to comply with 8 u.s.c . 1373 , `` communication between government agencies and the immigration and naturalization service . . among other things , the eo raises questions regarding potential restrictions of federal grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions . this report discusses several questions that might be raised regarding the implementation of the executive order by federal grant - making agencies ( also known as `` federal awarding agencies '' ) and the impact on federal grant funding for designated sanctuary jurisdictions . because of the complexity of implementing a centralized policy such as the eo through the decentralized structure of federal grants administration practices , there is uncertainty in determining the impact of the eo on federal grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions . this could be affected by the discretion exercised by the attorney general and the secretary in defining a `` federal grant , '' determining which programs are exempted because of providing necessary funding for law enforcement purposes , and determining what constitutes a `` sanctuary jurisdiction . . the impact of the eo on federal grant funding could also be affected by how federal grant awarding agencies utilize discretion in administering the grant programs , including review of eligibility and conditioning federal grant awards .
