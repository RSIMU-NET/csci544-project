this report provides a chronology of selected events leading up to and following thediscoveries of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , or `` mad cow disease '' ) in north america . these are primarily regulatory , legal , and congressional developments that are frequently referencedin the ongoing policy debate . the chronology generally does not contain entries for the introductionof the many bse - related bills introduced into this or previous congresses , except for those in recentyears where committee or floor action has occurred . this report , which will be updated if significantdevelopments ensue , is intended to be used alongside other crs reports that provide morebackground and context for the bse policy debate , and that cover many specific legislativeproposals . the chronology begins in 1986 , when bse was first identified by a british laboratory . asthe united kingdom and others attempted to understand and contain bse , the u.s. and canadiangovernments were establishing panels to study the disease and began instituting a series ofsafeguards aimed at keeping it out of north america or stopping any spread if it should occur here . the chronology proceeds into may 2003 , when canada reported the first native case in northamerica ; december 2003 , when the united states reported finding a case in a u.s. herd ; and mostof 2004 , when both countries worked to reassure consumers of the safety of north american cattleand beef and to reopen foreign markets blocking these exports . u.s. and canadian officials since2003 also have been strengthening various regulatory safeguards aimed at protecting the cattle herdand the food supply from bse . the chronology continues with major events of 2004 , 2005 , and the first half of 2006 , whichhave revolved around efforts to re - establish more open cattle and beef trade within north america , even while a handful of new cases of bse have emerged here , and the steps being taken to regainthe japanese and korean markets , which were until december 2003 two of the four leading foreignbuyers of u.s. beef . both were closed as of mid - 2006 ( although japan appeared on the verge ofreopening as of this writing ) . congress can be expected to continue to play a role , holding oversighthearings , providing funding for bse - related activities , and possibly considering legislative optionsto address one or more of the outstanding issues .
