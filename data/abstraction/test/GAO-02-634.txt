prescription drug diversion is the channeling of pharmaceuticals for illegal purposes or abuse . according to the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , increased prescription drug abuse and emergency room admissions , as well as the theft and illegal resale of prescription drugs , indicate that drug diversion is a growing problem associated with addiction , overdose , and death . all 15 state prescription drug monitoring programs ( pdmp ) collect information about the prescribing , dispensing , and use of prescription drugs and distribute it to medical practitioners , pharmacies , and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies . however , the programs differ in terms of objectives , design , and operations . in addition to helping law enforcement identify and prevent prescription drug diversion , program objectives also include education of the public , physicians , and pharmacists about the nature and extent of the problem , and medical treatment options for abusers of diverted drugs . the programs ' designs vary by specific drugs covered and by the type of state agency in which they are housed . some programs use the prescription data proactively to identify trends or patterns of use and to respond to law enforcement requests . others use it only to respond to requests . states with pdmps improve the timeliness of law enforcement and regulatory investigations . states considering establishing a pdmp , or expanding an existing one , face several challenges . these include educating the public and policymakers about prescription drug diversion and abuse and the benefits of a pdmp , responding to the concerns of physicians , patients , and pharmacists regarding the confidentiality of prescription information , and funding for program development and operations . national efforts to assist states in addressing illegal diversion have focused on providing guidance and technical assistance .
