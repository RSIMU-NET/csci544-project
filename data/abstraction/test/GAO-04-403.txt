in october 2001 , in response to the taliban regime 's protection of al qaeda terrorists who attacked the united states , coalition forces forcibly removed the regime from afghanistan . in december 2002 , congress passed the afghanistan freedom support act authorizing assistance funds to help afghanistan rebuild a stable , democratic society . the act directed gao to monitor the implementation of u.s. humanitarian and development assistance . this report analyzes , for fiscal years 2002-2003 , u.s. obligations and expenditures in afghanistan , results of assistance projects , the assistance coordination mechanisms and strategy , and major obstacles that affected the achievement of u.s. goals . of the $ 900 million that the u.s. government spent on nonsecurity - related assistance in afghanistan in fiscal years 2002-2003 , over 75 percent supported humanitarian efforts , including emergency food and shelter , and over 20 percent supported longer - term reconstruction . usaid , the department of state , and the department of defense spent $ 508 million , $ 254 million , and $ 64 million , respectively , for humanitarian , quick - impact , and some longer - term projects . u.s. funding represented about 38 percent of the $ 3.7 billion the international community disbursed over the 2-year period . u.s. humanitarian and short - term assistance benefited afghanistan , but longerterm reconstruction efforts achieved limited results by the end of fiscal year 2003 due to late funding . by providing food and shelter to returning refugees and other vulnerable populations , early u.s. assistance helped avert a humanitarian crisis . usaid 's and defense 's quick - impact projects also helped rebuild smallscale infrastructure such as schools and bridges . usaid initiated several longerterm reconstruction activities , such as repairing the kabul - kandahar road and starting a democracy program . however , because of delays in funding most major assistance contracts were not signed until summer 2003 , limiting the results in fiscal years 2002-2003. u.s. coordination mechanisms for afghanistan assistance were generally effective , but international assistance was not well coordinated in fiscal years 2002-2003. in addition , the united states lacked a complete and integrated assistance strategy , which hampered the u.s. government 's ability to focus available resources and hold itself accountable for measurable results . further , u.s. officials responsible for coordinating efforts lacked complete financial data , which hindered their ability to oversee the assistance . in fiscal years 2002-2003 , afghanistan confronted many obstacles that other postconflict nations have faced , such as multiple competing parties . in addition , security deteriorated and opium production increased , thereby jeopardizing u.s. reconstruction efforts . lack of staff , poor working conditions , and delayed reconstruction funding further impeded u.s. efforts . in september 2003 , to expedite progress , the u.s. government announced the `` accelerating success '' initiative , providing $ 1.76 billion for reconstruction in 2004 .
