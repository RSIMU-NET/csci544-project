according to the navy , the primary purpose of forward - deployed naval forces is to project power from the sea to influence events ashore . to be successful , naval forces must be able to gain access to , and operate in the coastal areas of potential adversaries . consequently , they must be able to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines and other antiship weapons . finally , they must be able to launch and support offensive operations against enemy forces ashore . this report assesses the navy 's existing mine countermeasures , antisubmarine warfare , ship self - defense , surface fire support capabilities , and progress in the acquisition programs the navy is pursuing to address shortfalls in these areas . gao found that the navy 's current force of specialized ships , helicopters , and other assets developed to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines lack several key warfighting capabilities it needs for shoreline operations . although the navy is making some progress in overcoming shortfalls in antisubmarine warfare , a lack of resources and priorities among competing programs persists . the navy 's ship defense capabilities against cruise missiles are marginal , and surface ships will be at risk when operating within the range of these weapons . the navy will not meet the marine corps ' naval surface fire support requirements for at least another decade . the navy has shown limited progress in overcoming shortfalls in the acquisition programs it is pursuing .
