nonprofits are key partners in delivering federal services yet reportedly often struggle to cover their indirect costs ( costs not readily identifiable with particular programs or projects ) . this raises concerns about fiscal strain on the sector . to provide information on nonprofits ' indirect cost reimbursement , especially when funding flows through entities such as state and local governments , gao was asked to review , for selected grants and nonprofits , how indirect cost terminology and classification vary , how indirect costs are reimbursed , and if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed , steps taken to bridge gaps . gao selected six departments of health and human services and housing and urban development grants and 17 nonprofits in louisiana , maryland , and wisconsin . gao selected these agencies for their historical relationship with nonprofits . gao reviewed policies and documents governing indirect costs and interviewed relevant officials . gao also reviewed research on nonprofits ' indirect costs . depending on the grant program , nonprofits may be reimbursed for indirect costs ( generally costs such as rent or utilities ) , administrative costs ( generally cost activities such as accounting or personnel ) , both , or neither . omb officials said costs can be classified as either indirect or direct , and administrative cost activities are usually , but not always , classified as indirect costs . however , inconsistencies in the use and meaning of the terms indirect and administrative , and their relationship to each other , has made it difficult for state and local governments and nonprofits to classify costs consistently . this has resulted in varying interpretations of what activity costs are indirect versus administrative . as omb guidance on cost principles for nonprofits recognizes ( 2 cfr part 230 ) , because nonprofit organizations have diverse characteristics and accounting practices , it is not possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect in all situations . this increases the challenges of administering federal grants and , in some cases , makes it difficult for recipients to determine those activities eligible for indirect cost reimbursement under a particular federal grant and those that are not . gao found differences in the rate in which state and local governments reimburse nonprofits for indirect costs . these differences , including whether nonprofits are reimbursed at all , largely depend on the policies and practices of the state and local governments that award federal funds to nonprofits . federal grants often provide wide latitude in setting cost reimbursement policies and practices , and some state and local governments do not reimburse these costs at all . those that do can often choose the reimbursement rate . as a result , gao found that variations in indirect cost reimbursement exist not only among different grants , but also within the same grant across different states . gao found that nonprofits fund indirect costs with a variety of federal and nonfederal funding sources , and that when indirect cost reimbursement is less than the amount of indirect costs nonprofits determine they have incurred , most nonprofits gao interviewed take steps to bridge the gap . they may reduce the population served or the scope of services offered , and may forgo or delay physical infrastructure and technology improvements and staffing needs . because many nonprofits view cuts in clients served or services offered as unpalatable , they reported that they often compromise vital `` back - office '' functions , which over time can affect their ability to meet their missions . further , nonprofits ' strained resources limit their ability to build a financial safety net , which can create a precarious financial situation for them . absent a sufficient safety net , nonprofits that experience delays in receiving their federal funding may be inhibited in their ability to bridge funding gaps . when funding is delayed , some nonprofits said they either borrow funds on a line of credit or use cash reserves to provide services and pay bills until their grant awards are received . collectively , these issues place stress on the nonprofit sector , diminishing its ability to continue to effectively partner with the federal government to provide services to vulnerable populations .
