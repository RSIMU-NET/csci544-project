the department of defense ( dod ) is increasingly reliant on software and information systems for its weapon capabilities , and dod prime contractors are subcontracting more of their software development . the increased reliance on software and a greater number of suppliers results in more opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in defense software . in addition , dod has reported that countries hostile to the united states are focusing resources on information warfare strategies . therefore , software security , including the need for protection of software code from malicious activity , is an area of concern for many dod programs . gao was asked to examine dod 's efforts to identify software development suppliers and manage risks related to foreign involvement in software development on weapon systems . dod acquisition and software security policies do not fully address the risk of using foreign suppliers to develop weapon system software . the current acquisition guidance allows program officials discretion in managing foreign involvement in software development , without requiring them to identify and mitigate such risks . moreover , other policies intended to mitigate information system vulnerabilities focus mostly on operational software security threats , such as external hacking and unauthorized access to information systems , but not on insider threats , such as the insertion of malicious code by software developers . recent dod initiatives may provide greater focus on these risks , but to date have not been adopted as practice within dod . while dod has begun to recognize potential risks from foreign software content , this is not always the case within the weapon programs where software is developed or acquired . program officials for the systems in this review did not make foreign involvement in software development a specific element of their risk identification and mitigation efforts . as a result , program officials ' knowledge of the foreign developed software included in their weapon systems varied . in addition , risk mitigation efforts emphasized program level risks , such as meeting program cost and schedule goals , instead of software security risks . further , program officials often delegated risk mitigation and source selection to contractors who are primarily concerned with software functionality and quality assurance , rather than specifically addressing software security for development risks associated with foreign suppliers . unless program officials provide specific guidance , contractors may favor business considerations over potential software development security risks associated with using foreign suppliers . as the amount of software on weapon systems increases , it becomes more difficult and costly to test every line of code . further , dod can not afford to monitor all worldwide software development facilities or provide clearances for all potential software developers . therefore , the program manager must know more about who is developing software and where early in the software acquisition process , so that it can be included as part of software source selection and risk mitigation decisions .
