the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and its contractors administer and implement the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) . gao designated nfip as a high - risk area in march 2006 , and as of december 2007 , fema owed more than $ 17.3 billion to the treasury for hurricane - related losses . concerns have been raised about the financial condition of nfip and fema 's efforts to mitigate losses and monitor nfip contractors . this report describes statistical and financial trends for nfip from 1997 through 2006 , assesses the extent to which flood - damaged properties were purchased to mitigate risk , and evaluates procedures for monitoring nfip - related contracts . for this study , gao analyzed financial and statistical data on the nfip and its mitigation programs , reviewed documentation of contract monitoring activities , and interviewed fema officials and contractors . the number of federal flood insurance policies in force nationwide increased 36 percent from 1997 through 2006 , but most homeowners at risk of flooding still lacked such insurance . while average insurance amounts ( per policy ) increased 78 percent from 1997 through 2006- - consistent with rising home values -- the average premium decreased 3 percent from 1997 through 2006 , likely driven in part by the increase in policies sold in moderate - to low - risk areas . conversely , loss amounts fluctuated by year , peaking at more than $ 17.7 billion in 2005. seventy - nine percent of the funds paid out through nfip from 1997 through 2006 were for hurricane - related claims , but the percentages in individual years varied widely ( correlating with hurricane activity ) . finally , the extent of claim payments attributed to repetitive loss properties ( those with two or more claims in a rolling 10-year period ) increased from 1997 through 2006 , from $ 3.7 billion to nearly $ 8 billion , with the most significant increases resulting from the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes . because of data limitations , gao was not able to determine the actual number of properties acquired through fema mitigation programs , which are intended to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods . information on completed mitigation projects ( which encompass multiple properties ) indicates that about one - third of properties approved for acquisition from 1997 to 2006 were acquired . however , these data are limited because they do not include a count of properties acquired in ongoing projects . projects may take several years to complete , and fema does not report properties acquired until a project is complete . further , fema collected property acquisition data ( for completed projects ) in an ad hoc manner because fema 's grants management system lacks the capability to record acquisition data . as a result , fema can not readily determine the extent to which flood - damaged and repetitive loss properties have been acquired through its mitigation programs . lack of monitoring records , inconsistent application of procedures , and lack of coordination have diminished the effectiveness of fema monitoring of nfip - related contracts . while federal internal control standards state that records should be properly maintained , fema did not consistently follow its monitoring procedures for preparing or maintaining monitoring reports and was unable to provide copies of the majority of monitoring reports gao requested . further , fema offices did not coordinate information and actions relating to contractor deficiencies and payments . in some cases , key officials were unaware of decisions on contractor performance . as a result , fema can not consistently ensure adherence to contract requirements and lacks information critical for effective oversight of key contractors . given the reliance of nfip upon contractors , it is important that fema have in place adequate controls that are consistently applied to all contracts .
