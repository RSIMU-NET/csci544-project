the agricultural act of 2014 ( 2014 farm bill , p.l . 113-79 ) was enacted on february 7 , 2014. after years of debate and deliberation , the enacted 2014 farm bill included a number of changes to the conservation title ( title ii ) , including program consolidation and reauthorization , amendments to conservation compliance , and a reduction in overall funding . debate on the 2014 farm bill focused on a number of controversial issues . while many did not consider conservation to be controversial , nonetheless , a number of policy issues shaped the final version of the title and ultimately its role in the enacted farm bill . prior to the 2014 farm bill , there were over 20 distinct conservation programs . discussion about simplifying or consolidating conservation programs to reduce overlap and duplication , and to generate savings , has continued for a number of years . the 2014 farm bill contained several program consolidation measures , including the repeal of 12 active and inactive programs , the creation of two new programs , and the merging of two programs into existing ones . overall changes include the following . the act reauthorizes larger conservation programs through fy2018 , including the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) , the conservation stewardship program ( csp ) , and the conservation reserve program ( crp ) . it authorizes a new agricultural conservation easement program ( acep ) , which retains most of the program provisions in the repealed easement programs ( wetlands reserve program [ wrp ] , easements under the grasslands reserve program [ grp ] , and farmland protection program [ fpp ] ) . acep establishes two types of easements : agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements . it authorizes a new regional conservation partnership program ( rcpp ) from the repealed partnership programs ( agricultural water enhancement program [ awep ] , cooperative conservation partnership initiative [ ccpi ] , chesapeake bay watershed program [ cbwp ] , and great lakes basin program for soil erosion and sediment control [ glbp ] ) . rcpp creates partnership opportunities to target and leverage federal conservation funding for specific areas and resource concerns . it incorporates other programs , such as the wildlife habitat incentives program ( whip ) and grazing contracts under grp , into larger reauthorized programs â€” eqip and crp , respectively . one of the most controversial issues in the 2014 farm bill debate was whether federal crop insurance subsidies should be included on the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands . ultimately the 2014 farm bill did add federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of benefits that could be lost and extended limited protection for native sod in select states . the 2014 farm bill also reduced funding for the conservation title by $ 3.97 billion over 10 years . most farm bill conservation programs are authorized to receive mandatory funding , and the conservation title makes up 6 % of the total farm bill 10-year baseline , or $ 58 billion of the total $ 956 billion in mandatory funding authorized in the 2014 farm bill .
