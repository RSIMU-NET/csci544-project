the u.s. government procures billions of dollars in goods and services each year on behalf of foreign governments through the fms program . multiple federal agencies are involved in the fms program ; however , dod manages the procurement process . the fms program is a key component of national security and foreign policy . house report 114-537 included a provision for gao to review certain aspects of dod 's acquisition process such as what effect , if any , certain types of contracts may have on the fms process . this report addresses how the use of firm - fixed - price contracts compares to other contract types awarded for fms and the reasons they are used ; and the factors that may contribute to delays or potentially increase costs . gao has other work addressing the fms process and will issue separate reports . gao analyzed fms procurement data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 , the most current data available to determine trends . gao also selected a non - generalizable sample of 32 fms cases from seven program offices , based on use of different contract types to procure the same item ; reviewed relevant dod and federal acquisition regulations and policies ; and interviewed dod officials . over the past 10 years , firm - fixed - price contracts — where the contractor is paid a set amount regardless of incurred costs — accounted for 99 percent of contract awards and had the highest obligations for foreign military sales ( fms ) . but in recent years , there has been an increased use of fixed - price - incentive contracts — where the government and contractor share in cost savings and risks and the contractor 's ability to earn a profit is tied to its performance . this trend is consistent with recent department of defense ( dod ) contracting practices and aligns with department guidance that emphasizes the use of fixed - price - incentive contracts in certain instances where better pricing outcomes might be achieved . contracting officers generally follow the same acquisition guidance for fms procurements as they do for dod and use various contract types based on assessed risks . for example , for decades , the air force had awarded firm - fixed - price contracts for fms customers to procure an air - to - air missile , but in 2015 transitioned to a fixed - price - incentive contract when it realized the contractor could achieve cost savings through production efficiencies . legislative changes in fiscal year 2017 call for dod to use firm - fixed - price contracts for fms unless a waiver is granted . dod is in the early stages of implementing these revisions and is weighing various factors , such as how waivers will be reviewed . gao found several factors may contribute to delays or increased prices in fms . for example , program officials noted that general acquisition issues , such as delayed contract awards and unforeseen events during production , can similarly affect fms . moreover , military department officials stated that the process for defining requirements is a significant challenge that affects expediency of fms procurements . dod guidance states that programs may combine fms and domestic requirements onto a single contract as a way to lower prices and facilitate timely delivery . however , program offices gao spoke with noted that adequately defining foreign customers ' requirements may prevent them from doing so . to expedite requirements definition , the air force and army implemented checklists to aid foreign partners and program offices when specifying requirements . the navy developed but has not yet disseminated its checklists for use . gao 's analysis of 32 fms cases showed that checklists were not always available to support procurements but that program offices that used them noted increases in timeliness . expanding the use of checklists by dod may better position dod to obtain information needed to deliver equipment and services to fms customers when needed . gao recommends that dod issue department - wide guidance for program offices to expand the use of tools , such as checklists , to aid fms customers in specifying their requirements in a way that dod can act upon in a timely manner . dod concurred with gao 's recommendation .
