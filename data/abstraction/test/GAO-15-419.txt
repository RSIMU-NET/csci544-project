as baby boomers move into retirement each year , the census bureau projects that the age 65-and - older population will grow over 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. several issues call attention to the retirement security of this sizeable population , including a shift in private - sector pension coverage from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans , longer life expectancies , and uncertainty about social security 's long - term financial condition . in light of these developments , gao was asked to review the financial status of workers approaching retirement and of current retirees . gao examined 1 ) the financial resources of workers approaching retirement and retirees and 2 ) the evidence that studies and surveys provide about retirement security for workers and retirees . to conduct this work , gao analyzed household financial data , including retirement savings and income , from the federal reserve 's 2013 survey of consumer finances , reviewed academic studies of retirement savings adequacy , analyzed retirement - related questions from surveys , and interviewed retirement experts about retirement readiness . gao found the data to be reliable for the purposes used in this report . gao received technical comments on a draft of this report from the department of labor and incorporated them as appropriate . many retirees and workers approaching retirement have limited financial resources . about half of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings ( such as in a 401 plan or an ira ) . according to gao 's analysis of the 2013 survey of consumer finances , many older households without retirement savings have few other resources , such as a defined benefit ( db ) plan or nonretirement savings , to draw on in retirement ( see figure below ) . for example , among households age 55 and older , about 29 percent have neither retirement savings nor a db plan , which typically provides a monthly payment for life . households that have retirement savings generally have other resources to draw on , such as non - retirement savings and db plans . among those with some retirement savings , the median amount of those savings is about $ 104,000 for households age 55-64 and $ 148,000 for households age 65-74 , equivalent to an inflation - protected annuity of $ 310 and $ 649 per month , respectively . social security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older . studies and surveys gao reviewed provide mixed evidence about the adequacy of retirement savings . studies range widely in their conclusions about the degree to which americans are likely to maintain their pre - retirement standard of living in retirement , largely because of different assumptions about how much income this goal requires . the studies generally found about one - third to two - thirds of workers are at risk of falling short of this target . in surveys , compared to current retirees , workers age 55 and older expect to retire later and a higher percentage plan to work during retirement . however , one survey found that about half of retirees said they retired earlier than planned due to health problems , changes at their workplace , or other factors , suggesting that many workers may be overestimating their future retirement income and savings . surveys have also found that people age 55-64 are less confident about their finances in retirement than those who are age 65 or older .
