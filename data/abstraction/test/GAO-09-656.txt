under the superfund program , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) places the most seriously contaminated sites on the national priorities list ( npl ) . epa may compel site cleanups by parties responsible for contamination , or conduct cleanups itself and have these parties reimburse its costs . the program is funded by a trust fund , which is largely supported by general fund appropriations . gao was asked to examine epa 's enforcement action outcomes and the factors parties consider in reaching these outcomes ; any trends in litigation to resolve superfund liability ; and the program 's status and costs . gao obtained and analyzed superfund program data from epa , as well as data on superfund litigation from cases filed in u.s. district courts . gao also interviewed epa officials and other superfund experts through fiscal year 2007 , 80 percent of epa 's completed enforcement actions resulted in agreements with responsible parties , and these actions yielded an estimated $ 29.9 billion in recovered costs , work commitments , and other results . while most of this value came from work commitments , responsible parties more often agreed to reimburse epa for its cleanup costs than to conduct site work . epa , the department of justice , and responsible parties make settlement decisions on the basis of site - specific characteristics , but generally also take into account site cleanup costs , the strength of the evidence of a party 's liability for site contamination , and the number and types of responsible parties identified , among other considerations . superfund litigation -- as measured by the number , duration , and complexity of cases -- decreased from fiscal years 1994 through 2007 , the period for which data were available . over this period , the number of superfund cases filed annually in u.s. district courts decreased by almost 50 percent . also , litigation in federally - initiated cases decreased as settlements prior to filing cases in court were reached more often , shortening court time . furthermore , cases became less complex as fewer defendants were involved . litigation costs can be substantial , according to experts , and such costs may have decreased as a result of these trends . litigation decreased because fewer sites were listed on the npl , and , as cleanups progressed , fewer sites required cleanup and parties had less reason to go to court ; epa promoted settlements with responsible parties ; and the courts clarified several legal uncertainties . as of fiscal year 2007 , epa or responsible parties completed construction of remedial actions at about 70 percent of the nonfederal npl sites , with program appropriations averaging about $ 1.2 billion annually . however , gao identified superfund program trends that make it difficult to predict future program costs . the number of sites added to the npl each year has declined ; epa added over 400 sites in fiscal year 1983 , but only 20 sites a year , on average , for fiscal years 1998 through 2007. the types of sites have also changed , as mining sites -- among the most expensive sites to clean up -- have been added to the npl in greater numbers . at the same time , because of limitations in epa 's data , the extent to which npl sites do not have viable parties to assist with cleanups and how this may impact epa 's cost recovery efforts are unclear . further , while remedial actions have been completed or are underway at most npl sites , data limitations make it difficult to quantify the amount of work remaining . also , npl sites that have not yet been cleaned up may be more complex and expensive . finally , program appropriations and expenditures are declining , while epa 's costs for individual sites are increasing . however , epa does not provide the congress with sufficient information to make program funding decisions . for example , epa does not provide aggregated information on the status and cost of work at sites not yet cleaned up or the extent to which it can not identify viable parties . as a result , it is unclear how much funding for future cleanup activities will have to come from trust fund appropriations rather than from responsible parties .
