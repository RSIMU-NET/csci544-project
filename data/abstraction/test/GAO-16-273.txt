gsa annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars making major and minor repairs and alterations to the more than 1,500 federally owned buildings that it holds . gao 's past work has indicated that gsa sometimes encounters “ unforeseen site conditions ” — conditions that are different from what was expected — in performing this work . unforeseen conditions can add both time and cost to repair and alteration projects . gao was asked to review issues related to tenant repair and alteration projects . this report addresses information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions on selected projects , and how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen conditions . gao reviewed 18 non - generalizable repair and alteration projects funded from fiscal year 2010 to 2013 , valued at $ 2 million or more ; interviewed gsa project managers and contracting officers about these projects ; reviewed project documents ; and interviewed a non - generalizable sample of organizations and individuals knowledgeable about the construction industry ( industry stakeholders ) . both industry stakeholders and general services administration ( gsa ) officials told gao that unforeseen conditions in repair and alteration projects are common . such conditions , for example , included an unknown wood subflooring discovered during demolition work . among the impacts identified by the stakeholders were increased project costs and schedule delays . in general , data are limited on unforeseen conditions since gsa does not analyze this type of information . most of the repair and alteration projects gao reviewed — 11 of 18 projects -- experienced an unforeseen condition . the overall impact of the unforeseen conditions on the 18 projects gao reviewed was largely limited . on 9 of the 11 projects that experienced such conditions , the cost to remediate them accounted for 1 to 5 percent of the project 's original construction contract award amount , and on one project the cost was approximately 6 percent . these amounts were below the typical 10 percent construction contingency gsa adds to project costs . schedule impacts were also limited : 4 of the 11 projects experienced delays ranging from 23 to 105 days . gao also found that three projects reviewed that did not experience unforeseen conditions were attached to larger projects that did experience these conditions . in two of these larger projects the cost increases from unforeseen conditions were about $ 2 million each . incomplete building drawings and lack of building information were among the possible causes of the unforeseen conditions experienced in the projects gao reviewed . gsa has a variety of methods to identify and assess risks of unforeseen conditions . gsa 's project planning guide states that , among other things , facility condition assessments and site surveys should be conducted initially . gsa guidance also calls for preparation of a project management plan ( pmp ) , which includes a risk assessment matrix . gao found that , in general , gsa used at least one of its risk identification methods on the projects reviewed . for example , gao found that gsa prepared pmps for 13 of the 18 projects reviewed . three of the remaining five projects were attached to larger projects that had pmps and gsa was unable to provide a pmp for the other two projects . however , gsa 's risk identification was sometimes inconsistent with unforeseen conditions that were actually experienced . for example , on 11 of the projects , gsa did not identify risks that later materialized during the project . the standards for internal control in the federal government state that agencies should comprehensively identify risks using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods . gsa officials told gao that contract change orders are used to document unforeseen conditions that result in a change to the contract , but that these change orders are not analyzed to identify what role these conditions represent on projects or their causes or impacts . as shown in the projects gao reviewed , unforeseen conditions can delay schedules and increase project costs — in some cases in the millions of dollars . analyzing project information such as change orders would allow gsa to better know what role unforeseen conditions play in repair and alteration projects and the magnitude of this risk . gao recommends that gsa develop and implement a plan for analyzing information it collects to identify the role of unforeseen conditions in repair and alteration projects and the specific causes and impacts of these conditions . gsa agreed with the recommendation and the agency stated it will develop a plan to address it .
