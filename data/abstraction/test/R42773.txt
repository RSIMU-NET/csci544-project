a presidential election period is a unique time in america and holds the promise of opportunity , as well as a possible risk to the nation 's security interests . while possible changes in administration during u.s. involvement in national security - related activities are not unique to the 2012-2013 election period , many observers suggest that the current security environment may portend a time of increased risk to the current presidential election period . whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm the nation 's security interests during the 2012-2013 election period , or the existing or new president experiences a relatively peaceful period during the transition , many foreign policy and security challenges will await the administration . collaboration and coordination during the presidential election period between the current administration and that of a potentially new one may have a long - lasting effect on the new president 's ability to effectively safeguard u.s. interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president . this report discusses historical national security - related presidential transition activities , provides a representative sampling of national security issues a new administration may encounter , and offers considerations and options relevant to each of the five phases of the presidential election period . each phase has distinct challenges and opportunities for the incoming administration , the outgoing administration , and congress . this report is intended to provide a framework for national security considerations during the current election period and will be updated to reflect the election outcome .
