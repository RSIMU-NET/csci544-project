pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the honor and conduct adjudicatory systems at the department of defense ( dod ) service academies , focusing on : how the systems at each academy compare ; the due process protections of these systems ; and the students ' attitudes and perceptions toward these systems . gao found that : although the honor systems at the academies have many similarities , there are some prominent differences among them ; the honor codes at the military and air force academies include non - toleration clauses that make it an honor offense to know about an honor offense and not report it , while at the naval academy failure to act on a suspected honor violation is a conduct offense ; differences also exist in the standard of proof that is used in honor hearings , `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' used at the air force academy versus `` a preponderance of the evidence '' used at the other academies ; academy honor hearings provide students with the majority of the protections typically associated with procedural due process , with some exceptions and limitations ; the most prominent limitations exist on the right to representation by counsel and the right to remain silent and avoid self - incrimination ; all three academies impose a limitation on the right to counsel by prohibiting military or civilian lawyers from representing cadets and midshipmen in the hearing itself ; the right to remain silent is not granted until the individual is actually charged with an offense ; responses to a gao questionnaire indicated that academy students generally saw their honor systems as fair ; in some cases , whether an act constitutes an honor violation is not completely clear because the intent of the accused must be inferred from the investigative and hearing processes ; there was considerable reluctance among students to report their fellow students for honor violations ; in general , the administrative conduct systems at the military and naval academies provide several due process protections , with some exceptions and limitations on others ; the cadet disciplinary board proceedings at the air force academy , on the other hand , provided fewer due process protections than proceedings at the other two academies ; as of january 1 , 1995 , the air force academy eliminated the cadet disciplinary board and implemented a two - step process aimed at improving timeliness and fairness in dealing with major conduct offenses ; while the conduct systems are characterized by academy officials as administrative , rather than judicial , they offer less due process protection than is mandated across dod for other nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings ; a large majority of the students questioned the reasonableness of many of the minor rules and regulations in the conduct codes ; and many students perceive academy handling of conduct offenses , the application of rules and regulations , and the imposition of disciplinary actions as inconsistent .
