the u.s. navy spends at least $ 18 billion per year on shipbuilding — a portion of which is spent after ships are delivered . during the post - delivery period — after delivery from the shipbuilder and before the ships enter the fleet — navy ships undergo a variety of tests , trials , and construction . gao was asked to assess the post - delivery period , including quality and completeness of ships when they are delivered to the fleet . the senate report on the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included additional questions about ship status after delivery . this report assesses the extent to which the navy provides complete and quality ships to the fleet , has a ship delivery policy that supports those efforts , and reports ship quality and completeness to congress . gao reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of eight navy ships , six of which have entered the fleet and two that recently began the post - delivery period . gao reviewed program documentation and interviewed navy officials . gao reviewed six ships valued at $ 6.3 billion that had completed the post - delivery period , and found they were provided to the fleet with varying degrees of incomplete work and quality problems . gao used three quality assurance metrics , identified by navy program offices , to evaluate the completeness of the six ships — lpd 25 , lha 6 , ddg 112 , littoral combat ships ( lcs ) 3 and 4 , and ssn 782 — at delivery and also at the time each ship was provided to the fleet . although the navy resolved many of the defects by the end of the post - delivery period , as the table below shows , quality problems persisted and work was incomplete when the selected ships were turned over to the operational fleet . fleet officials reported varying levels of concern with the overall quality and completeness of the ships , such as with unreliable equipment or a need for more intense maintenance than expected . for cvn 78 and ddg 1000 , the navy plans to complete significantly more work and testing during the post - delivery period than the other six ships gao reviewed . as such , these ships are at a greater risk of being provided to the fleet at the end of their post - delivery periods with incomplete construction work and unknowns about quality . the navy 's ship delivery policy does not facilitate a process that provides complete and quality ships to the fleet and practices do not comport with policy . the policy emphasizes that ships should be defect - free and mission - capable , but lacks clarity regarding what defects should be corrected and by when . without a clear policy , navy program offices define their own standards of quality and completeness , which are not always consistent . further , because the navy 's board of inspection and survey ( insurv ) does not inspect ships at the end of the post - delivery period , it is not in a position to verify each ship 's readiness for the fleet , as required by navy policy . the navy has not assessed the costs and benefits of ensuring insurv does this . addressing these policy concerns would improve the likelihood of identifying and correcting deficiencies before fleet introduction and increase consistency in how the navy defines quality . the navy does not use consistent definitions for key milestones in its reports to congress — such as delivery or initial operational capability ( ioc ) — and , therefore , these milestones are not as informative as they could be regarding ship quality and completeness . for example , the navy has routinely declared ioc on new ship classes without having demonstrated that ships are able to perform mission operations — contrary to department of defense ( dod ) guidance , which , for nearly all acquisition models , generally states that ioc should be declared only after successful operational testing that demonstrates performance . the navy should revise its ship delivery policy to identify what kinds of defects should be corrected and by when and study how to best ensure that insurv verifies ships . also , the navy should reflect in its reports to congress key milestones and consistent definitions in line with dod policy . dod did not concur with two recommendations , partially concurred with a third , and fully agreed with a fourth . gao stands by its recommendations , which will help ensure that complete and quality ships are provided to the fleet and that congress is provided with meaningful information on ship status .
