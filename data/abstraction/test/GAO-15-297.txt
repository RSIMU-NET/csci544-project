irs relies extensively on it systems to annually collect more than $ 2 trillion in taxes , distribute more than $ 300 billion in refunds , and carry out its mission of providing service to america 's taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations . for fiscal year 2014 , irs expected to spend about $ 2.4 billion on it . given the size and significance of irs 's it investments and the challenges inherent in successfully delivering these complex it systems , it is important that congress be provided reliable cost , schedule , and scope information to assist with its oversight responsibilities . accordingly , gao 's objectives were to evaluate irs 's efforts to address prior gao recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information ; summarize the reported cost , schedule , and performance of irs 's major it investments ; and assess the status and plans of selected investments . to do so , gao analyzed quarterly reports and reviewed information on cost and schedule from october 2013 to september 2014 , interviewed program officials , and analyzed documentation for selected investments . the internal revenue service ( irs ) has made limited progress in improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope performance information – the agency has partially implemented two of gao 's five prior recommendations , but not yet addressed the remaining three ( see table ) . irs 's implementation of these recommendations is critical in ensuring that congress receives the reliable information it needs for effective oversight and decision making . key : ● fully — the agency provided evidence that it fully addressed the recommendation . ◐ partially — the agency provided evidence that it has addressed the recommendation to some extent . ◌ not addressed — the agency did not provide any evidence that it addressed the recommendation . most of irs 's major information technology ( it ) investments were reported as meeting cost and schedule goals . specifically , 11 of 17 investments were reportedly within 10 percent of cost estimates , and 13 were within 10 percent of schedule estimates between october 2013 and september 2014. in addition , the agency reported “ green ” ratings for investments instead of their previous “ yellow ” ratings for chief technology officer summary - level risk assessments . it is important to note that these ratings are not provided for 6 investments for which irs provides detailed reporting to congress . providing summary - level risk ratings for all major investments would improve the visibility into changes in investment risk , and provide congress with the information to more easily determine the investments requiring greater attention . selected investments experienced variances from initial cost , schedule , and scope plans that were not transparent in congressional reporting because irs has yet to address gao 's prior recommendations . specifically , the return review program has so far exceeded planned costs by $ 86.5 million and has yet to deliver functionality that was scheduled for september 2012 , and a key phase of customer account data engine 2 was developed 10 months late and at $ 183.6 million more than planned . however , none of these variances were clearly identified in congressional reporting . in addition , the consolidated reports on the status of testing for the affordable care act administration investment are not comprehensive , making it difficult to determine whether all required testing is being performed . gao is making three recommendations to improve the reliability and reporting of investment performance information and management of selected investments . irs agreed with two recommendations but disagreed with the third related to the reporting of test results . gao continues to believe it is still warranted .
