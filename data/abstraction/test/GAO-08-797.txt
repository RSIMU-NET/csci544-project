the national wildlife refuge system , which is administered by the fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior , comprises 585 refuges on more than 96 million acres of land and water that preserve habitat for waterfowl and other migratory birds , threatened and endangered species , and other wildlife . refuges also provide wildlife - related activities such as hunting and fishing to nearly 40 million visitors every year . gao was asked to describe changing factors that the refuge system experienced from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , including funding and staffing changes , and examine how habitat management and visitor services changed during this period . we surveyed all refuges ; visited 19 refuges in 4 regions ; and interviewed refuge , regional , and national officials . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the interior made technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate . gao is not making recommendations in this report . between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 , the refuge system experienced funding and staffing level fluctuations , the introduction of several new policy initiatives , and the increased influence of external factors such as extreme weather that threaten wildlife habitat and visitor infrastructure . although core funding -- measured as obligations for refuge operations , maintenance , and fire management -- increased each year , inflation - adjusted core funding peaked in fiscal year 2003 at about $ 391 million -- 6.8 percent above fiscal year 2002 funding . inflation - adjusted core funding ended the period 2.3 percent below peak levels , but 4.3 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels by fiscal year 2007. core refuge staffing levels peaked in fiscal year 2004 at 3,610 full - time equivalents -- 10.0 percent above the fiscal year 2002 level -- and then declined more slowly than funding levels . by fiscal year 2007 , staffing levels fell to 4.0 percent below peak levels , but 5.5 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels . through fiscal year 2007 , the number of permanent employees utilized by the refuge system declined to 7.5 percent below peak levels . during this period , refuge system officials initiated new policies that : reduced staff positions and reallocated funds and staff among refuges to better align staff levels with funding ; required refuge staff to focus on a legislative mandate to complete refuge conservation plans by 2012 ; shifted to constructing a larger number of smaller visitor structures , such as informational kiosks , and fewer large visitor centers to spread visitor service funds across more refuges ; increased the number of full - time law enforcement officers and their associated training and experience requirements ; and resulted in additional administrative work . during this period , external factors that complicate refuge staffs ' ability to protect and restore habitat quality also increased , including severe storms and development around refuges . our survey showed that the quality of habitat management and visitor service programs varied across refuges during our study period . habitat conditions for key types of species improved about two times more often than they worsened , but between 7 percent and 20 percent of habitats were of poor quality in 2007. certain habitat problems increased at more than half of refuges during this period , and managers reported that they increased the time spent on certain habitat management activities , such as addressing invasive plants , despite declining staffing levels . however , several managers we interviewed told us that staff were working longer hours without extra pay to get work done , and managers expressed concern about their ability to sustain habitat conditions . while the quality of four key visitor service programs was reported to be stable or improving between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 at the vast majority of refuges , the other two key programs -- environmental education and interpretation -- were considered poor quality at one - third of refuges in 2007. changes in the time spent on visitor services varied considerably across refuges , and managers noted that visitor services generally are cut before habitat management activities when resources are limited . managers are concerned about their ability to provide high - quality visitor services in the future given staffing and funding constraints .
