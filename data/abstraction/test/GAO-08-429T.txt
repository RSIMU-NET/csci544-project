six years after the attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) , concerns persist about health effects experienced by wtc responders and the availability of health care services for those affected . several federally funded programs provide screening , monitoring , or treatment services to responders . gao has previously reported on the progress made and implementation problems faced by these wtc health programs . this testimony is based primarily on gao 's testimony , september 11 : improvements needed in availability of health screening and monitoring services for responders ( gao - 07-1229t , sept. 10 , 2007 ) , which updated gao 's report , september 11 : hhs needs to ensure the availability of health screening and monitoring for all responders ( gao - 07-892 , july 23 , 2007 ) . in this testimony , gao discusses efforts by the centers for disease control and prevention 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area . for the july 2007 report , gao reviewed program documents and interviewed department of health and human services ( hhs ) officials , grantees , and others . gao updated selected information in august and september 2007 and conducted work for this statement in january 2008. in july 2007 , following a reexamination of the status of the wtc health programs , gao recommended that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the wtc attack , regardless of where they reside . as of january 2008 , the department has not responded to this recommendation . as gao testified in september 2007 , niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it has taken steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in seven states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in 2007 it took steps toward expanding the provider network .
