the bureau of land management ( blm ) issued changes to grazing regulations ( 43 c.f.r . part 4100 ) on august 11 , 2006 , after a three year review . some portions of the regulations have been enjoined . the previous major revision of grazing rules , which took effect in 1995 , was highly controversial . the 2006 changes addressed many of the same issues , and received mixed reviews . blm asserted that the 2006 changes were needed to increase flexibility for grazing managers and permittees , to improve rangeland management and grazing permit administration , to promote conservation , and to comply with court decisions . critics contend that a need for change was not justified and that changes adopted removed important environmental protections and opportunities for public comment . under the 2006 changes , the blm and a permittee could share title to structural range improvements , such as a fence . permittees could acquire water rights for grazing , consistent with state law . the occasions on which blm would be required to get input from the public on grazing decisions were reduced . the administrative appeals process on grazing decisions was modified and the extent to which grazing could continue in the face of an appeal or stay of a decision was delineated . the definition of grazing preference was broadened to include a quantitative meaning â€” forage on public land . changes were made to the timeframe and procedures for changing grazing management after a determination that grazing is a significant factor in failing to achieve rangeland health standards . the three - year limit on temporary nonuse of a permit was removed , and permittees are able to apply for nonuse of a permit for up to one year at a time . conservation use grazing permits were eliminated . changes that have been enjoined relate primarily to public participation , sharing title to range improvements , and fundamentals of rangeland health . blm also considered , but did not propose , certain changes due to adverse public reaction or other considerations . on june 17 , 2005 , blm had issued a final environmental impact statement ( feis ) analyzing the potential impact of proposed changes in the regulations , an alternative , and the status quo . on march 31 , 2006 , blm published an addendum to the feis addressing public comment received after the closing date of march 2 , 2004 , primarily from the fish and wildlife service . final regulatory changes took effect august 11 , 2006. blm also considered , but did not make , changes to its grazing policies , which the agency had believed could be carried out under existing rules . potential changes that were examined included the establishment of reserve common allotments to serve as backup forage when permittees ' regular allotments are unavailable ; conservation partnerships between the blm and permittees whereby permittees work to improve environmental health in return for certain benefits ; voluntary allotment restructuring to allow multiple permittees to merge allotments ; conservation easement acquisition to preserve open space ; and landscape habitat improvement to promote species conservation and facilitate consultations under the endangered species act .
