the federal voluntary voting system guidelines ( vvsg ) are a set of technical standards for voting systems that use computers to assist in recording or counting votes . the first version went into effect in december 2007 , and a draft second version has been developed . the vvsg replaced the federal voluntary voting systems standards ( vss ) . the 2005 vvsg are a partial revision of the vss , with revision focused mainly on accessibility , usability , and security . the 2007 draft is a complete rewrite . several issues have been raised about the vvsg that may require congressional attention . among them is the question of timing . some vendors claim that there needs to be more time for technology development before the new guidelines become effective ; some activists argue that problems with voting systems , and federal requirements , demand more rapid implementation of the vvsg . the new guidelines did not have much direct impact on voting systems used in 2006. one exception was provisions relating to paper - ballot audit trails , which several states now require to be used in conjunction with electronic voting machines such as touchscreen systems . like the vss , the vvsg are voluntary , but some observers believe that a regulatory approach would be more appropriate given the importance of elections to the democratic process . however , since many states require that voting systems be certified , vendors are expected to treat the vvsg in the same way they have treated the vss â€” as effectively mandatory .
