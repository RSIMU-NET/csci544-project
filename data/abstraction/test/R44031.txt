the united states - hong kong policy act of 1992 ( p.l . 102-383 ) declares that , `` support for democratization is a fundamental principle of u.s. foreign policy . as such , it naturally applies to united states policy toward hong kong . . china 's law establishing the hong kong special administration region ( hksar ) , commonly referred to as the `` basic law , '' declares that `` the ultimate aim '' is the selection of hong kong 's chief executive ( ce ) and legislative council ( legco ) by universal suffrage . the year 2015 may be a pivotal year for making progress toward the objectives of both of these laws . it could also be a year in which the democratic aspirations of many hong kong residents remain unfulfilled . hong kong 's current chief executive , leung chun - ying , initiated a six - step process in july 2014 whereby hong kong 's basic law could be amended to allow the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017. on august 31 , 2014 , china 's national people 's congress standing committee ( npcsc ) completed the second step of the reform process when it issued a decision setting comparatively strict conditions on the adoption of universal suffrage for the 2017 ce elections that seemingly preclude the nomination of a pro - democracy candidate . the third step of the process , the ce submitting legislation to legco to amend the basic law , came on june 17. on june 18 , legco defeated the proposed election reforms by a vote of 28 against and 8 in favor of the legislation , completing the fourth step and terminating one path to universal suffrage . public opinion in hong kong over the proposed ce election reforms is split , with opinion surveys showing a sharp division of opinion on accepting the npcsc 's conditions . in the autumn of 2014 , anger in hong kong over the npcsc 's august 2014 decision precipitated the occupation of several major hong kong roads by thousands of hong kong residents . these occupations were ended in december 2014 by the deployment of thousands of police officers , but scattered protests continue . the democratization of hong kong not only has implications for u.s. relations with hong kong , but also for u.s. relations with china and the political development of taiwan and cross - strait relations . in response to the pro - democracy protests in hong kong , members of the 113th congress introduced the hong kong human rights and democracy act ( h.r . 5696 and s. 2922 ) , to amend the united states - hong kong policy act of 1992. the senate version of the legislation was amended by the senate foreign relations committee and placed on the senate legislative calendar on december 11 , 2014 , but did not receive consideration by the full senate . the hong kong human rights and democracy act has been reintroduced in the 114th congress in the house of representatives ( h.r . 1159 ) with some changes , but not in the senate . in addition , the 114th congress may consider continuing appropriations for existing programs to promote the democratization of hong kong . because the process of possibly reforming hong kong 's election laws is underway , this report will be updated as circumstances or conditions in hong kong significantly change . this update reflects legco 's defeat of the proposed resolution and possible next steps in election reforms .
