the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) focused national attention on improving schools so that all students reach academic proficiency by 2014. in the 2006- 2007 school year , about 4,500 of the 54,000 title i schools failed to make adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) for 4 or more years . schools that miss ayp for 4 years are identified for corrective action , and after 6 years , they must be restructured . gao examined the characteristics of title i schools in corrective action and restructuring ; the actions that schools in corrective action and restructuring implemented ; the assistance those schools received from districts and states ; and how education supports states in their efforts to assist these schools . gao administered two web - based surveys to a nationwide sample of schools in corrective action and restructuring status and conducted site visits to five states . nationwide , the 2,790 title i schools that were in corrective action or restructuring status in the 2005-2006 school year were more frequently located in urban areas and in a few states . these schools served higher percentages of minority , poor , and middle - school students than other title i schools , and many report that factors such as neighborhood violence and student mobility pose additional challenges to improving student academic performance . as state proficiency targets continue to increase to 100 percent in 2014 , the number of schools in corrective action and restructuring may increase . a majority of schools in corrective action or restructuring status implemented required activities . however , in some cases , schools may not be meeting nclba requirements . gao estimates that 6 percent of schools did not take any of the required corrective actions and that about a third continued corrective actions implemented during earlier years of school improvement but did not take a new action after entering corrective action status . while this course of action may be an appropriate path for some schools to take , the department of education has not provided guidance to districts delineating when continuing a corrective action is appropriate and when it is not . in addition , about 40 percent of schools did not take any of the five restructuring options required by nclba . while states are required to report annually to the department of education the measures taken by schools in improvement status , education does not require states to report on the specific measures taken for each school . gao estimates that 42 percent of the schools in corrective action or restructuring did not receive all required types of assistance through their school districts , although most received discretionary assistance from their state educational agencies . districts are required to ensure that several types of assistance are provided to all schools in improvement status , including those in corrective action and restructuring status . this assistance includes help in analyzing students ' assessment data and revising school budgets so that resources are allocated to improvement efforts . nclba generally does not require states to provide specific kinds of assistance to schools in corrective action or restructuring ; however , they are required to develop a statewide system of support , including school support teams to provide technical assistance to schools and districts . most schools received some type of assistance from the state educational agency . education provides technical assistance and research results to states primarily through its comprehensive centers program . education also has provided more material in its web - based clearinghouse to address a greater number of topics and is developing an initiative to outline practical steps for schools in improvement , including those in restructuring .
