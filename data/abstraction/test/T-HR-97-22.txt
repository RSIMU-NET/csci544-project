gao discussed major government programs and operations it has identified as high risk because of vulnerability to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement and legislative and agency actions that have resulted in progress towards resolving these problems . gao noted that : without additional attention to resolve problems in the 25 areas that are the current focus of gao 's high - risk initiative , the government will continue to miss huge opportunities to save billions of dollars , make better investments to reap the benefits of information technology , improve performance and provide better service , and more effectively manage the cost of government programs ; effective and sustained follow - through by agency managers is essential to make further headway and achieve greater benefits ; continued oversight by congress will add essential impetus to ensuring progress as well ; landmark legislation passed by congress in the 1990s has established broad management reforms , which , with successful implementation , will help resolve high - risk problems and provide greater accountability in many government programs and operations ; overall , agencies are taking high - risk problems seriously , trying to correct them , and making progress in many areas ; congress has also acted to address several problems affecting these high - risk areas through oversight hearings and specific legislative initiatives ; full and effective implementation of legislative mandates , gao suggestions , and corrective measures by agencies , however , have not yet been achieved because the high - risk areas involve long - standing problems that are difficult to correct ; federal agencies often fail to appropriately manage their finances , identify clearly what they intend to accomplish , or do the job effectively with a minimum of waste ; the government performance and results act ( gpra ) requires agencies to set goals , measure performance , and report on their accomplishments ; gpra will be more difficult for some agencies to apply than for others , but gpra has the potential for adding greatly to government performance , a particularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited and public demand is high ; reliable financial information is key to better managing government programs , providing accountability , and addressing high - risk problems , but financial information has not been reliable enough to use in federal decisionmaking or to provide the requisite public accountability ; the landmark chief financial officers act spelled out a long overdue and ambitious agenda to help resolve financial management deficiencies ; and important and steady progress is being made under the act to bring about sweeping reforms and rectify the devastating legacy from inattention to financial management .
