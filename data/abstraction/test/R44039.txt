enacted on august 2 , 2011 , the budget control act of 2011 as amended ( p.l . 112-25 , p.l . 112-240 , p.l . 113-67 , p.l . 114-74 , and p.l . 115-123 ) sets limits on defense and nondefense spending . as part of an agreement to increase the statutory limit on public debt , the bca aimed to reduce annual federal budget deficits by a total of at least $ 2.1 trillion from fy2012 through fy2021 , with approximately half of the savings to come from defense . the spending limits ( or caps ) apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority . budget authority is authority provided by law to a federal agency to obligate money for goods and services . the caps are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration . sequestration automatically cancels previously enacted appropriations ( a form of budget authority ) by an amount necessary to reach prespecified levels . the defense spending limits apply to national defense ( budget function 050 ) but not to funding designated for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) or emergencies . some defense policymakers and officials argue the spending restrictions impede the department of defense 's ( dod 's ) ability to adequately prepare military personnel and equipment for operations and other national security requirements . others argue the limits are necessary to curb rising deficits and debt . after lawmakers did not reach a deficit - reduction deal and triggered steeper reductions to the initial bca caps , congress repeatedly amended the legislation to raise the spending limits . most recently , president donald trump on february 9 , 2018 , signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) . the bill amended the bca to increase discretionary defense spending caps by the largest amounts to date â€” by $ 80 billion to $ 629 billion in fy2018 and by $ 85 billion to $ 647 billion in fy2019 . it did not change the spending limits for fy2020 and fy2021 . the annual federal budget deficit decreased from $ 1.1 trillion ( 6.8 % of gross domestic product ) in fy2012 to $ 665 billion ( 3.5 % of gdp ) in fy2017 , but is projected to increase to $ 1.1 trillion ( 4.9 % of gdp ) in fy2021 . meanwhile , federal debt held by the public has increased from $ 11.3 trillion ( 70.4 % of gdp ) in fy2012 to $ 14.7 trillion ( 76.5 % of gdp ) in fy2017 , and is projected to further increase to $ 19 trillion ( 83.1 % of gdp ) in fy2021 .
