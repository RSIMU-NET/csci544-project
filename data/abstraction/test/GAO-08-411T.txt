gao has for many years warned that our nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path . during the past 3 years , the comptroller general has traveled to 25 states as part of the fiscal wake - up tour . members of this diverse group of policy experts agree that finding solutions to the nation 's long - term fiscal challenge will require bipartisan cooperation , a willingness to discuss all options , and the courage to make tough choices . at the request of chairman conrad and senator gregg , the comptroller general discussed the long - term fiscal outlook , our nation 's huge health care challenge , and the shrinking window of opportunity for action . as we enter 2008 , what we call the long - term fiscal challenge is not in the distant future . already the first members of the baby boom generation have filed for early social security retirement benefits -- and will be eligible for medicare in only 3 years . simulations by gao , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and others all show that despite a 3-year decline in the budget deficit , we still face large and growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends . under any plausible scenario , the federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path . rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem ; they are our nation 's number one fiscal challenge . growth in health - related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local governments . unsustainable growth in health care spending is a systemwide challenge that also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercut our ability to compete in a global marketplace . addressing the unsustainability of health care costs is a societal challenge that calls for us as a nation to fundamentally rethink how we define , deliver , and finance health care in both the public and the private sectors . the passage of time has only worsened the situation : the size of the challenge has grown and the time to address it has shrunk . the longer we wait the more painful and difficult the choices will become , and the greater the risk of a very serious economic disruption . it is understandable that the congress and the administration are focused on the need for a short - term fiscal stimulus . however , our long - term challenge increases the importance of careful design of any stimulus package -- it should be timely , targeted , and temporary . at the same time , creating a capable and credible commission to make recommendations to the next congress and the next president for action on our longer - range and looming fiscal imbalance is called for .
