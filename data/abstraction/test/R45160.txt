the federal election commission ( fec ) is the nation 's civil campaign finance regulator . the agency ensures that campaign fundraising and spending is publicly reported ; that those regulated by the federal election campaign act ( feca ) and by commission regulations comply and have access to guidance ; and that publicly financed presidential campaigns receive funding . feca requires that at least four of six commissioners agree to undertake many of the agency 's key policymaking duties . as of this writing , the fec is operating with four commissioners instead of six . others reportedly are considering leaving the agency . one nomination to the fec has been resubmitted during the 115th congress ; no committee or floor action has been taken on it to date . it is entirely possible that the fec will retain at least four commissioners and that the agency will remain able to carry out all its duties . if , however , the fec loses its policymaking quorum — as happened for six months in 2008 — the agency would be unable to hold hearings , issue rules , and enforce campaign finance law and regulation . this crs report briefly explains the kinds of actions that feca would preclude if the commission lost its policymaking quorum . this report will be updated in the event of significant changes in the agency 's policymaking quorum or the status of agency nominations .
