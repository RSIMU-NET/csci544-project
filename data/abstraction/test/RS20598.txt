on june 5 , 2000 , the national commission on terrorism ( ntc ) , a congressionallymandated bi - partisan body , issueda report providing a blueprint for u.s. counter - terrorism policy with both policy and legislative recommendations.the report could be significant in shaping thedirection of u.s. policy and the debate in congress . it generally argues for a more aggressiveu.s . strategy in combating terrorism . critics , however , argue thatntc conclusions and recommendations ignore competing u.s. goals and interests ; i.e that a proactive strategymight lead to the curbing of individual rights andliberties , damage important commercial interests , and widen disagreements between the u.s. and its allies overusing the `` stick '' as opposed to the `` carrot '' approach in dealing with states that actively support or countenance terrorism . the ntc report is likely to stimulate strong congressional interest in counterterrorism policy in the 107th congress . likely areas of focus are ( 1 ) a more proactivecounterterrorism policy ; ( 2 ) a stronger state sanctions policy ; and ( 3 ) a more cohesive / better coordinated u.s.federal counterterrorism response . january 23 , 2001press reports indicate that rep. j.c. watts ( r - okla ) has urged house speaker dennis hastert to create a houseselect committee on domestic terrorism . in the106th congress , h.r . 4210 , which passed the house , would also give added attention todomestic terrorism by establishing a president 's council ondomestic preparedness in the white house . moreover , in the 106th congress , s. 3205 , the ( kyl - feinstein ) counteterrrorism act of 2000 , whichpassed the senate , incorporated a number of recommendations of the ntc including measures to ensure ( 1 ) enhanced policy emphasis on control of biologicalpathogens and terrorist funding raising ; ( 2 ) better sharing of fbi intelligence ; ( 3 ) easier recruitment of ciacounter - terrorism informants ; and ( 4 ) maintainingsyria and iran on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism . this report will not be updated .
