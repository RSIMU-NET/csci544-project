in 2008 , the department of state ( state ) estimated nearly 5 million u.s. citizens lived overseas , and 64 million trips were taken overseas by u.s. citizens . since protecting and serving u.s. citizens abroad are among state 's chief priorities , state must be prepared to provide emergency assistance to americans abroad . this report describes what services state provides to u.s. citizens who are the victims of crimes , suffer accidents , or otherwise need emergency services ; how state is prepared to assist u.s. citizens who are in need of emergency services ; and how state monitors the assistance it provides to u.s. citizens in need of emergency services . state provides a number of emergency services to american citizens abroad through its network of 267 embassies and consulates in 174 countries . state 's emergency services cover circumstances including deaths , arrests , medical or financial concerns , crime , and missing persons ' cases . state provides emergency assistance to americans at all hours , and provides information such as travel warnings to travelers and u.s. citizens living overseas through a variety of mechanisms , including the department 's embassy and consulate web sites . however , our review of a random sample of posts ' web sites found that only 14 percent had emergency phone numbers on the web sites ' main page . state also maintains a warden system to disseminate information from the embassy to u.s. citizens living in the country , and can send messages directly to americans who provide contact information to the department . state has trained staff dedicated to providing emergency assistance overseas as well as in washington , d.c. depending on the size of the post , american citizen services ( acs ) may be provided by multiple staff , or a single consular officer serving as the sole provider of all consular services including emergency services . locally engaged staff are a key component of posts ' provision of emergency services , as is state 's ability to deploy staff where needed when emergencies arise . state provides guidance , largely through the foreign affairs manual , formal on - the - job training , and other resources to ensure staff are able to carry out these services . the bureau of consular affairs has a variety of mechanisms to monitor its provision of emergency services ; however , all of these mechanisms have limitations and , as a result , consular affairs can not be assured it is allocating its resources effectively . the acs system , which is intended to track emergency services provided by posts , and the consular package , which provides post - specific workload information to guide consular resource allocations , both contain unreliable data . for example , reporting weaknesses and unclear guidance associated with the acs system prevent posts from accurately monitoring and evaluating their workload or using the data to make management decisions . although state shifts its consular resources to meet emergency demands , absent current and reliable data on the worldwide demand for emergency services , consular affairs may not make decisions based on a clear understanding of the global workload .
