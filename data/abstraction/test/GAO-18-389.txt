zika — a virus primarily transmitted through mosquito bites — can cause symptoms that include fever , rash , and joint and muscle pain . in pregnant women , the zika virus can be passed to the fetus and cause severe brain defects . in response to an outbreak in the united states and its territories , congress appropriated $ 932 million in september 2016 through the zika response and preparedness act to hhs and its agencies to prevent , prepare for , and respond to the zika virus and its related health conditions , and conduct related research . the act also included a provision that gao study the activities supported with the appropriated funds . this report describes the status of funds obligated and disbursed from the zika supplemental funding appropriated to hhs and its agencies ; and how selected awardees used their zika supplemental funding , and their experiences with applying for and managing the funding . to do this work , gao reviewed agency documents on zika supplemental funding and activities , and interviewed officials from the hhs agencies and selected awardees . to select awardees , gao identified states based on the amount of initial zika supplemental funding they received from cdc , the centers for medicare & medicaid services , and the health resources and services administration ; and selected states with the highest and lowest funding . in total , gao selected 12 awardees : 10 states , as well as one county and one city from 2 of the 10 states . gao provided a draft of this report to hhs . in response , hhs provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . as of september 30 , 2017 , department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) agencies had obligated nearly all of the $ 932 million of zika supplemental funding congress appropriated in 2016 through the use of multiple funding mechanisms , including cooperative agreements , grants , and contracts . four hhs agencies had small unobligated balances as of the september 30 , 2017 , obligation deadline ; these balances can not be used to incur new obligations , but may be used to adjust award amounts in future years . disbursement of the obligated funds was ongoing , with about 21 percent of the zika supplemental funding ( approximately $ 195.5 million ) disbursed as of december 31 , 2017. the agencies have until september 30 , 2022 , to disburse the remainder . the 12 awardees gao interviewed — officials from 10 states and two local entities — funded multiple activities with their zika supplemental funding , and had varying experiences applying for and managing the funds . awardees told gao that they used their funding to support such activities as collection of information about individuals affected by the zika virus ( human surveillance ) , mosquito control activities , laboratory capacity building , public outreach , and health care services . for example , florida used zika supplemental funding in its state - run laboratories to purchase materials for testing zika virus - related specimens . a majority of the awardees gao spoke with reported positive experiences applying for and managing the zika supplemental funding , including good communication with agency officials and awardees ' familiarity with the mechanisms used to make the awards . however , some awardees noted challenges , such as time frames to use the funding that varied among multiple awards and identifying the activities that could be funded . these challenges added administrative burdens to applying for and managing the zika supplemental funding while officials were responding to the outbreak , according to the awardees . in october 2017 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) issued a new notice of funding opportunity that agency officials said is intended to help minimize the administrative burden on states and certain localities during emergencies — such as preparing applications — by pre - approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to be eligible to rapidly receive future awards .
