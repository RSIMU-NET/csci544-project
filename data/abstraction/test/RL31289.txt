the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks prompted congressional action on many fronts , including passage of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate toolsrequired to intercept and obstruct terrorism ( usa patriot ) act , p.l . 107-56 . the act isbroadly scoped , and some of its provisions may affect internet usage , computer security , and criticalinfrastructure protection . in the area of computer security , the act creates a definition of `` computer trespasser '' andmakes such activities a terrorist act in certain circumstances . the act enables law enforcementofficials to intercept the communications of computer trespassers and improves their ability to trackcomputer trespasser activities . it also codifies some elements of u.s. critical infrastructure policyarticulated by both the clinton and george w. bush administrations to ensure that any disruptionsto the nation 's critical infrastructures are minimally detrimental . although the act does not explicitly address electronic commerce ( e - commerce ) , many ofthe law 's provisions may impact it . in particular , title iii responds to concerns that more can be doneto prevent , detect , and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism . over time , these provisions may affect e - commerce broadly , and electronic fund transfersspecifically . electronic government ( e - government ) could be affected by the act in both positive andnegative ways . the intense focus on improving data collection and information sharing practicesand systems may contribute to the establishment of government - wide technical standards and bestpractices that could facilitate the implementation of new and existing e - government initiatives . itcould also promote the utilization of secure web portals to help ensure the data integrity oftransactions between the government and citizens and business . however , concern about potentialabuses of data collection provisions could dampen citizen enthusiasm for carrying out electronictransactions with the government . the act provides law enforcement officials with greater authority to monitor internet activitysuch as electronic mail ( e - mail ) and web site visits . while law enforcement officials laud their newauthorities as enabling them to better track terrorist and other criminal activity , privacy rightsadvocates worry that , in an attempt to track down and punish the terrorists who threaten americandemocracy , one of the fundamental tenets of that democracy -- privacy -- may itself be threatened . because of the controversial aspects of some provisions in the act , particularly regardingprivacy , congress and other groups are expected to monitor closely how the act is implemented .
