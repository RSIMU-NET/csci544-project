whistleblowers help safeguard the federal government against waste , fraud , and abuse — however , they also risk retaliation by their employers . for example , in 2002 , a former fbi agent alleged she suffered retaliation after disclosing that colleagues had stolen items from ground zero following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . doj found in her favor over 10 years after she reported the retaliation . gao was asked to review doj 's process for handling such complaints . gao examined the time doj took to resolve fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints , the extent to which doj took steps to resolve complaints more quickly , and the extent to which doj complied with certain regulatory reporting requirements . gao reviewed all doj case files for fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints doj closed from 2009 to 2013 , and interviewed whistleblower attorneys , advocates , and government officials about the complaint process . the interview results are not generalizable . the department of justice ( doj ) closed 44 of the 62 ( 71 percent ) federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblower retaliation complaints we reviewed within 1 year , took up to 4 years to close 15 complaints , and took up to 10.6 years to close the remaining 3. doj terminated 55 of the 62 complaints ( 89 percent ) and awarded corrective action for 3 . ( complainants withdrew 4 . ) . we found that doj terminated many ( 48 of 62 ) complaints we reviewed because they did not meet certain regulatory requirements . for example , doj terminated at least 17 complaints in part because a disclosure was made to someone in the employee 's chain of command or management , such as a supervisor , who was not one of the nine high - level fbi or doj entities designated under doj regulations to receive such disclosures . unlike employees of other executive branch agencies , fbi employees do not have a process to seek corrective action if they experience retaliation based on a disclosure of wrongdoing to their supervisors or others in their chain of command who are not designated officials . this difference is due , in part , to doj 's decisions about how to implement the statute governing fbi whistleblowers . in 2014 , doj reviewed its regulations and , in an effort to balance competing priorities , recommended adding more senior officials in fbi field offices to the list of designated entities , but did not recommend adding all supervisors . doj cited a number of reasons for this , including concerns about the additional resources and time needed to handle a possible increase in complaints if doj added supervisors . however , doj is already taking other steps to improve the efficiency of the complaint process . more importantly , dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee 's supervisor or someone in that person 's chain of command leaves some fbi whistleblowers — such as the 17 complainants we identified — without protection from retaliation . by dismissing potentially legitimate complaints in this way , doj could deny some whistleblowers access to recourse , permit retaliatory activity to go uninvestigated , and create a chilling effect for future whistleblowers . we also found that doj and fbi guidance is not always clear that fbi employees reporting alleged wrongdoing to a supervisor or someone in their chain of command may not be a protected disclosure . ensuring that guidance always clearly explains to whom an fbi employee can report wrongdoing will help fbi whistleblowers ensure that they are fully protected from retaliation . doj took from 2 to 10.6 years to resolve the 4 complaints we reviewed that doj adjudicated , and doj did not provide complainants with estimates of when to expect doj decisions throughout the complaint process . providing such estimates would enhance accountability to complainants and provide additional assurance about doj management 's commitment to improve efficiency . further , doj offices responsible for investigating whistleblower retaliation complaints have not consistently complied with certain regulatory requirements , such as obtaining complainants ' approvals for extensions of time . one investigating office does not track investigators ' compliance with specific regulatory requirements and does not have a formal oversight mechanism to do so . effectively monitoring investigators ' compliance with such requirements could help assure complainants that their cases are making progress and that they have the information they need to determine next steps for their complaints . congress may wish to consider whether fbi whistleblowers should have means to seek corrective action if retaliated against for disclosures to supervisors , among others . further , gao recommends that doj clarify guidance to clearly convey to whom employees can make protected disclosures , provide complainants with estimated complaint decision timeframes , and develop an oversight mechanism to monitor regulatory compliance . doj and the office of the inspector general concurred with gao 's recommendations .
