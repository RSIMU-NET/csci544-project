doe had long planned to store defense and commercial nuclear waste in a single repository at yucca mountain , nevada , funded largely from commercial power fees . in 2010 , doe terminated this plan , and then considered developing separate defense and commercial repositories . this approach requires a presidential finding under the nwpa . in 2015 , doe provided information to the president supporting separate repositories and cited several benefits , including cost efficiencies . on the basis of this information , the president in 2015 reversed a 1985 presidential finding and determined that a separate repository for defense waste was required , setting doe down the path of developing separate repositories . taxpayers would likely fund a defense waste repository rather than industry fees . gao reviewed doe 's efforts to develop a separate defense waste repository . this report assesses the information on benefits doe provided to the president ; the reliability of doe 's cost and schedule estimates ; and doe 's efforts to site a defense hlw repository . gao reviewed doe documents and interviewed more than 50 experts . the information that the department of energy ( doe ) provided to the president about whether a separate defense waste repository was required did not quantify cited benefits , when possible , show how these benefits could be achieved , or show the risks if certain benefits could not be realized as planned . in the information provided to the president , doe stated that separate repositories for defense high - level waste ( hlw ) and commercial spent nuclear fuel ( snf ) would produce certain benefits . doe cited benefits in each area required by the nuclear waste policy act ( nwpa ) — cost efficiency , public acceptability , regulation , transportation , national security , and health and safety — in concluding that there is a strong basis for a defense hlw repository . federal guidance states that benefits must be quantified when possible , and that the risk that a benefit may not be realized as planned should be factored into the cost - benefit analysis . doe officials said their plan was still conceptual and the guidance did not yet apply . nevertheless , doe did not show that benefits outweighed costs in recommending to the president that the nation should depart from its longstanding nuclear waste strategy . doe 's preliminary cost and schedule estimates for the two - repository approach that it provided to the president are not reliable because the estimates do not meet industry best practices . doe 's cost estimates excluded major costs , such as site selection and site characterization costs that could add tens of billions of dollars . regarding its schedule estimates , doe did not provide information on how its schedules would be achieved . gao found that doe 's estimates leave little time for major activities and that doe 's schedule appears optimistic , given its past repository siting experiences . without reliable estimates that reflect best practices , doe provided information to the president that supported a decision that could commit the nation to expending undisclosed but significant future resources and to a time frame that appears optimistic . doe is planning to develop a process to obtain consent for an eventual repository site ; however , doe faces significant public opposition and certain prerequisites have not yet been established . these prerequisites include updated health and safety regulations , which are necessary for the public to consider as part of a consent - based siting process . without updated health and safety regulations , which establish radiation exposure limits , the public can not provide meaningful input into a consent - based siting process and local communities can not effectively be engaged in hosting potential repository sites . doe officials acknowledge that health and safety regulations — which were developed in the 1980s — need to be updated and revised for any future defense hlw or mostly commercial snf repository . revising such regulations is the responsibility of other federal agencies . experts and stakeholders told gao that updated health and safety regulations are a precondition for having discussions with the public and for screening potential sites . an internal project management requirement directs doe to perform key “ preconceptual ” planning activities to enhance front - end planning . in proceeding with siting activities without ensuring key prerequisites have been established , doe runs the risk of increasing public opposition and potentially wasting resources . gao recommends that doe assess benefits , costs , and schedule estimates , and reassess its decision to conduct site selection activities . doe agreed on the need for a more thorough assessment , but disagreed on the need to reassess site selection activities , citing benefits of its approach . gao continues to believe its recommendation is valid , as discussed in the report .
