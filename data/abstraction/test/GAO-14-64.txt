omb launched the dashboard in june 2009 as a public web site that reports performance for major it investments -- on which the federal government plans to invest over $ 38 billion in fiscal year 2014. the dashboard is to provide transparency for these investments and to facilitate public monitoring of them . after its launch , omb began using it to identify at - risk investments . this report characterizes the cio ratings for selected federal agencies ' it investments as reported on the dashboard over time , determines the extent to which selected agencies ' cio ratings are consistent with investment risk , and determines the extent to which selected agencies are addressing at - risk investments . gao selected the eight agencies with the most reported major it spending in fiscal year 2012 ( excluding those gao recently reviewed ) and selected 10 investments at each agency . gao reviewed the investments ' documentation , compared it to the cio ratings , and reviewed processes used for the highest - risk investments . gao also interviewed appropriate officials . as of august 2013 , the chief information officers ( cio ) at the eight selected agencies rated 198 of their 244 major information technology ( it ) investments listed on the federal it dashboard ( dashboard ) as low risk or moderately low risk , 41 as medium risk , and 5 as high risk or moderately high risk . however , the total number of investments reported by these agencies has varied over time , which impacts the number of investments receiving cio ratings . for example , energy reclassified several of its supercomputer investments from it to facilities and commerce decided to reclassify its satellite ground system investments . both decisions resulted in the removal of the investments from the dashboard , even though the investments were clearly it . in addition , the office of management and budget ( omb ) does not update the public version of the dashboard as the president 's budget request is being created . as a result , the public version of the dashboard was not updated for 15 of the past 24 months , and so was not available as a tool for investment oversight and decision making . of the 80 investments reviewed , 53 of the cio ratings were consistent with the investment risk , 20 were partially consistent , and 7 were inconsistent . while two agencies ' cio ratings were entirely consistent , other agencies ' ratings were inconsistent for a variety of reasons , including delays in updating the dashboard and how investment performance was tracked . for example , the department of justice downgraded an investment in july 2012 , but the dashboard was not updated to reflect this until april 2013. further , the social security administration resets investment cost and schedule performance baselines annually , an approach that increases the risk of undetected cost or schedule variances that will impact investment success . of the eight investments that were at highest risk in 2012 , seven were reviewed by their agencies using tools such as techstat sessions -- evidence - based reviews intended to improve investment performance and other high - level reviews . each of these resulted in action items intended to improve performance . the final investment was scheduled to have a techstat , but instead , according to department officials , a decision was made to modify its program cost and schedule commitments to better reflect the investment 's actual performance . gao recommends that omb make dashboard information available independent of the budget process , and that agencies appropriately categorize it investments and address identified weaknesses . omb neither agreed nor disagreed . six agencies generally agreed with the report or had no comments and two others did not agree , believing their categorizations were appropriate . gao continues to believe its recommendations remain valid , as discussed .
