given the significance and complexity of the cap goals , it is important that cap goal contributors , congress , and the public are able to track how cap goal teams are making progress . this report is one in a series in response to a statutory provision to review gprama implementation . it assesses the extent to which lessons learned from implementing the interim cap goals were incorporated into the governance of the current cap goals ; the extent to which gprama requirements for reporting on cap goal progress are included in the selected cap goal quarterly progress updates ; and the initial progress in implementing the selected cap goals . gao selected 7 of the 15 cap goals to review ( customer service , job - creating investment , lab - to - market , open data , people and culture , smarter it delivery , and stem education ) . gao assessed those goals ' quarterly progress updates against relevant gprama requirements , reviewed omb and pic guidance to cap goal teams , and interviewed omb , pic , and cap goal staff . the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) requires the office of management and budget ( omb ) to coordinate with agencies to develop cross - agency priority ( cap ) goals , which are 4-year outcome - oriented goals covering a number of complex or high - risk management and mission issues . for the current set of cap goals covering the period from 2014-2018 , omb and the interagency performance improvement council ( pic ) incorporated lessons learned from the 2012-2014 interim cap goal period to improve the governance and implementation of these cross - cutting goals . for example , omb and the pic changed the cap goal governance structure to include agency leaders , and holds regular senior - level reviews on cap goal progress . they also provide ongoing assistance to cap goal teams , such as by helping teams develop milestones and performance measures . based in part on prior gao recommendations , omb and the pic updated its guidance to assist cap goal teams in managing the goals and in meeting gprama reporting requirements . cap goal teams told gao that the cap goal designation increased leadership attention and improved interagency collaboration on these issues . gao 's assessment of the selected cap goals ' quarterly progress updates — published on performance.gov — determined that cap goal teams are meeting a number of gprama reporting requirements , including identifying contributors , reporting strategies for performance improvement and quarterly results . however , most of the selected cap goal teams have not established quarterly targets as required by gprama , but are consistently reporting the status of quarterly milestones to track goal progress . gao found that the selected goal teams are aligning their quarterly milestones with strategies to achieve the desired goal outcomes . further , all of the selected cap goal teams reported that they are working to develop performance measures , and are at various stages of the process . however , the selected cap goal teams were not consistently reporting on their efforts to develop performance measures . given omb , the pic , and cap goal teams ' emphasis on developing measures that are relevant and well - defined , greater transparency is needed to track goal team 's efforts on a quarterly basis . with improved performance information the cap goal teams will be better positioned to demonstrate goal progress at the end of the 4-year goal period . gao recommends that omb , working with the pic , report on performance.gov the actions that cap goal teams are taking to develop performance measures and quarterly targets . omb staff generally agreed with gao 's recommendation and provided technical clarifications , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
