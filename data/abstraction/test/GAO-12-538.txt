since fiscal year 2007 fema has obligated $ 33 billion in disaster assistance payments . fema relies heavily upon its cadre of daes , a reserve workforce who interact with disaster survivors . gao was asked to review the management and training of daes . specifically , this report addresses the extent to which fema has policies and procedures in place to govern the dae program ; femas human capital controls over the dae workforce are consistent with internal control standards ; and femas dae training incorporates key attributes of effective training and development programs . in addition , gao describes femas initiative to transform the dae program announced in april 2012. gao reviewed management documents such as program - specific and human capital - related guidance , interviewed fema officials , and conducted 16 focus group sessions with daes in four selected joint field offices chosen to provide geographic dispersion , among other factors . the results of the focus groups are not generalizable , but provide valuable insight into dae experiences . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has taken steps to enhance its management of the disaster assistance employee ( dae ) program , such as through the establishment of a credentialing program , the fema qualification system ( fqs ) ; however , management controls and training could be strengthened . for example , fema does not monitor how the regions implement dae policies and how daes implement disaster policies across regions to ensure consistency . femas administrator noted that due to differences in how regions operate , it is problematic to deploy someone based in one region to another during a disaster . establishing a mechanism to monitor both the regional implementation of dae policies and procedures and daes implementation of disaster policies could help provide fema with reasonable assurance that disaster assistance is conducted in accordance with policy and implemented consistently . femas human capital controls could be strengthened . femas regional dae managers are responsible for hiring daes , but fema has not established hiring criteria and has limited salary criteria . by establishing standardized criteria for making hiring and salary decisions , fema would be better positioned to hire people with requisite skills and better ensure consistency across regions . likewise , femas performance appraisal system for daes is not consistent with internal control standards . fema does not have criteria for supervisors to assign daes satisfactory or unsatisfactory ratings . thirteen of 16 regional dae managers gao interviewed stated that the appraisal process could be improved , such as implementing a rating scale instead of a pass / fail rating . fema officials noted that performance management is a critical component in dae supervision and must be improved in fiscal year 2012. establishing a more rigorous performance management system that includes criteria for given performance elements as well as guidance could help fema ensure that daes performance appraisals more accurately reflect performance and provide needed information to managers . femas dae training is not consistent with key attributes of effective training and development programs , such as a plan for training staff . fema does not have a plan to ensure daes receive necessary training such as fqs requirements . further , 13 of 16 regional dae managers gao spoke to said that they would like more opportunities for daes to receive training . a plan to ensure that all daes have opportunities for training and completing fqs requirements with related milestones would provide fema with a roadmap and ensure accountability for qualifying daes under fqs . in addition , fema does not track how much of the disaster relief fund is spent on training for daes . developing a systematic process to track training costs could provide fema with information to help it determine whether it is allocating its resources effectively . in an april 2012 memo , fema announced plans to transform the dae program beginning in june 2012 ; however , this effort is still in the early stages and as a result , it is too soon to evaluate the effectiveness of femas planned actions . gao recommends , among other things , that fema establish a mechanism to monitor both its regions implementation of dae policies and daes implementation of disaster policies ; criteria for hiring and compensating daes ; and a plan to train daes within a set time frame . dhs concurred with the recommendations .
