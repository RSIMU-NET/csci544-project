health care spending is one of the most rapidly growing portions of the federal budget . projections suggest if the rapid growth in health care costs is not curtailed , governments at all levels will face an uncomfortable choice between significant cuts in other spending priorities or major tax increases . this report examines the economic justification for government intervention and involvement in health care markets . many analysts claim market - oriented policies , in certain instances , could lower costs and enhance efficiency in health care . this report discusses the invisible hand theorem , which states that when certain assumptions hold , market outcomes will be efficient . these assumptions require that no one has an informational advantage over another , that no spillover effects exist in consumption or production , that no one exerts market power , and that no scale economies exist in production . many characteristics of health care markets fail to satisfy the assumptions of the invisible hand theorem . moreover , fundamental characteristics of health care ( such as informational asymmetries between patients and health care professionals and between payers and providers , as well as ethical and distributional concerns ) complicate efforts to expand the use of market or market - like incentives in health care . rising health care costs in part reflect the cost of technological advances , whose benefits exceed their costs , and the aging of the u.s. population . the growing role of third - party reimbursement over the past half century weakened incentives to minimize costs and thus has also led to higher health care costs . many analysts have called for initiatives which would improve the functioning of health care markets , such as improving consumer information and allowing greater use of bargaining . these initiatives may help reduce or slow the growth of health care costs , but may also have unintended negative consequences . greater use of market - like incentives can improve the efficiency of the health care system , but only if they take into account the special characteristics of health care .
