immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) officials believe that some aliens are using the benefit application process to carry out illegal activities , such as crimes of violence , narcotics trafficking , and terrorism . the extent of immigration benefit fraud is unknown , but ins officials and others believe that this problem will increase as smugglers and other criminal enterprises use fraud to bring illegal aliens , including criminals , into the united states . ins investigative units in both the service centers and the district offices investigate possible benefit fraud on the basis of information they receive from staff who process benefit applications , other ins units , the public , and law enforcement agencies . providing immigration benefits in a timely manner may conflict with the goal of preserving the integrity of the legal immigration system . although ins recognizes the need to balance these competing goals , it has not always succeeded . ins has several performance measures in place to gauge the results of its benefit fraud enforcement activities . however , ins has not established outcome - based performance measures to assess the results of fraud activities . additionally , ins has not established goals or measurement criteria for the service center units that are responsible for fraud investigations .
