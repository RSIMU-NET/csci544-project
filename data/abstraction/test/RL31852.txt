expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation . section 179 of the internal revenue code allows a taxpayer to expense ( or deduct as a current rather than a capital expense ) up to $ 1 million of the total cost of new and used qualified depreciable assets it buys and places in service in 2018 , within certain limits . firms unable to claim this allowance may recover the cost of qualified assets over longer periods , using the depreciation schedules from sections 167 or 168. while the section 179 expensing allowance is not expressly targeted at smaller firms , the limits on its use effectively tend to confine its benefits to such firms . section 168 ( k ) allows taxpayers to expense 100 % of the cost of qualified assets bought and placed in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022. there is considerable overlap between the property eligible for the section 179 and section 168 ( k ) expensing allowances . since 2002 , the two allowances have been used primarily as tax incentives for stimulating the u.s. economy . several studies have assessed the economic effects of the 30 % and 50 % bonus depreciation allowances from 2002 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2010. their findings suggested that accelerated depreciation did affect investment in qualified assets , but that it was a relatively ineffective tool for stimulating the u.s. economy during periods of weak or negative growth . available evidence also suggests that the expensing allowances have a moderate effect at best on the level and composition of business investment and its allocation among industries , the distribution of the federal tax burden among different income groups , and the cost of tax compliance for smaller firms . the allowances of course have advantages and disadvantages . on the one hand , an expensing allowance simplifies tax accounting , and a temporary allowance has the potential to stimulate increased business investment in favored assets in the short run by reducing the user cost of capital , increasing the cash flow of investing firms , and giving firms an incentive to make qualifying investments before the incentive expires . on the other hand , an expensing allowance is likely to interfere with an efficient allocation of capital among investment opportunities by diverting capital away from more productive uses with relatively low after - tax returns . in december 2017 , the house and the senate agreed on a measure ( h.r . 1 , p.l . 115-97 ) to revise key parts of the federal tax code . the new tax law made significant changes to both section 179 and section 168 ( k ) . in the case of the section 179 expensing allowance , p.l . 115-97 permanently raised the maximum allowance to $ 1 million , and the phaseout threshold for the allowance to $ 2.5 million , beginning in 2018 ; it also indexed both amounts for inflation starting in 2019. the act also expanded the definition of qualified property to include qualified improvement property , specified improvements ( e.g . , new roofs and heating systems ) to nonresidential real property , and property used in connection with lodging . in another change , the $ 25,000 expensing limit for heavy - duty sport utility vehicles imposed in 2003 was indexed for inflation starting in 2019. in the case of the bonus depreciation allowance , p.l . 115-97 increased it to 100 % for qualified property acquired and placed in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022 ; the allowance is scheduled to phase out to 0 % starting in 2027. in addition , the placed - in - service deadlines for property with relatively long production periods and for noncommercial aircraft were set one year longer . the wording of the final bill led to the unintended result that qualified improvement property became ineligible for bonus depreciation , as it no longer had a 15-year recovery period . as things now stand , such property is treated as 39-year nonresidential real property , unless congress alters the language .
