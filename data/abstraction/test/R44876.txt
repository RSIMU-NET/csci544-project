india will soon be the world 's most populous country , home to about one of every six people . many factors combine to infuse india 's government and people with `` great power '' aspirations : the asian giant 's rich civilization and history , expanding strategic horizons , energetic global and international engagement , critical geography ( with more than 9,000 total miles of land borders , many of them disputed ) astride vital sea and energy lanes , major economy ( at times the world 's fastest growing ) with a rising middle class and an attendant boost in defense and power projection capabilities ( replete with a nuclear weapons arsenal and triad of delivery systems ) , and vigorous science and technology sectors , among others . in recognition of india 's increasingly central role and ability to influence world affairs — and with a widely - held assumption that a stronger and more prosperous democratic india is good for the united states in and of itself — the u.s. congress and two successive u.s. administrations have acted both to broaden and deepen america 's engagement with new delhi . such engagement is unprecedented after decades of cold war - era estrangement and today takes place `` across the spectrum of human endeavor for a better world , '' as described in a 2015 u.s. - india declaration of friendship . washington and new delhi launched a `` strategic partnership '' in 2005 , along with a framework for long - term defense cooperation that now includes large - scale joint military exercises and significant defense trade . bilateral trade and investment have increased while a relatively wealthy indian - american community is exercising newfound domestic political influence , and indian nationals account for a large proportion of foreign students on american college campuses and foreign workers in the information technology sector . yet more engagement has meant more areas of friction in the partnership , many of which attract congressional attention . india 's economy , while slowly reforming , continues to be a relatively closed one , with barriers to trade and investment deterring foreign business interests . differences over u.s. immigration law , especially in the area of nonimmigrant work visas , remain unresolved ; new delhi views these as trade disputes . india 's intellectual property protection regime comes under regular criticism from u.s. officials and firms . the june 2017 announcement of u.s. withdrawal from the paris agreement on climate change dismayed many in india and brought into question significant ongoing bilateral collaboration in the energy field . other stumbling blocks — on localization barriers and civil nuclear commerce , among others — add to sometimes argumentative associations . meanwhile , cooperation in the fields of defense trade , intelligence , and counterterrorism , although vastly superior to that of only a decade ago , runs up against the obstacles variously posed by india 's bureaucracy , limited governmental capacity , difficult procurement process , seemingly incompatible federal institutions , and a lingering shortage of trust , not least due to america 's ongoing security relationship with and aid to india 's key rival , pakistan . finally , members of congress take notice of human rights abuses in india , perhaps especially those related to religious freedom . despite these many areas of sometimes serious discord , the u.s. congress has remained broadly positive in its posture toward the u.s. - india strategic and commercial partnership . meanwhile , the trump administration has thus far issued amicable rhetoric overall ( with some lapses ) that suggests an intention to maintain the general outlines of recent u.s. - india ties . this report reviews the major facets of current u.s. - india relations , particularly in the context of congressional interest . it discusses areas in which perceived u.s. and indian national interests converge and areas in which they diverge ; other leading indian foreign relations that relate to u.s. interests ; the outlines of bilateral engagement in defense , trade , and investment relations , as well as important issues involving energy , climate change ; and human rights concerns . this report will be updated .
