radio frequency spectrum policy issues before congress are characterized by economic , technological and regulatory complexity . of particular interest to policy makers are the allocation of spectrum for specific types of use ( such as tv broadcasting , radio , advanced wireless services , or unlicensed ) and the assignment of licenses for exclusive or shared use of specific frequencies . today , most frequencies allocated for commercial uses are assigned through auctions , with licenses going to the highest bidder . another important allocation of spectrum is for unlicensed use . both commercial and non - commercial entities use unlicensed spectrum to meet a wide variety of monitoring and communications needs . suppliers of wireless devices must meet requirements for certification to operate on frequency bands designated for unlicensed use . examples of unlicensed use include garage door openers and wi - fi communications . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) regulates licensed and unlicensed spectrum not allocated for federal use , is responsible for auctioning spectrum licenses , and can also use its authority to redistribute licenses . proceeds from spectrum license sales are presently attributed to general revenue in the u.s. budget . in the 108 th congress , however , a precedent was established with the creation of a spectrum relocation fund to hold proceeds from the auction of specified radio frequencies allocated to federal use ; federal agencies vacating spectrum to be auctioned for commercial use are being compensated from the fund for costs of relocation . in the 109 th congress , the deficit reduction act ( p.l . 109-171 ) included provisions that placed certain auction proceeds in a digital television transition and public safety fund . the fund is being mainly used to assist the transition from analog television broadcasting to digital broadcasting , and for contributions to programs for public safety . over $ 7 billion of the auction proceeds were applied to deficit reduction . the funding came from the auction of spectrum ( at 700 mhz ) currently used for analog television broadcasting , to be vacated by february 17 , 2009. the auction , auction 73 , concluded on march 18,2008 ; it grossed $ 19,592,420,000 . the rules for auction 73 introduced two new business models for spectrum management and assignment that represented departures from past policy . one model designated a block of spectrum licenses for a network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device or software application , referred to as open access . the other model would require a shared network to accommodate both public safety and commercial users in a partnership . a national license , referred to as the d block , was put up for auction , as part of auction 73 , with a reserve price of $ 1.3 billion . the winning bidder would have been required to assume the cost and responsibility of building the network using d block spectrum and adjacent spectrum assigned to public safety . the sole bid for the d block was below the reserve price and consequently the d block will be re - auctioned . the prospects for this new auction have triggered a debate about the nature of competition in the wireless industry and the need for a nationwide public safety network that may be resolved by congress through legislation .
