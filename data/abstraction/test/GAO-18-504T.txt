snap is the largest federally funded nutrition assistance program . in fiscal year 2017 , it provided about $ 63 billion in benefits . usda and the states jointly administer snap and partner to address issues that affect program integrity , including improper payments and fraud . gao has previously reported on various aspects of snap , including state snap e & t programs , improper payment rates , recipient fraud , and retailer trafficking . this testimony discusses gao 's prior and ongoing work on snap e & t programs , including program participants , design , and usda oversight , and usda 's efforts to address snap program integrity , including improper payments , as well as recipient and retailer fraud . as part of its ongoing work on snap e & t programs , gao analyzed e & t expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 , the most recent data available ; reviewed relevant research from usda ; and interviewed usda and selected state and local officials . the prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four gao products on e & t programs ( gao - 03-388 ) , improper payments ( gao - 16-708t ) , recipient fraud ( gao - 14-641 ) , and retailer trafficking ( gao - 07-53 ) . information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product . overseen by the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and administered by states , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) employment and training ( e & t ) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million snap recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016 , according to the most recent usda data available . these programs are generally designed to help snap recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training . some recipients may be required to participate . according to usda , about 14 percent of snap recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016 , while others , such as children and the elderly , were generally exempt from these requirements . states have flexibility in how they design their e & t programs . over the last several years , states have 1 ) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation , 2 ) focused on serving able - bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time - limited unless they comply with work requirements , and 3 ) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services . usda has taken steps to increase support and oversight of snap e & t since 2014 , including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states . gao has ongoing work reviewing snap e & t programs , including usda oversight . usda and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity , including improper payments and fraud , and usda has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas , but issues remain . improper payments . in 2016 , gao reviewed snap improper payment rates and found that states ' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal snap policy in the previous decade , as well as improper payment rate calculation methods , likely affected these rates . although usda reported improper payment estimates for snap in previous years , usda did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states . usda has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review . recipient fraud . in 2014 , gao made recommendations to usda to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud . for example , gao found that usda 's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended usda develop additional guidance . since then , usda has provided technical assistance to some states , including on the use of data analytics . gao has ongoing work reviewing states ' use of data analytics to identify snap recipient fraud . retailer trafficking . in 2006 , gao identified several ways in which snap was vulnerable to retailer trafficking â€” a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non - food items . for example , usda had not conducted analyses to identify high - risk retailers and target its resources . since then , usda has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors . gao has ongoing work assessing how usda prevents , detects , and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of usda 's estimates of the extent of snap retailer trafficking . gao is not making new recommendations . usda generally concurred with gao 's prior recommendations .
