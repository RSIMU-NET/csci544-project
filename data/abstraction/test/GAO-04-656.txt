each year , about 2.5 million people file claims with the social security administration ( ssa ) for disability benefits . if the claim is denied at the initial level , the claimant may appeal to the hearings level . the hearings level has allowed more than half of all appealed claims , an allowance rate that has raised concerns about the consistency of decisions made at the two levels . to help ensure consistency , ssa began a `` process unification '' initiative in 1994 and recently announced a new proposal to strengthen its disability programs . this report examines the status of ssa 's process unification initiative , ssa 's assessments of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels , and whether ssa 's new proposal incorporates changes to improve consistency in decisions between adjudication levels . ssa has only partially implemented its process unification initiative . although the agency initially made improvements in its policies and training intended to address inconsistency in decisions made at the two adjudication levels , it has not continued to actively pursue these efforts . further , as part of this initiative , the agency implemented a review of hearings level decisions to identify ways to improve training and policies , but no new improvements were made as a result of the review . finally , the agency began tests of two process changes intended to improve the consistency of decision making between the two adjudication levels . one test , which is ongoing , was not well designed and therefore will not provide conclusive results . the other test was abandoned because of implementation difficulties . ssa 's assessments have not provided a clear understanding of the extent and causes of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels . the two measures ssa uses to monitor inconsistency of decisions have weaknesses , such as not accounting for the many factors that can affect decision outcomes , and therefore do not provide a true picture of the changes in consistency . furthermore , ssa has not sufficiently assessed the causes of possible inconsistency . for example , ssa conducted an analysis in 1994 that identified potential areas of inconsistency , but it did not employ more sophisticated techniques -- such as multivariate analyses , followed by in - depth case studies -- that would allow the agency to identify and address the key areas and leading causes of possible inconsistency . ssa has yet to repeat or expand upon this 10-year - old study . ssa 's new proposal incorporates changes intended to improve consistency in decisions between levels . however , challenges may hinder its implementation . most stakeholder groups for adjudicators and claimant representatives told us that a number of aspects of the proposal hold promise for improving consistency . these included one change , being tested as part of the process unification initiative , that requires state adjudicators to more fully develop and document their decisions , as well as several new changes , such as providing both adjudication levels with equal access to medical expertise . however , stakeholder groups also told us that insufficient resources and other obstacles might hinder the implementation of some changes . adding to uncertainties about the proposal 's overall success is its dependence on a new electronic folder system that would allow cases to be easily accessed by various adjudicators across the country . however , this technically complex project has not been fully tested .
