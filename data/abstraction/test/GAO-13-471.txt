federal agencies and state and local governments have established field - based entities ( e.g . , centers and task forces ) nationwide that share terrorism - related information , among other things . gao was asked to assess these entities . this report addresses the extent to which these entities are distinct , fragmented , overlapping , or duplicative ; the extent to which doj , dhs , and ondcp hold entities accountable for coordinating and have assessed coordination opportunities ; and how , if at all , doj , dhs , and ondcp incorporate information on the results entities achieve when making funding decisions . gao analyzed entities ' missions , activities , and coordination efforts in eight selected urban areas that range in geographic dispersion and risk . although not generalizable , this analysis provided insights . this is a public version of a sensitive report gao issued in march 2013. information the federal bureau of investigations ( fbi ) deemed sensitive has been redacted . five types of field - based information - sharing entities are supported , in part , by the federal government -- joint terrorism task forces , field intelligence groups , regional information sharing systems ( riss ) centers , state and major urban area fusion centers , and high intensity drug trafficking area ( hidta ) investigative support centers -- and have distinct missions , roles , and responsibilities . however , gao identified 91 instances of overlap in some analytical activities -- such as producing intelligence reports -- and 32 instances of overlap in investigative support activities , such as identifying links between criminal organizations . these entities conducted similar activities within the same mission area , such as counterterrorism , for similar customers , such as federal or state agencies . this can lead to benefits , such as the corroboration of information , but may also burden customers with redundant information . gao also found that riss centers and hidtas operate three different systems that duplicate the same function -- identifying when different law enforcement entities may be conducting a similar enforcement action , such as a raid at the same location , to ensure officer safety -- resulting in some inefficiencies . riss and hidta have taken steps to connect two of the systems , but hidta does not have target time frames to connect the third system . a commitment to time frames would help reduce risks to officer safety and potentially lessen the burden on law enforcement agencies that are currently using multiple systems . agencies have neither held entities accountable for coordinating nor assessed opportunities for further enhancing coordination to help reduce the potential for overlap and achieve efficiencies . the departments of justice ( doj ) and homeland security ( dhs ) , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) -- the federal agencies that oversee or provide support to the five types of field - based entities -- acknowledged that entities working together and sharing information is important , but they do not hold the entities accountable for such coordination . a mechanism that enables agencies to monitor the results of coordination efforts could encourage more coordination , help reduce any unnecessary overlap and leverage resources . officials in the eight urban areas said that practices such as having representatives from other agencies on governance boards and colocating entities where possible enhanced coordination , information sharing , and efficiencies -- in their view , reducing the potential of unnecessary overlap . federal agencies have not assessed the extent to which such practices could be further implemented and , therefore , may be missing opportunities to maximize benefits . the program manager for the information sharing environment ( pm - ise ) -- which manages efforts to enhance sharing governmentwide -- has not reported on specific coordination efforts across the entities . including agencies ' assessment progress in the annual reports to the congress would enhance accountability . the agencies collect information on entities ' results , but vary in the extent to which they consider the results when they make decisions about future funding . for example , agencies may consider other factors -- such as risk and threats -- rather than results , or funding decisions may be determined by state grant recipients or set in part by statutory or other requirements . gao recommends that ondcp work with hidta officials to establish time frames to connect systems ; dhs , doj , and ondcp develop measures to hold entities accountable for coordination and assess opportunities to enhance coordination ; and the pm - ise report on the results of the agenciesÂ’ efforts to assess coordination . dhs , ondcp , and the pm - ise concurred . doj generally agreed with the intent of the recommendations , but disagreed with their underlying premises that doj was not already taking such actions . gao believes these actions do not fully address the recommendations as discussed further in this report .
