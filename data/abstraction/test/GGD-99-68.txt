pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed events related to personnel reassignments , appointments , and activities at the small business administration ( sba ) . gao noted that : sba made hundreds of appointments during the 1990s using competitive procedures for career appointments , special noncompetitive hiring authority for the office of advocacy , and political appointment procedures for other appointments ; for the appointments that gao reviewed , gao found that sba adhered to the different procedural requirements ; for example , although 6 of the 42 district director appointees were hired from outside sba to the career positions , and 2 of them had political backgrounds , gao found nothing procedurally amiss in the hiring process ; gao determined , however , that in several cases sba did not follow applicable federal regulations when setting the starting salary at a rate higher than the minimum rate for the grade ; sba could not provide the documentation required by federal regulations to support the advanced salary settings ; sba has developed draft procedures that , if properly implemented , should help prevent such situations from recurring ; gao also determined that sba poorly controlled its interagency detailing of employees , with the result that cost reimbursements were not always being collected ; and sba officials advised gao that they are developing new procedures to better control interagency details and collections of reimbursements .
