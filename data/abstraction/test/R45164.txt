according to the centers for disease control and prevention , the annual number of drug overdose deaths involving prescription opioids ( such as hydrocodone , oxycodone , and methadone ) and illicit opioids ( such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical fentanyl ) has more than quadrupled since 1999. a november 2017 report issued by the president 's commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis also observed that `` [ t ] he crisis in opioid overdose deaths has reached epidemic proportions in the united states ... and currently exceeds all other drug - related deaths or traffic fatalities . . how the current opioid epidemic happened , and who may be responsible for fueling it , are complicated questions , though reports suggest that several parties likely played contributing roles , including pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors , doctors , health insurance companies , rogue pharmacies , and drug dealers and addicts . many federal departments and agencies are involved in efforts to combat opioid abuse and addiction , including a law enforcement agency within the u.s. department of justice , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , which is the focus of this report . the primary federal law governing the manufacture , distribution , and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the controlled substances act ( csa ) , a statute that the dea is principally responsible for administering and enforcing . the csa and dea regulations promulgated thereunder establish a framework through which the federal government regulates the manufacture , distribution , importation , exportation , and use of certain substances which have the potential for abuse or psychological or physical dependence , including opioids . congress enacted the csa in 1970 to facilitate the availability of controlled substances for authorized medical , scientific , research , and industrial purposes , while also preventing these substances from being diverted out of legitimate channels for illegal purposes such as drug abuse and drug trafficking activities . the csa aims to protect the public 's health and safety from dangers posed by highly addictive or dangerous controlled substances that are diverted into the illicit market , while also ensuring that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes such as the treatment of pain . this report describes the current federal legal regime governing opioids and other controlled substances under the csa and its implementing regulations , including ( 1 ) the classification of various plants , drugs , and chemicals into one of five schedules based on the substance 's medical use , potential for abuse , and safety or dependence liability ; ( 2 ) who must register with the dea in order to receive authorization to handle the substances ( such as drug manufacturers , wholesale distributors , doctors , hospitals , pharmacies , and scientific researchers ) ; ( 3 ) what obligations registrants must satisfy in order to maintain a valid registration ( such as keeping records of drug inventories and transactions , submitting reports to the dea , and providing security measures to safeguard controlled substances ) ; and ( 4 ) the dea 's administrative , civil , and criminal authorities for enforcing regulatory compliance with the csa ( such as suspending or revoking a registrant 's legal authority to handle controlled substances if the dea administrator finds that the registrant has `` committed such acts as would render his registration ... inconsistent with the public interest . '' ) . the report then examines dea initiatives and actions taken , pursuant to its legal authorities under the csa , which specifically target the abuse of opioids . the report concludes by describing the legislative response to the opioid epidemic , including a summary of the amendments to the csa made by legislation enacted by the 115th congress , the substance use - disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act ( p.l . 115-271 ) .
