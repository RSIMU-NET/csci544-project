the people 's republic of china ( prc ) has the world 's largest number of internet users , estimated at 500 million people . despite government efforts to limit the flow of online news , chinese internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information , and political activists have utilized the web as a vital communications tool . in recent years , twitter - like microblogging has surged , resulting in dramatic cases of dissident communication and public comment on sensitive political issues . however , the web has proven to be less of a democratic catalyst in china than many observers had hoped . the prc government has one of the most rigorous internet censorship systems , which relies heavily upon cooperation between the government and private internet companies . some u.s. policy makers have been especially critical of the compliance of some u.s. internet communications and technology ( ict ) companies with china 's censorship and policing activities . the development of the internet and its use in china have raised u.s. congressional concerns , including those related to human rights , trade and investment , and cybersecurity . the link between the internet and human rights , a pillar of u.s. foreign policy toward china , is the main focus of this report . congressional interest in the internet in china is tied to human rights concerns in a number of ways . these include the following : the use of the internet as a u.s. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in china , the use of the internet by political dissidents in the prc , and the political repression that such use often provokes , the role of u.s. internet companies in both spreading freedom in china and complying with prc censorship and social control efforts , and the development of u.s. internet freedom policies globally . since 2006 , congressional committees and commissions have held nine hearings on internet freedom and related issues , with a large emphasis on china . in response to criticism , in 2008 , yahoo ! , microsoft , google , and other parties founded the global network initiative , a set of guidelines that promotes awareness , due diligence , and transparency regarding the activities of ict companies and their impacts on human rights , particularly in countries where governments frequently violate the rights of internet users to freedom of expression and privacy . in the 112th congress , the global online freedom act ( h.r . 3605 ) would require u.s. companies to disclose any censorship or surveillance technology that they provide to internet - restricting countries . it also would bar u.s. companies from selling technology that could be used for the purposes of censorship or surveillance in such countries . for over a decade , the united states government has sought to promote global internet freedom , particularly in china and iran . in 2006 , the bush administration established the global internet freedom task force , which was renamed the netfreedom task force under the obama administration . congress provided $ 95 million for global internet freedom programs between 2008 and 2012. the broadcasting board of governors has spent approximately $ 2 million annually during the past decade to help enable internet users in china and other internet - restricting countries to access its websites , such as voice of america and radio free asia . some experts argue that support for counter - censorship technology , which has long dominated the u.s. effort to promote global internet freedom , has had an important but limited impact . obstacles to internet freedom in china and elsewhere include not only censorship but also the following : advances in government capabilities to monitor and attack online dissident activity ; tight restrictions on social networking ; and the lack of popular pressure for greater internet freedom . as part of a broadening policy approach , the u.s. government has sponsored a widening range of internet freedom programs , including censorship circumvention technology ; privacy protection and online security ; training civil society groups in effective uses of the web for communications , organizational , and advocacy purposes ; and spreading awareness of internet freedom .
