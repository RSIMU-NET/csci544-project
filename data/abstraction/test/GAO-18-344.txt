o & s costs — the costs used to operate and sustain a program — can account for up to 70 percent of a program 's total cost . end users rely on o & s funds for maintenance , spares , and personnel . dhs programs initially identify o & s costs in their life - cycle cost estimate at the outset of the acquisition . this estimate informs the program 's budget and affects the amount the department designates for the program 's use . in 2015 , gao found that dhs 's budget requests did not reflect all estimated costs — including o & s — for certain programs , which limits visibility for decision makers . gao was asked to review o & s activities for major acquisition programs at dhs . this report examines the extent that dhs 's budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight , and cost estimates are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated . gao selected a non - generalizable sample of 11 major acquisition programs , based on asset type and acquisition status , as case studies from selected dhs components . gao analyzed selected programs ' o & s cost estimates , funding , and spending . in addition , gao interviewed dhs officials at the headquarters , component , and program office level . while the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) budget management provides flexibility to conduct operations , such as shifting funds to programs within the same mission area to cover unforeseen needs , budget reporting does not provide congress with insight into specific programs ' operations and support o & s costs . the o & s budget information that dhs reports to congress is oriented by mission — for example , integrated operations — instead of by program — for example , the multi - role enforcement aircraft program . the figure depicts the mission - oriented nature of the budget . while some program - oriented o & s data are available at the component level , this information does not appear in dhs 's budget reports to congress . this disparity is due in part to the manner in which the department reports budget information . however , these limitations are not insurmountable . standards for internal controls state that managers should communicate quality information , in this case full program costs . providing additional data on o & s costs in budget reports would preserve dhs 's flexibility in its use of funds while providing congress a better understanding of the budgetary and programmatic effect of its funding decisions . gao reviewed the o & s portion of the most recently approved cost estimates for selected programs and found that 10 of the 11 estimates provided a complete accounting of all resources and associated cost elements . further , all the programs had appropriately updated their cost estimates as required , a gao best practice in cost estimating . due to the sensitive nature of some programs ' cost models , gao could not verify all aspects of accuracy for all estimates reviewed . gao is making three recommendations , including that dhs work with congress to add program - level o & s funding details to the budget information it provides congress . dhs concurred .
