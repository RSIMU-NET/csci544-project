the farm service agency ( fsa ) runs a direct loan program that provides loans to farmers who are unable to obtain private commercial credit to buy and operate farms . fsa is required to administer this program in a fair , unbiased manner . gao found that during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , fsa averaged 4 days longer to process loan applications from hispanic farmers than it did for non - hispanic farmers : 20 days versus 16 days . however , the processing times in three of the four states with the highest number of hispanic borrowers was faster that it was for non - hispanic borrowers in those states . fsa 's direct loan approval rate was somewhat lower for hispanic farmers than for non - hispanic farmers nationwide -- 83 and 90 percent , respectively . the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) policies for staying foreclosures when discrimination has been alleged depend on the method used to lodge complaints . when an individual has a discrimination complaint accepted by usda 's office of civil rights ( ocr ) , fsa 's policy is to automatically issue a stay of foreclosure until the complaint has been resolved . a gao survey revealed that during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , fsa foreclosed on the loans of 600 borrowers nationwide . although hispanic farmers make up 4 percent of the agency 's direct loan portfolio , 3 percent of these foreclosures involved hispanic farmers . ocr has made modest progress in the length of time it takes to process discrimination complaints . usda requirements direct ocr to complete its processing up through the investigative phase of complaints within 180 days of acceptance . it does not , however , have a time requirement for all of the phases of complaint processing .
