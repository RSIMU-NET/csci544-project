pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined whether the movement of funds from bank deposits into mutual funds affects the availability of credit for residential , consumer , or commercial purposes . gao found that : the amount of money in mutual funds grew from $ 994 billion at year - end 1989 to $ 2,172 billion at year - end 1994 , mainly due to an increase of net customer inflows ; during the same period , bank deposits declined from $ 3.55 billion to $ 3.46 billion ; as much as $ 700 billion of the growth in mutual funds may have come at the expense of bank deposits between 1990 and 1994 ; the movement of money into mutual funds has resulted partly from the relatively lower interest rates paid on bank deposits , but this should have little effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds , since mutual funds also lend or invest a major portion of the funds they receive ; there was insufficient data on whether the different categories of borrowers were affected by the shift of money from bank deposits to mutual funds ; all categories of borrowers have recently increased their access to financing obtained through the securities markets ; and flows of deposits out of smaller banks could reduce the availability of finance for small businesses whose primary source of finance is loans from such banks .
