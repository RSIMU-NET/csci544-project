medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health services for most persons 65 years of age and older and for most permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. part a of the program , the hospital insurance program , covers hospital , post - hospital , and hospice services . part b , the supplementary medical insurance program , is optional and covers a broad range of complementary medical services including physician , laboratory , outpatient hospital services , and durable medical equipment . part c provides private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in both parts a and b. part d is an optional outpatient prescription drug program . medicare has established specific rules for payment of covered benefits . some , such as physician services and most durable medical equipment , are based on fee schedules . a fee schedule is a list of medicare payments for specific items and services , which are calculated according to statutorily specified formula and take into account the actual amount of care provided . many services , including inpatient and outpatient hospital care , are paid under different prospective payment systems ( ppss ) . a prospective payment system is a method of paying hospitals , or other providers , amounts or rates of payment that are established in advance for a defined period and are generally based on an episode of care , regardless of the actual amount of care used . other payments are based , in part , on a provider 's bid ( an estimate of the cost of providing a service ) relative to a benchmark ( the maximum amount medicare will pay ) . bids and benchmarks are used to determine payments in medicare parts c and d. payments for some items of durable medical equipment in specified locations are also based on the bids of competing providers . in general , the program provides for annual updates to these payment amounts . the program also has rules regarding the amount of cost sharing , if any , that beneficiaries can be billed in excess of medicare 's recognized payment levels . unlike other services , medicare 's outpatient prescription drug benefit can be obtained only through private plans . further , while all part d plans must meet certain minimum requirements , they differ in terms of benefit design , formulary drugs , premiums , and cost - sharing amounts . medicare payment policies and potential changes to these policies are of continuing interest to congress . the medicare program has been a major focus of deficit reduction legislation since 1980. in each congress since the 105th congress , laws have been passed to both increase , but more often slow , the rate of growth of payments to medicare providers and private plans . perhaps of particular interest in the 113rd congress is the update to the medicare physician fee schedule . the method for updating the physician fee schedule amount , known as the sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) , would have resulted in negative updates for physician payments in recent years , except that congress has stepped in to stop the updates . physician payment rates , which would have fallen 26.5 % in the absence of congressional action , are frozen through december 31 , 2013. under current law , medicare physician fee schedule payments are to be reduced by 24.4 % beginning january 2014. this report provides an overview of medicare payment rules by type of service , outlines current payment policies , and summarizes the basic rules for payment updates . in addition to the payment information provided in the tables of this report , medicare is subject to a maximum 2 % payment reduction due to sequestration . this report will be updated twice a year to reflect recent fiscal year and calendar year changes , and will be updated to reflect the details of how the 2 % reduction in payments will be applied .
