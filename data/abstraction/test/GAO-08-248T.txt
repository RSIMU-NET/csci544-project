social security covers about 96 percent of all u.s. workers ; the vast majority of the remaining 4 percent are public employees . although these noncovered workers do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings , they may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses ' or their own earnings from other covered employment . social security has provisions -- the government pension offset ( gpo ) and the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) -- that attempt to take noncovered employment into account when calculating the social security benefits for public employees . however , these provisions have been difficult to administer and critics contend that the provisions themselves are often unfair . the committee asked gao to discuss the issues regarding the coverage of public employees under social security , the provisions to take noncovered employment into account , and the proposals to modify those provisions . there are no easy answers to the difficulties of equalizing social security 's treatment of covered workers and noncovered public employees . about one - fourth of public employees -- primarily state and local government workers -- are not covered by social security and do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings . nevertheless , these workers may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses ' or their own earnings from other covered employment . to address concerns with how noncovered workers are treated compared with covered workers , social security has provisions in place to take noncovered employment into account and reduce social security benefits for public employees . to be administered fairly and accurately , both these provisions require complete and accurate reporting of government pension income , which is not currently available . the resulting disparity in the application of the provisions is a continuing source of confusion and frustration for affected workers . thus , various changes that would affect the gpo and wep provisions have been proposed , such as : eliminate the gpo and wep provisions . this would simplify administration and avoid concerns about unfair treatment among public employees . however , any reductions in the gpo or the wep would widen social security 's financial gap and would raise concerns about unfair treatment of public employees compared with other workers . extend mandatory coverage . if all newly hired state and local government employees who are not currently covered were to become covered , the need for the gpo and wep could be phased out over time . in 2005 , social security actuaries estimated that mandating coverage for these employees would reduce the 75-year actuarial deficit by about 11 percent . while mandatory coverage could enhance retirement benefits for the affected workers , it could also result in significant costs to the affected state and local governments . as long as the gpo and the wep remain in effect , it will be important to administer the provisions effectively and equitably based on accurate and complete information on both covered and noncovered employment .
