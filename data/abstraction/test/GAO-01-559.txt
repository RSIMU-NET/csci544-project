this report examines the working capital fund activities for the department of defense ( dod ) . gao identifies potential changes in current management processes or policies that , if made , would result in a more efficient operation and evaluates various aspects of the dod policy that allow defense working capital fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next . gao found that dod lacks a sound analytical basis for its current 3-month carryover standard . dod established a 3-month carryover standard for most working capital fund activity groups , although it has not done the analysis necessary to support the 3-month standard . without a validation process , neither dod nor congressional decisionmakers can be sure that the 3-month standard is providing activity groups with reasonable amounts of carryover to ensure a smooth transition from one fiscal year to the next or whether the carryover is excessive . in addition , carryover information currently reported under the 3-month standard is not comparable between services and is misleading to dod and congressional decisionmakers . specifically , results can differ markedly because the military services use different methods to calculate the number of months of carryover . further complicating the congressional budget review of carryovers is that some activity groups have underestimated their budgeted carryover year after year , thereby providing decisionmakers with misleading year - end carryover information and resulting in more funding being provided than was intended . gao also reviewed the potential financial impact of reducing the amount of fiscal year - end carryover permitted by dod policy . gao 's analysis showed that if a 30-day , 60-day or 75-day carryover policy had been in effect during the fiscal year 2001 budget review process , the amount of budgeted customer orders could have been reduced by about $ 2.9 billion , $ 1.6 billion , or $ 1.0 billion , respectively .
