federal obligations under sba 's 8 business development program totaled about $ 10.9 billion in fiscal year 2019 , according to federal procurement data reported as of october 7 , 2019. sba 's 8 program is one of the federal government 's primary vehicles for developing socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses , including firms owned by ancs . one of the key benefits of this program is the ability for anc - owned firms to receive federal contract awards that have been set aside solely for 8 firms . from 2006 through 2016 , gao issued three reports detailing the limitations of sba 's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 program . gao 's testimony discusses the highlights of the aforementioned three reports and the extent to which sba has addressed the recommendations gao made in those reports , as of october 2019. gao examined sba files and other documents , conducted site visits , and interviewed program officials to perform the work of those reports . in three reports issued between 2006 and 2016 , gao has found persistent weaknesses in the small business administration 's ( sba ) oversight and monitoring of tribal 8 firms , in particular the alaska native corporations ' ( anc ) subsidiary firms ( anc - owned firms ) that participate in sba 's 8 program . over the course of the program , qualified small , disadvantaged businesses , including anc - owned firms , can receive federal contract awards that have been set aside solely for such businesses , and business development support from sba , such as mentoring , financial assistance , and other management and technical assistance . in its three reports , among other things , gao found that sba had incomplete information and documentation on anc - owned firms and their compliance with regulatory requirements ; limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce its own program ; insufficient staffing in its alaska district office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks ; and inadequate or vague program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations . gao made 21 recommendations to sba that address weaknesses in sba 's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 program . sba has taken steps to implement many of those recommendations , including enhancing training for sba staff that emphasized program rules , and developing and implementing a regulation that helps sba better enforce rules against anc - owned firms obtaining contracts for which they were not necessarily eligible . however , sba has not yet implemented recommendations that , if implemented as intended , could significantly improve its oversight of the 8 program . for example , sba has not yet addressed limitations raised in gao 's 2006 and 2016 reports regarding sba 's tracking of revenue information for anc - owned firms , which limits sba 's oversight of 8 rules prohibiting multiple subsidiaries under one anc from generating revenue in the same primary line of business — which 8 program regulations intend to limit . sba officials informed gao of the agency 's plans to develop an information system capable of addressing this issue . however , at the time of gao 's 2016 report , sba could not provide detailed information or plans about this system , and as of today , the agency could not provide documentation that this system is operational . as another example , sba has not addressed gao 's 2006 recommendation to consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing contracting opportunities when sba awards contracts through the 8 program to anc - owned firms , as required in regulation — an area where gao found that sba had fallen short in its oversight . instead , in 2009 , sba reported that it performed a single analysis of a limited set of procurement data from a limited period and concluded the data did not indicate that other small 8 firms ( e.g . , black - owned , hispanic - owned , and others ) were losing contracting opportunities to anc - owned firms . however , sba 's actions did not address the intent of gao 's recommendation to “ consistently ” perform this oversight . absent action on these recommendations , the program continues to be at risk of noncompliance . gao made multiple recommendations in its reports from 2006 through 2016 , many of which sba has taken steps to implement . however , sba has not addressed key gao recommendations , including tracking and sharing anc - related information across sba regional offices , considering the establishment of criteria thresholds for contract modifications , and developing policies to consistently assess whether other small businesses are losing 8 contracts to anc - owned firms . gao continues to believe that implementing these recommendations would enhance sba 's oversight and monitoring of firms in the 8 program .
