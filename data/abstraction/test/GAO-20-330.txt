in december 2017 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) updated its policy on pregnant women , removing language that stated that pregnant women would generally not be detained except in extraordinary circumstances or as mandated by law . within dhs , cbp temporarily holds individuals in its facilities and processes them for further action , such as release or transfer to ice . ice manages the nation 's immigration detention system . ice utilizes various facility types to detain individuals , such as those owned and operated by ice and contract facilities . gao was asked to review issues related to the care of pregnant women in dhs facilities . this report examines what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in dhs facilities , dhs policies and standards that address the care of pregnant women , and what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in dhs facilities . gao analyzed available dhs data and documents from calendar years 2015 through 2019 , including detention data , inspection reports and data , and complaints ; reviewed policies related to the care of pregnant women ; and interviewed agency officials and three national non - governmental organizations . gao also interviewed a non - generalizable sample of 14 pregnant women detained or released by dhs and five non - governmental organizations in four field locations that had the greatest number of detentions of pregnant women , among other things . gao 's analyses of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) and u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) data on pregnant women found : ice detained pregnant women over 4,600 times from calendar year 2016 through 2018 , with more than 90 percent resulting from cbp arrests . sixty - eight percent of these detentions were for 1 week or less , while 10 percent were for more than 30 days . seventy - eight percent of these initial detentions occurred at facilities staffed with ice medical personnel . ice has policies and detention standards that address a variety of topics regarding the care of pregnant women , such as pregnancy testing requirements , for which non - governmental organizations , professional associations , and federal agencies have issued recommended guidance . however , some facility types — which vary based on who owns , operates , and provides medical care at the facility — did not address all these pregnancy - related topics in their policies and standards , such as prenatal vitamins , as of december 2019. ice has plans to address the gaps gao identified in these facility types , including updating some of its policies and detention standards in february 2020. in regards to cbp , its facilities are designed for holding individuals for no more than 72 hours , and therefore are not equipped to provide long - term care . nonetheless , cbp has some policies and standards regarding pregnant women for its short - term facilities , including those related to nutrition and the circumstances in which restraints could be used . gao 's analyses of inspections and complaint mechanisms offered the following insights into the care provided to pregnant women : ice inspections found 79 percent or greater compliance with most of its pregnancy - related performance measures . for example , inspections found 91 percent of pregnant woman were seen by an obstetrician - gynecologist within 30 days of pregnancy confirmation , from december 2016 through march 2019. according to ice officials and agency documentation , ice has processes in place to address non - compliance . additional inspections identified pregnancy - related issues at 13 facilities from january 2015 through july 2019. the facilities or ice have taken actions to address the issues . cbp generally relies on offsite care for pregnant women , and as a result has limited information on care cbp provided . however , cbp has efforts underway to enhance medical support at selected facilities . over 100 complaints were filed about ice 's and cbp 's care of pregnant women from january 2015 through april 2019. of these complaints , 3 were substantiated or partially substantiated , and 24 were unsubstantiated or partially unsubstantiated . in most cases there was not enough information for the investigating agency to determine whether proper care had been provided .
