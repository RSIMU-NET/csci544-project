to address concerns with the current medicare ffs cost - sharing design , various groups have proposed modernizing the design to make it simpler and include features found in private plans . these proposals have generally included a single deductible , modified cost - sharing requirements ( e.g . , a uniform coinsurance ) , and the addition of a cap on beneficiaries ' annual cost - sharing responsibilities . gao was asked to review how modernized cost - sharing designs would affect beneficiaries ' costs over multiple years . this report describes implications of the current cost - sharing design ; options for modernizing ; and how modernized cost - sharing designs could directly and indirectly affect beneficiaries ' costs . gao reviewed studies related to modernizing medicare 's cost - sharing design and interviewed authors of those studies and other experts . gao also used summarized medicare claims data from 2007 to 2014 ( the most recent data available ) to develop four illustrative modernized designs , each including a single deductible , uniform coinsurance , and an annual cap while maintaining medicare program spending similar to the current design . for each design , gao calculated how beneficiaries ' annual cost - sharing responsibilities compared with the current design over a 1- , 4- , and 8-year time horizon . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate . gao and others have raised concerns about the design of medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing — the portion of costs beneficiaries are responsible for when they receive care . the current cost - sharing design has been largely unchanged since medicare 's enactment in 1965 , can be confusing for beneficiaries , and can contribute to overuse of services . additionally , the design leaves some beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs that can exceed tens of thousands of dollars annually . the complexity of the design and lack of an annual cap on cost - sharing responsibilities also increases demand for supplemental insurance , which can cost beneficiaries thousands annually and further contribute to overuse of services . modernizing medicare ffs 's cost - sharing design to include features found in private plans could help address these concerns , but would involve design trade - offs . for example , adding an annual cap on cost - sharing responsibilities while maintaining medicare 's aggregate share of costs similar to the current design would involve a trade - off between the level of the cap and other cost - sharing requirements . in analyzing four illustrative ffs cost - sharing designs , gao found that the direct effect of modernizing the design on beneficiaries ' cost - sharing responsibilities — that is , the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant — would depend on the specific revisions and the time horizon examined . for example , gao found that during year 1 , cost - sharing designs that feature relatively low deductibles ( costs a beneficiary is responsible for before medicare starts to pay ) and relatively high caps would result in a median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility close to or below that of the current design . in contrast , designs with relatively low caps — and therefore greater beneficiary protection from catastrophic costs — would result in a median annual cost - sharing responsibility above that of the current design . by the end of 8 years , there would still be differences in the median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility across different designs , but they would become less pronounced . modernizing the medicare ffs cost - sharing design would also affect beneficiaries ' costs indirectly through altered incentives . the studies gao reviewed and experts gao interviewed identified several types of behavioral responses that would influence the net effect of a modernized design on beneficiaries ' out - of - pocket costs , including changes in beneficiaries ' demand for and insurers ' supply of supplemental insurance ; changes in beneficiaries ' use of services ; changes in medicare beneficiaries ' enrollment in ffs versus medicare 's private plan alternative ; and interactions among these and other behavioral responses , including effects on the price of supplemental insurance .
