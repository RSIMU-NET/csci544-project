this report compares selected recommendations of the president 's commission on care for america 's returning wounded warriors ( pccww ) , often called the dole - shalala commission in reference to its co - chairs , and the veterans ' disability benefits commission ( vdbc ) . the vdbc was established in 2004 to study veterans ' benefits in a broad context . the pccww was established in 2007 following reports of problems among injured servicemembers returning from iraq and afghanistan with medical rehabilitation and access to benefits . the pccww was charged to focus specifically on the needs of these individuals . the recommendations presented in this report are those that relate to the transition of injured servicemembers from military service to civilian life and / or veteran status . this report does not examine certain other recommendations , such as those in the vdbc report regarding benefits for survivors of deceased servicemembers , or regarding evaluation of presumptive disability , i.e . , establishing service connection for certain long - term health effects of hazardous exposures . as this report is limited to a comparison of the final recommendations of the pccww and the vdbc , it will not be updated .
