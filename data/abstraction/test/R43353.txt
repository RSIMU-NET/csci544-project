after decades of activities in space , earth 's orbit is littered with man - made objects that no longer serve a useful purpose . this includes roughly 22,000 objects larger than the size of a softball and hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments . this population of space debris potentially threatens u.s. national security interests in space , both governmental ( military , intelligence , and civil ) and commercial . congress has broadly supported the full range of these national security interests and has a vested concern in ensuring a strong and continued u.s. presence in space . two events in recent years dramatically increased the amount of fragmentation debris in orbit . one was the 2007 chinese anti - satellite test and , in 2009 , an active u.s. commercial satellite accidentally collided with a defunct russian satellite . although the 2013 movie gravity exaggerated the issue and took certain artistic liberties , the film graphically depicted and drew the public 's attention to the potential destruction of operational satellites and other platforms in space from collisions with orbital debris . some experts maintain the population growth of debris in space will be primarily driven by catastrophic collisions that are likely to occur every five to nine years . for decades , the united states has worked to minimize the amount of orbital debris left from its space launches and inactive satellites . many space - faring nations have adopted similar mitigation measures , and additional voluntary international codes of conduct are being pursued . many experts now believe that mitigation efforts alone are insufficient to prevent the continual increase of space debris . a growing view among experts holds that some level of active removal of debris from the space environment is necessary . nevertheless , such efforts are technologically immature and face significant budgetary and legal obstacles . congress has an opportunity to explore these issues through hearings , for instance with major stakeholders in the u.s. national security and civil space communities , and the commercial sector . efforts to find international agreement on mitigation may involve congressional prerogatives on advice and consent , and any program to pursue remediation will likely entail appropriations support from congress .
