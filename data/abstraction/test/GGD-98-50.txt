pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on whether federal prison industries ( fpi ) collects and maintains data that would enable it to make reliable , generalizable statements about the satisfaction of its federal agency customers with respect to the quality , cost , and timely delivery of fpi 's products , focusing on : if fpi has data , either from its management information system or other sources , to support overall conclusions about how federal customers who buy and use its products and services view their timeliness , price , and quality ; and whether agencies who are among the largest buyers of fpi products and services monitor fpi 's performance the same way they do commercial vendors in terms of timeliness , price , and quality . gao noted that : fpi has been the subject of substantial debate over the years , much of which has centered on the timeliness , price , and quality of its products ; missing from this debate have been convincing data that show whether federal customers who buy and use fpi products and services are satisfied with fpi 's performance ; fpi has a variety of management information systems that allow it to track customer orders and react to complaints ; however , fpi does not have a systematic or structured process for collecting and analyzing customer satisfaction data so that conclusions can be drawn about customer satisfaction ; fpi 's efforts to gauge customer satisfaction have been limited to relying on narrowly scoped surveys as well as other efforts ; without convincing data on customer satisfaction , fpi : remains vulnerable to assertions by its critics that federal customers are dissatisfied and , in turn , should no longer be required to buy fpi products ; and may miss opportunities to improve its operations by having better data on how federal customers view its performance in the areas of timeliness , price , and quality ; furthermore , fpi 's lack of a systematic approach for collecting these data appears inconsistent with contemporary management principles used by both public - and private - sector organizations ; regarding agencies ' efforts to monitor fpi performance , major customer agencies that gao contacted stated that they consider price when awarding contracts and monitor factors like quality and timeliness while administering contracts for all vendors , including fpi ; it should be recognized , however , that the contracting officer 's leverage in resolving procurement problems is different for fpi than for private - sector vendors since the rules that typically govern contracts with private - sector vendors do not apply to fpi ; in this regard , on september 13 , 1993 , the acting attorney general issued a legal opinion that fpi , as a seller of goods to the federal government , is not covered by the federal acquisition regulations ( far ) , and must be treated under its authorizing legislation far subpart 8.6 ; furthermore , agencies can not use past performance information to deny awarding a contract to fpi because , under the law , fpi is a mandatory source of supply ; and however , at fpi 's discretion , agencies can use it to negotiate with fpi factors such as product quality or delivery time frames , or to seek a waiver from fpi so that they can buy from a commercial vendor that can better meet their quality or delivery requirements .
