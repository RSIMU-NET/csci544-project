long - term services and supports ( ltss ) refer to a broad range of health and health - related services and supports needed by individuals who lack the capacity for self - care due to a physical , cognitive , or mental disability or condition . often the individual 's disability or condition results in the need for hands - on assistance or supervision over an extended period of time . medicaid plays a key role in covering ltss to aged and disabled individuals . as the largest single payer of ltss in the united states , federal and state medicaid spending accounted for $ 149.4 billion or 42.5 % of all ltss expenditures in 2015 ( $ 351.8 billion ) . ltss are also a substantial portion of spending within the medicaid program relative to the population served , accounting for 31 % of all medicaid spending in 2015. of the 68.5 million total enrolled medicaid population , an estimated 4.1 million ( or 5.9 % ) received ltss in fy2013 . medicaid funds ltss for eligible beneficiaries in both institutional and home and community - based settings , though the portfolio of services offered differs substantially by state . moreover , states are required to offer certain medicaid institutional services to eligible beneficiaries , while the majority of medicaid home and community - based services ( hcbs ) are optional for states . in recent decades , federal authority has expanded to assist states in increasing and diversifying their medicaid ltss coverage to include hcbs . as a result , the share of medicaid ltss spending for hcbs has nearly tripled , accounting for 18 % of medicaid ltss spending in 1995 to over half ( 53 % ) of total medicaid ltss spending in fy2014 . states now have a broad range of coverage options to select from when designing their ltss programs . in general , medicaid law provides states with two broad authorities , which either cover certain ltss as a benefit under the medicaid state plan or cover home and community - based ltss through a waiver program which permits states to disregard certain medicaid requirements in the provision of these services , subject to approval . the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) established or extended several medicaid state plan options and grant activities to enhance or expand states ' ltss delivery systems . given the range of available coverage options , states continue to enhance or expand their ltss delivery systems to cover additional services or target services to specific populations with a focus on hcbs . in fy2016 and fy2017 , most states reported activities to expand hcbs ( 46 and 47 states , respectively ) , which include expanding section 1915 ( c ) hcbs waiver authority programs or the section 1915 ( i ) hcbs state plan option , among other programmatic changes . this report provides a description of the various statutory authorities that either require or otherwise allow states to cover ltss under medicaid . appendix a provides a brief legislative history of medicaid ltss from medicaid 's enactment and initial coverage requirements for institutional care through the evolution of hcbs options available to states . a discussion of changes to medicaid made by the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) with respect to ltss coverage options is also provided . the tables in appendix b provide state information about coverage of medicaid state plan optional benefits .
