pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed year 2000 ( y2k ) computing crisis risks to the department of education , focusing on : student financial aid systems ; actions the department has taken in recent months to address these risks ; and key issues the department must deal with if its systems are to be ready for the century change : testing of systems , exchanging data with internal and external partners , and developing business continuity and contingency plans . gao noted that : education faces major risks that y2k failures could severely disrupt the student financial aid delivery process , including delaying disbursements and application processing ; further , because of systems interdependencies , repercussions from y2k - related problems could be felt throughout the student financial aid community -- a network including students , institutions of higher educations , financial organizations , and other government agencies ; the department was very slow in implementing a comprehensive y2k program to address these risks -- basic awareness and assessment tasks were not completed until recently ; education is now accelerating its program , but with the slow start , it remains in a position of playing catch up ; accordingly , the department has major challenges ahead but limited time remaining to adequately deal with them ; and therefore , it must also focus on developing appropriate contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of key systems failures .
