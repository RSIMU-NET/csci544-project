beginning in 2010 , omb initiated a series of it reform efforts to consolidate the growing number of data centers and eliminate duplicative spending . in may 2012 , the agency began a “ cut and reinvest ” effort that required agencies to propose fiscal year 2014 it reductions and reinvestments . gao was asked to review agencies ' savings from omb 's it reform efforts and determine how those savings are being reinvested . the objectives were to assess agencies ' progress in achieving savings from their it reform efforts , evaluate agencies ' plans to reinvest their savings , and evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings and governance processes to oversee the reinvestments . gao assessed 26 agencies ' cost savings and avoidance documentation , evaluated 27 agencies ' ( including the smithsonian institution ) reinvestment plans against omb 's guidance , and compared 4 of the agencies ' governance processes against best practices . the 4 agencies were selected , in part , because they had the highest dollar amounts of proposed it reinvestments . twenty - four of the 26 federal agencies participating in the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) information technology ( it ) reform initiatives reported achieving an estimated total of $ 3.6 billion dollars in cost savings and avoidances between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. slightly more than half ( or about $ 2.0 billion ) of the savings and avoidances were from data center consolidation and optimization efforts . notably , of the $ 3.6 billion total , the departments of defense , homeland security , treasury , and the social security administration accounted for about $ 2.5 billion ( or 69 percent ) . most agencies did not fully meet omb 's requirements to submit reinvestment plan information . of the 27 agencies required to submit reinvestment plans ( including one - time and ongoing plans ) , 5 agencies had fully implemented omb 's guidance , while the remaining 22 had only partially implemented it . for example , most agencies had not fully implemented omb 's guidance for submitting one - time fiscal year 2014 it reduction and reinvestment plans as part of omb 's “ cut and reinvest ” effort . as a result , agencies ' plans were substantially short of omb 's overall fiscal year 2014 targets : $ 3.0 billion in proposed reductions and $ 2.1 billion in proposed reinvestments , compared to omb 's targets of $ 7.6 billion in reductions and as much as $ 7.6 billion in reinvestments . agencies provided varied reasons for not meeting omb 's requirements , such as that their components had not fully tracked and reported how their savings were to be reinvested . until agencies complete their ongoing reinvestment plans , they will be challenged to ensure that their considerable savings are being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible . four selected agencies — the departments of education , interior , labor , and the social security administration — had documented key governance processes to guide the development of their fiscal year 2014 budget submission , which included proposed it reinvestments of $ 350 million . however , none of the four agencies had tracked the reinvestment performance results . they provided varied reasons for not doing so , and two agencies noted the lack of visibility into their components ' reinvestments . the lack of performance tracking is also due to omb not requiring agencies to document actual results . in addition , omb has not defined targets for reinvestments beyond fiscal year 2014. until omb requires agencies to track actual reinvestment performance and defines targets , it will be limited in its ability to ensure that agencies are actually reinvesting funds as planned and may not be able to hold them accountable . finally , without improved tracking , selected agencies may lack assurance that their components are reinvesting in areas consistent with agency - wide goals . gao recommends that agencies complete their it savings reinvestment plans and improve tracking , and that omb define targets for agency reinvestment and require that agencies complete their plans and track actual reinvestment performance . omb and 12 agencies agreed with gao 's recommendations , 1 did not state whether it agreed or disagreed , 3 had no comments , and 1 partially agreed .
