the missile defense agency ( mda ) has spent about $ 56 billion and will spend about $ 50 billion more through 2013 to develop a ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) . this testimony is based on two reviews gao was directed to conduct in 2008. in addition to our annual review assessing the annual cost , testing , schedule , and performance progress mda made in developing bmds , we have also reported on mda 's targets program . in this testimony we discuss the productivity of mda 's recent test program , the consequences of the testing shortfalls , and key factors that should be considered as mda revises its approach to testing . gao assessed contractor cost , schedule , and performance ; tests completed ; and the assets fielded during 2008. gao also reviewed pertinent sections of the u.s. code , acquisition policy , and the activities of a new missile defense board . the scale , complexity , cost and safety associated with testing the missile defense system constitute a unique challenge for mda , test agencies and other oversight organizations . this challenge is heightened by the fact that missile defense assets are developed , produced , and fielded concurrently . overall , during fiscal year 2008 , testing has been less productive than planned . while mda completed several key tests that demonstrated enhanced performance of bmds , all elements of the system had test delays and shortfalls , in part due to problems with the availability and performance of target missiles . gmd in particular was unable to conduct either of its two planned intercept attempts in fiscal year 2008. while it did subsequently conduct one in december 2008 , it was not able to achieve all primary objectives because the target failed to release its countermeasures . as a result , aspects of the fielded ground - launched kill vehicles may not be demonstrated since no more flight tests have been approved . target missiles continue as a persistent problem in fiscal year 2008 as poor target performance caused several tests to either fail in part or in whole . testing shortfalls have had several consequences . first , they have delayed the validation of models and simulations , which are needed to assess the system 's overall performance . as a result , the performance of the fielded bmds as a whole can not yet be determined . second , the production and fielding of assets has continued and in some cases has gotten ahead of testing . for example , enhanced exoatmospheric kill vehicles will now be produced and delivered before they are flight tested . third , mda has relied on a reduced basis -- fewer test , model , and simulation results -- to declare capabilities as operational in the field . mda has undertaken a three - phase review of the entire bmds test program that involves identifying critical variables that have not been proven to date , determining what test scenarios are needed to collect the data , and developing an affordable , prioritized schedule of flight and ground tests . this review , as long as it continues to involve test and evaluation organizations , appears to offer a sound approach for closing the gaps that exist between testing , modeling , and simulation . critical to being able to implement the approach will be addressing the factors that have limited the productivity of the current test approach , such as the availability and performance of targets . an additional consideration in a new testing approach must be to ensure that assets are sufficiently tested before they are produced and fielded . an important consideration in this regard is for modeling , simulation , and testing events to be re - synchronized so that they properly inform decisions on producing , fielding , and declaring assets operational . contingency plans could then be formed for adjusting the pace of these decisions should shortfalls occur in modeling , simulation , or testing . because mda has indicated implementation will take time , managing the transition may need to include reassessing the ambitious fiscal year 2009 test plan . in the mean time , mda will have to be prudent in making decisions to produce and field assets .
