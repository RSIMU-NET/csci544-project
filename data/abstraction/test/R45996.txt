over the years , the u.s. military has become reliant on precision - guided munitions ( pgms ) to execute military operations . pgms are used in ground , air , and naval operations . defined by the department of defense ( dod ) as `` [ a ] guided weapon intended to destroy a point target and minimize collateral damage , '' pgms can include air - and ship - launched missiles , multiple launched rockets , and guided bombs . these munitions typically use radio signals from the global positioning system ( gps ) , laser guidance , and inertial navigation systems ( ins ) âusing gyroscopesâto improve a weapon 's accuracy to reportedly less than 3 meters ( approximately 10 feet ) . precision munitions were introduced to military operations during world war ii ; however , they first demonstrated their utility operationally during the vietnam war and gained prominence in operation desert storm in 1991. since the 1990s , due in part to their ability to minimize collateral damage , pgms have become critical components in u.s. operations , particularly in afghanistan , iraq , and syria . the proliferation of anti - access / area denial ( a2 / ad ) systems is likely to increase the operational utility of pgms . in particular , peer competitors like china and russia have developed sophisticated air defenses and anti - ship missiles that increase the risk to u.s. forces entering and operating in these regions . using advanced guidance systems , pgms can be launched at long ranges to attack an enemy without risking u.s. forces . as a result , dod has argued it requires longer range munitions to meet these new threats . the air force , army , navy , and marine corps all use pgms . in fy2021 , the department of defense ( dod ) requested approximately $ 4.1 billion for more than 41,337 weapons in 15 munitions programs . dod projects requesting approximately $ 3.3 billion for 20,456 weapons in fy2022 , $ 3.9 billion for 23,306 weapons in fy2023 , $ 3.9 billion for 18,376 weapons in fy2024 , and $ 3.6 billion for 16,325 weapons in fy2025 . previously dod obligated $ 1.96 billion for 13,985 weapons in fy2015 , $ 2.98 billion for 35,067 weapons in fy2016 , $ 3.63 billion for 44,446 weapons in fy2017 , $ 5.05 billion for 68,988 weapons in fy2018 , and $ 4.3 billion in fy2019 for 60,62 munitions . in fy2020 , congress authorized $ 5.30 billion for 56,067 weapons . current pgm programs can be categorized as air - launched , ground - launched , or naval - launched . air - launched : paveway laser guided bomb , joint direct attack munition ( jdam ) , small diameter bomb , small diameter bomb ii , hellfire missile , joint air - to - ground missile , joint air - to - surface strike missile ( jassm ) , long range anti - ship missile ( lrasm ) , and advanced anti - radiation guided missile . ground - launched : guided multiple launch rocket system ( gmlrs ) , army tactical missile system ( atacms ) , and precision strike missile ( prsm ) ; naval pgms : tomahawk cruise missile , standard missile - 6 ( sm - 6 ) , and naval strike missile . congress may consider several issues regarding pgms , including planned procurement quantities and stockpile assessments , defense industrial base production capacity , development timelines , supply chain security , affordability and cost - effectiveness , and emerging factors that may affect pgm programs .
