about 7,500 peace corps volunteers currently serve in 70 countries . the administration intends to increase this number to about 14,000. volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable communications , police , or medical services . as americans , they may be viewed as relatively wealthy and , hence , good targets for crime . in this testimony , gao summarizes findings from its 2002 report peace corps : initiatives for addressing safety and security challenges hold promise , but progress should be assessed , gao - 02-818 , on trends in crime against volunteers and peace corps ' system for generating information , the agency 's field implementation of its safety and security framework , and the underlying factors contributing to the quality of these practices . the full extent of crime against peace corps volunteers is unclear due to significant under - reporting . however , peace corps ' reported rates for most types of assaults have increased since the agency began collecting data in 1990. the agency 's data analysis has produced useful insights , but additional analyses could help improve anti - crime strategies . peace corps has hired an analyst to enhance data collection and analysis to help the agency develop better - informed intervention and prevention strategies . in 2002 , we reported that peace corps had developed safety and security policies but that efforts to implement these policies in the field had produced varying results . some posts complied , but others fell short . volunteers were generally satisfied with training . however , some housing did not meet standards and , while all posts had prepared and tested emergency action plans , many plans had shortcomings . evidence suggests that agency initiatives have not yet eliminated this unevenness . the inspector general continues to find shortcomings at some posts . however , recent emergency action plan tests show an improved ability to contact volunteers in a timely manner . in 2002 , we found that uneven supervision and oversight , staff turnover , and unclear guidance hindered efforts to ensure quality practices . the agency has taken action to address these problems . to strengthen supervision and oversight , it established an office of safety and security , supported by three senior staff at headquarters , nine field - based safety and security officers , and a compliance officer . in response to our recommendations , peace corps was granted authority to exempt 23 safety and security positions from the `` 5-year rule '' -- a statutory restriction on tenure . it also adopted a framework for monitoring post compliance and quantifiable performance indicators . however , the agency is still clarifying guidance , revising indicators , and establishing a performance baseline .
