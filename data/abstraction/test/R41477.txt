the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides federal funding to support community - based mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services . samhsa awards formula and competitive grants under its authorities in title v of the public health service act ( phsa ) . the agency also administers the $ 1.8 billion substance abuse prevention and treatment ( sapt ) block grant and the $ 420 million community mental health services ( cmhs ) block grant , both of which are authorized in phsa title xix . samhsa 's funding totaled almost $ 3.6 billion in fy2010 . the agency 's budget increased by 34 % from fy2000 to fy2010 . in real ( i.e . , inflation - adjusted ) dollars , however , the funding increase over that period was only 6 % . funding for samhsa 's two block grants , which together account for 62 % of the agency 's budget , has grown at a much slower pace than funding for its competitive grant programs . samhsa was reauthorized in 2000 , as part of the children 's health act ( p.l . 106-310 ) . the act amended samhsa 's existing authorities to give the agency more flexibility to direct mental health and substance abuse funding ; increased state flexibility to direct the use of block grant funds , creating several new competitive grant programs to expand mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents ; and authorized appropriations through fy2003 . it also added charitable choice provisions that allow faith - based organizations to compete for samhsa substance abuse funding without impairing their religious character . p.l . 106-310 required samhsa to submit two reports to congress , one on providing coordinated care to individuals with co - occurring mental illness and substance abuse , and the other on efforts to improve the flexibility and accountability of the block grants . comprehensive reauthorization has not occurred since 2000. however , several laws have further expanded the agency 's programs and activities in suicide prevention , underage drinking , and prescription drug abuse . the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-148 ) contained new authorizations for samhsa related to depression and behavioral health services for american indians and alaskan natives , as well as additional provisions related to mental health and substance abuse . while reauthorization has not moved out of committee , issues that may be of interest during the next reauthorization of samhsa include increased performance measurement and accountability for samhsa grants and programs , granting specific authority for the access to recovery program that provides vouchers for individuals to seek treatment services , improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response , requiring collaboration between samhsa and other federal agencies , increasing samhsa 's level of emphasis on primary prevention , increasing samhsa 's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce , and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute samhsa 's block grants . this report describes samhsa 's history , organization , authority , and programs , and analyzes some of the issues that may be considered by congress during a reauthorization of the agency . the appendixes include a table describing samhsa 's authorizations and appropriations , a table with samhsa 's funding from fy2000-fy2010 , a matrix of samhsa 's national outcome measures that aim to evaluate progress on substance abuse and mental health prevention and treatment indicators , and a list of samhsa resources .
