pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program , focusing on : whether the quality of research proposals has kept pace with the program 's expansion ; the implementation of a provision for technical assistance to agencies ; and the duplicate funding of similar research projects . gao found that : the quality of research proposals has kept pace with the program 's expansion ; it is too early to make a conclusive judgment about the long - term quality of research proposals because major increases in program funding have not yet occurred ; none of the five major agencies taking part in the sbir program have implemented the discretionary provision for technical assistance to agencies and future implementation remains uncertain ; these agencies have taken steps to provide assistance with the commercialization of research results ; duplicate funding of similar research projects has become a problem due to the increasing numbers of research proposals submitted to the sbir program ; a few companies received funding for the same proposals on more than one occasion before the agencies became aware of the duplication ; and duplicate funding occurs due to the evasion of certification procedures , lack of consensus on what constitutes a duplicate proposal , and the general lack of current information on recent sbir awards .
