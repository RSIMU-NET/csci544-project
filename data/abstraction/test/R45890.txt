congress established the national wild and scenic rivers system ( nwsrs ) in 1968 through the wild and scenic rivers act ( wsra ; p.l . 90-542 ) to preserve free - flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations and to complement the then - current national policy of constructing dams and other river structures that altered flow . designated rivers usually are referred to as wild and scenic rivers ( wsrs ) . the wsra established three classes of wsrsâwild , scenic , and recreationalâreflecting the characteristics of the rivers at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of subsequently allowable development . the system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico . wsrs may come into the nwsrs either by congressional designation or by state nomination to the secretary of the interior . wsrs may be located on federal lands , nonfederal lands , or a combination of both . some wsrs on nonfederal land are referred to as partnership wild and scenic rivers ( or partnership wsrs ) . the wsra does not define this term ; it is an umbrella term used to describe wsrs with generally similar characteristics , such as nonfederal management and land ownership , but partnership wsrs can vary . wsrs on nonfederal land also may be added to the nwsrs through an administrative process , wherein states may apply to the secretary of the interior for inclusion of a state - protected river . rivers added to the system through state nomination , or rivers designated by congress that run through both federal and nonfederal lands , generally are not referred to as partnership wsrs . in the case of congressionally designated rivers , congress may first direct in legislation that a study be conducted to determine whether the river area is suitable for wild and scenic designation . congress generally specifies in the designating legislation that either the secretary of agriculture or the secretary of the interior administer the wsr . if the designated wsr contains federal land , the secretary then manages the river through the federal land management agency of jurisdictionâthe bureau of land management , the national park service ( nps ) , or the fish and wildlife service within the department of the interior or the forest service within the u.s. department of agriculture . the relevant local jurisdiction manages partnership wsrs and state - nominated wsrs , with certain administrative functions carried out at the federal level . wsrs are administered to protect and enhance the values for which the rivers were included in the system and to preserve the rivers ' free - flowing condition . the agency , or the relevant local jurisdiction for wsrs on nonfederal land , prepares a comprehensive resource management plan ( crmp ) to guide management . the wsra prohibits federally licensed or assisted water resources projects that would have a `` direct and adverse '' effect on the values for which a river was established and prohibits the federal energy regulatory commission from licensing projects on or directly affecting a designated river segment . the agency of jurisdiction enforces this provision ; on partnership wsrs and state - nominated wsrs , nps enforces this provision . in addition to the provisions of the wsra , management of wsrs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency 's lands . each federal land management agency specifies policies regarding river management at varying levels of detail . agencies typically provide the most protection to wild rivers . for congressionally designated rivers on federal lands , congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual appropriations for the relevant agencies . agencies sometimes provide funding separately for individual rivers or provide funding through broader budget activities , not specific to an individual river . rivers added to the nwsrs through state nomination typically do not receive federal funding . however , partnership wsrs receive funding through nps . the wsra authorizes federal agencies to provide technical assistance to states and their political subdivisions ( such as counties , townships , and others ) , landowners , organizations , or individuals in planning , protecting , and managing wsrs . designation of wild and scenic rivers has been controversial in some cases , especially for wsrs containing nonfederal lands . initially following enactment of the wsra , congress designated rivers primarily on federal land . over the past 20 years , congress has designated or authorized for study an increasing number of partnership wsrs . opinions regarding the balance of federal and local control over partnership wsrs have varied . some have observed that congress intended the state nomination authority to be the primary means for rivers on nonfederal lands to be included in the system , but this designation method has not been used in recent years . congress may consider whether it is preferable to encourage use of the state - nominated process , which includes a set of fixed provisions , or to continue to establish partnership wsrs through individual designating statutes , whose provisions vary .
