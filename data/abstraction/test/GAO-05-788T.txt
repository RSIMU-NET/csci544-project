although the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property domestically , intellectual property protection in parts of the world is inadequate . as a result , u.s. goods are subject to piracy and counterfeiting in many countries . a number of u.s. agencies are engaged in efforts to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . this testimony , based on a prior gao report as well as recent work , describes u.s. agencies ' efforts , the mechanisms used to coordinate these efforts , and the impact of these efforts and the challenges they face . u.s. agencies undertake policy initiatives , training and assistance activities , and law enforcement actions in an effort to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . policy initiatives include identifying countries with the most significant problems -- an annual interagency process known as the `` special 301 '' review . in addition , many agencies engage in assistance activities , such as providing training for foreign officials . finally , a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions , such as criminal investigations and seizures of counterfeit merchandise . agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts , although the mechanisms ' usefulness varies . the national intellectual property law enforcement coordination council , established in 1999 to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement , has struggled to find a clear mission , has undertaken few activities , and is generally viewed as having little impact despite recent congressional action to strengthen the council . the congress 's action included establishing the role of coordinator , but the position has not yet been filled ( although the selection process is underway ) . the administration 's october 2004 strategy targeting organized piracy ( stop ! ) . is intended to strengthen u.s. efforts to combat piracy and counterfeiting . thus far , the initiative has resulted in some new actions and emphasized other ongoing efforts . u.s. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas , but enforcement in many countries remains weak , and further u.s. efforts face significant challenges . for example , competing u.s. policy objectives such as national security interests take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions . further , other countries ' domestic policy objectives can affect their `` political will '' to address u.s. concerns . finally , many economic factors , as well as the involvement of organized crime , hinder u.s. and foreign governments ' efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property abroad .
