the federal government is one of the world 's largest and most complex entities ; about $ 3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2014 funded a broad array of programs and operations . gao maintains a program to focus attention on government operations that it identifies as high risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy , efficiency , or effectiveness challenges . since 1990 , more than one - third of the areas previously designated as high risk have been removed from the list because sufficient progress was made in addressing the problems identified . the five criteria for removal are : leadership commitment , agency capacity , an action plan , monitoring efforts , and demonstrated progress . this biennial update describes the status of high - risk areas listed in 2013 and identifies new high - risk areas needing attention by congress and the executive branch . solutions to high - risk problems offer the potential to save billions of dollars , improve service to the public , and strengthen government performance and accountability . solid , steady progress has been made in the vast majority of the high - risk areas . eighteen of the 30 areas on the 2013 list at least partially met all of the criteria for removal from the high risk list . of those , 11 met at least one of the criteria for removal and partially met all others . sufficient progress was made to narrow the scope of two high - risk issues â€” protecting public health through enhanced oversight of medical products and dod contract management . overall , progress has been possible through the concerted actions of congress , leadership and staff in agencies , and the office of management and budget . this year gao is adding 2 areas , bringing the total to 32. managing risks and improving veterans affairs ( va ) health care . gao has reported since 2000 about va facilities ' failure to provide timely health care . in some cases , these delays or va 's failure to provide care at all have reportedly harmed veterans . although va has taken actions to address some gao recommendations , more than 100 of gao 's recommendations have not been fully addressed , including recommendations related to the following areas : ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes , inadequate oversight and accountability , information technology challenges , inadequate training for va staff , and unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . the recently enacted veterans access , choice , and accountability act included provisions to help va address systemic weaknesses . va must effectively implement the act . improving the management of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations . congress has passed legislation and the administration has undertaken numerous initiatives to better manage it investments . nonetheless , federal it investments too frequently fail to be completed or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes . gao has found that the federal government spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments which often suffered from ineffective management , such as project planning , requirements definition , and program oversight and governance . over the past 5 years , gao made more than 730 recommendations ; however , only about 23 percent had been fully implemented as of january 2015. gao is also expanding two areas due to evolving high - risk issues . enforcement of tax laws . this area is expanded to include irs 's efforts to address tax refund fraud due to identify theft . irs estimates it paid out $ 5.8 billion ( the exact number is uncertain ) in fraudulent refunds in tax year 2013 due to identity theft . this occurs when a thief files a fraudulent return using a legitimate taxpayer 's identifying information and claims a refund . ensuring the security of federal information systems and cyber critical infrastructure and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information ( pii ) . this risk area is expanded because of the challenges to ensuring the privacy of personally identifiable information posed by advances in technology . these advances have allowed both government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of pii more effectively . the number of reported security incidents involving pii at federal agencies has increased dramatically in recent years . this report contains gao 's views on progress made and what remains to be done to bring about lasting solutions for each high - risk area . perseverance by the executive branch in implementing gao 's recommended solutions and continued oversight and action by congress are essential to achieving greater progress .
