the patient protection and affordable care act required the establishment of health insurance exchanges — or marketplaces — to allow consumers to compare , select , and purchase health insurance plans . states can elect to establish a state - based marketplace , or cede this authority to cms to establish a federally facilitated marketplace . some states had difficulties with the rollout and operation of their marketplaces , and some states that struggled with it implementation are now using the federal marketplace it platform . gao was requested to review cms 's and states ' actions to implement the marketplaces . this report describes cms 's actions to assist states that have chosen to transition to a different marketplace it platform and identify costs and challenges those states incurred in making this transition ; assesses cms 's actions taken to assist selected states to ensure that the development and operations of marketplace it systems can be financially self - sustained ; and assesses cms 's steps to monitor the performance of the states ' marketplace it systems . gao reviewed documentation from cms and four states selected based on different types of marketplaces , federal grants provided , and enrollment numbers , and interviewed cms and the states ' officials . the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) has offered assistance through providing periodic oversight and issuing regulation and guidance to states transitioning from state - based marketplaces to the federally based marketplace it platform , including two states that gao reviewed — hawaii and oregon — that had made that transition . while cms provided these states with assistance , documented cms transition guidance was not finalized until after the two states had completed their transition . the two states incurred costs of approximately $ 84.3 million , collectively , to transition to the federal platform . the two states ' transition efforts included making changes to their medicaid systems , with these states mainly relying on medicaid matching funds from cms to do this . while the selected states successfully transitioned , they encountered challenges during their transitions , due to accelerated transition time frames , difficulties reassigning marketplace responsibilities , delays in receiving approvals from cms , and trouble accessing historical consumer data in previous vendor - developed marketplace it systems . cms took steps to assist hawaii and oregon , as well as two states that gao selected for review that operated state - based marketplaces , minnesota and new york , in developing plans for marketplace it system sustainability . cms assisted these four states by consulting with the states ' officials and providing oversight of their sustainability plans , financial audit reports , and risk assessments . however , cms did not fully ensure the states provided complete sustainability plans and financial audit reports . further , cms did not base its risk assessments on fully defined processes . these weaknesses limit cms 's oversight and assurance that it can be informed of the state marketplaces ' sustainability efforts . although cms established a process to monitor the performance of state - based marketplaces , cms did not consistently follow its processes . for example , cms did not ensure that the two selected states , minnesota and new york , had developed , updated , and followed their performance measurement plans . also , cms did not conduct reviews to analyze the operational performance of these states ' marketplace it systems against an established set of parameters . further , while cms collected it performance metrics from the two states , such as the number of electronic enrollments and website traffic volume , it did not link state metrics to goals or establish targets for performance . these weaknesses limit cms 's ability to determine if states ' marketplace systems are performing efficiently , effectively , and to provide early warnings of potential problems ( see table ) . gao recommends that cms take six actions : ensure that states provide complete sustainability plans ; complete financial audit reports ; fully define its risk assessment process ; complete updated performance measurement plans ; align metrics with goals ; and conduct operational analysis reviews . hhs concurred with two , partially concurred with two , and did not concur with two of gao 's recommendations , which gao continues to believe are valid .
