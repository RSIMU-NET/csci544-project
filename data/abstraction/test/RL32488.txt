under the populist rule of president hugo chávez , first elected in 1998 and reelected to a six - year term in december 2006 , venezuela has undergone enormous political changes , with a new constitution and unicameral legislature , and a new name for the country , the bolivarian republic of venezuela . u.s. officials and human rights organizations have expressed concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of expression under president chávez , who has survived several attempts to remove him from power . the government benefitted from the rise in world oil prices , which sparked an economic boom and allowed chávez to increase expenditures on social programs associated with his populist agenda . after he was reelected , chávez announced new measures to move the country toward socialism , but his may 2007 closure of a popular venezuelan television station ( rctv ) that was critical of the government sparked protests , and his proposed constitutional amendment package was defeated by a close margin in a december 2007 national referendum . state and local elections held in november 2008 were a mixed picture of support for the government , with the opposition winning several key contests . in february 2009 , venezuelans approved a controversial constitutional referendum that abolished term limits and allows chávez to run for re - election in 2012 and beyond . in 2009 , the government has increased efforts to suppress the political opposition , including elected officials , and is continuing to threaten media critical of the government . the united states traditionally has had close relations with venezuela , the fourth major supplier of foreign oil to the united states , but there has been friction with the chávez government . u.s. officials have expressed concerns about human rights , venezuela 's military arms purchases , its relations with cuba and iran , and its efforts to export its brand of populism to other latin american countries . declining cooperation on anti - drug and anti - terrorism efforts has also been a concern . in september 2008 , bilateral relations worsened when president chávez expelled the u.s. ambassador to venezuela , and the united states responded in kind . under the obama administration , venezuela and the united states reached an agreement in late june 2009 for the return of respective ambassadors . while some observers are hopeful that the return of ambassadors will mark an improvement in relations , others emphasize continued u.s. concerns about the venezuelan government 's treatment of the news media and political opposition and about interference in the affairs of other countries in the region . to date in the 111th congress , the senate approved an amendment ( s.amdt . 1536 ) to the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fy2010 , s. 1390 , that requires the director of national intelligence to provide a report on venezuela 's military purchases , potential support for terrorist groups , and other venezuelan activities . in addition , several resolutions and bills related to venezuela have been introduced : h.r . 375 would , among its provisions , place restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting the nuclear programs of venezuela ; h.r . 2475 includes a provision identical to that in h.r . 375 described above that would place restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting the nuclear programs of venezuela ; h.res . 174 and h.con.res . 124 would express concern about anti - semitism in venezuela . note : this report provides background on political changes in venezuela , u.s. policy , and u.s. legislative initiatives from 2003-july 2009. it will not be updated .
