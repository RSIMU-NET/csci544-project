gao discussed the general services administration 's ( gsa ) progress in upgrading the security of federal buildings under its operation , focusing on : what criteria gsa used to assess security risks and prioritize security upgrades for its buildings ; the implementation and operational status of gsa 's security upgrade program and the costs gsa has incurred by both funding source and type of security upgrade ; and whether any problems have hindered gsa 's implementation of the security upgrade program . gao noted that : gsa used the department of justice ( doj ) report 's criteria to assess risks and prioritize security upgrades in its buildings ; despite the formidable challenges posed by this program , gsa has made progress implementing upgrades in federal buildings throughout the country , particularly in its higher risk buildings ; gsa 's data systems indicate that about 7,000 upgrades were completed and it estimates that roughly $ 353 million were obligated from the federal buildings fund for the upgrade program nationally between october 1 , 1995 , and march 31 , 1998 ; however , mistakes made by rushing to meet the timetables in the doj report because of gsa 's sense of urgency to upgrade security in its buildings , reduced staffing due to downsizing , data reliability problems , and uncertain funding sources have hindered gsa 's upgrade program implementation ; because of data reliability problems , neither gsa nor gao can specify the exact status or cost of the building security upgrade program , and because gsa has not established program outcome measures , neither gsa nor gao knows the extent to which completed upgrades have resulted in greater security or reduced vulnerability for federal office buildings ; and gsa is not in a good position to manage its program to mitigate security threats .
