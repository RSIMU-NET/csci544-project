government advertising can be controversial if it conflicts with citizens ' views about the proper role of government . yet some government advertising is accepted as a normal part of government information activities . it is difficult to calculate the amount of funds spent by the federal government on advertising each year . the reasons for this include ( 1 ) there is no government - wide definition of what constitutes advertising and ( 2 ) there is no central authority to which agencies are required to report advertising expenses . however , an estimate of the federal government 's expenditures on contracts for advertising services can be derived from data in the federal procurement data system . according to these data , federal agencies spent $ 892.5 million on advertising services in fy2013 . agencies ' discretion to advertise is limited primarily by restrictions imposed by congress in authorization and appropriations statutes and by the principles set forth in volume 1 of the government accountability office 's ( gao 's ) principles of federal appropriations law . any oversight of government advertising expenditures rests with agencies ' inspectors general , gao , and congress .
