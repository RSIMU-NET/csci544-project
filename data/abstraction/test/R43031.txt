the u.s. supreme court in district of columbia v. heller held that the second amendment to the u.s. constitution protects an individual right to possess a firearm , unconnected with service in a militia , and the use of that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home . it also held that the second amendment applies to the states in mcdonald v. city of chicago . since then , federal and state firearms laws have been challenged under the second amendment . lower courts have been disputed in determining how to evaluate these provisions , given that the heller decision was not an exhaustive analysis of the scope of the second amendment . this report first discusses the two - step inquiry fashioned by the lower courts to analyze provisions under the second amendment . it proceeds to highlight how this test has been employed on a select number of firearms laws â€” namely , the federal age requirement and prohibition on possession by those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ; and state requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit and a state assault weapons ban . how courts have applied the test to these categories may provide some indication as to how future firearms regulations may be considered by the supreme court . the report concludes with a discussion on how varied interpretations by the lower courts of the heller decision may affect the burden upon the federal government to defend firearms provisions , as well as new analytical frameworks that have been suggested .
