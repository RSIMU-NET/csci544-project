this report provides a summary review of issues related to pakistan and terrorism , especially in the context of u.s. interests , policy goals , and relevant assistance . the outcomes of u.s. policies toward pakistan since 9 / 11 , while not devoid of meaningful successes , have neither neutralized anti - western militants and reduced religious extremism in that country nor contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan . many observers thus urge a broad re - evaluation of such policies . sources for this report include , among other things , the u.s. departments of state and defense , congressional transcripts , intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations , regional press reports , and major newswires . this report will be updated periodically .
