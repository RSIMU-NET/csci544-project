the rail network is one of americas safest modes of transportation , although several recent rail accidents have reinforced the need for constant effort from the private and public sectors to ensure safety for rail passengers , the public , and railroad employees . fra , the federal agency responsible for railroad safety , works with freight , commuter , and intercity passenger railroads and certain states to ensure the safety of the u.s. railroad network . in 2007 , fra developed and implemented a risk - based approach to its safety inspections of the railroad network . in 2008 , rsia was enacted and , among other things , reauthorized fras rail safety program and included several new rail safety provisions , such as the implementation of ptc and creation of rail safety risk reduction plans . this statement discusses gaos preliminary observations about 1 ) how fra oversees rail safety , 2 ) challenges to rail safety , and 3 ) ptc implementation by the u.s. rail industry . gao examined fras overall rail safety framework and interviewed state rail safety officials and officials from fra ; selected class i , ii , and iii railroads ; and amtrak on rail safety and ptc implementation . gao plans to issue reports on reviews of rail safety and ptc in the fall of 2013. the federal railroad administration ( fra ) primarily monitors railroads ' compliance with federal safety regulations through routine inspections by individual inspectors at specific sites on railroads ' systems . thirty states also employ railroad safety inspectors , who participate in a partnership program with fra to conduct supplemental safety oversight activities based on fra rail safety regulations and enforce state railroad safety laws . fra applies a quantitative , risk - based approach , the national inspection plan , to inform its rail safety oversight efforts using analyses of past accident and inspection data and other information to target inspections in each region . fra also uses a planning and evaluation tool , the staffing allocation model ( sam ) , to distribute its inspection resources across each fra region . however , according to several fra regional administrators that gao spoke with , the staffing decisions based on sam results do not necessarily align with their perspectives on the inspector needs for their regions . based on gao 's work to date , there are several potential challenges affecting fra 's rail safety oversight . first , the rail safety improvement act ( rsia ) required fra to issue regulations requiring certain railroads to submit risk reduction plans within 4 years . fra has not yet issued a final rule on the plans . second , fra does not have a specific plan to replace its aging inspector workforce . according to fra officials , in the next 5 years , about 32 percent of fra inspectors will be eligible to retire . although fra officials said that they anticipate being able to replace inspectors , it can take 1 to 2 years to find , hire , train , and certify a new inspector . finally , fra faces other ongoing and emerging safety challenges like addressing adverse weather conditions and their impact on railroad operations and equipment , educating the public on the potential hazards of rail - highway crossings , accommodating changes in rail safety risks including new freight flows that affect the need for inspections , and hiring and training a specialized inspector workforce to provide adequate safety oversight for emerging technologies including positive train control ( ptc ) , a communications - based system designed to prevent train accidents caused by human factors . gao 's work to date indicates that railroads may not be able to fully implement ptc by the 2015 deadline established in rsia . this is because of the many interrelated challenges caused by the complexity and breadth of ptc implementation . for example , ptc components , such as the back office servers , which are needed to communicate vital information between locomotives and wayside signals , are still under development . in addition , the need to integrate ptc components and field test the system is a time - and resource - consuming process . finally , some railroads had concerns with fra 's limited resources and ability to verify field testing and certify the system once it is fully implemented . officials from freight railroads and fra stated they will not compromise ptc safety functions and will ensure ptc is implemented to meet the requirements of the rsia mandate . however , in attempting to implement ptc by the 2015 deadline , railroads may be making choices that could introduce financial and operational risks . for example , freight railroad representatives told us that without adequate time for field testing , ptc systems could potentially malfunction or fail more frequently , causing system disruptions .
