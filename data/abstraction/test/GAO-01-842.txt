to deter illegal entry between the nation 's ports of entry , the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) developed its southwest border strategy . ins has spent seven years implementing the border strategy , but it may take ins up to a decade longer to fully implement the strategy . this assumes that ins obtains the level of staff , technology , equipment , and fencing it believes it needs to control the southwest border . although illegal alien apprehensions have shifted , there is no clear indication that overall illegal entry into the united states along the southwestern border has declined . ins ' current efforts to measure the effectiveness of its border control efforts could be enhanced by analyzing the data in its automated biometric identification system ( ident ) . these data offer ins an opportunity to develop additional performance indicators that could be incorporated into its annual performance plan review process and could help ins assess whether its border control efforts are associated with an overall reduction in the flow of illegal aliens across the border . borderwide analysis of the ident data could be used to address several important questions related to illegal entry . the strategy 's impact on local communities has been affected by the timing of ins , infusion of agent and other resources intended to protect the local community from a surge in illegal alien traffic ; what routes the illegal aliens have used in crossing the border ; and ins ' involvement with the community . ins has learned the importance of outreach efforts in attempting to mitigate the potential negative effects the strategy can cause a community and the harm that can befall illegal aliens who risk injury and death to cross the border .
