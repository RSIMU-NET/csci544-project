the lda , as amended , requires lobbyists to file quarterly lobbying disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions . the law also requires that gao annually audit lobbyists ' compliance with the lda . gao 's objectives were to determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements , identify challenges to compliance that lobbyists report , and describe the resources and authorities available to usao in its role in enforcing lda compliance , and the efforts usao has made to improve enforcement . this is gao 's ninth report under the mandate . gao reviewed a stratified random sample of 80 quarterly disclosure ld - 2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the first and second quarters of 2015. gao also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 ld - 203 reports from year - end 2014 and midyear 2015. this methodology allowed gao to generalize to the population of 45,565 disclosure reports with $ 5,000 or more in lobbying activity , and 29,189 reports of federal political campaign contributions . gao met with officials from usao to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply . gao provided a draft of this report to the attorney general for review and comment . the department of justice provided updated data which gao incorporated into the report . gao is not making any recommendations in this report . for the 2015 reporting period , most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) . for lobbying disclosure ( ld - 2 ) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and second quarter of 2015 , gao estimates that 88 percent of lobbyists filed initial ld - 2 reports as required for new lobbying registrations ( lobbyists are required to file ld - 2 reports for the quarter in which they first register ) ; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement ; 93 percent could provide documentation for income and expenses , but on 31 percent of these ld - 2 reports lobbyists did not correctly follow the guidance to round to the nearest $ 10,000 ; and 85 percent filed year - end ld - 203 2014 reports as required . these findings are generally consistent with prior reports gao issued for the 2010 through 2014 reporting periods . as in our other reports , some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions , such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions . gao estimates that 21 percent of all ld - 2 reports may not have properly disclosed one or more previously held covered positions . however , over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure , gao has found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with ld - 2 reporting as “ very easy ” or “ somewhat easy ” to understand with regard to meeting their reporting requirements . the u.s. attorney 's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) stated it has sufficient resources and authority to enforce compliance with the lda . usao continued its efforts to bring lobbyists into compliance by prompting them to file reports or applying civil penalties . in august 2015 , usao finalized a $ 125,000 settlement with the carmen group , the largest civil penalty settlement for noncompliance .
