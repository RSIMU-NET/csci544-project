title i , part a , of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) authorizes federal aid to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged children . title i - a grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other pupils attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from low - income families . in recent years , they have also become a `` vehicle '' to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k - 12 education for all pupils have been attached as a condition for receiving title i - a grants . these include requirements for assessments of pupil achievement ; adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) standards and determinations for schools , leas , and states ; consequences for schools and leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more ; plus teacher and paraprofessional qualifications . the esea was initially adopted in 1965 , and was most recently reauthorized and amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ) , p.l . 107-110. currently , although the authorization for esea title i - a has expired , appropriations have continued to be provided , and the program continues to be implemented under the policies established by the most recent authorization statute . the 111th congress is expected to consider proposals to extend and amend the esea . for the allocation of funds to states and leas , title i - a has four separate formulas : the basic , concentration , targeted , and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas . once these funds reach leas , they are no longer treated separately ; they are combined and used without distinction for the same program purposes . while there are numerous complications and special features associated with the title i - a allocation formulas , each has the same underlying structure . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a `` population factor , '' consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an `` expenditure factor '' based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the population and expenditure factors , and / or the population factor is modified to direct increased funds to leas with concentrations of poverty . major title i - a reauthorization issues regarding allocation formulas are likely to include the following : should annual variations in the poverty estimates used to calculate title i - a grants be reduced through multi - year averaging or other methods ? . has the targeting of title i - a funds on high poverty leas increased since 2001 ? . should the population weighting factors of the targeted and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas be modified to more equally favor leas with large numbers of school - age children in poor families and leas with high poverty rates ? . should the expenditure factors continue to play a major role in the title i - a formulas ? . should there be some consolidation of the four different allocation formulas ? . should the authorization level for title i - a continue to be specified for future years , and if so , at what levels ? . should the effort factor in the efig formula be modified ? . should the equity factor in the efig formula be modified ? . should the current provisions for intra - lea allocation be reconsidered ? . should the remaining special constraints on grants to puerto rico , the cap on aggregate population weights in the targeted grant formula , be removed ? . should the temporary assistance to needy families ( tanf ) formula factor be eliminated ? . and finally , should each county portion of new york city and other multi - county leas continue to be treated as separate leas under the title i - a allocation formulas ? . this report will not be updated .
