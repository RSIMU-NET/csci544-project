the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , intensified long - standing concerns about the adequacy of safeguards and security at four nuclear weapons production sites and three national laboratories that design nuclear weapons -- most of these facilities store plutonium and uranium in a variety of forms . these facilities can become targets for such actions as sabotage or theft . the department of energy ( doe ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) -- a separately organized agency within doe -- are responsible for these facilities . nnsa plays a crucial role in managing the contractors operating many of these facilities to ensure that security activities are effective and in line with departmental policy . gao reviewed how effectively nnsa manages its safeguards and security program , including how it oversees contractor security operations . nnsa has not been fully effective in managing its safeguards and security program in four key areas . as a result , nnsa can not be assured that its contractors are working to maximum advantage to protect critical facilities and material from individuals seeking to inflict damage . defining clear roles and responsibilities : nnsa still has not fully defined clear roles and responsibilities for its headquarters and site operations . assessing sites ' security activities : without a stable and effective management structure and with ongoing confusion about roles and responsibilities , inconsistencies have emerged among nnsa sites on how they assess contractors ' security activities . consequently , nnsa can not be assured that all facilities are subject to the comprehensive annual assessments that doe policy requires . overseeing contractors ' corrective actions : to compound the problems in conducting security assessments , nnsa contractors do not consistently conduct required analyses in preparing corrective action plans . as a result , potential opportunities to improve physical security at the sites are not maximized because corrective actions are developed without fully considering the problems ' root causes , risks posed , or cost versus the benefit of taking corrective action . allocating staff : nnsa has shortfalls at its site offices in the total number of staff and in expertise , which could make it more difficult for site offices to effectively oversee security activities .
