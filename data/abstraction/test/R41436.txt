medicare is the nation 's health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons . medicare consists of four distinct parts : part a , or hospital insurance ( hi ) ; part b , or supplementary medical insurance ( smi ) ; part c , or medicare advantage ( ma ) ; and part d , the outpatient prescription drug benefit . the part a program is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers ; these are credited to the hi trust fund . the part b program is financed through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues . income from these sources is credited to the smi trust fund . beneficiaries can choose to receive all their medicare services , except hospice , through managed care plans under the ma program ; payment is made in appropriate parts from the hi and smi trust funds . a separate account in the smi trust fund accounts for the part d drug benefit ; part d is financed through general revenues , beneficiary premiums , and state contributions . the hi and smi trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that provides annual reports to congress . the 2014 report of the medicare board of trustees estimates that the hi trust fund will become insolvent in 2030 , four years later than it had predicted in the 2013 report . because of the way that it is financed , the smi fund can not face insolvency ; however , the trustees project that smi expenditures will continue to grow rapidly , and thus place increasing demands on medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers . additionally , unlike in prior years , the projections in the 2014 report assume that reductions in physician payment rates scheduled under current law will not occur , because these reductions have usually been overridden by congress . the trustees estimate that total medicare costs will increase from 3.5 % of gdp in 2013 to 6.9 % in 2088. although the medicare trustees report that the financial outlook for the medicare program appears to have improved as a result of changes made by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended ( aca , p.l . 111-148 ) , they caution that the projections in the report are somewhat uncertain , due to the potential for future expenditure reductions not to materialize . as it has done each year subsequent to the enactment of aca , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) office of the actuary issued a supplemental analysis that provides illustrative alternative projections based on the assumption that certain aca provisions affecting medicare provider payments will be phased out .
