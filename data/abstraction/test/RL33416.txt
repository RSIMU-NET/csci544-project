in the past few years , the people 's republic of china ( prc ) has experienced rising social unrest , including protests , demonstrations , picketing , and group petitioning . according to prc official sources , `` public order disturbances '' grew by nearly 50 % from 58,000 incidents in 2003 to 87,000 in 2005. although political observers have described social unrest among farmers and workers since the early 1990s , recent protest activities have been broader in scope , larger in average size , greater in frequency , and more brash than those of a decade ago . fears of greater unrest have triggered debates with the communist party leadership about the pace of economic reforms and the proper way to respond to protesters . workers in state - owned enterprises and the special economic zones producing goods for export , peasants and urban residents who have lost their farmland or homes to development projects , and others have engaged in mass protests , some of them violent , often after having exhausted legal channels for resolving grievances . a december 2005 clash between villagers and police in dongzhou village , southeastern guangdong province , in which 3-20 villagers were killed , has became a symbol of the depth of anger of those with grievances and the inability of chinese administrative , legal , and political institutions to resolve disputes peacefully . u.s. interests regarding social unrest in china include human rights concerns , ongoing u.s. - funded democracy and rule - of - law programs in the country , the effects of social unrest on u.s. investments in china , and the effects on prc foreign policy . growing disparities of income , official corruption , and the lack of democratic institutions are likely to continue to fuel social unrest . the potential for widespread social upheaval has captured the keen attention of the communist party leadership . however , in the medium term , the prc government is likely to be able to contain protests through policies that mix accommodation and suppression and that promote continued economic growth . most analysts do not expect social unrest to evolve into a national political movement unless linkages among disaffected groups strengthen and other social groups , particularly the middle class , intellectuals , and students , join the protests as well . policy options for congress include monitoring the situation , increasing assistance for local democracy , civil society , rule - of - law and environmental programs in china , supporting a free press and independent judiciary , or pressing the chinese government to respect the rights of protestors and release jailed activists . on december 15 , 2005 , a bi - partisan group of u.s. congressional leaders submitted a letter to the prc ambassador to the united states , zhou wenzhong , expressing `` deep concern '' over the shooting incident in dongzhou . this report , which will be updated periodically , discusses the causes of growing social unrest in china and describes recent incidents , explains how the prc government responds to protest activities , analyzes implications for prc politics , and discusses policy options for congress .
