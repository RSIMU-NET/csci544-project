disposal of unneeded buildings — for example through demolition , sale , or transfer to other federal agencies — has the potential to save the government millions of dollars . to this end , omb has developed policies to reduce space in federal buildings and identify buildings for disposal . recent progress notwithstanding , gao 's body of work on real property has found limitations in the overall reliability of data in gsa 's government - wide database . omb has reported on the status of federal real property disposals for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. gao was asked to examine the reliability of the data used to report disposals and any efforts to improve the data . this report assesses the reliability and reporting of government - wide disposal data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 , and steps omb , gsa , and three selected agencies have taken to improve disposal data . gao analyzed the most recent frpp data , agency documents , and interviewed omb , gsa , and agency officials . gao selected the departments of agriculture , energy , and the interior based on the highest numbers of disposed buildings . gao 's analysis showed that government - wide data were generally reliable for reporting on real property disposals for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. the general services administration 's ( gsa ) federal real property profile ( frpp ) serves as the building inventory database for most of the largest federal agencies . frpp 's data on real property disposals were generally complete , reasonable , and internally consistent , based on gao 's guidance for assessing data reliability . for example , the disposal date , disposal method , and buildings ' square footage data generally met these criteria . the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) reporting of frpp disposal data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 was also generally reliable . based on analysis of frpp data , gao was able to replicate omb 's reported numbers on building disposals , despite minor inconsistencies . gao identified three minor inconsistencies in its analysis and omb 's reporting , all of which led to some over - reporting of building disposals . for example , the data showed 134 buildings as disposed of in multiple years . given that these inconsistencies resulted in small differences in the number of buildings reported , gao determined that the inconsistencies did not affect the overall reliability of government - wide reporting of disposal data . gao recommends that gsa implement a data validation procedure to prevent reporting a building as disposed of multiple times and that omb , in coordination with gsa , establish a procedure to verify that its reports include data as intended . gsa and omb agreed with gao 's recommendations and identified steps to implement them .
