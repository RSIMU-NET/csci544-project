the 115th congress and the trump administration are reviewing existing u.s. policies and programs in sub - saharan africa ( henceforth , `` africa '' ) as they establish their budgetary and policy priorities toward the region while also responding to emerging crises . africa - specific policy questions did not feature prominently in the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign , and the views of the trump administration on many u.s. - africa policy issues remain unspecified . the obama administration 's strategy toward sub - saharan africa identified its policy priorities as strengthening democratic institutions ; spurring economic growth , trade , and investment ; advancing peace and security ; and promoting opportunity and development . analysts continue to debate whether that strategy reflected an appropriate mix and ranking of priorities , as well as the degree to which the obama administration 's actions reflected its stated goals . congressional action on trade and electrification projects in africa in the 114th congress suggested some shared priorities with the obama administration . the obama administration 's efforts to promote greater private sector engagement and youth leadership in africa won praise from various quarters . at the same time , analysts have probed whether the obama administration 's emphasis on building democratic institutions in africa was matched with appropriate resource allocations , and whether president obama 's stated support for democratic accountability was undermined by close u.s. partnerships with authoritarian - leaning states in east africa and by a growing emphasis on security relationships . africa is a top destination of u.s. foreign aid . following significant increases during the george w. bush administration in the 2000s , civilian - administered aid levels allocated for african countries remained largely flat during the obama administration , reflecting overarching budgetary constraints among other considerations . the areas of emphasis nonetheless shifted in some ways , with new presidential development initiatives focusing on electrification , trade , agricultural development , and health system strengthening . u.s. military cooperation and defense department - administered security assistance spending in africa also increased substantially , in line with new congressionally enacted authorities for defense spending as well as administration - led peacekeeping and counterterrorism initiatives . the united states has long been a top bilateral donor of emergency humanitarian and disaster assistance in africa , as well as the top financial contributor to u.n. peacekeeping operations , the majority of which are in africa . the 114th congress enacted several pieces of legislation that shaped u.s. - africa policy and programs . these included the reauthorization of the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa , p.l . 114-27 ) , the electrify africa act ( p.l . 114-121 ) , the global food security act ( p.l . 114-195 ) , the eliminate , neutralize , and disrupt wildlife trafficking act ( p.l . 114-231 ) , annual national defense authorization acts ( most recently , p.l . 114-328 ) , and foreign aid and defense appropriations measures . congress has also influenced u.s. - africa policy through its oversight activities , and through member statements and communications with the executive branch and african leaders . to inform further congressional consideration of u.s. - africa policy issues and challenges , this report provides background on the following : sub - saharan africa 's development and economic challenges ; u.s. - africa trade , investment , and economic cooperation ; governance , democracy , and human rights issues ; peace and security issues ; and u.s. aid to africa and other selected u.s. responses to policy challenges .
