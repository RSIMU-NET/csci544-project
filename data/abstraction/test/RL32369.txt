the 113th congress may consider a comprehensive reform of the nation 's immigration system ( cir ) , and during such discussions , the detention of noncitizens in the united states might be an issue . congress may choose to reevaluate detention priorities ( i.e . , who should be detained , when they should be detained ) and detention resources . under the law , there is broad authority to detain foreign nationals ( aliens / noncitizens ) while awaiting a determination of whether the noncitizen should be removed from the united states . the law also mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention ( i.e . , the aliens must be detained ) . aliens subject to mandatory detention include those arriving without documentation or with fraudulent documentation , those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal grounds , those who are inadmissible or deportable on national security grounds , those certified as terrorist suspects , and those who have final orders of deportation . aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained , paroled , or released on bond . the priorities for detention of these aliens are specified in statute and regulations . for example , the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) increased the categories of aliens subject to mandatory detention . this increase has raised concerns about the justness of mandatory detention , especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation . as of december 22 , 2012 , on an average day in fy2013 , there were 34,696 noncitizens in department of homeland security ( dhs ) custody . the amount of detention space is almost exclusively controlled by congress through appropriations , and congress has been active in providing oversight of detention space allocations and detention conditions . since fy2002 , congress has increased the number of funded detention beds from 21,109 beds to 34,000 beds . as dhs increases its ability to identify aliens who are subject to removal from local jails in more remote locations , the nationwide allocation of detention space may become an issue . furthermore , the detention policy for aliens who have received a final order of removal may also be a congressional concern . after a final removal order has been issued against an alien , the law provides that the alien be removed within 90 days , except as otherwise provided in the statute . certain aliens subject to a removal order `` may be detained beyond the removal period and , if released , shall be subject to [ certain ] terms of supervision . . this provision had been interpreted as permitting indefinite detention where removal was not reasonably foreseeable , but in 2001 , the u.s. supreme court in zadvydas v. davis , interpreted it as only permitting detention for up to six months where removal was not reasonably foreseeable . nonetheless , the u.s. supreme court stated that its ruling was made `` absent clear guidance from congress '' ( i.e . , that it was not clear what congressional intent was related to detaining aliens who could not be removed within 90 days ) . comprehensive immigration reform ( cir ) bills in the 109th and 110th congress would have modified and codified the regulations regarding the detention of those with final orders of removal . in the 112th congress , h.r . 1932 , as reported by the house judiciary committee would have amended the immigration and nationality act to allow dhs to indefinitely detain , subject to six - month reviews , aliens under orders of removal who could not be removed if certain conditions were met .
