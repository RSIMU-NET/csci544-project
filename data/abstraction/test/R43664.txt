the sheer number of central american children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and who lack proper immigration documents is raising complex and competing sets of humanitarian concerns and immigration control issues . adults and families from the same three countries — el salvador , guatemala , and honduras — have also been coming in increasing numbers over the same period . current law provides that unaccompanied alien children ( also referred to as unaccompanied children ) are treated differently than adults or children with their parents who come to the united states without proper immigration documents . this report focuses on how unaccompanied alien children are treated in comparison to unauthorized adults and families with children in the specific contexts of asylum and expedited removal . foreign nationals apprehended along the border or arriving at a u.s. port who lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are placed in expedited removal ; however , if they express a fear of persecution , they receive a `` credible fear '' hearing with a u.s. citizenship and immigration services bureau ( uscis ) asylum officer and — if found credible — are referred to an executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) immigration judge for a hearing . to ultimately receive asylum in the united states , foreign nationals must demonstrate a well - founded fear that if returned home , they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics : race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act ( tvpra ) of 2008 revised the procedures and policies for those unaccompanied alien children who file for asylum , most notably requiring that unaccompanied children from contiguous countries ( i.e . , canada and mexico ) be screened for possible trafficking risks and asylum claims . subsequently , the administration opted to screen all unaccompanied children for possible asylum claims . in addition , the tvpra gives uscis asylum officers `` initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by '' an unaccompanied alien child . only a small portion of the unaccompanied children apprehended by customs and border protection ( cbp ) have requested asylum with uscis thus far . while the numbers requesting asylum have increased , they have not increased at as fast a rate as the overall increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied children . through the third quarter of fy2014 , uscis reports that they have adjudicated 167 cases and granted asylum to 108 unaccompanied children . only two of these approved cases were for unaccompanied children apprehended in fy2014 . all of the other approved cases were for unaccompanied children apprehended in prior years . this report builds on a set of crs reports on issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children : crs report r43599 , unaccompanied alien children : an overview , by [ author name scrubbed ] , [ author name scrubbed ] , and [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report in10107 , unaccompanied alien children : a processing flow chart , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report r43628 , unaccompanied alien children : potential factors contributing to recent immigration , coordinated by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report r43623 , unaccompanied alien children — legal issues : answers to frequently asked questions , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report r41731 , central america regional security initiative : background and policy issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
