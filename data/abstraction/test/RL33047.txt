while the acceptance by members of congress and staff of personal gifts from most outside , private sources is significantly regulated and restricted by internal congressional rules , members of the house and senate may still generally accept from some private sources — other than those who are registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents — necessary travel expenses , including transportation , food and lodging , for travel `` in connection with '' their official duties , such as for fact - finding trips , conferences or symposia , under certain limited circumstances . under both house and senate rules , the over - all purpose of any privately funded trip of this nature must be related or connected to official duties , and may not be `` substantially recreational in nature . . furthermore , while members may accept `` necessary '' travel expenses for events which are sufficiently officially - related or `` officially connected , '' the expenses for incidental recreational activities during these trips , such as the costs for golf , snow - skiing , jet - skiing , or tennis , are expressly not considered `` necessary '' expenses of such travel under either the house or the senate rules , and thus fall within the general prohibitions and the $ 50 limitations on gifts from private sources . ( under both the house and senate rules , gifts from any private source , other than from relatives and certain long - term personal friends , are generally prohibited if the value of the gift is $ 50 or more . ) . the duration of any permitted trip under the `` officially connected '' travel exception is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel ( excluding travel days ) , and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel ( also excluding travel days ) . staff employees must receive advance approval for accepting from private sources expenses for such officially connected travel , and whenever expenses or reimbursement for officially connected travel are accepted by members or staff , a disclosure report on such travel and expenses is required to be made within 30 days of the end of the travel .
