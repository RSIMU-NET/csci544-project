in international trade , the term most - favored - nation ( mfn ) treatment has a meaning atvariance with what it appears to mean : the expression means equal -- rather than exclusivelyfavorable -- treatment and is often used interchangeably with `` nondiscriminatory . . to make thisdistinction clearer and avoid a possibly misleading interpretation of the most - favored - nation term , legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace it in u.s. law with the term `` normal trade relations , '' orntr . in this report , both terms are used interchangeably with `` nondiscriminatory . . the unitedstates accords general mfn treatment as a matter of international obligation as well statutory policyto all trading partners ; however , mfn tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended underspecific legislation . virtually all such suspensions , initially applied to 21 countries or politicalentities , took place under the mandate of the trade agreements extension act of 1951 , and twomore under country - specific legislation . mfn tariff treatment of countries suspended under the 1951law can be restored and maintained in effect for one - year periods by using the procedure providedunder title iv of the trade act of 1974 for such restoration to `` nonmarket economy '' ( nme ) countries . under this procedure , an nme country needs to conclude with the united states a tradeagreement containing a reciprocal mfn clause , and be in compliance with the criteria of thejackson - vanik ( j - v ) freedom - of - emigration provision of that act . the two countries whose mfnstatus was suspended by country - specific legislation could -- and did -- have it restored bypresidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law . trade agreements with nme countries must be approved by joint resolution , and aretriennially self - renewable , but their renewal is also subject to presidential confirmation . to maintainin force the compliance with the j - v criteria ( and the mfn status ) , such compliance must be eitherdetermined semiannually , or waived annually , by the secretary of state , and such determinations orwaivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint resolution . repeated past legislativeaction to disapprove some waivers , particularly those for china , has been unsuccessful and ntrtreatment contingent on a waiver has invariably remained in effect . permanent restoration of ntrstatus of any country generally requires specific legislation . of the 29 countries , today 's successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951suspension , 15 had their permanent ntr status restored by specific legislation ( five directly and tenafter a period of conditional restoration under the jackson - vanik amendment ) , one ( poland ) by thepresident under then existing statutory authority , and one ( east germany ) administratively throughunification with west germany . the status of seven of them is still temporary , subject to thedetermination of full - compliance with the jackson - vanik amendment , and of three of them underthe jackson - vanik waiver provision . two countries ( cuba , and north korea ) are denied ntr statusaltogether . the ntr status of two countries , suspended by individual legislation , has been restoredpermanently by presidential action as authorized by the suspending legislation . this report will be updated as warranted .
