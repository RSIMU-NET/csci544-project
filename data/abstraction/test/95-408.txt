the large influx of immigrants in recent decades has led to an equally long debate over their effect on the labor market outcomes of native - born workers . economic theory posits that an increase in the supply of labor , such as from immigration , will reduce the wage employers are willing to pay all workers ( native - born and foreign - born ) in a given labor market . as a result , some of the workers who had been earning a higher wage before the increase in labor supply will be unwilling to accept a lower wage and they will leave that labor market . the economic model assumes , however , that labor is homogenous . but , workers enter the united states possessing different skill levels and they therefore will compete with ( i.e . , put downward wage pressure on ) native - born workers possessing very similar skill levels . economists have conducted empirical studies to measure the labor market effects of immigration that take into account the skill composition of foreign - born vis - Ã  - vis native - born workers . they have employed two different approaches to do so . the concentration of foreign - born workers in certain cities and skill groups led some economists to posit that immigration 's greatest impact would be felt by similarly skilled native - born workers living in those areas . studies thus have compared differences in labor market outcomes between native - born workers who live in high - versus low - immigrant areas and who most often compete for jobs with foreign - born workers ; given the composition of the recent immigrant flow , these would be low - skilled u.s. workers . most inter - area analyses have found scant evidence that foreign - born labor adversely affects the labor market prospects of u.s. workers in general . a few cross - city studies have estimated a slight negative impact on low - skilled natives . other economists have argued that the cross - city approach underestimates immigration 's consequences because it assumes that labor , capital , and goods do not rapidly adjust to the immigration - induced increase in the supply of labor . if , for example , native - born competitors quickly leave labor markets in high - immigrant areas , their movements would spread any wage effects due to immigration across the nation , and thereby make it difficult for spatially based research to detect any impact . some analysts , therefore , have concluded that immigration 's labor market effects can best be identified by examining data at the national level . for many years , national studies estimated that immigration in the short - run substantially reduced the wages of native - born workers in each skill ( education - experience ) group . native - born workers who lacked a high school diploma were determined to be the most severely affected . more recent national studies have estimated the adverse wage effect of immigration in the short - run to be much smaller , even among the least skilled . the different results in part stem from the finding that workers with at most a high school degree are close substitutes for workers without a degree , which dampens the competitive effect of immigration on the least skilled workers . a 2009 study that utilized cross - city data similarly estimated that the two groups do not compete with one another ; as a result , any adverse effect of low - skilled immigrants is not concentrated on the relatively few native - born workers who are high school dropouts .
