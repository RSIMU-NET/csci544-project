veterans returning from service in iraq and afghanistan could increase demand for affordable rental housing . households with low incomes ( 80 percent or less of the area median income ) generally are eligible to receive rental assistance from the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) housing choice voucher , public housing , and project - based programs . however , because rental assistance is not an entitlement , not all who are eligible receive assistance . in response to a congressional mandate , gao assessed the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households , how hud 's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( whether a person is a veteran or not ) and whether they use a veterans ' preference , and the extent to which hud 's rental assistance programs served veterans in fiscal year 2005. among other things , gao analyzed data from hud , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , and the bureau of the census , surveyed selected public housing agencies , and interviewed agency officials and veterans groups . gao makes no recommendations in this report . va agreed with the report 's findings . hud objected to the characterization in the report regarding hud 's policies on veteran status and program eligibility and subsidy amounts . in 2005 , an estimated 2.3 million veteran renter households had low incomes . the proportion of veteran renter households that were low income varied by state but did not fall below 41 percent . further , an estimated 1.3 million , or about 56 percent of these low - income veteran households , had housing affordability problems -- that is , rental costs exceeding 30 percent of household income . compared with other ( nonveteran ) renter households , however , veterans were somewhat less likely to be low income or have housing affordability problems . hud 's policies for its three major rental assistance programs generally do not take veteran status into account when determining eligibility or assistance levels , but eligible veterans can receive assistance . also , hud generally does not distinguish between income that is specific to veterans , such as va - provided benefits , and other sources of income . the majority of the 41 largest public housing agencies that administer the housing choice voucher or public housing programs have no veterans ' preference for admission . the 13 largest performance - based contract administrators that oversee most properties under project - based programs reported that owners generally did not adopt a veterans ' preference . in fiscal year 2005 , an estimated 11 percent of all eligible low - income veteran households ( at least 250,000 ) received assistance , compared with 19 percent of nonveteran households . although the reasons for the difference are unclear , factors such as differing levels of need for affordable housing among veteran and other households could influence the percentages .
