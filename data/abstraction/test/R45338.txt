the federal communications commission ( fcc ) aims , with its broadcast media ownership rules , to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a geographic market and , in the case of broadcast television stations , nationwide . in addition , the fcc seeks to encourage diversity , including ( 1 ) the diversity of viewpoints , as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives ; ( 2 ) diversity of programming , as indicated by a variety of formats and content ; ( 3 ) outlet diversity , to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market ; and ( 4 ) minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets . two fcc media ownership rules have proven particularly controversial . its national media ownership rule prohibits any entity from owning commercial television stations that reach more than 39 % of u.s. households nationwide . its `` uhf discount '' rule discounts by half the reach of a station broadcasting in the ultra - high frequency ( uhf ) band for the purpose of applying the national media ownership rule . in december 2017 , the commission opened a rulemaking proceeding , seeking comments about whether it should modify or repeal the two rules . if the fcc retains the uhf discount , even if it maintains the 39 % cap , a single entity could potentially reach 78 % of u.s. households through its ownership of broadcast television stations . an important issue with respect to the national ownership cap , which the fcc has not addressed in a rulemaking , is how the agency treats a situation in which a broadcaster manages , operates , or sells advertising for a television station owned by another . in some cases , the fcc has articulated its policy on an ad hoc basis in the context of merger reviews , while in other instances it has effectively consented to such arrangements through its silence . thus , a single entity could comply with the national ownership cap while still influencing broadcast television stations it does not own , reaching more viewers than permitted under the cap . for example , in reviewing the now - cancelled proposed merger between sinclair broadcast group and tribune media company in 2018 , fcc commissioners raised concerns that sinclair 's proposed sale of tribune 's chicago station wgn - tv in order to comply with the national ownership cap could effectively be a `` sham '' transaction due to sinclair 's relationships with the proposed buyer . nevertheless , neither sinclair 's application nor the fcc 's order for a designated hearing addressed whether sinclair 's intention to operate four television stations owned by others within the wilkes - barre - scranton - hazleton , pa , television market might cause it to breach the national ownership cap . in november 2017 , acting in response to petitions from broadcast station licensees , the fcc repealed or relaxed several local media ownership rules . the repealed rules limited common ownership of broadcast television and radio stations within the same market , and of television stations and newspapers within the same market . the fcc also relaxed rules limiting common ownership of two top - four television stations ( generally , abc , cbs , fox , and nbc stations ) within the same market . in august 2018 , the fcc issued rules governing a new `` incubator '' program designed to enhance ownership diversity . parties , including the prometheus radio project , have appealed these orders . the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the legal challenges to all of the fcc 's recent broadcast media ownership rule changes . the fcc plans to launch its next quadrennial media ownership review later this year . these regulatory changes are occurring against the background of significant changes in media consumption patterns . based on surveys conducted by pew research center , the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65 % in 1996 to 37 % in 2016. as broadcast stations face competition for viewers ' attention from other media outlets , and thereby financial pressures , some station owners have sought to strengthen their positions by consolidating . the extent to which such media consolidation can occur is directly related to the fcc media ownership and attribution rules in place at the time .
