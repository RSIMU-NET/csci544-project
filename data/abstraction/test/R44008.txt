the importance of children 's early learning experiences to their development and later success in school and the workforce has become a subject of increasing interest to the public , members of congress , and the administration . during recent congresses many bills have been introduced that would provide funding to states aiming to facilitate improvements in the quality of , and access to , early childhood education ( ece ) programs . this report focuses on two early childhood initiatives — race to the top - early learning challenge ( rtt - elc ) grants for fy2011-fy2013 and preschool development grants ( pdg ) for fy2014-fy2016 . both programs have been administered jointly by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . in addition to background and information on these programs , the report provides data on states that received grants under one or both of these programs . through the rtt - elc program , ed and hhs awarded three rounds of rtt - elc grants in december 2011 ( $ 500 million ) , 2012 ( $ 133 million ) , and 2013 ( $ 370 million ) . nine states received rtt - elc grants in 2011 ( phase 1 ) , five states in 2012 ( phase 2 ) , and six states in 2013 ( phase 3 ) . these grants were broadly focused on building comprehensive statewide systems to support high - quality preschool , as well as increasing access to preschool for high - need children . the obama administration 's proposed pdg program was intended to build on the rtt - elc grants program to accomplish similar goals . for fy2014-fy2016 , the pdg program focused specifically on expanding access to high - quality preschool for four - year - olds from low - income families . the administration requested $ 750 million in fy2014 and fy2016 , and $ 500 million in fy2015 for the pdg program ; the program received $ 250 million in each of the three years . according to the administration 's fy2016 budget request to congress , higher funding for the pdg program would help lay the groundwork for the administration 's larger preschool for all initiative — which was intended to provide high - quality preschool to all low - and moderate - income children . separately , the every student succeeds act ( p.l . 114-95 ) , enacted in december 2015 , established a standalone authorization for a new pdg program . this new program has not yet been funded ; fy2017 is the first year for which funding is authorized . this report is focused on the initial programs , as administered through fy2016 . the new pdg program is generally beyond the scope of this report , though some additional information on it can be found in appendix c. on december 10 , 2014 , ed and hhs awarded pdg grants to 18 states from fy2014 funding . fy2015 and fy2016 funding allowed existing grantees to receive continuation awards but did not fund any new grantees . pgd grants were divided into two separate funding streams . states with fewer than 10 % of their four - year - olds in state - funded preschool that had not received an rtt - elc grant were eligible for pdg - preschool development grants . five states received these grants . states with more than 10 % of their four - year - olds in state - funded preschool or that had received an rtt - elc grant were eligible to apply for pdg - preschool expansion grants . thirteen states received these grants .
