in recent years , the united states has admitted an increasingly diverse group of refugees and other humanitarian cases with a diverse set of needs . there seems to be broad consensus that the u.s. refugee resettlement assistance system is not adequately meeting the needs of these new arrivals and is ripe for reform . the national security council is leading an interagency review of refugee resettlement , the forthcoming results of which may further energize reform efforts . to help inform possible future efforts to reform the refugee resettlement assistance system , this report discusses existing resettlement assistance programs , key challenges and issues in providing effective assistance , and policy options to reform the current system . to assist newly arriving refugees , the department of state ( dos ) administers a program of initial resettlement known as the reception and placement program . under this program , public and private , nonprofit entities provide new refugees with initial resettlement services and referrals to other services , as needed . a separate set of refugee resettlement assistance programs , administered by the office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) in the department of health and human services ' administration for children and families ( hhs / acf ) , provides transitional assistance to refugees and other designated groups . these groups include individuals granted asylum , cuban and haitian entrants , trafficking victims , amerasians , and iraqi and afghan special immigrants . the orr programs — which provide mainly cash assistance , medical assistance , and employment - related services — are intended to help the beneficiaries ( who are referred to collectively as `` refugees '' in this report ) achieve economic self - sufficiency as soon as possible after their arrival in the united states . many observers argue that the dos and orr programs and the refugee resettlement assistance system more broadly are in need of reform . a number of reports have identified perceived shortcomings in the existing system and have offered recommendations for change . several of these reports have focused , in particular , on the recent experience of iraqi refugees resettled in the united states . among the broad challenges facing the refugee resettlement assistance system are interagency coordination and information sharing , and funding . critics also question the system 's self - sufficiency model , which requires refugees to secure employment as quickly as possible . key issues include financial assistance to refugees , which is widely viewed as insufficient , and the `` lottery effect , '' whereby refugees resettled in different parts of the united states receive different levels of financial assistance and services . growing out of these challenges and issues are a variety of options for reforming the existing system with respect to administration and planning and the orr programs .
