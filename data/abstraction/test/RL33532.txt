two separate but closely related issues confront congress each time the president introduces armed forces into a situation abroad that conceivably could lead to their involvement in hostilities . one issue concerns the division of war powers between the president and congress , whether the use of armed forces falls within the purview of the congressional power to declare war and the war powers resolution ( wpr ) . the other issue is whether or not congress concurs in the wisdom of the action . this report does not deal with the substantive merits of using armed forces in specific cases , but rather with congressional authorization for military action , and the application and effectiveness of the wpr . the purpose of the wpr ( p.l . 93-148 , passed over president nixon 's veto on november 7 , 1973 ) is to ensure that congress and the president share in making decisions that may get the united states involved in hostilities . compliance becomes an issue whenever the president introduces u.s. forces abroad in situations that might be construed as hostilities or imminent hostilities . criteria for compliance include prior consultation with congress , fulfillment of the reporting requirements , and congressional authorization . if the president has not complied fully , the issue becomes what action congress should take to bring about compliance or to influence u.s. policy . a related issue has been congressional authorization of u.n. peacekeeping or other u.n. - sponsored actions . for over three decades , war powers and the war powers resolution have been an issue in u.s. military actions in asia , the middle east , africa , central america , and europe . presidents have submitted 136 reports to congress as a result of the war powers resolution , although only one ( the mayaguez situation ) cited section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) or specifically stated that forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities . congress invoked the wpr in the multinational force in lebanon resolution ( p.l . 98-119 ) , which authorized the marines to remain in lebanon for 18 months . in addition , p.l . 102-1 , enacted in january 1991 , authorizing the use of u.s. armed forces in response to iraqi aggression against kuwait , stated that it constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the wpr . on november 9 , 1993 , the house used a section of the wpr to state that u.s. forces should be withdrawn from somalia by march 31 , 1994 ; congress had already taken this action in appropriations legislation . war powers have been at issue in former yugoslavia / bosnia / kosovo , iraq , and haiti . authorizing military actions in response to the terrorist attacks against the united states of september 11 , 2001 , through p.l . 107-40 directly involved war powers . the continued use of force to obtain iraqi compliance with u.n. resolutions remained a war powers issue from the end of the gulf war on february 28 , 1991 , until the enactment of p.l . 107-243 in october 2002 , which explicitly authorized the president to use force against iraq , an authority he exercised in march 2003 , and continues to exercise for military operations in iraq . most recently , issues associated with presidential compliance with the war powers resolution have arisen over his use of u.s. military forces to support a u.n. sanctioned `` no - fly zone '' in libya , without obtaining congressional authorization for such action . debate continues on whether using the war powers resolution is effective as a means of assuring congressional participation in decisions that might get the united states involved in a significant military conflict . proposals have been made to modify or repeal the resolution . none have been enacted to date . this report will be updated as events warrant .
