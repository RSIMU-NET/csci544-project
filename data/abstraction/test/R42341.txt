dating back to the 1950s , federal sourcing policy generally has focused on the premise that the government should rely on the private sector for the provision of certain goods and services . additionally , it has centered around guidance for conducting public - private competitions to determine whether federal employees , or contractor employees , should be selected to perform certain agency functions . the administration of president george w. bush , in particular , emphasized subjecting eligible agency functions to public - private competitions . branding this policy , and related guidance , as competitive sourcing , the bush administration included it as one component of the president 's management agenda . during the administration of president barack obama , another strain , or facet , of sourcing policy surfaced . labeled multi - sector workforce management by the administration , it posits that federal agencies might be susceptible to overreliance on contractors , which could affect the ability of agencies to maintain control over their missions and operations . omb 's july 2009 memorandum provides guidance to agencies on how to manage their multi - sector workforces . the office of federal procurement policy 's policy letter 11-01 — by providing a single , consistent definition of inherently governmental and guidance for identifying and managing inherently governmental functions , functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions , and critical functions — complements the administration 's multi - sector workforce management policy . this letter was issued in september 2011. congressional interest in sourcing policy , generally , has been evident for some time . for example , in 1998 , the federal activities inventory reform ( fair ) act ( p.l . 105-270 ) was signed into law . it requires certain federal agencies to compile , and submit annually to omb , inventories of their commercial activities , which are activities that may be performed by federal employees or a government contractor . recent signs of interest in sourcing policy include two substantively similar but identically titled bills that were introduced during the 112th congress . h.r . 1474 and s. 785 , the freedom from government competition act , contain provisions that would expand upon existing policies designed to encourage federal government reliance on the private sector for the provision of both goods and services . this report provides an overview of the evolution of federal sourcing policy to date and identifies the major policy issues before congress . it is not a legislation tracking report . this report will be updated as events warrant .
