china could potentially be a much larger producer and consumer of natural gas than it is now . despite china 's pollution problems and international environmental commitments , the role of natural gas in china 's energy mix remains relatively low , particularly compared to the united states . china has announced big plans for its natural gas development and use , but the changes will require significant investment in exploration , production , infrastructure , and consumption . with a slowing economy , china may not be in a position in the short - term to undertake these investments . china 's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which congress has expressed a strong interest . those issues include the prospects for u.s. hydrocarbon exports to china , prospects for u.s. energy companies ' investments in china , chinese investment in the u.s. energy sector , china 's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change , and china 's plans for disputed waters in the south china sea , which may contain hydrocarbon resources , among other topics . in the 114th congress , members have expressed interest in chinese policy related to natural gas in hearings , such as the senate committee on energy and natural resources ' january 2015 hearing on s. 33 , the lng permitting certainty and transparency act , and the same committee 's february 2015 hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the u.s. department of energy . china 's energy sector , including its natural gas industry , is controlled by the government via the national development and reform commission 's national energy administration and other regulatory and planning bodies . there are three main national energy companies â€” china national petroleum corporation ( cnpc ) , china petrochemical corporation ( sinopec ) , and china national offshore oil company ( cnooc ) . the first two are among the world 's largest energy companies . these companies are the primary actors domestically and internationally . china has made significant strides in diversifying its natural gas supplies . domestic production rose 164 % from 2004 to 2014 , to 135 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) . natural gas imports , which did not begin until 2006 , grew from one bcm that year to over 58 bcm in 2014. with its imports split almost evenly between pipeline and liquefied natural gas ( lng ) , china is the fourth largest natural gas importer in the world , with turkmenistan supplying just under half of its imports . growth in china 's demand for natural gas has slowed in recent years . state media reported that annual consumption in 2015 was 191 bcm , up 3.7 % from 2014. this represented the lowest rate of annual growth in a decade . china 's government expects its overall energy consumption to grow in 2016 , and for natural gas to rise to 6.2 % of primary energy needs , from 6 % in 2014. part of the slowdown in consumption growth is attributed to the slowing economy . in november 2015 , china cut natural gas prices to spur demand .
