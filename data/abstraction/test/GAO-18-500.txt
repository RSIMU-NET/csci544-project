gender - related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender . while variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences , some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor . while the equal credit opportunity act and fair housing act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions , no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders . gao was asked to review gender - related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the united states . this report examines , among other things , how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women , and potential reasons for any price differences ; what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender , such as mortgages ; and the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender - related price differences . to examine these issues , gao analyzed retail price data , reviewed relevant academic studies , analyzed federal consumer complaint data , and interviewed federal agency officials , industry experts , and academics . firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent . products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes . of 10 personal care product categories ( e.g . , deodorants and shaving products ) that gao analyzed , average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women 's products than for men 's in 5 categories . in 2 categories — shaving gel and nondisposable razors — men 's versions sold at a significantly higher price . one category — razor blades -- had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed , and two others — disposable razors and mass - market perfumes — showed no significant gender price differences . gao found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified , but gao did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender - related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors , such as different advertising costs . though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes , such as product size and packaging type , all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed . studies gao reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender — mortgages , small business credit , auto purchases , and auto repairs . for example , with regard to mortgages , women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men , in part due to weaker credit characteristics , such as lower average income . however , after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors , three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women , while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans . in addition , one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics , and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk . while these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs , several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics , such as credit scores , which could affect analysis of gender disparities . also , several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier , which limits the generalizability of the results . in their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes , the bureau of consumer financial protection , federal trade commission , and department of housing and urban development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender - related pricing differences . gao 's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012 – 2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender - related price differences . the agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness . however , given the limited consumer concern , they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender - related price differences into their existing consumer education resources .
