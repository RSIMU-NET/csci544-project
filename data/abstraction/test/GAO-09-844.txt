nasa 's constellation program is developing the ares i crew launch vehicle and the orion crew exploration vehicle as the agency 's first major efforts in a plan to return to the moon and eventually send humans to mars . gao has issued a number of reports and testimonies on various aspects of this program , and made several recommendations . gao was asked to assess nasa 's progress in implementing gao 's recommendations for the ares i and orion projects , and identify risks the program faces . gao analyzed nasa plans and schedules , risk mitigation information , and contract performance data relative to knowledge - based acquisition practices identified in prior gao reports , and interviewed government officials and contractors . nasa is still struggling to develop a solid business case -- including firm requirements , mature technologies , a knowledge - based acquisition strategy , a realistic cost estimate , and sufficient funding and time -- needed to justify moving the constellation program forward into the implementation phase . gaps in the business case include significant technical and design challenges for the orion and ares i vehicles , such as limiting vibration during launch , eliminating the risk of hitting the launch tower during lift off , and reducing the mass of the orion vehicle , represent considerable hurdles that must be overcome in order to meet safety and performance requirements ; and a poorly phased funding plan that runs the risk of funding shortfalls in fiscal years 2009 through 2012 , resulting in planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones . this approach has limited nasa 's ability to mitigate technical risks early in development and precludes the orderly ramp up of workforce and developmental activities . in response to these gaps , nasa delayed the date of its first crewed - flight and changed its acquisition strategy for the orion project . nasa acknowledges that funding shortfalls reduce the agency 's flexibility in resolving technical challenges . the program 's risk management system warned of planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones . consequently , nasa is now focused on providing the capability to service the international space station and has deferred the capabilities needed for flights to the moon . though these changes to the overarching requirements are likely to increase the confidence level associated with a march 2015 first crewed flight , these actions do not guarantee that the program will successfully meet that deadline . nevertheless , nasa estimates that ares i and orion represent up to $ 49 billion of the over $ 97 billion estimated to be spent on the constellation program through 2020. while the agency has already obligated more than $ 10 billion in contracts , at this point nasa does not know how much ares i and orion will ultimately cost , and will not know until technical and design challenges have been addressed .
