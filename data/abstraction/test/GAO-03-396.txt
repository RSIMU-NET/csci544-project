since the mid - 1990s , gao has highlighted the need for the department of state and other agencies to establish a systematic process for determining their overseas staffing levels . to support this long - standing need and in support of the president 's management agenda , gao developed a framework for assessing overseas workforce size and identified options for rightsizing . because the framework was largely based on work at the u.s. embassy in paris , gao was asked to determine whether the rightsizing framework is applicable at u.s. embassies in developing countries . to accomplish this objective , we visited three u.s. embassies in west africa -- a medium - sized post in dakar , senegal ; and two small embassies in banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania -- and applied the framework and its corresponding questions there . gao 's rightsizing framework can be applied at u.s. embassies in developing countries . officials from the bureau of african affairs , and u.s. embassy officials in dakar , senegal ; banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania , said that the framework 's questions highlighted specific issues at each post that should be considered in determining staffing levels . officials in other state bureaus also believed that the security , mission , cost , and option components of the framework provided a logical basis for planning and making rightsizing decisions . at each of the posts gao visited , application of the framework and corresponding questions generally highlighted physical and technical security deficiencies that needed to be weighed against proposed staff increases ; mission priorities and requirements that are not fully documented or justified in the posts ' mission performance plans ; cost of operations data that were unavailable , incomplete , or fragmented across funding sources ; and rightsizing actions and other options that post managers should consider for adjusting the number of personnel .
