the 111th congress passed comprehensive food safety legislation in december 2010 ( the fda food safety modernization act , or fsma , p.l . 111-353 ) . although numerous agencies share responsibility for regulating food safety , this newly enacted legislation focused on foods regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) and amended fda 's existing structure and authorities , in particular via the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ; 21 u.s.c . §§ 301 et seq . ) . the new law does not directly affect activities at the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , which oversees the safety of most meat and poultry . fsma generally expands or modifies existing fda authorities rather than creating a new food safety structure or authorities . among its many provisions , the new law will increase frequency of inspections at food facilities , tighten record - keeping requirements , extend more oversight to certain farms , and mandate product recalls if a firm fails to institute them voluntarily . the new law will require food processing , manufacturing , shipping , and other regulated facilities to conduct an analysis of the most likely safety hazards and to design and implement risk - based controls to prevent them . fsma also will facilitate the establishment of science - based `` performance standards '' for the most significant food contaminants . other provisions in the new law are also intended to improve the nation 's foodborne illness surveillance systems . fsma also mandates increased scrutiny of food imports , which account for a growing share of u.s. consumption ; food import shipments will have to be accompanied by documentation that they can meet safety standards that are at least equivalent to u.s. standards . such certifications might be provided by foreign governments or other so - called third parties accredited in advance . fsma also contains provisions for certifying or accrediting laboratories , including private laboratories , to conduct sampling and testing of food , among other provisions . this report provides a detailed overview of these and other major provisions in the newly enacted law . the 112th congress will likely provide oversight and scrutiny of how the law is implemented , including fda 's coordination with other federal agencies . implementation of the law will depend largely on the availability of discretionary appropriations , and some have questioned whether funding should be provided in the current budgetary climate . in addition , the 112th congress may consider changes to other food safety laws and policies that continue to be actively debated in congress . continued congressional interest in reforming the nation 's food safety laws and in monitoring food safety issues is expected , given other perceived problems with the current food safety system .
