gao assessed the cost - effectiveness of organizing the air force 's airlift and refueling force into fewer , larger - sized squadrons and wings , focusing on : the effect that reorganization may have on mission accomplishment ; whether costs could be reduced through redistributing aircraft among fewer wings ; and five possible options for redistributing c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft among fewer wings at lower operating costs . gao noted that : the air force could reduce costs and meet peacetime and wartime commitments if it reorganized its c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft into larger - sized squadrons and wings at fewer locations ; these savings would primarily result from fewer people being needed to operate these aircraft ; for the reorganization options gao developed , up to $ 209 million dollars could be saved annually ; creating larger - sized squadrons and wings would still allow the air force to accomplish its peacetime and wartime missions with the existing number of aircraft ; in peacetime deployments , reserve component c - 130 and kc - 135 personnel do not participate as part of entire squadrons or wings but rather as individual volunteers ; thus , creating larger - sized squadrons and wings should not compromise these missions ; for wartime deployments , requirements for c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft are typically stated by the number of aircraft rather than by squadrons or wings ; moreover , war plans where existing flying squadrons are assigned can be changed to accomodate larger - sized squadrons ; specific reserve component wings are not usually assigned in existing war plans ; thus , the impact of reducing them would be minimal ; redistributing the reserve component 's c - 130 and kc - 135 existing aircraft into fewer , larger - sized squadrons and wings would reduce operating costs ; for example , redistributing 16 c - 130 aircraft from two 8-aircraft wings to one 16-aircraft wing would save about $ 11 million annually , primarily from personnel savings ; gao developed five options to illustrate the kind of savings that can be achieved by creating larger - sized squadrons ; these savings range from about $ 51 million to $ 209 million annually ; and sufficient personnel could be recruited and most locations ' facilities could be inexpensively expanded to accomodate the unit sizes in gao 's options .
