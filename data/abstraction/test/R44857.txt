the constitution vests congress with the legislative power , which includes authority to establish federal agencies and conduct oversight of those entities . criminal investigations and prosecutions , however , are generally regarded as core executive functions assigned to the executive branch . because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself , there have often been calls for criminal investigations by prosecutors with independence from the executive branch . in response , congress and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries . these frameworks have aimed to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials . under the ethics in government act of 1978 , for example , congress authorized the appointment of `` special prosecutors , '' who later were known as `` independent counsels . . under this statutory scheme , the attorney general could request that a specially appointed three - judge panel appoint an outside individual to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of criminal law . these individuals were vested with `` full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the department of justice '' with respect to matters within their jurisdiction . ultimately , debate over the scope , cost , and effect of the investigations ( perhaps most notably the iran - contra and the whitewater investigations ) resulted in the law 's expiration and nonrenewal in 1999. following the lapse of these statutory provisions , doj promulgated regulations authorizing the attorney general ( or , if the attorney general is recused from a matter , the acting attorney general ) to appoint a `` special counsel '' from outside the federal government to conduct specific investigations or prosecutions that may be deemed to present a conflict of interest if pursued under the normal procedures of the agency . special counsels are not subject to `` day - to - day supervision '' by any official and are vested `` within the scope of his or her jurisdiction , the full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any united states attorney . . the independent nature of these investigations has raised constitutional questions about the propriety of the appointment and removal mechanisms provided for the officials leading the inquiries . these concerns were addressed by the supreme court in the 1988 case of morrison v. olson , which upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel statute . the reasoning of that opinion has been challenged , however , and the court 's subsequent analysis of related issues in the 1997 case of edmond v. united states and the 2010 case free enterprise fund v. public accounting oversight board did not apply the standard enunciated in morrison . the constitutional status of a statutory framework similar to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate . several bills introduced in the 116th congress ( including s. 71 and h.r . 197 , which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115th congress , s. 1735 and s. 1741 ) would statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal , echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute 's provisions . whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in morrison .
