a small group of developing countries are transforming the global economic landscape . led by china , india , and brazil , these rising economic powers pose varied challenges and opportunities for u.s. economic interests and leadership of the global economy . they also raise significant policy issues for congress , including the future direction of u.s. trade policy and negotiations , as well as for the multilateral economic institutions that have historically served as the foundation of an open and rules - based global economy . this report addresses ongoing shifts in global trade and finance and projected future trends resulting from the emergence of these economies . it is the first of a three - part crs series that focuses on how the rising economic powers are affecting u.s. interests and raising challenges for congressional oversight of u.s. international trade and financial policies . the major trends in the global economy identified and discussed in this report are : the balance of global economic power is shifting from the united states and europe to a number of fast - growing and large developing countries . these economies account for rising shares of global gdp , manufacturing , and trade , including a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries ( south - south trade ) . these shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies , particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries . rising economic powers are becoming more important players in international finance . they have increased holdings of foreign exchange reserves , established sovereign wealth funds , borrowed capital from international capital markets , and attracted substantial foreign investment . their multinational corporations , many state - owned , are investing assets globally and are competing with u.s. firms for natural resources and access to other developing - country markets . the long - standing distinction between advanced and developing countries , particularly for rising economic powers , is blurring . the advanced countries may still be the richest countries in terms of per capita income , but their economies may no longer be the largest , the fastest - growing , or the most dynamic . rising economic powers are exerting greater influence in global trade and financial policies and in the multilateral institutions that have underpinned the global economy since world war ii . these developments , in turn , have implications for u.s. global leadership that are subject to debate . while the impact of the rising economic powers is considered by most economists to be strongly positive for the u.s. economy overall , not all groups of americans have benefitted equally . highly educated workers are seen gaining more job opportunities and higher wages than workers with less education . issues for congress on the international trade and finance policies raised by the changing global landscape could include : seizing full advantage of growing markets for u.s. manufacturers , service providers , agricultural producers , and their workers , including preparing for increased competition . the future direction of u.s. trade negotiations and the global trading system , as well as specific policies and issues raised by the global economy . these might include the increasing role of state - owned enterprises , access to developing country markets for services and government procurement , the future role of the dollar as the primary reserve currency , and u.s. participation in global supply chains , among other issues . the evolution of international frameworks for financial integration , as well as multilateral and bilateral frameworks for foreign direct investment and sovereign wealth funds . this report will be updated as events warrant .
