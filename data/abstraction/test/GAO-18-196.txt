under capta , states perform a range of prevention activities , including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure . the number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic . gao was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement capta requirements on substance - affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. this report examines the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify cps of substance - affected infants ; state efforts to develop plans of safe care , and associated challenges ; and steps hhs has taken to help states implement the provisions . to obtain this information , gao surveyed state cps directors in all 50 states and the district of columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate . gao also visited 3 states ( kentucky , massachusetts , and pennsylvania ) ; reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations , and hhs guidance ; and interviewed hhs officials . gao did not assess states ' compliance with capta requirements . all states reported adopting , to varying degrees , policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services ( cps ) about infants affected by opioids or other substances . under the child abuse prevention and treatment act ( capta ) , as amended , governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use . this is to include health care providers notifying cps of substance - affected infants . in response to gao 's survey , 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify cps about substance - affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification . the remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect , cps is notified . in response to gao 's survey , 49 states reported that their cps agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care ; 2 reported not having such a requirement . under capta , states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance - affected infants . although not defined in law , a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family 's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child 's safety and well - being . states reported that plans typically address the infant 's safety needs , immediate medical needs , and the caregiver 's substance use treatment needs . however , officials in the 3 states gao visited noted challenges , including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these capta requirements . most states reported in gao 's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges . nevertheless , hhs officials told gao that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance , but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the national center on substance abuse and child welfare â€” a resource center funded by hhs . however , of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received , 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful . states offered suggestions for improving the assistance , such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information . in october 2017 , hhs officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the capta requirements . hhs officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans . without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states ' understanding of capta requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report , states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need . gao recommends that hhs provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements . hhs did not concur with the recommendation . as discussed in the report , gao continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states .
