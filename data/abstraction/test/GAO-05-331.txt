the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) multibillion - dollar effort to modernize the nation 's air traffic control ( atc ) system has suffered from cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls in its system acquisitions for more than two decades and has been on our list of high risk programs since 1995. faa 's performance - based air traffic organization ( ato ) was created in february 2004 , in part , to address these legacy challenges . in this report , gao examined faa 's experience in meeting cost , schedule , and performance targets for major atc system acquisitions ; steps taken to address legacy problems with the program and additional steps needed ; and the potential impact of the constrained federal budget on this program . the ato met its acquisition goal for fiscal year 2004. however , prior to the establishment of the ato , faa had experienced more than two decades of cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls in acquiring major systems under its atc modernization program . for example , 13 of the 16 major system acquisitions that we reviewed in detail have experienced cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls when assessed against their original milestones . these 13 system acquisitions experienced total cost growth from $ 1.1 million to about $ 1.5 billion ; schedule extensions ranging from 1 to 13 years ; and performance shortfalls , including safety problems . we found that one or more of four factors -- funding , requirements growth and / or unplanned work , stakeholder involvement , and software complexity -- have contributed to these legacy challenges . while faa met its recent acquisition goal , it is important to note that this goal is based on updated program milestones and cost targets for system acquisitions , not those set at their inception . consequently , they do not provide a consistent benchmark for assessing progress over time . also , as indicators of annual progress , they can not be used in isolation to measure progress over the life of an acquisition . although additional steps are warranted , faa has taken some positive steps to address key legacy challenges it has had with acquiring major systems under the modernization program . for example , the ato has cut funding for some major systems that were not meeting their goals and is reassessing all capital investments to help ensure that priority systems receive needed funding . the ato has improved its management of software - intensive acquisitions and information technology investments and begun to more actively involve stakeholders . as we recommended , the ato plans to establish an overall policy to apply its process improvement model to all software - intensive acquisitions . however , additional steps could be taken to improve its management of system acquisitions . for example , the ato could use a knowledge - based approach to managing system acquisitions , characteristic of best commercial practices , to help avoid cost , schedule , and performance problems . the ato will also be challenged to modernize the atc system under constrained budget targets , which would provide faa with about $ 2 billion less than it planned to spend through 2009. to fund its major system acquisitions and remain within these targets , the ato has eliminated planned funding to start new projects and substantially reduced planned funding for other areas . however , when forwarding its budget submission for review by senior officials at faa , dot , the office of management and budget , and congress , the ato provides no detail on the impact of the planned funding reductions on atc modernization and related activities to modernize the nas . our work shows that the ato should provide these decision - makers with detailed information in its budget submissions about the impact of funding decisions on modernization efforts . without this type of information , decision - makers lack important details when considering faa 's annual budget submissions .
