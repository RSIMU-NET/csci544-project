in fiscal year 2003 , the federal food stamp program made payment errors totaling about $ 1.4 billion in benefits , or about 7 percent of the total $ 21.4 billion in benefits provided to a monthly average of 21 million low - income participants . because payment errors are a misuse of public funds and can undermine public support of the program , it is important that the government minimize them . because of concerns about ensuring payment accuracy gao examined : what is included in the national food stamp payment error rate and how it has changed over time , what is known about the causes of food stamp payment errors , and what actions the food and nutrition service ( fns ) and states have taken to reduce these payment errors . to answer these questions , gao analyzed program quality control data for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 and interviewed program stakeholders , including state and local officials from nine states . the national dollar payment error rate for the food stamp program , which combines states ' overpayments and underpayments to program participants in all states , has declined by almost one - third over the last 5 years to a record low of 6.63 percent . this decline has been widespread ; the rate fell in 41 states and the district of columbia , and rates in 18 of these states fell by at least one - third . however , despite this decrease , some states continue to have relatively high payment error rates . for example , in 2003 , 7 states had payment error rates of more than 10 percent . almost two - thirds of food stamp payment errors are caused by caseworkers , usually when they fail to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules , and one - third are caused by participant failure to report required , complete , or correct information , such as household income and composition . state officials said program complexity and other factors , such as the lack of resources and staff turnover , can contribute to these errors . in fiscal year 2003 , states referred about 5 percent of all cases identified with errors for suspected participant fraud investigation . to increase food stamp payment accuracy , fns and the 9 states gao reviewed took many approaches that parallel good internal control practices . these efforts include increasing the leadership and accountability in the program , performing risk assessments to identify problem areas , implementing various program and process changes in response to the findings from risk assessments , and monitoring and promoting improved performance . the states are using a combination of approaches to improve payment accuracy , making it difficult to tie error rate improvements to specific practices . however , state officials point to their improved state error rates as evidence of a collective impact .
