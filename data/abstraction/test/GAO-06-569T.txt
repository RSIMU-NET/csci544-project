title insurance is a required element of almost all real estate purchases and is not an insignificant cost for consumers . however , consumers generally do not have the knowledge needed to `` shop around '' for title insurance and usually rely on professionals involved in real estate -- such as lenders , real estate agents , and attorneys -- for advice in selecting a title insurer . recent state and federal investigations into title insurance sales have identified practices that may have benefited these professionals and title insurance providers at the expense of consumers . at the request of the house financial services committee , gao currently has work under way studying the title insurance industry , including pricing , competition , the size of the market , the roles of the various participants in the market , and how the industry is regulated . this testimony discusses the preliminary results of gao 's work to date and identifies issues for further study . in so doing , this testimony focuses on : the reasonableness of cost structures and agent practices common to the title insurance market that are not typical of other insurance markets ; the implications of activities identified in recent state and federal investigations that may have benefited real estate professionals rather than consumers ; and the potential need for regulatory changes that would affect the way that title insurance is sold . some cost structures and agent practices that are common to the title insurance market are not typical of other lines of insurance and merit further study . first , the extent to which premium rates reflect underlying costs is not always clear . for example , most states do not consider title search and examination costs -- insurers ' largest expense -- to be part of the premium , and do not review these costs . second , while title agents play a key role in the underwriting process , the extent to which state insurance regulators review agents is not clear . few states collect information on agents , and three states do not license them . third , the extent to which a competitive environment exists within the title insurance market that benefits consumers is also not clear . consumers generally lack the knowledge necessary to `` shop around '' for a title insurer and therefore often rely on the advice of real estate and mortgage professionals . as a result , title agents normally market their business to these professionals , creating a form of competition from which the benefit to consumers is not always clear . fourth , real estate brokers and lenders are increasingly becoming full or part owners of title agencies , which may benefit consumers by allowing one - stop shopping , but may also create conflicts of interest . finally , multiple regulators oversee the different entities involved in the title insurance industry , but the extent of involvement and coordination among these entities is not clear . recent state and federal investigations have identified potentially illegal activities -- mainly involving alleged kickbacks -- that also merit further study . the investigations alleged instances of real estate agents , mortgage brokers , and lenders receiving referral fees or other inducements in return for steering business to title insurers or agents , activities that may have violated federal or state anti - kickback laws . participants allegedly used several methods to convey the inducements , including captive reinsurance agreements , fraudulent business arrangements , and discounted business services . for example , investigators identified several `` shell '' title agencies created by a title agent and a real estate or mortgage broker that had no physical location or employees and did not perform any title business , allegedly serving only to obscure referral payments . insurers and industry associations with whom we spoke said that they had begun to address such alleged activities but also said that current regulations needed clarification . in the past several years , regulators , industry groups , and others have suggested changes to the way title insurance is sold , and further study of these suggestions could be beneficial . for example , the department of housing and urban development announced in june 2005 that it was considering revisions to the regulations implementing the real estate settlement procedures act . in addition , the national association of insurance commissioners is considering changes to model laws for title insurers and title agents . finally , at least one consumer advocate has suggested that requiring lenders to pay for the title policies from which they benefit might increase competition and ultimately lower consumers ' costs .
