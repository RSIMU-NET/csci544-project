the agriculture appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) except for the forest service . the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 115-141 , division a ) , and the fy2019 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 116-6 , division b ) include funding for conservation programs and activities at usda . congress passed the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act on march 23 , 2018. fy2019 began with seven appropriations bills , including usda , unfinished . the house and senate appropriations committees reported agriculture appropriations bills for fy2019 ( h.r . 5961 , s. 2976 ) , with the senate having amended and passed its version as division c of a four - bill minibus ( h.r . 6147 ) . congress and the president approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through december 21 , 2018 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . 115-245 ) . after december 21 , 2018 , a partial shutdown of the government , including many agencies within usda , occurred . one of the few exceptions was the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) , which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown . on january 25 , 2019 , an agreement was reached to continue funding for usda and other appropriations that had lapsed through february 15 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . 116-5 ) . the fy2019 consolidated appropriations act was signed into law on february 15 , 2019 , funding usda through the end of the fiscal year ( division b , p.l . 116-6 ) . agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending . most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills . other conservation programs — mostly technical assistance — are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations . the largest discretionary program is the conservation operations ( co ) account , which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country . the enacted fy2018 appropriation provided $ 874 million for co , an increase from the fy2017 enacted amount ( $ 864 million ) . the enacted fy2019 appropriation decreases funding for co below fy2018 levels to $ 819 million and redirects funding to the new farm production and conservation business center . other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs . the largest — watershed and flood prevention operations ( wfpo ) — was funded at $ 150 million annually in fy2018 and fy2019 . most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation . however , congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending ( chimps ) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since fy2003 . the enacted fy2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since fy2002 that did not include chimps to mandatory conservation programs . the enacted fy2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs , as most programs ' authorizations expired on september 30 , 2018 , making these programs ineligible for reduction . the 2018 farm bill ( agricultural improvement act of 2018 , p.l . 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs . while this is infrequent , the agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs . the fy2018 agriculture appropriations act included two such amendments — one to wfpo and one to farm bill conservation program reporting requirements . the wfpo amendment increased the size threshold required for congressional approval . under the amended language , the senate and house agriculture committees must approve wfpo projects that include an estimated federal contribution of more than $ 25 million for construction , an increase from the previous $ 5 million threshold . additionally , the fy2018 appropriations act exempted farm bill conservation programs from select federal reporting requirements , including obtaining a data universal numbering system ( duns ) number and system for award management ( sam ) registration . agriculture appropriations bills may also include policy - related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriation . the fy2018 and fy2019 appropriations acts both include policy provisions for conservation programs that range from reports to congress to suggested natural resource priorities .
