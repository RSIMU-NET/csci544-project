in 1967 , the congress created the national park foundation ( foundation ) -- a nonprofit organization with the sole purpose of providing private support to the national park service ( park service ) . however , some park service officials have raised concerns that the foundation 's support is not meeting parks ' priority needs . in this context , congressional requesters asked gao to review the activities of the foundation by determining the foundation 's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the park service , amount and kinds of donations the foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , and extent to which the contributions obtained by the foundation assisted the park service in addressing park priorities . in accordance with its legislative charter , the foundation raises private donations from a variety of sources and has broad discretion in how it distributes these donations to support the park service . in general , the foundation 's policy is to support systemwide projects that serve the park service and are not otherwise federally funded , such as supporting temporary transportation advisors to help alleviate congestion at national parks . overall , annual private donations to the foundation have more than doubled -- from $ 18 million in fiscal year 1999 to $ 41 million in fiscal year 2003. much of this increase has stemmed from the foundation 's concerted effort to target corporate donations , which accounted for the bulk of the donations received . most of the corporate donations are noncash or `` inkind , '' such as providing expertise to renovate the red bus fleet in glacier national park or providing electric vehicles to parks in california . corporate donors typically specify how their donations are to be used . for example , one corporation donated funds to renovate a national monument in the district of columbia . the foundation , in consultation with the park service , decided to use these funds to renovate the washington monument . because the majority of the foundation 's donations are restricted by the donors for a specific use , there are limited funds available to respond to some parks ' requests , such as for fund - raising assistance or support for local nonprofit groups . consequently , some park officials question the usefulness of foundation donations and believe support should be directed at park priorities . in an effort to raise more discretionary funds and possibly better support individual park needs , the foundation is expanding its fund - raising approach to attract more donations from individuals . the foundation 's efforts to assist the park service are hampered by poor communication and documentation problems . first , unlike most other partner relationships with the park service , the foundation and the park service do not have a comprehensive written agreement that clearly describes the foundation 's fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each partner . second , the foundation and the park service sometimes enter into verbal rather than written fund - raising agreements , thereby making it more difficult to determine the responsibilities of each party and whether commitments were met . third , foundation and park service officials disagree about the fund - raising strategy as well as the objectives for one of the foundation 's key fundraising programs . both parties have taken initial steps to address these and other communication problems .
