the federal aviation administration ( faa ) operates one of the safest air transportation systems in the world , but this system is under growing strain as the demand for air travel increases . recognizing the need to transform this system , congress created the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) , housed within faa , to plan and develop the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) . the current authorization for faa , the airport and airway trust fund ( trust fund ) , and most of the excise taxes that support the trust fund will expire september 30 , 2007. several proposals , including two reauthorization bills -- h.r . 2881 and s. 1300- - identify various funding sources for faa activities , including nextgen . among these are current excise taxes , fees , and flight surcharges . concerned about the need for stable , sustainable financing for the nation 's multibillion - dollar transportation infrastructure investments , including nextgen , gao has designated transportation financing as high risk . gao 's statement addresses the extent to which the current funding structure can support faa 's activities , including nextgen , issues that could affect the overall cost of nextgen , and the implications of selected proposals to fund aviation activities . the statement is based on recent gao reports and testimonies . recent estimates indicate that faa 's current funding structure -- consisting primarily of trust fund revenues plus a contribution from the general fund of the u.s. treasury -- can potentially support faa 's activities , including nextgen . the current structure has provided sufficient funding for faa 's activities to date , and both faa and the congressional budget office ( cbo ) have estimated that revenues will continue to increase . according to cbo projections through 2017 , the current structure , if maintained , could support about $ 22 billion in additional spending over current spending levels ( adjusted for inflation ) . congress could also raise more revenue for faa by raising excise tax rates or by increasing the general fund contribution . however , contributions from the general fund may be limited by the federal government 's long - term fiscal imbalance , and policy choices , structural changes in the aviation industry , and external events could affect trust fund revenues . furthermore , the current funding structure raises concerns about equity and efficiency because users may pay more or less than the costs of the air traffic control services they receive , and therefore they may lack incentives to use the national airspace system as efficiently as possible . issues that could affect the overall cost of nextgen are primarily related to the content and cost of its infrastructure and research and development . jpdo is developing and has issued some key planning documents that will provide more insights into some of these issues , but questions remain over which entities will perform activities such as research and development . other issues include the cost savings that could result from more efficient faa operations and acquisition processes , which could reduce the need for new nextgen funding , and the extent to which public - private partnerships and leasing can be used to acquire nextgen infrastructure as flexibly and cost - effectively as possible . selected proposals for funding aviation activities could generate more revenue , but could also lead to unintended consequences . for example , a house committee recommendation to raise general aviation fuel tax rates could increase trust fund revenue , but might reduce fuel purchases , which would limit the amount of the revenue increase . h.r . 2881 would raise airport passenger facility charges , mainly benefiting larger airports , and would establish or increase fees for certain faa certification and registration activities . however , when fees are imposed for aviation activities , care must be taken to ensure that efforts to avoid the fees do not compromise safety . s. 1300 would authorize a surcharge of $ 25 per flight on many flights to help pay for nextgen capital projects . while a surcharge would create an incentive for efficient use of air traffic services , some stakeholders raise the possibility that such a fee could lead to reduced air service for small communities . s. 1300 would also allow faa to seek debt financing for capital projects in the private capital market -- a proposal designed to create a stable revenue source but resulting in higher interest costs than borrowing from the u.s. treasury .
