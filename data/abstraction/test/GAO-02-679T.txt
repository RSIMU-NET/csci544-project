welfare reform significantly changed federal policy for low - income families with children and established a five - year lifetime limit on cash assistance . welfare reform also extended transitional medicaid assistance through 2001. states have implemented various initiatives to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce , including some enhancements to transitional medicaid . these initiatives likely helped to cut cash assistance caseloads by more than half from 1996 through mid - 2001 . low - wage or part - time jobs -- which are common for newly working individuals -- often do not come with affordable health insurance , thus making transitional medicaid coverage an important option . the implementation of transitional medicaid assistance varied across the 21 states that gao reviewed . state practices enhanced beneficiaries ' ability to retain medicaid coverage . however , many families did not receive their full transitional medicaid assistance benefits because they failed to report their income three times during the 12-month period of coverage . amending the medicaid statute to provide states with greater flexibility to ease income - reporting requirements , as has been done for other aspects of the medicaid program , could facilitate uninterrupted health insurance coverage for families moving from cash assistance to the workforce .
