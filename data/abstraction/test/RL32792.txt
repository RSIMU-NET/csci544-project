as a result of falling age - specific mortality , life expectancy rose dramatically in the united states over the past century . final data for 2003 ( the most recent available ) show that life expectancy at birth for the total population has reached an all - time american high level , 77.5 years , up from 49.2 years at the turn of the 20 th century . record - high life expectancies were found for white females ( 80.5 years ) and black females ( 76.1 years ) , as well as for white males ( 75.3 years ) and black males ( 69.0 years ) . life expectancy gaps between males and females and between whites and blacks persisted . in combination with decreasing fertility , the life expectancy gains have led to a rapid aging of the american population , as reflected by an increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and older . this report documents the improvements in longevity that have occurred , analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions and the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race . in addition , it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years . detailed statistics on life expectancy are provided . a brief comparison with other countries is also provided . while this report focuses on a description of the demographic context of life expectancy change in the united states , these trends have implications for a wide range of social and economic programs and issues that are likely to be considered by congress . this report will be updated upon release of final data for 2004 by the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) .
