since the deepwater horizon oil spill began on april 20 , 2010 , congress has given much attention to the compensatory liability provisions of the oil pollution act and , to a lesser extent , those of the jones act and the death on the high seas act . however , federal laws possibly relevant to the oil spill also impose civil and criminal money penalties , which may reach dollar amounts in connection with the gulf spill greater than those for compensatory liability . this report summarizes selected federal civil and criminal penalty provisions that may be found violated in connection with the gulf spill and related worker fatalities . it does not purport to be exhaustive . crs stresses that it has no knowledge of the facts surrounding the gulf spill other than what has been publicly reported ; hence the provisions listed here are only an informed guess as to those that ultimately may be found violated . at the outset , the penalty ceilings in the program statutes listed in this report may not be the applicable ones . as for civil penalty ceilings , the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act requires federal agencies to adjust at least once every four years the maximum ( and minimum , if any ) dollar amount on civil penalties within their jurisdiction to reflect movement in the consumer price index . as for criminal penalty ceilings , the criminal fine improvements act often applies . under this statute , the maximum criminal fine a court may impose may be up to the greater of the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense or various alternative ceilings in the criminal fine improvements act . for each statute listed , the report describes any civil administrative penalties , civil judicial penalties , and criminal penalties authorized by the statute that conceivably might be relevant to the gulf spill . the program statutes covered are the clean water act , endangered species act , marine mammal protection act , migratory bird treaty act , oil pollution act , outer continental shelf lands act , and occupational safety and health act . in addition , the report lists several provisions in the federal penal code that are often used in the prosecution of environmental crimes â€” involving aiding and abetting , conspiracy , false statements to the federal government , mail fraud , wire fraud , and obstruction of justice . an addendum describes the civil complaint filed by the united states on december 15 , 2010 , against several parties allegedly responsible for the gulf spill , and an insurance company .
