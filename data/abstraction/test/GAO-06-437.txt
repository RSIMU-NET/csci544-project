since 1979 , egypt has received about $ 60 billion in military and economic assistance with about $ 34 billion in the form of foreign military financing ( fmf ) grants that enable egypt to purchase u.s. - manufactured military goods and services . in this report , gao describes the types and amounts of fmf assistance provided to egypt ; assesses the financing arrangements used to provide fmf assistance to egypt ; and evaluates how the u.s. assesses the program 's contribution to u.s. foreign policy and security goals . egypt is currently among the largest recipients of u.s. foreign assistance , along with israel , afghanistan , and iraq . egypt has received about $ 1.3 billion annually in u.s. foreign military financing ( fmf ) assistance and has purchased a variety of u.s. - manufactured military goods and services such as apache helicopters , f - 16 aircraft , and m1a1 tanks , as well as the training and maintenance to support these systems . the united states has provided egypt with fmf assistance through a statutory cash flow financing arrangement that permits flexibility in how egypt acquires defense goods and services from the united states . in the past , the defense security cooperation agency ( dsca ) accumulated large undisbursed balances in this program . because the flexibilities of cash flow financing permit egypt to pay for its purchases over time , egypt currently has agreements for u.s. defense articles and services worth over $ 2 billion -- some of which are not due for full payment until 2011. the departments of state ( state ) and defense ( dod ) have not conducted an assessment to identify the risks and impacts of a potential shift in fmf funding . officials and many experts assert that the fmf program to egypt supports u.s. foreign policy and security goals ; however , state and dod do not assess how the program specifically contributes to these goals . u.s. and egyptian officials cited examples of egypt 's support for u.s. interests , such as maintaining egyptian - israeli peace and providing access to the suez canal and egyptian airspace . dod has not determined how it will measure progress in achieving key goals such as interoperability and modernizing egypt 's military . for example , the u.s. central command , the responsible military authority , defines modernization as the ratio of u.s. - to - soviet equipment in egypt 's inventory and does not include other potentially relevant factors , such as readiness or military capabilities . achieving interoperability in egypt is complicated by the lack of a common definition of interoperability and limitations on some types of sensitive equipment transfers . given the longevity and magnitude of fmf assistance to egypt , evaluating the degree to which the program meets its goals would be important information for congressional oversight , particularly as congress assesses the balance between economic and military assistance to egypt as well as the impact on u.s. foreign policy interests .
