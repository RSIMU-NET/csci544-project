pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the : status of the national weather service ( nws ) systems modernization ; and most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's ( noaa ) marine data . gao noted that : although nws is nearing completion of its systems modernization effort , two significant challenges face it this year : deploying the final system of modernization ; and ensuring that all of its mission - critical systems are year 2000 compliant ; nws has made progress on both fronts ; in the noaa fleet area , noaa now outsources for more of its research and data needs but plans to spend $ 185 million over the next five years to acquire four new replacement noaa fisheries research ships ; and thus , gao believes that continued congressional oversight of this area , as well as noaa 's budget requests for replacement or upgraded ships , is needed to ensure that noaa is pursuing the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring marine data .
