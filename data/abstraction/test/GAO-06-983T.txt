the department of defense ( dod ) maintains a military force with unparalleled logistics capabilities , but it continues to confront decades - old supply chain management problems . the supply chain can be the critical link in determining whether our frontline military forces win or lose on the battlefield , and the investment of resources in the supply chain is substantial . because of weaknesses in dod 's supply chain management , this program has been on gao 's list of high - risk areas needing urgent attention and transformation since 1990. last year , dod developed a plan to resolve its long - term supply chain problems in three focus areas : requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . in october 2005 , gao testified that the plan was a good first step . gao was asked to provide its views on dod 's progress toward implementing the supply chain management improvement plan and incorporating performance measures for tracking and demonstrating improvement , as well as to comment on the alignment of dod 's supply chain management improvement plan with other department logistics plans . this testimony is based on prior gao reports and ongoing work in this area . it contains gao 's views on opportunities to improve dod 's ability to achieve and demonstrate progress in supply chain management . since october 2005 , dod has continued to make progress implementing the 10 initiatives in its supply chain management improvement plan , but it will take several years to fully implement these initiatives . dod 's stated goal for implementing its plan is to demonstrate significant improvement in supply chain management within 2 years of the plan 's inception in 2005 , but the time frames for substantially implementing some initiatives are currently 2008 or later . while dod has generally stayed on track , it has reported some slippage in the implementation of certain initiatives . factors such as the long - standing nature of the problems , the complexities of the initiatives , and the involvement of multiple organizations within dod could cause the implementation dates of some initiatives to slip farther . dod has incorporated several broad performance measures in its supply chain management improvement plan , but it continues to lack outcome - focused performance measures for many of the initiatives . therefore , it is difficult to track and demonstrate progress toward improving the three focus areas of requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . although dod 's plan includes four high - level performance measures that are being tracked across the department , these measures do not necessarily reflect the performance of the initiatives and do not relate explicitly to the three focus areas . further , dod 's plan does not include cost metrics that might show efficiencies gained through supply chain improvement efforts . in their effort to develop performance measures for use across the department , dod officials have encountered challenges such as a lack of standardized , reliable data . nevertheless , dod could show near - term progress by adding intermediate measures . these measures could include outcome - focused measures for each of the initiatives or for the three focus areas . dod has multiple plans aimed at improving aspects of logistics , including supply chain management , but it is unclear how these plans are aligned with one another . the plans were developed at different points of time , for different purposes , and in different formats , so it is difficult to determine how all the ongoing efforts link together to sufficiently cover requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution and whether they will result in significant progress toward resolving this high - risk area . also , dod 's supply chain management improvement plan does not account for initiatives outside the direct oversight of the office of the secretary of defense , and dod lacks a comprehensive strategy to guide logistics programs and initiatives . dod is in the process of developing a new plan , referred to as the `` to be '' roadmap , for future logistics programs and initiatives . the roadmap is intended to portray where the department is headed in the logistics area , how it will get there , and what progress is being made toward achieving its objectives , as well as to link ongoing capability development , program reviews , and budgeting . however , until it is completed , gao will not be able to assess how the roadmap addresses the challenges and risks dod faces in its supply chain improvement efforts .
