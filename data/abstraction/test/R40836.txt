increasing focus on current cyber threats to federal information technology systems , nonfederal critical information infrastructure , and other nonfederal systems has led to numerous legislative cybersecurity proposals and executive branch initiatives . the proposed national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( ndaa fy2010 ) and the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( iia fy2010 ) both contain provisions that would affect programs and funding for current and future cybersecurity - related programs . in may 2009 , the obama administration issued its 60-day review of cybersecurity policy , declaring that u.s. information networks would be treated as a strategic national asset . there is no single congressional committee or executive agency with primary responsibility over all aspects of cybersecurity ; each entity involved pursues cybersecurity from a limited vantage point dictated by committee jurisdiction . many different initiatives exist , but because of fragmentation of missions and responsibilities , `` stove - piping , '' and a lack of mutual awareness between stakeholders , it is difficult to ascertain where there may be programmatic overlap or gaps in cybersecurity policy . drawing from common themes found in the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative ( cnci ) , a study by the center for strategic and international studies ( csis ) commission for the 44th presidency , and the proposed near - term action plan from the president 's recent cyberspace policy review , this report identifies cybersecurity policy issues that have been proposed for priority consideration . the report lists and synopsizes current legislation at the time of this writing that has been developed to address various aspects of the cybersecurity problem . it then lists the status of the legislation and compares legislation with existing executive branch initiatives at the time of writing . finally , analysis of information contained in executive branch initiatives and congressional legislation is used to further highlight cybersecurity - related considerations for congress . this report will not be updated .
