the board is charged with overseeing and supporting the capitol police . gao was asked to review the board 's operations , including the board 's accountability and level of communication . this report examines the roles and responsibilities of the board and the police chief and the comparability of the board 's scope to other law enforcement oversight entities ; the extent to which the board 's manual incorporates leading practices for accountability , transparency , and external communication , and how the board implements these practices ; and congressional stakeholder perspectives on the board 's approaches and adjustments to enhance them . to complete this review , gao analyzed relevant statutes and board governing documents and operations . gao also used internal control and corporate governance standards to articulate the key principles of accountability , transparency , and effective external communication ; identified six leading practices that facilitate these principles ; and analyzed the board 's manual against each . gao also interviewed board members and staff , congressional stakeholders , and experts selected for their knowledge of law enforcement oversight . the capitol police board ( board ) has wide - ranging responsibilities and according to experts with knowledge of law enforcement oversight bodies , like civilian oversight boards , the board 's scope is unique by comparison . for example , the board has authority for security decisions , as well as certain human capital and personnel matters , including the approval of officer terminations . in 2013 , the board adopted a manual of procedures ( manual ) that references its operations and establishes protocols for outreach with the congressional committees and leadership offices ( stakeholders ) with whom the board interacts . this manual fully incorporated one and partially incorporated five of the six leading practices that facilitate the principles of accountability , transparency , and effective external communication ; however , the board has not always implemented these practices , such as notifying stakeholders that certain information on the board 's decisions and operations is available to them . some stakeholders raised concerns , such as the board not adequately soliciting their input , and suggested adjustments to enhance the board 's approaches . board officials told us that the manual has not incorporated some leading practices , in part because they address activities beyond statutory requirements . leading practices note that effective governing bodies make commitments to stakeholders that exceed basic requirements , and gao found the manual includes activities that go beyond what is statutorily prescribed . working to fully incorporate leading practices into its manual and operations would help the board enhance its accountability , transparency , and effective external communication with stakeholders . gao recommends that the board revise its manual to fully incorporate leading practices , including evaluating its performance , and engage with stakeholders and incorporate their views , as appropriate , on any changes . the board did not state whether it concurred with the recommendation .
