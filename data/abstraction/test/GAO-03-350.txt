some economists predict that by 2030 , the united states could experience a labor shortage of 35 million workers . as the shortage approaches , one option available is to encourage people to work beyond traditional retirement ages , especially because people who are age 55 or older will constitute nearly a third of the poppulation . accordingly , increasing demands will be made on the workforce development system to help ensure that older workers are provided opportunities to help address the anticipated labor shortage . concerned that the existing workforce development system may not meet the needs of older workers , the subcommittee 's ranking minority member asked gao to determine the extent that older workers are enrolled in federal employment and training programs , what services are provided , and how performance measures affect such services . about 12 percent of the 1.3 million older people who were not working and wanted a job were enrolled in these programs between july 2000 and june 2001. some older workers received services without being enrolled in a program but these people were not counted in program statistics . the majority of older people enrolled received subsidized jobs through the senior community service employment program . about one - third participated in programs funded by the workforce investment act and trade adjustment assistance . most of the older workers enrolled in these programs received job search assistance , such as help in preparing for interviews and writing resumes , but some also received job training . research findings have been inconsistent as to whether older workers have distinct learning needs , but workforce investment act program providers are less likely now than in the past to have separate programs for older workers . the workforce investment act requires program providers to report certain information so that labor can determine how well programs are performing . these performance measures include how many participants find jobs and how much their earnings have increased . program providers report that some performance measures provide a disincentive to enrolling older workers into the program because of employment characteristics that may negatively affect program performance . for example , in 6 of 10 the local areas we visited , officials said they considered performance measures a barrier to enrolling older workers seeking part - time jobs because they would have lower earnings and therefore reduce program performance . consequently , some older workers may only receive job search assistance and not have access to in - depth services , such as computer training .
