the chesapeake bay ( the bay ) is the largest estuary in the united states . it is recognized as a `` wetlands of international importance '' by the ramsar convention , a 1971 treaty about the increasing loss and degradation of wetland habitat for migratory waterbirds . the chesapeake bay estuary resides in a more than 64,000-square - mile watershed that extends across parts of delaware , maryland , new york , pennsylvania , virginia , west virginia , and the district of columbia . the bay 's watershed is home to more than 18 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals . a combination of factors has caused the ecosystem functions and natural habitat of the chesapeake bay and its watershed to deteriorate over time . these factors include centuries of land - use changes , increased sediment loads and nutrient pollution , overfishing and overharvesting , the introduction of invasive species , and the spread of toxic contaminants . in response , the bay has experienced reductions in economically important fisheries , such as oysters and crabs ; the loss of habitat , such as underwater vegetation and sea grass ; annual dead zones , as nutrient - driven algal blooms die and decompose ; and potential impacts to tourism , recreation , and real estate values . congress began to address ecosystem degradation in the chesapeake bay in 1965 , when it authorized the first wide - scale study of water resources of the bay . since then , federal restoration activities , conducted by multiple agencies , have focused on reducing pollution entering the chesapeake bay , restoring habitat , managing fisheries , protecting sub - watersheds within the larger bay watershed , and fostering public access and stewardship of the bay . congress has authorized various programs and activities to restore the chesapeake bay , including the chesapeake bay program ( cbp ) , created in 1983. the cbp implements the chesapeake bay agreement , a periodically renewed agreement between executives in the watershed states , a joint bay state legislative body , and select federal agencies that aims to coordinate bay restoration efforts . the most recent agreement was signed in 2014 ( known as the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement ) and set a series of restoration goals and actions to be completed by 2025. the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement , like others in the past , is not binding . other restoration plans — including the 2010 chesapeake bay strategy for protecting and restoring the chesapeake bay watershed ( pursuant to president obama 's 2009 executive order 13508 ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency 's 2010 chesapeake bay total maximum daily load , and a draft comprehensive plan from the u.s. army corps of engineers — harmonize with the goals of the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement and contain objectives for federal agencies and states . as work continues toward the 2025 restoration goals set by state and federal plans , congress may consider what role the federal government plays in chesapeake bay restoration , if any . in considering the federal role in chesapeake bay restoration , congress may weigh issues related to coordination of federal activities and federal agency authority , funding and total cost of activities , and the rate of progress toward restoration .
