this testimony discusses the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993. during the last decade , congress , the office of management and budget , and executive agencies have worked to implement a statutory framework to improve the performance and accountability of the executive branch and to enhance executive branch and congressional decisionmaking . the core of this framework includes financial management legislation , especially gpra . as a result of this framework , there has been substantial progress in the last few years in establishing the basic infrastructure needed to create high - performing federal organizations . the issuance of agencies ' fiscal year 2000 performance reports , in addition to updated strategic plans , annual performance plans , and the governmentwide performance plans , completes two full cycles of annual performance planning and reporting under gpra . however , much work remains before this framework is effectively implemented across the government , including transforming agencies ' organizational cultures to improve decisionmaking and strengthen performance and accountability .
