the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 required the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) to accelerate their exchange of health information and to develop capabilities that allow for interoperability ( generally , the ability of systems to exchange data ) by september 30 , 2009. it also required compliance with federal standards and the establishment of a joint interagency program office to function as a single point of accountability for the effort . further , the act directed gao to semiannually report on the progress made in achieving these requirements . for this fourth report , gao determined the extent to which dod and va developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by september 30 , 2009 , and the interagency program office established by the act is functioning as a single point of accountability . to do so , gao analyzed agency documentation on project status and conducted interviews with agency officials . dod and va previously established six objectives that they identified as necessary for achieving full interoperability ; they have now met the remaining three interoperability objectives that gao previously reported as being partially achieved -- expand questionnaires and self - assessment tools , expand dod 's inpatient medical records system , and demonstrate initial document scanning . as a result of meeting the six objectives , the departments ' officials , including the co - chairs of the group responsible for representing the clinician user community , believe they have satisfied the september 30 , 2009 , requirement for full interoperability . nevertheless , dod and va are planning additional actions to further increase their interoperable capabilities and address clinicians ' evolving needs for interoperable electronic health records . specifically , dod and va plan to meet additional needs that have emerged with respect to social history and physical exam data ; dod plans to further expand the implementation of its inpatient medical records system to sites beyond those achieved as of september 2009 ; and dod and va plan to test the capability to scan documents , in follow - up to their demonstration of an initial document scanning capability . additionally , in response to a presidential announcement , the departments are beginning to plan for the development and implementation of a virtual lifetime electronic record , which is intended to further increase their interoperable capabilities . the interagency program office is not yet positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities . the departments have made progress in setting up their interagency program office by hiring additional staff , including a permanent director . in addition , consistent with gao 's previous recommendations , the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter in the areas of scheduling , planning , and performance measurement . however , the office 's effort in these areas does not fully satisfy the recommendations and are incomplete . specifically , the office does not yet have a schedule that includes information about tasks , resource needs , or relationships between tasks associated with ongoing activities to increase interoperability . also , key it management responsibilities in the areas of planning and performance measurement remain incomplete . among the reasons officials cited for not yet completing a schedule , plan , or performance measures were the office 's need to focus on verifying achievement of the six interoperability objectives and participating in the departments ' efforts to define the virtual lifetime electronic record . nonetheless , if the program office does not fulfill key management responsibilities as gao previously recommended , it may not be positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the delivery of future interoperable capabilities , including the development of the virtual lifetime electronic record .
