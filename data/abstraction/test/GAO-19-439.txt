amid concerns about the ability of dod 's acquisition process to keep pace with evolving threats , congress included numerous reforms in recent national defense authorization acts that could help to streamline acquisition oversight and field capabilities faster . gao was asked to examine dod 's efforts to implement these reforms . this report addresses the progress dod has made implementing selected oversight reforms related to major defense acquisition programs ; how dod has used middle - tier acquisition pathways ; and challenges dod faces related to reform implementation . gao reviewed five reforms : milestone decision authority designation ; cost , fielding , and performance goals ; independent technical risk assessments ; restructuring of acquisition oversight offices ; and middle - tier acquisition . gao analyzed applicable statutes and implementing guidance , collected information from dod about the number and types of middle - tier acquisition programs , reviewed relevant documentation , and interviewed dod officials . the department of defense ( dod ) has made progress in implementing reforms to restructure the oversight of major defense acquisition programs . as a result of one of these reforms , decision - making authority for many programs shifted from the office of the secretary of defense to the military departments ( see figure ) . questions remain about how some reforms gao reviewed will be carried out . for example , no programs have been required to have cost and fielding goals set under dod 's new process yet , and dod has formed a working group to determine when to delegate risk assessments to the military departments . dod also began using new pathways referred to as middle - tier acquisition to rapidly prototype and field new weapon systems . middle - tier programs are expected to field capabilities within 2 to 5 years . as of march 2019 , military departments were using this authority for 35 unclassified programs ( see table ) . source : gao analysis of department of defense data . | gao - 19-439 dod has yet to fully determine how it will oversee middle - tier acquisition programs , including what information should be required to ensure informed decisions about program selection and how to measure program performance . without consistent oversight , dod is not well positioned to ensure that these programs — some of which are multibillion dollar acquisitions — are likely to meet expectations for delivering prototypes or capability to the warfighter quickly . dod also continues to face implementation challenges , including one related to disagreements about oversight roles and responsibilities between the office of the secretary of defense and the military departments . senior dod leadership has not fully addressed these disagreements . as a result , dod is at risk of not achieving an effective balance between oversight and accountability and efficient program management . gao is making four recommendations , including that dod should identify the types of information needed to select and oversee middle - tier acquisition programs consistently , and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the office of the secretary of defense and the military departments for acquisition oversight . dod concurred with gao 's recommendations and described actions planned to address them .
