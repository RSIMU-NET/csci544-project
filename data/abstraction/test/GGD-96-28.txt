pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined : the extent of legalized gaming in the united states ; currency transaction reporting requirements for casinos ; whether the same transaction reporting requirements apply to tribal casinos ; and the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) efforts to ensure that casinos are complying with currency transaction reporting requirements . gao found that : 48 states permit some form of legalized gaming , including riverboat casino gaming and indian gaming ; the amount of cash wagered annually in casinos has grown from $ 117 billion in 1984 to $ 407 billion in 1994 ; the bank secrecy act ( bsa ) requires casinos to report currency transactions over $ 10,000 , obtain additional identifying information about customers opening a line of credit , and develop bsa compliance programs that meet certain requirements ; although nevada casinos report customers that purchase chips in cash amounts over $ 10,000 , they do not report customer identification information on verified winnings over $ 10,000 or cash exchanges involving small denomination bills over $ 2,500 ; tribal casinos are not subject to bsa , but they must report currency transactions in accordance with the internal revenue code ( irc ) provision regarding cash received in a trade or business ; irs has made efforts to educate tribal casino officials on irc reporting requirements to ensure that they are complying with federal regulations ; irs needs to use its enforcement resources to complete compliance reviews of other nonbank financial institutions and to ensure that individuals and businesses are complying with tax laws ; and new bsa regulations will relieve some of the pressure on irs by requiring casinos to take a more active role in ensuring their own compliance with bsa .
