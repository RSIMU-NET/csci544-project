in 2004 , an estimated 35.7 million foreign - born people resided in the united states , and many legitimately have ssns . many of these individuals have social security numbers ( ssns ) which can have a key role in verifying authorization to work in the united states . however , some foreign - born individuals have been given ssns inappropriately . recent legislation , aimed at protecting the ssn and preventing fraud and abuse , changes how the social security administration ( ssa ) assigns numbers and awards benefits for foreign - born individuals . the chairman of the subcommittee on social security asked gao to address two questions . first , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for an ssn ? . second , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for social security benefits ? . ssa determines who is eligible for an ssn by verifying certain immigration documents and determining if an individual 's card requires a work restriction . some foreign - born individuals are eligible for one of three kinds of social security cards depending in part on their immigration status : regular cards , those valid for work only with authorization from the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and those that are not valid for work -- non - work cards . as of 2003 ssa had issued slightly more than 7 million non - work cards to people who need them to receive benefits for which they were otherwise entitled . both ssa 's inspector general and gao have identified weaknesses in ssa procedures for assigning ssns and issuing cards , also known as enumeration . for example , working undercover and posing as parents of newborns , gao investigators were able to obtain social security cards by using counterfeit documents . congress has enacted recent legislation strengthening the ssn enumeration process and documentation requirements . ssa is implementing the law and is improving document verification and now requires third - party verification of noncitizen documents such as birth certificates and visual inspection of documents before issuing an ssn . ssa also continues to strengthen program integrity by , for example , restricting the number of replacement cards . congress and ssa have also improved laws and procedures designed to strengthen program integrity in the payment of benefits to the foreign - born . due to provisions of the social security protection act of 2004 , some foreign - born individuals who were not authorized to work will no longer be eligible for benefits . to be entitled to benefits , the law requires noncitizens originally assigned an ssn after 2003 to have a work - authorized ssn . amendments to the social security act in 1996 require individuals to be lawfully present in the u.s. to receive social security benefits , though some noncitizens can receive benefits while living abroad , such as noncitizens who have worked in the u.s. and in a country with which the u.s. has a totalization agreement . ssa 's totalization agreements coordinate taxation and public pension benefits . the agreements help eliminate dual taxation and social security coverage that multinational employers and employees encounter when workers temporarily reside in a foreign country with its own social security program . successful implementation of these agreements requires the countries involved to carefully coordinate and verify data they exchange . computer matches with foreign countries , for example , may help protect totalization programs from making payments to ineligible individuals . ssa is exploring options for undertaking such exchanges .
