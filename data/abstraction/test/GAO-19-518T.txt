according to fema — a component within dhs — the 2017 disasters affected 47 million people , or about 15 percent of the nation 's population . federal contracts have played a key role in responding to these disasters and in long - term community recovery . so far , fema has obligated billions of dollars on these contracts . this testimony is based primarily on gao 's recent reports on disaster contracting — specifically advance contracting and post - disaster contracts related to the 2017 disasters — which detail much of fema 's disaster contracting activities . it addresses key challenges fema faced contracting for goods and services in response to these disasters . to conduct this work , gao analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation through june 30 , 2018 , the latest and most complete data available for the 2017 disasters . gao also analyzed fema guidance and documentation and interviewed fema officials to discuss the use of contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters . following hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , and the 2017 california wildfires , federal agencies entered into disaster - related contracts worth about $ 9.5 billion , according to data as of june 30 , 2018 — the latest and most complete data at the time of gao 's review ( see figure ) . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) obligated about $ 2.9 billion of this total through advance contracts , which it establishes prior to a disaster to rapidly mobilize resources . fema obligated an additional $ 1.6 billion through post - disaster contracts , which are established after disasters hit . in its december 2018 and april 2019 reports , gao made 10 recommendations to strengthen fema 's ability to address challenges gao identified in how fema plans , coordinates , and tracks its contracts : planning : fema has an outdated strategy and unclear guidance on how contracting officers should use advance contracts and has not fully assessed its contracting workforce needs . effectively planning its contract use is critical to fema quickly providing critical goods and services . coordination : fema did not fully coordinate with states and localities on certain contracts and encountered communication and coordination challenges with other federal agencies . effective coordination helps fema ensure stakeholders have the tools needed to facilitate their disaster response efforts . tracking : the full extent of 2017 disaster contracting activities , for fema and other agencies , is unknown . gao found that codes used to track obligations for these disasters in a federal procurement data system were closed without full consideration of user needs or due to inconsistent implementation of criteria established by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and other agencies , limiting visibility over federal disaster contracts . gao has made a total of 19 recommendations — most of which were to fema — related to contracting activities in response to the 2017 disasters . ten of these are described in this statement . dhs concurred with most of these recommendations , and has some actions underway , but it has not fully implemented them . attention to these recommendations can assist fema as it uses contracts to respond to future disasters .
