indian tribes and their members hold considerable energy resources and may use these resources to provide economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities . however , gao and others have found that indian energy development is hindered by several factors , such as a complex regulatory framework , bia workforce challenges , and limited access to energy markets . tribes and their members determine how to use their energy resources . in doing so , they work with multiple federal agencies with various roles in the development process — including a regulatory role , a role as provider of technical and financial assistance , or as a purchaser of energy . gao was asked to evaluate issues related to indian energy development . this report examines , among other things , federal efforts to help overcome factors that hinder development , bia 's efforts to address workforce challenges , and federal efforts to implement a preference authority to purchase energy from tribes . gao analyzed federal data and documents and interviewed tribal and federal officials . two key federal initiatives led by the department of the interior ( interior ) — the interagency white house council on native american affairs ' energy subgroup ( energy subgroup ) and interior 's indian energy service center ( service center ) — were implemented to help improve collaboration and the effectiveness of federal efforts to fulfill management responsibilities for indian lands , assist tribes in developing their energy resources , and overcome any related challenges . however , the energy subgroup and the service center have not incorporated leading collaborative practices , which may limit the effectiveness of these initiatives to address the factors that hinder indian energy development . for example , gao found the following : energy subgroup : participating agencies have dedicated few staff and financial resources to the subgroup and have not identified resources needed or a funding model — a leading practice to sustain collaborative efforts . some participating agency officials noted that the effectiveness of the subgroup is limited without dedicated resources . they also stated that key activities completed to date by the subgroup are the result of agencies voluntarily applying budgetary resources to specific activities . without dedicated resources and a funding model to support its activities , the extent to which the energy subgroup will be able to effectively accomplish its goals is unclear . service center : interior has recognized the need for collaboration in the regulatory process and described the service center as a central point of collaboration for permitting that will break down barriers between federal agencies . however , some regulatory agencies , such as the fish and wildlife service , the environmental protection agency , and the u.s. army corps of engineers have not been included as participants . without the involvement of key regulatory agencies , the service center will be limited in its ability to improve efficiencies in the regulatory process for indian energy development . gao and others have previously reported that interior 's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) has longstanding workforce challenges that have hindered indian energy development . in this review , gao found that bia has high vacancy rates at some agency offices and that the agency has not conducted key workforce planning activities , such as an assessment of work skills gaps . these workforce issues further contribute to bia 's inability to effectively support indian energy development . federal internal control standards recommend agencies identify the key skills and competencies their workforces need to achieve their goals and assess any skills gaps . until bia undertakes such activities , it can not ensure that it has a workforce with the right skills , appropriately aligned to meet the agency 's goals and tribal priorities . a provision in the energy policy act of 2005 authorizes the federal government , the largest single consumer of energy in the nation , to give preference to tribes for purchases of electricity or other energy products . however , the general services administration ( gsa ) , the federal agency with primary responsibility for purchasing energy , has not developed guidance to implement this provision government - wide ; doing so could help to increase tribal access to the federal government 's energy purchasing programs . gao is making 10 recommendations , including that the secretary of the interior identify resources and a funding model for the energy subgroup , involve other agencies in the service center so it is a single point of contact for the regulatory process , and require bia to undertake workforce planning activities . gao is also recommending that the administrator of the gsa develop implementing guidance relating to purchasing energy from tribes . interior , doe , and gsa concurred with gao 's recommendations .
