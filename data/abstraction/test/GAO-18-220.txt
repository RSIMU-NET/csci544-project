demonstrations — which represented roughly a third of the more than $ 300 billion in federal medicaid spending in 2015 — are a powerful tool to test new approaches to providing coverage and delivering medicaid services that could reduce costs and improve beneficiaries ' outcomes . evaluations are essential to determining whether demonstrations are having their intended effects . states are required to evaluate their demonstrations and cms can initiate its own federal evaluations of demonstrations . gao was asked to examine evaluations of demonstrations , including how the results have been used to inform medicaid policy . this report examines state - led evaluations and federal evaluations . gao reviewed evaluation documentation for eight states with high demonstration expenditures that varied in the number of years their demonstrations had been in effect and by geography . gao also reviewed documentation for the ongoing federal evaluations and interviewed state and federal medicaid officials . gao assessed evaluation practices against federal standards for internal control and leading evaluation guidelines . under section 1115 of the social security act , the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) may approve medicaid demonstrations to allow states to test new approaches to providing coverage and for delivering services that can transform large portions of states ' programs . however , gao found that selected states ' evaluations of these demonstrations often had significant limitations that affected their usefulness in informing policy decisions . the limitations included gaps in reported evaluation results for important parts of the demonstrations . ( see table . ) . these gaps resulted , in part , from hhs 's centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) requiring final , comprehensive evaluation reports after the expiration of the demonstrations rather than at the end of each 3- to 5-year demonstration cycle . cms has taken a number of steps since 2014 to improve the quality of state - led evaluations , and in october 2017 , officials stated that the agency planned to require final reports at the end of each demonstration cycle for all demonstrations . however , the agency has not established written procedures for implementing such requirements , which could allow for gaps to continue . cms also plans to allow states to conduct less rigorous evaluations for certain types of demonstrations but has not established criteria defining under what conditions limited evaluations would be allowed . federal evaluations led by cms have also been limited due to data challenges that have affected the progress and scope of the work . for example , delays obtaining data directly from states , among other things , led cms to considerably reduce the scope of a large , multi - state evaluation , which was initiated in 2014 to examine the impact of state demonstrations in four policy areas deemed to be federal priorities . though cms has made progress in obtaining needed data , it is uncertain when results from the multi - state and other federal evaluations will be available to policymakers because cms has no policy for making results public . by not making these results public in a timely manner , cms is missing an opportunity to inform important federal and state policy discussions . gao recommends that cms : establish written procedures for requiring final evaluation reports at the end of each demonstration cycle , issue criteria for when it will allow limited evaluations of demonstrations , and establish a policy for publicly releasing findings from federal evaluations of demonstrations . hhs concurred with these recommendations .
