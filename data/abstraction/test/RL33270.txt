the bush administration has proposed eliminating the section 8 housing choice voucher program and replacing it with a new program in each of the past several years . while the specifics have changed , each proposal would significantly alter key features of the current program , including its administration , funding distribution , tenant contributions toward rent , initial and ongoing eligibility of families , and the eligible uses of program funds . the first proposal was referenced in the president 's fy2004 budget request and was later introduced in the 108th congress ( h.r . 1841 / s . 947 ) . called the housing assistance for needy families act of 2003 , it would have created a new block grant administered by states — rather than the local public housing authorities ( phas ) that administer the current program — and eliminated many of the current rules governing the program . hearings were held on the legislation , although no further action was taken . language to enact the second proposal , called the flexible voucher program ( fvp ) , was included in the administrative provisions section of the president 's fy2005 budget request . under the fvp , phas would have retained administration of the new grant program , although most of the federal section 8 voucher rules and regulations would have been eliminated . the appropriations committees did not include the language in their versions , nor the final version , of the fy2005 hud budget , and authorizing legislation was not introduced before the close of the 108th congress . the president 's fy2006 budget request again called for enactment of a flexible voucher program . during the first session of the 109th congress , a modified version of the fvp was included as title i of the state and local housing flexibility act of 2005 ( h.r . 1999 / s . 771 ) . the president 's fy2007 budget request reiterated the administration 's support for the bill . the house financial services committee held hearings on the bill , although no further action was taken before the close of the 109th congress . in the second session of the 109th congress , the house financial services committee approved a bipartisan section 8 voucher reform bill , the section 8 voucher reform act of 2006 ( h.r . 5443 ) . while notably narrower in scope than the president 's reform proposals , it would have represented the first major reform of the program since the quality housing and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1998 ( p.l . 105-276 ) . it was not enacted before the close of the 109th congress . this report includes a table comparing the key features of the reform proposals from the 109th congress . it will not be updated .
