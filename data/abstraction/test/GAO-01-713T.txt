medicare provides valuable and extensive health care coverage for beneficiaries . nevertheless , significant gaps leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out - of - pocket expenses . medigap is a widely available source of supplemental coverage . this testimony discusses beneficiaries ' potential financial liability under medicare 's current benefit structure and cost - sharing requirements , the cost of medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage , and concerns that medigap 's so - called `` first dollar '' coverage undermines the cost control incentives of medicare 's cost - sharing requirements . gao found that medicare 's benefits package and cost - sharing requirements leave beneficiaries liable for high out - of - pocket costs . medigap policies pay for some or all medicare cost - sharing requirements but do not fully protect beneficiaries from potentially significant out - of - pocket costs such as prescription drug coverage . medigap first - dollar coverage eliminates the ability of medicare 's cost - sharing requirements to promote prudent use of services .
