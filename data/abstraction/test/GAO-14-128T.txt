as part of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , fps is responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 9,600 federal facilities under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) . recent incidents at federal facilities demonstrate their continued vulnerability to attacks or other acts of violence . to help accomplish its mission , fps conducts facility risk assessments and provides oversight of approximately 13,500 contract security guards deployed to federal facilities . this testimony is based on the results of our september 2013 report ( released by the subcommittee today ) , previous reports , and preliminary results of work gao conducted for a report that gao plans to issue to the chairman later this year . gao discusses challenges fps faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and the extent to which fps and select federal agencies ' facility risk assessment methodologies align with standards issued by the isc . to perform this work , gao reviewed fps and guard company documentation and interviewed officials about oversight of guards . gao also reviewed fps 's and eight federal agencies ' risk assessment documentation and compared it to isc 's standards . these agencies were selected based on their missions and types of facilities . the federal protective service ( fps ) faces challenges ensuring that contract guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities around the country . in a september 2013 report , gao found that providing active - shooter - response and screener training is a challenge for fps . for example , according to officials at five guard companies , their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active - shooter . without ensuring that all guards receive this training , fps has limited assurance that its guards are prepared for such a threat . similarly , officials from one of fps 's contract guard companies stated that 133 ( about 38 percent ) of its approximately 350 guards have never received screener training . as a result , those guards may be using x - ray and magnetometer equipment at federal facilities that they are not qualified to use , raising questions about their ability to properly screen access control points at federal facilities -- one of their primary responsibilities . we were unable to determine the extent to which fps 's guards have received active - shooter - response and screener training . fps agreed with gao 's 2013 recommendation that they take steps to identify guards that have not had required training and provide it to them . gao also found that fps continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements . for instance , although fps agreed with gao 's 2010 and 2012 recommendations that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards ' training , certifications , and qualifications , it still does not have such a system . additionally , 23 percent of the 276 guard files gao examined ( maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies we interviewed ) lacked required training and certification documentation . examples of missing items include documentation of initial weapons and screener training and firearms qualifications . gao 's preliminary results indicate that several agencies , including fps , do not use a methodology to assess risk at their facilities that aligns with the interagency security committee 's ( isc ) risk assessment standards . risk assessments help decision - makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures to mitigate the risk . isc 's standards state that agencies ' facility risk assessment methodologies must : 1 ) consider all of the undesirable events identified by isc as possible risks to federal facilities , and 2 ) assess the threat , vulnerability , and consequence of specific undesirable events . most commonly , agencies ' methodologies that gao reviewed are inconsistent with isc 's standards because they do not assess facilities ' vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events . if an agency does not know its facilities ' potential vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events , it can not set priorities to mitigate these vulnerabilities . in addition , as gao reported in august 2012 , although federal agencies pay fps millions of dollars to assess risk at their facilities , fps 's risk assessment tool is not consistent with isc 's risk assessment standards because it does not assess consequence ( i.e . , the level , duration , and nature of loss resulting from undesirable events ) . as a result , fps and the other non - compliant agencies gao reviewed may not have a complete understanding of the risks facing approximately 57,000 federal facilities located around the country ( including the 9,600 protected by fps ) . dhs and fps agreed with gao 's recommendations in its september 2013 report .
