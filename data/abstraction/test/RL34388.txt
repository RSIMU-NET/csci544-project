as the u.s. constitution has been interpreted , states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare . however , congress provides significant federal funds to help states exercise this responsibility ( $ 7.9 billion appropriated in fy2008 ) . most of this support is provided for children who are in foster care and who meet specific federal eligibility criteria . this report discusses the federal framework for child welfare policy ; reviews the scope of activities , and children and families served , by state child welfare agencies ; summarizes several child welfare - related hearings that were held in 2007 ; describes child welfare and related legislative proposals that have been introduced in the 110th congress ; and reviews child welfare programs for which funding authorization has expired or is set to expire on the last day of fy2008 . child welfare agencies seek to ensure the well - being of children and their families , including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have a safe and permanent home . in fy2006 child protection agencies found 905,000 children to be victims of abuse or neglect . some of these children were removed to foster care , some remained in their homes and received services , while others received no further follow - up from the agency . after reaching a recorded high of 567,000 on the last day of fy1999 , the number of children in foster care has declined by about 10 % , and on the last day of fy2006 , an estimated 510,000 children were in foster care . less than half of these children are eligible for federal foster care support under title iv - e of the social security act . legislation that would respond to a number of the concerns raised in 2007 child welfare hearings has been introduced in the 110th congress . these proposals would expand the eligible populations served with title iv - e funds to include ( potentially ) all children in foster care or adopted ( with special needs ) from foster care ( h.r . 5466 , h.r . 4207 , s. 2900 , s. 1462 , h.r . 4091 , and s. 3038 ) , as well as children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with a relative ( s. 661 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 5466 , and s. 3038 ) , and youth who choose to remain in foster care until their 21st birthday ( s. 1512 , h.r . 4208 , s. 2560 , and h.r . 5466 ) . other introduced proposals would authorize additional support for child and family services ( h.r . 5466 and s. 2237 ) ; authorize or require new services or protections for children in , or about to enter , foster care ( h.r . 3283 , s. 379 , s. 382 , h.r . 687 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; seek to improve services for youth who have , or are expected to , age out of care ( s. 2341 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 4208 / s . 2560 , and h.r . 3409 ) ; help support or permit access to services for kinship caregivers and further encourage their use as caregivers ( s. 661 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 5645 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; provide new support for training or other related efforts to improve the child welfare workforce ( h.r . 5466 , h.r . 2314 and s. 2944 ) ; aim to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts ( s. 2395 and h.r . 4198 ) ; permit direct access to federal title iv - e funds for tribal governments ( s. 1956 , h.r . 4688 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; and make other related changes intended to enhance the welfare of children , including requiring states to have licensing standards for certain residential programs for youth with emotional or behavioral issues ( h.r . 5876 ) , and expanding or making permanent the current adoption tax credit rules ( h.r . 273 , h.r . 471 , s. 561 , h.r . 1074 , h.r . 3192 , and h.r . 4313 ) . this report will be updated as legislative activity occurs .
