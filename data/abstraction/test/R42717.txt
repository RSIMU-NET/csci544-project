according to a 2012 report released by the world health organization ( who ) and the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , roughly 780 million people around the world lack access to clean drinking water and an estimated 2.5 billion people ( roughly 40 % of the world 's population ) are without access to safe sanitation facilities . the united states has long supported efforts to improve global access to clean water , sanitation , and hygiene ( wash ) . in 2000 , for example , the united states signed on to the millennium development goals , one of which includes a target to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. in 2002 , the united states also participated in the 2002 world summit on sustainable development , which emphasized the need to address limited access to clean water and sanitation among the world 's poor . the 109th congress enacted legislation to advance these global goals through the senator paul simon water for the poor act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-121 [ water for the poor act ] ) . in march 2012 , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) announced that it had joined the sanitation and water for all partnership â€” a coalition of governments , donors , civil society and development groups committed to advancing sustainable access to clean drinking water and sanitation . congressional support for the act was motivated , in part , by calls to augment funding for wash programs and improve the integration of wash activities into broader u.s. foreign aid objectives and programs , as well as global health efforts . the act called for usaid to bolster support for wash programs , further synthesize wash activities into global health programs , and contribute to global goals to halve the proportion of people without access to clean water and sanitation by 2015. in the 111th congress , the senator paul simon water for the world act of 2010 was introduced , but not enacted . that bill would have amended the water for the poor act and addressed several concerns observers raised regarding the water for the poor act , particularly by creating senior leadership within usaid to address water and sanitation issues , assessing u.s. water and sanitation programs , and strengthening reporting requirements . a new bill , introduced in the 112th congress as the proposed water for the world act ( s. 641 ) , awaits action by the senate committee on foreign relations . several agencies contribute to u.s. efforts to improve global access to clean drinking water and sanitation , of which programs implemented by the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) and usaid make up roughly 90 % . in fy2010 , for example , the united states invested $ 953 million on water and sanitation programs worldwide , including $ 898 million provided by usaid and mcc . appropriations for water projects are provided to usaid annually , while mcc receives multi - year funding for its country compacts that include support for water projects . as such , spending by mcc on water projects may vary significantly from year to year and may not be requested annually . the president requested $ 302 million for usaid 's water activities for fy2012 and congress appropriated not less than $ 315 million for international water and sanitation programs through the fy2012 consolidated appropriations . the fy2013 request for usaid 's water and sanitation efforts was slightly lower at $ 299.1 million . this report addresses congressional efforts to address limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation , outlines related programs implemented by usaid and mcc , and analyzes issues related to u.s. and international drinking water and sanitation programs that the 112th congress might consider .
