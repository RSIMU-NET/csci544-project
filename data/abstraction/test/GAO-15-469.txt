gao has reported extensively on problems in cost , schedule , and performance for major defense acquisition programs . according to some acquisition reform advocates , expanding the role of the military service chiefs in the process to acquire weapon systems may improve acquisition outcomes . following a 2014 gao report on the service chiefs ' role in the acquisition chain of command , gao was asked to review further related issues and concerns the service chiefs have with the acquisition process and its outcomes . this report examines : the views of current and former military service chiefs on the acquisition process , and key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and gao 's assessment of these issues . gao conducted interviews with 12 current and former military service chiefs and vice chiefs , and with other current and former dod leadership to discuss the acquisition process . gao also drew upon its extensive body of work on defense acquisitions and best practices . to assess key problems with the current process , gao reviewed program execution information on all 78 current major defense programs . most current and former military service chiefs and vice chiefs gao interviewed from the army , air force , navy , and marine corps collectively expressed dissatisfaction with acquisition program outcomes and believed that the department of defense 's ( dod ) requirements development and acquisition processes need to be better integrated . the service chiefs are largely responsible for developing the services ' requirements for weapon systems , while the service acquisition executives are responsible for overseeing programs to plan and develop systems . most service chiefs told gao they were concerned that after weapon system requirements are handed to the acquisition process , requirements are changed or added by the acquisition community ( sometimes referred to as “ creep ” ) , increasing the capabilities and cost of the system . some service chiefs stated that they are not always involved in the acquisition process and are frequently caught by surprise when cost , schedule , and performance problems emerge in programs . current and former chiefs agreed that the chiefs should be more involved in programs , but their views varied on how best to achieve this . gao analyzed requirements for all 78 major defense acquisition programs and found that creep — or growth — in the high - level requirements is rare . instead , it is after a program has formally started development that the myriad lower - level , technical requirements needed to complete a weapon system 's design are defined ( see figure ) . it is the definition of these requirements — most of which occurs after the service chiefs ' primary involvement — that leads to the realization that much more time and resources are needed to build the weapon system . the process of systems engineering translates high - level requirements , such as range , into specifics , like fuel tank size . gao has previously reported on the importance of conducting systems engineering early so that the consequences of high - level requirements can be confronted before a program starts . when gao presented its analysis of the problem to the service chiefs , they generally agreed with it . several noted that trade - offs informed by systems engineering must take place before programs start so that requirements are better defined and more realistic cost , schedule , and performance commitments can be made . gao recommends that dod ensure sufficient systems engineering is conducted to better define requirements and assess resource trade - offs before a program starts . dod concurred with the recommendations , citing recent policy changes . gao believes more focus is needed on implementing actions .
