pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the sales practices for over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives , mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) , and structured notes , focusing on the : federal sales practice requirements applicable to these products and the dealers marketing them ; extent of end - user satisfaction with sales practice , product use , and related disputes and the costs of these disputes ; views of end - users and dealers on the nature of their relationship and responsibilities ; actions dealers and end - users have taken to reduce the potential for sales practice disputes ; and actions regulators have taken to address sales practice issues . gao noted that : the extent to which otc derivatives are subject to federal sales practice requirements intended to protect end - users varies , depending , in part , on whether they are considered to be securities , futures , or neither ; when they are considered to be securities or futures , their sale is covered by the federal securities or commodities laws , and they are regulated by the securities exchange commission ( sec ) and the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , respectively ; to the extent that these products are not securities or futures , end - users with sales practice disputes would need to seek redress against a dealer by asserting primarily state statutory or common law claims ; in contrast to most otc derivatives , mbs and structured notes are typically securities and , thereby , subject to the federal securities laws , except when exempted from specific provisions ; the extent to which sales practice requirements apply to the dealers marketing otc derivatives in the united states also varies , depending on whether the dealer offering them is regulated ; when otc derivatives are marketed by banks , they are subject to supervisory guidance issued by federal bank regulators ; securities , futures , and insurance firms , unlike banks , typically market otc derivatives that they consider to be neither securities nor futures from affiliates that are not subject to any direct federal financial regulatory oversight , although some individual transactions may be subject to such oversight ; although sales practice requirements vary by product and dealer , according to gao 's survey , most end - users were generally satisfied with the sales practices of the dealers with whom they entered transactions ; gao 's survey also found that relatively few organizations reported using otc derivatives ; gao 's review of regulatory and public records , covering 1993 through 1996 , indicated that cases involving actual or alleged deficiencies in dealer sales practices were limited in number ; however , the dealers and end - users involved in these cases often experienced significant costs ; although generally satisfied with dealer sales practices , end - users ' views on the nature of counterparty relationships sometimes differed from those of dealers ; in addition , bank regulators have taken certain actions to address sales practice issues ; and although sec and cftc do not directly regulate the affiliates that securities and futures firms use to conduct their otc derivatives activities , sec and cftc worked with the most active of these firms to produce one of two sets of voluntary guidance .
