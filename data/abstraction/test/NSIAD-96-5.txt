pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the air force 's management of its reparable parts inventory , focusing on : commercial airline industry practices to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service ; air force reengineering efforts to improve its logistics system and reduce costs ; and barriers to the air force 's reengineering efforts . gao found that : the commercial airline industry , including certain manufacturers , suppliers , and airlines , are using leading - edge practices to improve logistics operations and reduce costs ; in recognition of increasing budgetary pressures , the changing global threat , and the need for radical improvements in its logistics system , the air force has begun a reengineering program aimed at redesigning its logistics operations ; gao has urged these changes and supports them , and has identified additional private - sector practices that may result in even greater savings ; there are several major barriers to bringing about change that must be addressed and resolved if the air force is to reengineer its logistics system and save billions of dollars ; the air force reengineering effort addresses inherent problems with its logistics system , but additional steps can be taken to maximize potential improvements ; additional steps gao identified that could enhance this program include establishing a top - level dod champion of change to support the air force initiatives , greater use of third - party logistics services , closer partnerships with suppliers , encouraging suppliers to use local distribution centers , centralizing repair functions , and modifying repair facilities to accommodate these new practices ; the success of the air force in achieving a quantum leap in system improvements hinges on its ability to address and overcome certain barriers , such as inherent organizational resistance to change ; top - level dod officials must be supportive of and engaged in air force reengineering efforts to remove these barriers and drive success ; information systems do not always provide air force managers and employees with accurate , real - time data on the cost , amount , location , condition , and usage of inventory ; and without the support of top - level dod management and accurate , real - time inventory information , the expansion of the air force 's reengineering efforts could be seriously impaired .
