thirty - five years of experience implementing and enforcing the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to tsca 's core provisions . stakeholders appear to agree that tsca needs to be updated , although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions . s. 847 in the 112th congress legislation would amend core provisions of tsca title i. this report compares key provisions of s. 847 , as introduced , with current law ( 15 u.s.c . 2601 et seq . ) . generally , s. 847 would increase the amount of information about chemical toxicity and usage that chemical manufacturers and processors would be required to submit to the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) , and would facilitate epa regulation of toxic chemicals . the bill directs epa to establish , by rule , varied or tiered minimum data set requirements for different chemical substances or categories of substances . data would be required from chemical manufacturers and processors for all chemicals within five years of the date of enactment of s. 847 , earlier for high - priority chemicals . all chemicals already in commerce are to be placed on a list and prioritized by epa into three groups based on the need for risk management . a chemical must be included in the highest priority class if it `` is , or is degraded and metabolized into , a persistent , bioaccumulative , and toxic substance with the potential for widespread exposure to humans or other organisms . . epa is required to determine whether chemicals in the top two priority classes , as well as all new chemicals , meet a stringent new safety standard , given the imposition of any needed restrictions on manufacture , processing , distribution , use , or disposal . the bill would prohibit any activities with respect to an evaluated chemical substance that the epa had not specifically allowed in the safety standard determination . in contrast , current law authorizes data collection from manufacturers only if exposure is expected to be substantial or if epa determines that a chemical may pose an unreasonable risk . tsca as currently written allows all chemicals to enter and remain in commerce unless epa can show that a chemical poses `` an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment . . epa then must regulate to control unreasonable risk , but only to the extent necessary using the `` least burdensome '' means of available control . this tsca standard has been interpreted to require cost - benefit balancing . s. 847 also would add new sections to tsca . of particular significance is a section authorizing actions that would allow u.s. implementation of three international agreements , which the united states has signed but not yet ratified . other new sections would provide authority for epa to support research in so - called `` green '' engineering and chemistry , promote alternatives to toxicity testing on animals , encourage research on children 's environmental health , and require biomonitoring of pregnant women and infants . a `` hot spots '' provision would require epa to identify locations where residents are disproportionately exposed to pollution and to develop strategies for reducing their risks . key provisions of s. 847 are compared with current law in tables 1 through 6 .
