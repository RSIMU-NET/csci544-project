the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventions and administers the registration of trademarks . it also assists other federal departments and agencies protect american intellectual property in the international marketplace . the uspto is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as `` offsetting collections '' and subject to spending limits established by the committee on appropriations . until recently , appropriation measures limited uspto use of all fees accumulated within a fiscal year . critics of this approach argued that because agency operations are supported by payments for services , all fees were necessary to fund these services in the year they were provided . some experts claimed that a portion of the patent and trademark collections were used to offset the cost of other , non - related programs . proponents of limiting use of funds collected maintained that the fees appropriated back to the uspto were sufficient to cover the agency 's operating budget . on december 9 , 2016 , president obama signed into law the further continuing and security assistance , appropriations act of 2017 ( p.l . 114-254 ) . this act , among other provisions , continues uspto 's budget supported by patent fees at $ 3.231 billion . for fy2017 , the administration 's request for a fee - based budget authority was $ 3.244 billion . p.l . 112-29 , the leahy - smith america invents act , keeps the use of fees collected within the congressional appropriations process , but requires that fees generated above the budget authority provided by the committee on appropriations be placed in a separate fund within the department of the treasury . while use of these `` excess '' funds still remains under the control of the appropriators , they may only be used for the work of the uspto .
