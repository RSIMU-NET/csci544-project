energy is crucial to the operation of a modern industrial and services economy . concerns about the availability and cost of energy and about environmental impacts of fossil energy use have led to the establishment of a wide variety of federal incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency . these incentives are aimed at the implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and the development and commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies . many of the existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have authorizations tracing back to the 1970s . many of the programs have been reauthorized and redesigned repeatedly to meet changing economic factors . the programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia , and from state and local governments to rural communities . since 2005 , congress has enacted several major energy laws : the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ; p.l . 109-58 ) ; the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ; p.l . 110-140 ) ; the energy improvement and extension act ( eiea ) , enacted as division b of the emergency economic stabilization act ( eesa ; p.l . 110-343 ) ; and the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) . each of those laws established , expanded , or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment ( rdd & d ) programs . the department of energy ( doe ) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs . the department of the treasury and the department of agriculture ( usda ) operate several programs . a few programs can also be found among the departments of the interior ( doi ) , labor ( dol ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) . this report describes federal programs that provide grants , loans , loan guarantees , and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency , energy conservation , and renewable energy . for each program , the report provides the administering agency , authorizing statute ( s ) , annual funding , and the program expiration date . the appendixes provide summary information in a tabular format and also list recently expired programs .
