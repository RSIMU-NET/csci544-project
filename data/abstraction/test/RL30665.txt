the majority leader in the contemporary house is second - in - command behind the speaker of the majority party . typically , the majority leader functions as the speaker 's chief lieutenant or `` field commander '' for day - to - day management of the floor . although the majority leader 's duties are not especially well - defined , they have evolved to the point where it is possible to spotlight two fundamental and often interlocking responsibilities that orient the majority leader 's work : institutional and party . from an institutional perspective , the majority leader has a number of duties . scheduling floor business is a prime responsibility of the majority leader . although scheduling the house 's business is a collective activity of the majority party , the majority leader has a large say in shaping the chamber 's overall agenda and in determining when , whether , how , or in what order legislation is taken up . in addition , the majority leader is active in constructing winning coalitions for the party 's legislative priorities ; acting as a public spokesman â€” defending and explaining the party 's program and agenda ; serving as an emissary to the white house , especially when the president is of the same party ; and facilitating the orderly conduct of the house 's business . from a party perspective , three key activities undergird the majority leader 's principal goal of trying to ensure that the party remains in control of the house . first , the majority leader assists in the reelection campaigns of party incumbents by , for example , raising campaign funds and traveling to scores of house districts to campaign either with incumbents or challengers of the party . second , the majority leader promotes the party 's agenda by developing themes and issues important to core supporters in the electorate . third , the majority leader encourages party cohesion by , for instance , working to minimize internal factional disagreements that may undermine the majority party 's ability to govern the house .
