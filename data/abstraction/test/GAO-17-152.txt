as the lead federal agency charged with securing u.s. borders , the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) cbp has employed a variety of technologies and assets to assist with its border security efforts . in support of its mission , cbp operates a fleet of remotely piloted predator b uas and uses aerostats , including tactical aerostats and tars . gao was asked to review cbp 's use of uas and aerostats for border security . this report addresses the following questions : how does cbp use uas and aerostats for border security activities , and to what extent has cbp developed and documented procedures for uas coordination ? . and to what extent has cbp taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its uas and aerostats for border security activities ? . gao reviewed cbp documents ; analyzed predator b uas , tactical aerostat , and tars data on use and effectiveness from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 ; interviewed field and headquarters officials ; and conducted site visits to observe cbp 's use of uas and aerostats along u.s. borders . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) uses predator b unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) for a variety of border security activities but could benefit from documented coordination procedures in all operating locations . cbp uses its predator b uas to support a variety of efforts , such as missions to support investigations in collaboration with other government agencies ( e.g . , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ) and to locate individuals illegally crossing the border . gao found that cbp established various mechanisms to coordinate with other agencies for predator b missions but did not develop and document coordination procedures in two of its three operational centers . without documented coordination procedures in all operating locations consistent with internal control standards , cbp does not have reasonable assurance that practices in all operating locations align with existing policies and procedures for joint operations with other federal and non - federal government agencies . cbp uses aerostats — unmanned buoyant craft tethered to the ground and equipped with video surveillance cameras and radar technology — to support its border security activities along the southern u.s. border . in south texas , the u.s. border patrol ( border patrol ) uses relocatable tactical aerostats equipped with video surveillance technology to locate and support the interdiction of cross - border illegal activity . at eight fixed sites across the southern u.s. border and in puerto rico , cbp uses the tethered aerostat radar system ( tars ) program to support its efforts to detect occurrences of illegal aircraft and maritime vessel border incursions . cbp has taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its uas and aerostats for border security , but could improve its data collection . cbp collects a variety of data on its use of predator b uas , tactical aerostats , and tars including data on their support for the apprehension of individuals , seizure of drugs , and other events ( asset assists ) . for predator b uas , gao found mission data — such as the names of supported agencies and asset assists for seizures of narcotics — was not recorded consistently across all operational centers , limiting cbp 's ability to assess the effectiveness of the program . cbp has not updated its guidance for collecting and recording mission information in its data collection system to include new data elements added since 2014 , and it does not have instructions for recording mission information such as asset assists . in addition , not all users of cbp 's system have received training for recording mission information . updating guidance and fully training users , consistent with internal control standards , would help cbp better ensure the quality of data it uses to assess effectiveness . for tactical aerostats , gao found that border patrol collection of asset assist information for seizures and apprehensions does not distinguish between its tactical aerostats and tars . consistent with internal control standards , data that distinguishes between support provided by tactical aerostats and support provided by tars would help cbp collect better and more complete information and guide resource allocation decisions , such as the re - deployment of tactical aerostat sites based on changes in cross - border illegal activity . gao is making five recommendations , including that cbp document coordination procedures for predator b operations in all operating locations , update guidance and implement training for collection of predator b mission data , and update border patrol 's data collection practices for aerostat asset assists . cbp concurred and identified planned actions to address the recommendations .
