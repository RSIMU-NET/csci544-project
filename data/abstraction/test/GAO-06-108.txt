following major welfare reform in 1996 , the number of families receiving cash assistance was cut in half to 2 million . while many former recipients now rely more on their earnings , they often work at low - wage jobs with limited benefits and advancement opportunities . to better understand how to help these individuals and their families attain economic self - sufficiency , gao is reporting on strategies designed to increase income for tanf recipients through employment ; the key factors related to implementing and operating such strategies ; and actions the department of health and human services ( hhs ) has taken to facilitate the use of these strategies . gao consulted experts to gather information about promising strategies and visited 26 programs . based on interviews with experts and site visits , we identified four strategies that aimed to increase incomes for recipients of temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) -- training , post - secondary education , self - employment , and financial asset building . training strategies often targeted services to particular groups or job market needs . other programs used post - secondary education to position clients for higher - wage jobs . some programs we visited gave participants the tools to run their own businesses as a way out of poverty . finally , asset building strategies aim to help clients save and invest money to pursue career goals and support their families . the 26 programs we visited used one or more of these strategies . a broad network of local non - profits , state and local tanf offices , employers , and community colleges is key to operating these strategies . some of the programs we visited were non - profits under contract with the tanf office . others relied on a mix of public and private funds , some because of concerns that tanf 's emphasis on work was a barrier to providing education and training options . state and local tanf offices , for their part , sometimes set policies and provide additional funding to encourage the strategies discussed in this report . local non - profits and tanf agencies either directly provided or helped link clients to supplemental services such as child care , housing , on - the - job support , and transportation . as part of the broader network , local non - profits and tanf offices often forged links with employers and community colleges to leverage additional resources for their clients , including training curricula , career ladders , and work opportunities . hhs is supporting these strategies through research , targeted grants , and technical assistance . efforts by other federal agencies , such as the departments of education and labor , also support some of the strategies discussed in this report . hhs has several research projects focused on helping low - income individuals find higher - wage employment and build their assets . while these efforts are important , more needs to be known about the effectiveness of specific strategies , such as those identified in this report , in increasing tanf recipients ' earnings capacity . in addition to the tanf block grant , hhs has two small grant programs that support employment and asset - building strategies . while hhs has provided some technical assistance to facilitate the use of these strategies , it is not clear whether service providers understand ways they can incorporate education and training in a work - focused welfare system . furthermore , hhs faces some challenges disseminating information on new research or promising strategies to all of the organizations providing services to tanf clients in the more decentralized welfare environment .
