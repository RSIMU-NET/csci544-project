since 2001 , congress has appropriated nearly $ 700 billion for the global war on terrorism . the majority of these funds have supported u.s. efforts in iraq . congressional oversight is crucial to improve performance , ensure accountability , and protect u.s. programs from fraud , waste , and abuse . since 2003 , gao has issued nearly 130 iraq - related reports and testimonies . this testimony addresses factors contributing to poor contracting outcomes and accountability , long - standing issues in the department of defense 's ( dod ) management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces , and efforts to improve the capacity of the iraqi government . gao reviewed u.s. agency documents and interviewed officials from state , dod , and other agencies ; the united nations ( un ) ; and the iraqi government . we also made multiple trips to iraq . u.s. efforts in iraq have relied extensively on contractors to undertake reconstruction projects and provide support to u.s. forces . however , a lack of well - defined requirements , poor business arrangements , and inadequate oversight and accountability have negatively affected reconstruction and support efforts . for example , in a july 2007 report , gao found that dod completed negotiation for task orders on an oil contract more than 6 months after the work commenced and most costs were incurred . dod paid nearly all of the $ 221 million in costs questioned by auditors . also in july 2007 , gao found that unclear dod guidance , inadequate staff , and insufficient technology resulted in poor accountability over more than 190,000 weapons provided to iraqi forces . dod concurred with gao 's recommendation to determine what dod accountability procedures apply or should apply to the program . however , as of march 2008 , dod had not made a determination . the need to effectively manage and oversee contractors supporting deployed forces is equally important . dod pays billions of dollars each year for contracted goods and services in locations such as iraq and elsewhere . however , several long - standing and systemic problems continue to hinder dod 's management and oversight of contractors at deployed locations , including the failure to follow planning guidance , provide an adequate number of contract oversight personnel , systematically collect and distribute lessons learned , and provide predeployment training for military commanders and contract oversight personnel on the use and role of contractors . gao 's work has identified instances where poor oversight and management of contractors led to negative financial and operational impacts . gao has made a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening dod 's management and oversight of contractor support at deployed locations , and the department has agreed to implement many of those recommendations . however , gao has found that dod has made limited progress in implementing some key recommendations . the united states has made available nearly $ 6 billion to rebuild iraq 's energy sector and $ 300 million to develop its government ministries but lacks integrated strategic plans for both efforts . building the capacity of the ministries is critical to ensure that iraq can effectively govern , rebuild , and stabilize the country . rebuilding iraq 's energy sector is necessary to ensure that iraq can pay for these tasks and provide essential services to the iraqi people . however , in the absence of a comprehensive and integrated strategic plan , u.s. efforts to build the capacity of the iraqi government have been hindered by multiple u.s. agencies pursuing individual efforts without overarching direction . the creation of a plan for the energy sector is also essential for iraq to meet energy production and export goals . gao recommended that state work with iraqi ministries to develop an integrated energy plan . state commented that the iraqi government , not the u.s. government , should act on gao 's recommendations . given the billions of dollars provided to rebuild iraq 's energy sector and the limited capacity of iraqi ministries , gao believes that its recommendations are still valid .
