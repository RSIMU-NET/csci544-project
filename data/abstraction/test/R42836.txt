various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country . in particular , domestic on - shore unconventional oil and gas development , such as hydraulic fracturing , has caused rapid growth in freshwater demand . to accommodate water supply requests in the missouri river basin , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) has proposed the use of surplus water from its garrison dam / lake sakakawea project in north dakota . the corps ' proposal would allow it to enter into five - year contracts to supply surplus water for a fee , which will be set through administrative rulemaking . north dakota and other states have objected to the corps ' proposal as a violation of their constitutional right to water flowing within their borders , arguing that the corps can not require payment for water that the state owns . although the legality of the corps ' charging for surplus water storage at its facilities has not been litigated specifically , the corps ' constitutional authority over operations at its reservoirs is generally very broad . additionally , congress has authorized the corps to charge for surplus storage at federal projects such as the garrison dam / lake sakakawea project . of course , statutory approval of an action that may interfere with state sovereignty does not connote constitutionality . other provisions within the corps ' statutory authorities arguably may indicate that congress did not intend to infringe upon state sovereignty over water rights within its boundaries . while it appears that the corps has broad authority to impound waters owned by the state for the purposes of a particular project without necessarily acquiring water rights under state law , it may be argued that surplus water , which is not used for any of the authorized purposes , is beyond the control of the corps . however , the viability of such an argument is unclear , given the lack of legal precedent on the issue . this report addresses the legal authority of the corps to charge for surplus water stored at its facilities . it analyzes the constitutional and statutory authority of the federal government to operate federal water projects , specifically lake sakakawea , along the missouri river . it also examines the nature of states ' claims of ownership of waters within state boundaries . finally , the report discusses the relationship between federal and state authority , including examples in which congress addressed competing federal and state roles .
