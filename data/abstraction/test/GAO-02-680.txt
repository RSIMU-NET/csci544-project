each year , the federal housing administration ( fha ) insures billions of dollars in multifamily housing mortgage loans to help construct , rehabilitate , purchase , and refinance apartments and health care facilities . however , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) lacks assurances that the lenders approved for the multifamily accelerated processing ( map ) program always meet all of hud 's qualifications . hud 's guidance requires prospective lenders to submit documents showing that they are financially sound , have a satisfactory lending record , and have qualified underwriters . gao found that hud did not always comply with , or effectively implement , controls and procedures for reviewing and monitoring map lenders ' underwriting of loans . before issuing a loan , field staff are required to conduct and document reviews of lenders ' mortgage insurance applications and associated loan exhibits to ensure compliance with hud underwriting requirements . however , staff did not always properly document their reviews . hud has held some lenders accountable for specific violations of program requirements but is unable to systematically identify lenders that exhibit patterns of noncompliance . to hold lenders accountable for specific violations or for patterns of noncompliance , hud 's office of multifamily housing can suspend or terminate their ability to participate in the map program .
