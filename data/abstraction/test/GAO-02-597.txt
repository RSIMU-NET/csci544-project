the three largest disability programs collectively provided $ 89.7 billion in cash benefits to 10.2 million adults in 2001. however , the disability insurance ( di ) program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , and va disability criteria reflect neither medical and technological advances nor the labor market changes that affect the skills needed to perform work and work settings . if these federal disability programs do not update scientific and labor market information , they risk overestimating the limiting nature of some disabilities while underestimating others . twelve years ago , both the social security administration and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) began reviewing relevant medical advances and updating the criteria they use to evaluate claims . however , the time the agencies are taking to revise the medical criteria could undermine the very purpose of the update . moreover , because of the limited role of treatment in the statutory and regulatory design of these programs , the updates have not fully captured the benefits afforded by advances in treatment . also , the disability criteria used by di , ssi , and va programs have not incorporated labor market changes . these programs continue to use outdated information about the types and demands of jobs needed to determine the impact that impairments have on individuals ' earning capacity . to incorporate scientific advances and labor market changes into the di , ssi , and va programs , steps can be taken within the existing program design , but some would require more fundamental change . agencies need to continue their medical updates and vigorously expand their efforts to more closely examine labor market changes . at a more fundamental level , ssa and va could consider changes to the disability criteria that would revisit the programs ' basic orientation .
