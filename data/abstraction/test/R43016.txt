on march 16 , 2010 , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) released connecting america : the national broadband plan . the national broadband plan ( nbp ) identified significant gaps in broadband availability and adoption in the united states , and in order to address those gaps and other challenges , the nbp set specific goals to be achieved by the year 2020. goals were set for next generation broadband service ; universal broadband service ; mobile wireless broadband innovation and coverage ; broadband access of community anchor institutions ; a nationwide , wireless , interoperable broadband public safety network ; and broadband for tracking energy consumption . three years after the rollout of the nbp , available data indicate that there has been progress towards reaching the 2020 goals . the following observations can be made : the united states is much closer to reaching broadband availability goals than broadband adoption goals , which remain a major challenge ; the united states is much closer to achieving broadband download speed goals than upload speed goals ; while the next generation broadband goal of 100 million households with 100 mbps speeds seems within reach ( at least for download speeds ) , the price remains high — affordability could improve in the future depending on technological advances and consumer demand for ultra - high speed next generation performance ; recent rollouts of next generation wireless technologies have led the fcc to state that the united states leads the world in mobile innovation ; on the other hand , the latest organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) data indicate that the united states remains in the middle of the pack with respect to wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 of the population ; while broadband data are incomplete for community anchor institutions , available information indicate that the number of cais with 1 gigabit connections remains relatively low ; and two major initiatives — firstnet and smart grid — are currently underway in order to help reach the goals for a public safety wireless network and for broadband monitoring of energy consumption . many of the key telecommunications issues that are currently being considered by the 113th congress are focused on improving broadband deployment and thus are intended to have a positive impact on the nation 's progress towards reaching one ( or in many cases , several ) of the nbp goals . as the 113th congress considers contentious telecommunications issues such as universal service reform , wireless technology and spectrum policy , and telecommunications regulatory reform , the ongoing progress towards meeting the nbp goals is likely to be part of that debate .
