this report responds to section 112 , division b , of the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 , which directs gao to review federal programs benefiting rural communities in alaska . after discussions with congressional staff , gao agreed to examine federal programs benefiting alaska native villages . specifically , this report provides information on the amount of federal assistance provided to alaska native villages during fiscal years 1998 through 2003 , describes how selected federal funds have been used to assist alaska native villages , and provides data on the number and average cost of houses built by villages and alaska native regional housing authorities . gao 's analysis of available data indicates that alaska native villages and regional native nonprofits -- including native associations , and regional health and housing nonprofits -- received over $ 3 billion in federal assistance from fiscal years 1998 through 2003. specifically , total federal funding included approximately $ 483 million to 216 alaska native villages and about $ 3 billion to 33 regional native nonprofits . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) accounted for 63 percent of all funding over the period . according to federal and state officials , alaska native villages also likely benefited from federal funding to the state of alaska and to cities and boroughs that contain villages , such as when federal funding is used by municipalities to provide water services . based on data gao obtained from the state of alaska , during fiscal years 1998 through 2003 , the state passed through more than $ 105 million in federal funding to native villages and regional native nonprofits . based on available information for 13 programs gao reviewed , federal funding was used to provide alaska natives with assistance in health care , housing , infrastructure , and other areas . for example , according to information from hhs , its tribal self - governance program was used by 13 regional native nonprofits , three native villages , four groups of alaska native villages , and one statewide native health care provider to provide clinical services at tribally run hospitals and health clinics that had over 1 million total visits throughout alaska in 2002. another program , hud 's indian housing block grant , provided funds used by villages and regional housing authorities to build , rehabilitate , modernize , and operate single - family homes and multifamily housing properties . however , the extent of readily available information on how funds were used from the 13 programs gao reviewed varied , in part due to different agency reporting requirements . results from gao 's survey of alaska native villages and regional housing authorities indicated that , during calendar years 1998 through 2003 , responding entities constructed a total of 874 single - family units . gao 's survey indicated that the average cost of units constructed by responding entities varied by region and by whether they were developed by villages or housing authorities . for example , the 6-year average regional cost ( in 2003 dollars ) of all units constructed ranged from a low of $ 138,944 per unit , or $ 122 per square foot , to a high of $ 305,634 per unit , or $ 267 per square foot . gao also found that the cost of new housing units developed by housing authorities was slightly higher than units developed by native villages , and that regional housing authorities constructed more than three times the number of units compared with villages . however , various factors could account for differences in the cost and number of units completed among regions or between villages and regional housing authorities .
