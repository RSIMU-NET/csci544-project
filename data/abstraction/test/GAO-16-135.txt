gao designated federal real - property management as a high - risk area in part because of physical security challenges at federal facilities . fps and gsa have joint responsibility for protecting federal facilities held or leased by gsa . fps has primary responsibility for the security and protection of buildings and their occupants , whereas gsa has primary responsibility for security fixtures , maintenance , and building access . in light of these challenges , gao was asked to review how the agencies ' collaboration reflects key practices to ensure facility security and the impact of their collaboration practices on day - to - day operations at the regional and facility level . gao analyzed pertinent laws and documents , compared fps 's and gsa 's collaboration efforts against gao 's selected key - collaboration practices , and interviewed agency officials at the headquarters and regional levels selected based on various factors . while the results from regions can not be generalized , they provided illustrative examples . the federal protective service ( fps ) , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the general services administration ( gsa ) have taken some steps to improve collaboration , such as drafting a joint strategy . while each agency has some individual policies for collaboration , the two agencies have made limited progress in agreeing on several key practices as described below . reaching agreement on these practices will help to enhance the agencies ' ability to protect federal facilities and to improve day - to - day operations at the regional level . as a result of not having key practices in place , regional officials said they were not aware of agreed upon collaborative policies and procedures to conduct day - to - day operations . gao found that this created inefficiencies and security risks . for example , fps officials told gao that gsa did not coordinate with them on new construction intended for law enforcement tenants , and as a result , it was not suitable for law enforcement use . gsa officials told gao that they did not have sufficient information from fps about security plans for upcoming events and , therefore , were not able to inform tenants of necessary security measures . gao recommends that fps and gsa take actions to improve their collaboration in several areas , including defining common outcomes , agreeing on roles and responsibilities , and communicating compatible policies and procedures . dhs specifically concurred with gao 's recommendations , and gsa agreed to work with fps to address the findings .
