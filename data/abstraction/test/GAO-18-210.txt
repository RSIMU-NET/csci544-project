recent data breaches have highlighted the importance of ensuring the security of health information , including medicare beneficiary data . such data are created , stored , and used by a wide variety of entities , such as health care providers , insurance companies , financial institutions , researchers , and others . gao was asked to conduct a study of cms efforts to protect medicare beneficiary data accessed by external entities . gao 's objectives were to identify the major external entities that collect , store , and process medicare fee - for - service beneficiary data ; determine whether requirements for the protection of medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance ; and assess cms oversight of the implementation of those requirements . gao analyzed information about how external entities access data , reviewed cms documentation on who they share data with , compared federal standards with cms security requirements for external entities , and analyzed results of independent security reviews . gao also interviewed cms officials about their oversight activities . the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) shares medicare beneficiary data with three major types of external entities : medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) that perform processing and distribution functions that support the payment of medicare benefits ; research organizations ( researchers ) that use medicare beneficiary data to study how health care services are provided to beneficiaries ; and qualified public or private entities that use claims data to evaluate the performance of medicare service providers and equipment suppliers . cms has developed requirements for implementing security controls that align with federal guidance for two of the three types of external entities that access medicare beneficiary data . while cms has developed guidance for macs and qualified entities , it has not developed equivalent guidance for researchers . researchers must adhere to broad governmentwide standards , but are not given guidance on which specific controls to implement . according to cms , the lack of specific guidance gives the researchers more flexibility to independently assess their security risks and determine which controls are appropriate to implement ; however , without providing comprehensive , risk - based security guidance to researchers , cms increases the risk that external entities possessing agency data may not have applied security controls that meet cms standards . additionally , cms has established an oversight program for the security of mac data , but has not established a corresponding program to oversee security implementation by researchers and qualified entities . without effective oversight measures in place for researchers and qualified entities , cms can not fully ensure that the security of medicare beneficiary data is being adequately protected . regarding macs , although they are subject to two types of independent annual assessments , which have regularly identified weaknesses in their implementation of security controls , the weaknesses that have been assessed as low - risk have not been consistently tracked in the cms finding tracking system . without more consistent tracking of these low - risk weaknesses , it may be difficult for cms to determine if all weaknesses are being addressed in a timely manner . examples of categories of recurring weaknesses that have been identified during annual assessments are listed in the table . gao recommends that cms develop additional guidance for researchers on implementing security controls required by cms , consistently track results of independent assessments , and provide oversight of researchers and qualified entities . cms concurred with gao 's three recommendations and described actions it has planned or taken to address them .
