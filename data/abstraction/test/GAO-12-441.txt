in 2003 , the bush administration announced the proliferation security initiative ( psi ) to enhance u.s. efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) . psi is not a program housed in only one agency , but instead is a set of activities with participation by multiple u.s. agencies and other countries . congress recommended that the department of defense ( dod ) and department of state ( state ) establish policies , procedures , and indicators to measure results and required that they submit annual reports . it also mandated that gao report on psi effectiveness . in 2008 , gao likewise recommended that law enforcement agencies also establish policies , procedures , and performance indicators . this report assesses the progress relevant agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended psi policies and procedures and issuing required annual reports ; and the extent to which psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. counterproliferation efforts . gao reviewed and analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials from state , dod , and other agencies with psi responsibilities . u.s. agencies have adopted interagency guidance documents that establish psi policies and procedures and have submitted annual reports ; however , these reports do not contain expenditure data for all agencies as required by law . the agencies produced documents that contain general psi policies and procedures . in addition , dod and the department of homeland securitys customs and border protection ( cbp ) developed policies and procedures specifically to guide their agencies psi activities . the annual reports submitted in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 met requirements to describe psi - related activities planned for future years and those that took place in the preceding year . although the reports included an account of dods psi expenditures , they did not contain all expenditures for other agencies for psi activities as required by law . u.s. officials participated in a range of psi activities since 2008 to meet their objective of expanding and enhancing counterproliferation efforts , but it is unclear to what extent these activities have achieved the objective because agencies lack measures of results . the agencies either led or participated in 22 psi activities from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011 including multilateral meetings and exercises . officials stated that their outreach efforts contributed to increased support for psi since gaos 2008 report , such as the increase from 93 to 98 countries endorsing psi . in addition , they have extended access to psi activities to more countries that are not part of the group of 21 psi operational experts group countries , for example by holding regional planning meetings . despite recommendations of congress and gao that agencies develop psi performance indicators , dod , state , cbp , and the federal bureau of investigation have not developed indicators that can be used to systematically measure progress toward the stated psi objective . further , the agencies have not systematically evaluated psi activity results . although some officials indicated plans to develop psi performance indicators , officials from dod and state also cited several challenges to developing indicators to measure psi activities results including difficulty quantifying how psi activities improved capacity . however , gao has previously reported that , despite such challenges , developing measures that help link activities to results is possible . psi agencies could develop a framework that links performance measures to outcomes . for example , such a framework could link the number of participants trained to changes in national policies that strengthen participant countries authority to interdict the shipment of wmd , their delivery systems , and related materials . gao recommends that state and dod provide all required expenditure information in psi annual reports and develop a framework for measuring psis results . dod partially concurred with both recommendations and state partially concurred with the reporting recommendation . state disagreed with the framework recommendation , but noted its support for analysis consistent with it .
