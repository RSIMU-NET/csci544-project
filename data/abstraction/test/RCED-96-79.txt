pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined the deregulation of the airline industry , focusing on : airfares and the quantity , quality , and safety of air service since deregulation . gao noted that : the average fare per passenger mile is 9 percent lower at small - community airports , 11 percent lower at medium - sized airports , and 8 percent lower at large - community airports ; the largest increase in fares occurred in the southeast and appalachian regions , and the largest decrease occurred in the west and southwestern regions ; this geographic disparity exists because of the intense competition between low - cost , new carriers in the west and dominant , high - maintenance carriers in the southeast ; the overall quantity of air service at airports has increased , but large communities have experienced the largest increase ; air service quality is difficult to measure and depends on the number of destinations served by nonstop flights and one - stop connections , and the type of aircraft used ; air service quality since deregulation has been mixed largely due to the airlines hub networks and greater use of turboprop aircraft ; and the overall accident rate since deregulation has dropped , but there are no statistically significant differences in air safety trends for any of the airport groups .
