in 2010 , as focal point for information technology management across the government , ombs federal chief information officer launched the federal data center consolidation initiativean effort to consolidate the growing number of federal data centers . in july 2011 and july 2012 , gao evaluated 24 agencies progress and reported that nearly all of the agencies had not completed a data center inventory or consolidation plan and recommended that they do so . gao was asked to testify on its report , being released today , that evaluated agencies ' reported progress against ombs planned consolidation and cost savings goals , and assessed the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by omb for the federal data center consolidation initiative are adequately performing oversight of agencies ' efforts to meet these goals . in this report , gao assessed agencies progress against ombs goals , analyzed the execution of oversight roles and responsibilities , and interviewed omb , gsa , and data center consolidation task force officials about their efforts to oversee agencies consolidation efforts . the 24 agencies participating in the federal data center consolidation initiative made progress towards the office of management and budgets ( omb ) goal to close 40 percent , or 1,253 of the 3,133 total federal data centers , by the end of 2015 , but omb has not measured agencies progress against its other goal of $ 3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015. agencies closed 420 data centers by the end of december 2012 , and have plans to close an additional 548 to reach 968 by december 2015285 closures short of ombs goal . omb has not determined agencies progress against its cost savings goal because , according to omb staff , the agency has not determined a consistent and repeatable method for tracking cost savings . this lack of information makes it uncertain whether the $ 3 billion in savings is achievable by the end of 2015. until omb tracks and reports on performance measures such as cost savings , it will be limited in its ability to oversee agencies progress against key goals . pursuant to omb direction , three organizationsthe data center consolidation task force , the general services administration ( gsa ) program management office , and ombare responsible for federal data center consolidation oversight activities ; while most activities are being performed , there are still several weaknesses in oversight . specifically , while the data center consolidation task force has established several initiatives to assist agencies in their consolidation efforts , such as holding monthly meetings to facilitate communication among agencies , it has not adequately overseen its peer review process for improving the quality of agencies ' consolidation plans . the gsa program management office has collected agencies quarterly data center closure updates and made the information publically available on an electronic dashboard for tracking consolidation progress , but it has not fully performed other oversight activities , such as conducting analyses of agencies inventories and plans . omb has implemented several initiatives to track agencies consolidation progress , such as establishing requirements for agencies to update their plans and inventories yearly and to report quarterly on their consolidation progress . however , the agency has not approved the plans on the basis of their completeness or reported on progress against its goal of $ 3 billion in cost savings . the weaknesses in oversight of the data center consolidation initiative are due , in part , to omb not ensuring that assigned responsibilities are being executed . improved oversight could better position omb to assess progress against its cost savings goal and minimize agencies risk of not realizing expected cost savings . in march 2013 , omb issued a memorandum that integrated the federal data center consolidation initiative with the portfoliostat initiative , which requires agencies to conduct annual reviews of its information technology investments and make decisions on eliminating duplication , among other things . the memorandum also made significant changes to the federal data center consolidation effort , including the initiatives reporting requirements and goals . specifically , agencies are no longer required to submit the previously required consolidation plans and the memorandum does not identify a cost savings goal . in its report , gao recommended that ombs federal chief information officer track and report on key performance measures , extend the time frame for achieving planned cost savings , and improve the execution of important oversight responsibilities . omb agreed with two of gaos recommendations and plans to evaluate the remaining recommendation related to extending the time frame .
