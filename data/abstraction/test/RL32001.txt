the aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america has begun to have negative consequences for economic and social development in several countries , and continued increases in hiv infection rates threaten future development prospects . in contrast to other parts of latin america , the mode of hiv transmission in several caribbean and central american countries has been primarily through heterosexual contact , making the disease difficult to contain because it affects the general population . the countries with the highest prevalence or infection rates are belize , the bahamas , guyana , haiti , and trinidad and tobago , with rates between 2 % and 4 % ; and barbados , the dominican republic , honduras , jamaica , and suriname , with rates between 1 % and 2 % . the response to the aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america has involved a mix of support by governments in the region , bilateral donors ( such as the united states , canada , and european nations ) , regional and multilateral organizations , and nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) . many countries in the region have national hiv / aids programs that are supported through these efforts . u.s. government funding for hiv / aids in the caribbean and central america has increased significantly in recent years . aid to the region rose from $ 11.2 million in fy2000 to $ 33.8 million in fy2003 . because of the inclusion of guyana and haiti as focus countries in the president 's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) , u.s. assistance to the region for hiv / aids increased from $ 47 million in fy2004 to an estimated $ 139 million in fy2008 . for fy2009 , the administration requested almost $ 139 million in hiv assistance for the caribbean and central america , with $ 92 million for haiti and $ 20 million for guyana . in the 110th congress , h.r . 848 ( fortu√±o ) , introduced february 6 , 2007 , would add 14 caribbean countries to the list of focus countries under pepar . the additional countries are antigua & barbuda , barbados , the bahamas , belize , dominica , grenada , jamaica , montserrat , st. kitts & nevis , st. vincent and the grenadines , st. lucia , suriname , trinidad & tobago , and the dominican republic . in the second session of the 110th congress , the language of h.r . 848 was included in pepfar reauthorization legislation , h.r . 5501 ( berman ) , approved by the house on april 2 , 2008. the senate version of the pepfar reauthorization , s. 2731 ( biden ) , which was reported by the senate committee on foreign relations on april 15 , 2008 , does not have a similar provision expanding the list of caribbean countries that are focus countries . this report , which will be updated periodically , examines the characteristics and consequences of the hiv / aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america and the response to the epidemic in the region . also see crs report rl33485 , u.s. international hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria spending : fy2004-fy2008 , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report rl33396 , the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis , and malaria : progress report and issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report rl33771 , trends in u.s. global aids spending : fy2000-fy2008 , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
