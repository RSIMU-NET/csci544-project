the phrase `` glass - steagall '' generally refers to the separation of commercial banking from investment banking . congress effected a separation of commercial and investment banking through four sections of the banking act of 1933 — sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32. these four statutory provisions are commonly referred to as the glass - steagall act . key takeaways of this report the glass - steagall debate is not centered on prohibiting risky financial services ; rather , the debate is about whether to permit inherently risky commercial and investment banking activities to be conducted within a single firm — specifically within firms holding federally insured deposits . over the course of the nearly 70-year - long glass - steagall era , the clear - cut separation of traditional commercial banking and securities activities gradually eroded . this erosion was the result of a confluence of matters , including market changes , statutory changes , and regulatory and judicial interpretations . the glass - steagall era formally ended in 1999 when the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) repealed the glass - steagall act 's restrictions on affiliations between commercial and investment banks . less than a decade after glba , the united states suffered its worst financial crisis since the great depression . some have argued that the partial repeal either was a cause of the financial crisis that resulted in the so - called great recession or that it fueled and worsened the crisis 's deleterious effect . on the other hand , some policymakers argue that glass - steagall issues were not significant causes of the crisis , and that the glass - steagall act would have made responding to the crisis more difficult if it had remained in place . the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l . 111-203 ) was congress 's primary legislative prescription to prevent a similar financial crisis in the future . the dodd - frank act neither reinstated the sections of the glass - steagall act that were repealed by glba nor substantially modified the ability of banking firms to affiliate with securities firms . it did , however , include some arguably glass - steagall - like provisions , which were designed to promote financial stability going forward , reduce various speculative activities of commercial banks , and reduce the likelihood that the u.s. government would have to provide taxpayer support to avert or minimize a future financial crisis . some believe that a more effective way of accomplishing these policy objectives would be to fully reinstate the glass - steagall act . in fact , multiple bills have been introduced in the 114th congress with that stated purpose . these bills include : s. 1709 / h.r . 3054 , the 21st century glass - steagall act of 2015 , and h.r . 381 , the return to prudent banking act of 2015. on the other side of the policy discussion , some argue that the glass - steagall act is ill - suited for the current financial system and that the recent financial crisis would have occurred even if glba had never partially repealed the glass - steagall act . even if the dodd - frank act had completely re - enacted the repealed provisions of the glass - steagall act , the financial history of the glass - steagall era shows that regulatory walls could be difficult to maintain or enforce .
