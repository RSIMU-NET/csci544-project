the impact aid program , administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) and authorized by title vii of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , was originally established in 1950 by p.l . 81-815 and p.l . 81-874 , 15 years prior to the enactment of the esea . impact aid compensates local educational agencies ( leas ) for a `` substantial and continuing financial burden '' resulting from federal activities . these activities include federal ownership of certain lands , as well as the enrollments in leas of children whose parents work or live on federal property and children living on indian lands . the federal government provides compensation because leas are unable to collect property or other taxes from these individuals ( e.g . , members of the uniformed services living on military bases ) or their employers , even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children . thus , impact aid is intended to compensate leas , in part , for the resulting loss of tax revenue . the impact aid program authorizes several types of payments , as detailed in the table below . overall , the impact aid program received about $ 1.4 billion in fy2019 . the largest impact aid payment is basic support payments ( bsps ) for federally connected children ( section 7003 ( b ) ) , accounting for nearly 90 % of the total appropriation . federally connected children are those who reside with a parent who is a member of the uniformed services living on or off federal property , with a parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on or off federal property , on indian lands , in low - rent public housing , or with a parent who is a civilian working or living on federal property . bsps are allocated directly to leas based on a formula that uses weights assigned to different categories of federally connected children , cost factors to determine maximum payment amounts , and provisions to determine payment amounts when appropriations are insufficient to provide maximum payments . in addition to the impact aid programs administered by ed , a smaller set of programs administered by the department of defense ( dod ) are often referred to as the `` dod impact aid '' programs . these two programs include one that provides supplemental aid to leas serving military children , and one that provides assistance to leas serving military children with severe disabilities . for fy2018 , total appropriations for these programs were $ 35 million ( $ 30 million for the first program and $ 5 million for the second ) .
