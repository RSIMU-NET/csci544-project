the unemployment insurance ( ui ) program is a federal - state partnership to help replace the lost earnings of unemployed persons and to stabilize the economy during a recession . the department of labor estimates that $ 2.4 billion in overpayments were made in 2001 , including $ 577 million attributed to fraud or abuse . overpayments in the ui program result from management and operational practices at the state and federal level . at the state level , many states do not sufficiently balance the need to quickly process and pay ui claims with the need to control program payments . moreover , states rely heavily on self - reported information from claimants for other important data , such as a claimant 's receipt of other federal or state program benefits and whether they are citizens of the united states . at the federal level , policies and directives from the department of labor affect states ' priorities and procedures in a manner that makes overpayments more likely .
