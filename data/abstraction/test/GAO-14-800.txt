in fiscal year 2013 , hrsa awarded over $ 6 billion in grants , which accounted for over 80 percent of the agency 's appropriations . hrsa 's workforce — its staff and contractors — is responsible for monitoring the agency 's grantees to ensure they are financially sound , using federal funds appropriately , and in compliance with program requirements . in recent years , gao has reported on weaknesses in hrsa 's monitoring of certain grant programs and made recommendations for the agency to improve grantee monitoring . gao was asked to review hrsa 's oversight mechanisms for its grantee monitoring workforce . this report examines the extent to which hrsa has developed guidance for staff who monitor grantees ; the extent to which it implemented training for this staff ; hrsa 's oversight of its staff ; and its practices to ensure contractors who conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified and carry out their work as appropriate . gao reviewed hrsa training documentation and guidance related to grantee monitoring and interviewed hrsa officials . gao also reviewed the contracts that hrsa identified as including grantee monitoring activities in fiscal year 2013. in 2012 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) began systematically developing guidance for the key staff involved in grantee monitoring — project officers in its programmatic bureaus and grants management specialists and financial integrity staff in its office of federal assistance management ( ofam ) . specifically , hrsa issued the first agency - wide guidance written primarily for project officers in november 2012 and is in the process of developing new guidance and revising existing guidance for staff in ofam . additionally , hrsa required each of the bureaus to develop more detailed guidance for project officers by the end of 2012. to assist the bureaus in systematically developing this guidance , hrsa provided a template outlining the minimum components to be included in the documents . while all of hrsa 's bureaus developed guidance for their project officers , gao found that the bureaus ' guidance did not address all of the key components of grantee monitoring identified by hrsa , such as components related to conducting site visits . although hrsa conducted reviews of the bureaus ' guidance , these reviews were not sufficient to ensure that the guidance addressed all required grantee monitoring components . consequently , there is an increased possibility that project officers will not conduct , or document , all the monitoring activities required by hrsa , which puts the agency at risk for incomplete or insufficient grantee monitoring . since 2013 , hrsa has implemented agency - wide training programs for key staff responsible for conducting monitoring of grantees — a project officer certification program , which the majority of project officers have completed , and a career development program for grants management specialists . both programs include courses that cover material related to grantee monitoring . in addition to these training programs , the bureaus and ofam offer formal and informal training related to grantee monitoring , such as training on specific grant program requirements . hrsa has four main methods for overseeing its staff 's monitoring of grantees . according to hrsa officials , supervisors review information in , and reports from , hrsa 's online system for documenting grantee monitoring activities , such as staff 's assessments of grantee compliance ; regularly communicate with staff in one - on - one and other meetings ; and conduct annual performance appraisals to hold staff accountable for their monitoring responsibilities . additionally , hrsa has mechanisms in place to ensure that the contractors that conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified , including reviewing staffing proposals prior to awarding the contract , requiring contractor staff to have specific qualifications , and requiring training for contractor staff . to oversee contractors ' work , hrsa staff regularly communicate with the contractors , review their deliverables , and obtain feedback from project officers and grantees on contractor performance . gao recommends that hrsa develop a process to ensure that the guidance developed by its bureaus addresses all of the key components of grantee monitoring as established by the agency . hhs agreed with gao 's recommendation and said hrsa has begun to take action to implement it .
