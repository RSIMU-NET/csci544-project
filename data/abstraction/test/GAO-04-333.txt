in 2001 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) administration for children and families ( acf ) implemented the child and family services reviews ( cfsr ) to increase states ' accountability . the cfsr uses states ' data profiles and statewide assessments , as well as interviews and an on - site case review , to measure state performance on 14 outcomes and systemic factors , including child well - being and the provision of caseworker training . the cfsr also requires progress on a program improvement plan ( pip ) ; otherwise acf may apply financial penalties . this report examines acf 's and the states ' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; acf 's and the states ' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in pips ; and any additional efforts that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to help ensure that all states meet federal goals related to children 's safety , permanency , and well - being . acf and many state officials perceive the cfsr as a valuable process and a substantial undertaking , but some data enhancements could improve its reliability . acf staff in 8 of the 10 regions considered the cfsr a helpful tool to improve outcomes for children . further , 26 of 36 states responding to a relevant question in our survey commented that they generally or completely agreed with the results of the final cfsr report , even though none of the 41 states with final cfsr reports released through 2003 has achieved substantial conformity on all 14 outcomes and systemic factors . additionally , both acf and the states have dedicated substantial financial and staff resources to the process . nevertheless , several state officials and child welfare experts we interviewed questioned the accuracy of the data used in the review process . while acf officials contend that stakeholder interviews and case reviews complement the data profiles , many state officials and experts reported that additional data from the statewide assessment could bolster the evaluation of state performance . program improvement planning is under way , but uncertainties have affected the development , funding , and implementation of state pips . officials from 3 of the 5 states we visited said acf 's pip - related instructions were unclear , and at least 9 of the 25 states reporting on pip implementation in our survey said that insufficient funding and staff were among the greatest challenges . while acf has provided some guidance , acf and state officials remain uncertain about pip monitoring efforts and how acf will apply financial penalties if states fail to achieve their stated pip objectives . since 2001 , acf 's focus has been almost exclusively on the cfsrs and regional staff report limitations in providing assistance to states in helping them to meet key federal goals . while staff from half of acf 's regions told us they would like to provide more targeted assistance to states , and state officials in all 5 of the states we visited said that acf 's existing technical assistance efforts could be improved , acf officials acknowledged that regional staff might still be adjusting to the new way acf oversees child welfare programs .
