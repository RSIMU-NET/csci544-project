the gsa estimated that federal agencies spent about $ 1.6 billion during fiscal year 2009 purchasing office supplies from more than 239,000 vendors . concerned that federal agencies may not be getting the best prices available , congress directed gsa to study office supply purchases by the 10 largest federal agencies . gsa delivered the results of its study in november 2010. the study also discussed gsas efforts to implement an initiative focused on leveraging the governments buying power to realize savings when buying office supplies , known as os ii . congress directed gao to assess the gsa study , with particular attention to the potential for savings . this testimony is based on the findings and conclusions of gaos december 2011 report , g ao - 12-178 , and focuses on the support for the findings and conclusions in gsas study , and how gsa 's new office supply contracts support the goal of leveraging the governments buying power to achieve savings . in 2010 , the general services administrations ( gsa ) pricing study found that during fiscal year 2009 , the 10 largest federal agencies accounted for about $ 1.3 billion , or about 81 percent , of the total $ 1.6 billion spent governmentwide in 14 categories of office supplies . about 58 percent of their office supply purchases were made outside of the gsa schedules programa simplified process to take advantage of price discounts equal to those that vendors offer most favored customers. most of these purchases were made at retail stores . gsa also reported that agencies paid an average of 75 percent more ( a price premium ) than schedule prices for their retail purchases and 86 percent more compared to office supplies ii ( os ii ) prices . while the gsa acknowledged some limitations with the study data , we identified additional data and other limitations that lead us to question the magnitude of some of gsas reported price premiums and assertions . more specifically , we determined that the study may not have properly controlled for quantities , used two different formulas to calculate price premium estimates , and relied on interviews with senior level acquisition officials instead of purchasers to determine whether buyers compared prices before making purchases . we were not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations . additionally , other agencies questioned the studys specific findings related to price premiums , but their own studies of price premiums support gsas conclusion that better prices can be obtained through consolidated , leveraged purchasing . available data show that the os ii initiative has produced savings of $ 39.2 million from june 2010 through march 2012. according to gsa , the os ii initiative is demonstrating that leveraged buying can produce greater savings and has provided improvements for managing ongoing and future strategic sourcing initiatives . for example , gsa reports that os ii allowed it to negotiate discounts with vendors who were selected for the initiative . as governmentwide sales surpass certain targets , additional discounts are applied to purchase prices . further , os ii has spurred competition among schedule vendors that were not selected for os ii , resulting in decreased schedule prices . the initiative is also expected to lower governmentwide supply costs through more centralized contract management . another key aspect of the initiative is that participating vendors provide sales and other information to gsa to help monitor prices , savings , and vendor performance . finally , gsa is capturing lessons learned from os ii and is attempting to incorporate these lessons into other strategic sourcing initiatives . gao did not make any recommendations in its report , and is not making any in this testimony .
