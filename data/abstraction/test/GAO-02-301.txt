the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) relied on its 11 coal - burning plants to supply 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001. these plants account for almost all of tva 's emissions of two key air pollutants -- sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , which has been linked to reduced visibility , and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone . to meet an increase in demand of 1.7 percent annually through 2010 , tva estimates that it will need to expand its current generating capacity of 30,365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually . building new generating capacity can produce more emissions , which raises environment concerns . to lessen the need for new capacity , tva and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through `` demand - side management '' programs , which seek to reduce the amount of energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed . even though tva intends to increase its capacity to generate electricity through 2005 , it also expects to reduce its so2 and nox emissions during the same time period , primarily by burning lower - sulfur coal , installing devices to control emissions at its existing plants , and relying on fuels other than coal for new capacity . although tva 's demand - side management programs have allowed customers to cut their electrical consumption , these programs have made only modest contributions to reducing peak - time demand . tva has limited the scope of its key program to reduce peak - time consumption by residential customers because tva believes the program is not cost - effective . tva projects that its demand - side programs will produce nearly twice as much in savings between 2001 and 2005 as was achieved in the previous five years . other large utilities have more fully implemented the types of programs that tva now has in place and have also implemented a greater array of demand - side management tools . these programs have involved a much higher proportion of their residential customers and established different prices for electricity used during different times of the day .
