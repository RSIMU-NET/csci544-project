congress is currently considering the u.s. - vietnam bilateral trade agreement ( bta ) . under the agreement , which was signed in july 2000 and requires congressional approval , the united states pledged to extend conditional normal trade relations status to vietnam , thereby significantly lowering tariffs on imports from vietnam , in return for hanoi 's agreement to enact a wide range of market - oriented reforms . congressional discussion over the bta is expected to highlight vietnam 's labor rights situation , a topic that has become a contentious part of the trade debate in recent years . the bta itself does not specifically address workers ' rights . the evolution of vietnam 's labor rights regime has been heavily conditioned by the tension between maintaining political stability and promoting economic development — two goals that often conflict . on the one hand , vietnamese workers are not free to form their own independent unions . all unions must belong to the vietnam general confederation of labor ( vgcl ) , an organ of the communist party . analysts have observed that the absence of a true right of association in vietnam has impeded the improvement of labor rights in other areas . collective bargaining agreements remain the exception rather than the rule . vietnam 's doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms , launched in 1986 , have been followed by surging urban unemployment and a rise in child labor , forced prostitution , and the trafficking of women and children . workers in all sectors of the economy are often exposed to dangerous , unhealthy , and in some cases impoverished `` sweatshop '' conditions . rapid economic expansion , corruption , and shortages of funds , training , and personnel have made it extremely difficult for government authorities to enforce vietnam 's labor laws . on the other hand , since the launch of the doi moi reforms , worker rights have made substantial progress . vietnam rejoined the international labor organization ( ilo ) in 1992 and since then the government , unions , and local groups have intensified their cooperation with the ilo and other international groups . a comprehensive and detailed labor code was passed in 1994. among other advances , it recognized workers ' right to strike . there is evidence that over the past decade the vgcl and its member - unions have become more assertive — particularly on matters relating to wages , health , and safety — a development tolerated by the government . by many measures — the coverage of labor laws , the tolerance of wildcat strikes , the slowly increasing clout of grass - roots unions , the relative openness of debate over labor issues — there is evidence that the vietnamese labor rights regime is more flexible and responsive than its chinese counterpart . this report details vietnam 's law and policy in six areas of labor rights : the right of association / collective bargaining ; forced labor ; child labor ; health and safety ; wages , hours and welfare benefits ; and discrimination . this report also provides international context by contrasting the vietnamese and chinese labor rights regimes . comprehensive information about vietnam 's labor conditions are scarce . as more information is obtained , this report will be updated .
