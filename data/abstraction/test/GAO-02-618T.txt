estimating the extent of abusive tax schemes used by individual taxpayers is difficult because they are often hidden . nevertheless , the internal revenue service ( irs ) believes that the number and dollar consequences of these schemes has grown recently . irs estimates that 740,000 taxpayers used abusive schemes in tax year 2000. irs caught $ 5 billion in improper tax avoidance or tax credit and refund claims , but estimates that another $ 20 to $ 40 billion went undetected . recent developments suggest that the number of individuals using an abusive tax scheme involving offshore accounts may be greater than estimated and potential lost revenues may be higher than estimated . because no one individual or office could provide an agencywide perspective on irs 's strategy , goals , objectives , performance measures , or program results , it is difficult to provide a clear picture of irs 's efforts to address abusive tax schemes . irs has created new offices , reemphasized and reorganized earlier efforts , and plans to assign at least 200 additional staff to its efforts . limited data suggest that irs 's enhanced efforts have helped to successfully convict those promoting and taking advantage of abusive schemes , publicize these results , and uncover previously hidden major offshore compliance problems . the number of possible abusive tax schemes , however , could outstrip irs 's audit resources . furthermore , identifying and handling these cases will require better coordination on irs 's part . irs has not yet developed a way to track the resources used to combat abusive schemes , nor has it developed goals and measures to assess its progress .
