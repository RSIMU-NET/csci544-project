on december 17 , 2003 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a proposed rule to address the effect of interstate transport of air pollutants on non - attainment of the nationalambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulates ( pm 2.5 ) and ozone ( specifically , the8-hour standard ) . the proposed interstate air quality ( iaq ) rule appeared in the federal register january 30 , 2004. for pm 2.5 , the proposed rule finds that the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) from 28 states and the district of columbia contributessignificantly to downwind non - attainment ; for ozone , the proposed rule finds that interstate transportof nox from 25 states and d.c. contributes significantly to downwind non - attainment of the 8-hourstandard . with the iaq rule , epa proposes a region - wide emissions cap for nox and so 2 to be implemented in two phases -- 2010 and 2015. based on the methodology employed in the proposedrule , epa estimates reductions of about 70 % from baseline emissions in 2015. epa 's methodologydetermined the caps by applying `` highly cost effective '' pollution controls on electric generatingunits . epa has presented the proposed iaq rule and the accompanying proposed mercury ( hg ) rule as a `` suite of integrated air actions '' to reduce emissions of three pollutants -- so 2 , nox , and hg . the two proposed rules are integrated in such a way that the technologies reducing so 2 and noxemissions under the iaq rule also reduce enough hg emissions to meet the modest 2010 reductionrequirements of the proposed hg rule . this combination of requirements and technology allowsutilities to meet the requirements of both rules without installing three different control technologies -- one for each pollutant . as epa does not provide a cost - benefit analysis of hg reductions , it is notpossible to quantitatively determine whether this decision is economically efficient in terms ofpotential hg benefits foregone by not imposing a more stringent reduction requirement . however , from the broader perspective of the interaction of the proposed rules with the underlying clean air act ( caa ) , there is a resulting lack of integration . it is likely to be argued thatthe proposed rule simply represents another layer on an already multi - layered cake called the cleanair act . adding a regionwide annual cap and trade program onto a regulatory structure whosefoundation is health - based national standards that focus on the local concentration of pollutants inthe ambient air presents numerous difficulties . as a result , there are multiple inconsistencies betweenthe proposed rule and other provisions of the caa . these conflicts are not surprising -- there islittle epa can do to resolve them out by regulation . if the administration 's goal is to restructurecaa compliance strategies toward market - oriented cap and trade programs without creating morelayers and conflicts , it is possible a statutory solution will be necessary . this report will be updated if events warrant .
