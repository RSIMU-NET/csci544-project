the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( act ) created the national veterans business development corporation ( the veterans corporation ) to address perceived gaps in providing small business and entrepreneurship assistance to veterans . the act requires gao to review the veterans corporation . gao described the veterans corporation 's efforts to provide small business assistance to veterans , including service - disabled veterans ; use of and controls over federal funds in providing these services ; and efforts to become financially self - sufficient . the veterans corporation is providing veterans with entrepreneurial training , on - line educational resources , micro loans , business insurance , and an on - line marketplace . the veterans corporation identified initial challenges that slowed program progress , including getting information on transitioning military personnel ; and veteran - owned businesses ; and delays in making management appointments . because the programs are new , it is too early to determine their effectiveness . during its first 2 years of operation , the veterans corporation spent about $ 5 of $ 8 million in total federal appropriations ; about $ 1 million in fiscal year 2001 ; and about $ 4 million in fiscal year 2002 , with the largest part of the increase due to salaries and program costs . an external audit for fiscal year 2001 identified internal control issues , such as the lack of adequate supporting documentation for disbursements and untimely reconciliation of bank accounts . according to the external auditor , all but one of the deficiencies was addressed in 2002. the veterans corporation has developed a financial self - sufficiency plan based on four major revenue sources -- an on - line marketplace , a credit card program , an insurance service program , and fund - raising . at the time of gao 's review , most of these efforts were just beginning to produce revenue . according to the plan , the veterans corporation is not expected to achieve self - sufficiency until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004. if outcomes do not meet projections , veterans corporation officials stated that they would explore alternatives .
