power plants ' electricity output must be matched continuously with demand , which varies depending on the time of day and year . to maintain a reliable supply of electricity , operators of the electricity grid — a complex network of power plants and power lines managed by utility companies and other operators — take steps to ensure power plants are available to generate electricity when needed . increasingly , renewable sources of energy , such as solar and wind , are being integrated into the grid . energy storage allows for electricity to be stored and used later when it is needed and could change the operating capabilities of the electricity grid . batteries and other energy storage technologies can store energy in one form — such as chemical , mechanical , or thermal energy — and transform that energy to generate electrical power at a later time . gao was asked to provide information on the role of energy storage in grid operations . this report describes how energy storage can be used to enhance grid operations and performance ; factors that affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations ; and federal and state policies and other efforts that address the deployment of energy storage . gao reviewed studies published from 2012 through 2017 ; and interviewed 41 stakeholders , including officials from government agencies and representatives of industry and other groups based on their knowledge of energy storage and grid operations . energy storage can be used in various ways to enhance the reliability , resilience , and efficiency of grid operations , according to studies gao reviewed and stakeholders gao interviewed . such storage can be deployed throughout the electricity system and act as a generation , transmission , distribution , or customer - sited asset to provide various services , address operational challenges and needs , and potentially reduce costs , as shown in the figure below . for example , storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions and the variability of renewable energy resources , such as solar and wind ; relieve transmission congestion ; defer the need for transmission or distribution system upgrades ; and provide backup power during a power outage . examples of potential storage applications on the electricity grid various factors affect energy storage deployment . these include industry and technology readiness , safety concerns and stringency of siting requirements , increasing use of renewable resources , cost - competitiveness of storage and challenges with quantifying the value of storage , and the regulatory environment , according to studies gao reviewed and stakeholders gao interviewed . for example , industry and technical challenges include uncertainty about the performance of certain technologies over time and in various operating conditions . federal and state policymakers have used various policies and other efforts to encourage the deployment of storage and address market barriers . for example , the department of energy has undertaken various efforts , including research and development focused on improving factors that affect the cost and capacity of certain storage technologies . in addition , the federal energy regulatory commission has issued proposed and final rules to address market barriers to storage deployment in wholesale markets . lastly , state policies and other efforts that aim to encourage the deployment of storage or to address market barriers include establishing mandates and targets for storage adoption , revising planning requirements , and offering financial incentives and funding .
