congress created the section 1603 grant program as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) . this program , administered by the u.s. department of the treasury , provides cash grant incentives for renewable energy projects . initially , the section 1603 grant program was scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. a one - year extension was enacted as part of the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-312 ) at an estimated cost of $ 3 billion . absent congressional action , the section 1603 grant program will expire at the end of 2011. as of december 6 , 2010 , grants totaling approximately $ 5.6 billion had been awarded to 1,495 entities , since section 1603 became law in february 2009. wind has received approximately 84 % of the grant award value , while solar electric represents approximately 75 % of entities that have received grant awards . `` other '' technologies ( qualifying energy property not represented by wind or solar electricity ) have also received grant awards , although the value and number of awards represented by this category is relatively small compared to wind and solar electricity . prior to the availability of section 1603 grants , qualifying renewable energy projects were federally supported primarily through the production tax credit ( ptc ) or investment tax credit ( itc ) . it has been common industry practice for renewable energy developers to partner with tax - equity investors , where the tax - equity investors offer cash in exchange for project ownership , project cash flows , tax credits , and depreciation benefits . the section 1603 grant program was motivated by difficult economic conditions and the perceived lack of tax - equity capacity to support renewable energy projects . analysis of the tax equity marketplace reveals fluctuations in the dollar volume , number of participants , and required rates of return between 2007 and 2010. market response , since section 1603 was established , has been mixed . the solar industry had a record year of installations in 2010 ( 887 megawatts ) and is forecasting another record year in 2011 ( approximately 1,700 megawatts ) . in 2010 , the wind industry experienced a 50 % decline compared to 2009 ( approximately 5 gigawatts installed in 2010 compared to 10 gigwatts installed in 2009 ) . wind industry forecasts for 2011 are approximately 7,000 megawatts . it is important to note , however , that many factors influence annual renewable energy installations , the cash grant being just one . if congress considers additional extensions to or modifications of the section 1603 grant program , economic and cost factors may also be taken into account . grants , as opposed to tax credit , may be a more efficient mechanism for delivering public funds to the renewable energy sector . as is the case with most tax or subsidy programs , however , there are concerns that grants may be going to projects that would have moved forward without added federal incentives . finally , this report presents various policy options congress may want to consider regarding the section 1603 grant and related tax credits for renewable energy . the first option presented is to allow the grant program to expire . even if the grant program were to expire , tax incentives would remain available . a second option is to extend the section 1603 grant program . an extension of the grant program may be considered alongside an extension of the ptc for wind , which is set to expire at the end of 2012. a modification to the itc and ptc , which could potentially enhance the benefits associated with the existing tax incentives , is presented as a third option .
