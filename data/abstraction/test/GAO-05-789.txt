the indian health service ( ihs ) , located within the department of health and human services , is responsible for arranging health care services for native americans ( american indians and alaska natives ) . ihs services include primary care ( medical , dental , and vision ) ; ancillary services , such as laboratory and pharmacy ; and specialty care , including services provided by physician specialists . ihs provides some services through direct care at hospitals , health centers , and health stations , which may be federally or tribally operated . when services are not available -- that is , both offered and accessible -- on site , ihs offers them , as funds permit , through contract care furnished by outside providers . concerns persist that some native americans are experiencing gaps in necessary health care . gao was asked to examine the availability of primary care services and ancillary and specialty services for native americans . additionally , gao examined the underlying factors associated with variations in the availability of services and strategies used by facilities to increase service availability . gao conducted site visits to 13 facilities and interviewed ihs officials from all 12 ihs areas , which cover all or part of 35 states . gao received written comments from ihs . ihs substantially agreed with the findings and conclusions of this report . the availability of primary care -- medical , dental , and vision -- services was largely dependent on the extent to which native americans living in ihs areas were able to gain access to the services offered at ihs - funded facilities . all of the 13 facilities gao visited offered medical services , such as physical examinations , while 12 facilities offered dental and 12 facilities offered vision services . however , access to these services was not always assured because of factors such as the amount of waiting time between the call to make an appointment and the delivery of a service , travel distances to facilities , or a lack of transportation . certain ancillary and specialty services were not always available to the native americans served by the 13 facilities , primarily because of gaps in the services offered by the facilities . while some ancillary and specialty services were offered to all patients , gao also identified gaps in other services , including services to diagnose and treat nonurgent conditions -- such as arthritis and knee injuries -- specialty dental care , and behavioral health care . most facilities lacked the staff or equipment to offer these services on site and thus had to purchase them with contract care funds , which were rationed on the basis of relative medical need at 12 of the 13 facilities . five of the 12 facilities were unable to pay for any contract care services that were not deemed emergent or acutely urgent . gao identified three distinct factors that were associated with variations in the availability of services , namely a facility 's structure , location , and funding from sources other than ihs . a facility 's structure was associated with the overall amount and range of services available . for example , hospitals offered a broader array of services on site for more hours per week compared with other facilities . location was a factor in recruiting and retaining staff for geographically remote facilities and in the cost of certain types of services , most notably transportation . finally , a facility 's funding from two types of sources -- reimbursements from private and federal health insurance programs for care offered on site and any tribal contributions made -- affected the extent to which the facility was able to offer services . the amount of these funds varied across facilities . facilities reported using at least one of six strategies to increase the availability of services . these strategies included bringing specialists on site and negotiating discounts for contract care . according to officials , the strategies were not available to , or effective for , every facility . for example , four facilities reported that while hospitals generally offered discounted rates for contract care , physicians were not always willing to do so .
