the federal transit administration ( fta ) oversees about $ 5.5 billion in federal funds each year to transit agencies serving urban areas ( grantee ) , in part through its triennial review program , which evaluates grantee adherence to federal requirements at least once every 3 years . gao recommended in a 1998 oversight report that fta improve the program . the subcommittee requested that gao review this program . gao identified the extent to which triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 ; the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process ; and fta 's performance measures for the triennial review and the extent to which they meet key attributes of successful performance measures . gao addressed these objectives by analyzing oversight data on 424 grantees that had three triennial reviews , reviewing triennial review reports and guidance , assessing fta 's performance measures ; and interviewing fta headquarters and regional officials , contractors who conduct the reviews , and grantees . gao 's analysis of fta 's triennial review oversight data found that over two - thirds of the 424 grantees analyzed have not consistently improved overall performance in terms of meeting more federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008. fifty - one percent of grantees had mixed results in meeting requirements and 17 percent consistently met fewer requirements ; while 31 percent consistently met more requirements -- one of the goals of the triennial review program . executives from three grantees that met most requirements attributed their performance to , among other things , having job descriptions that link employee responsibilities to the triennial review -- a practice they said contributed to a culture of accountability . during the same time , grantees had the greatest number of findings in 5 of 23 triennial review areas , including the procurement and drug and alcohol testing areas . while fta helps grantees address findings , additional efforts to identify the underlying causes and the severity of findings could further benefit grantees . fta 's triennial review program uses some strong management practices -- having a well - defined process , using an information system to monitor grantees , and issuing reports timely . still , two areas could be strengthened . first , while fta is legislatively required to conduct a complete review of grantees ' adherence to federal requirements at least once every 3 years , gao identified a few instances where documentation does not clearly show that fta reviewed all requirement areas . for example , 10 triennial review reports for 2008 showed that the drug and alcohol program area was `` not reviewed . . fta 's practice is to review all areas , regardless of documentation , but because fta 's guidance is not clear about how to document the review of areas where fta has conducted a related special review in the prior two years , a few grantees may not be reviewed for 5 years . fta plans to revise its guidance to avoid ambiguity . second , fta is aware of the burden oversight reviews place on grantees and works to limit this burden . however , in a limited number of cases , fta did not coordinate its special oversight reviews with the triennial review schedule , which may place undue burden on a few grantees receiving multiple oversight reviews in the same fiscal year . fta 's two timeliness performance measures for assessing the triennial review program -- closing 80 percent of grantees ' deficient findings within 30 days of their due date and issuing 95 percent of the final triennial review reports within 30 days of completing a review -- meet some , but not all key attributes of successful measures . although both measures link throughout the organization , have measurable targets , are clearly stated , and do not overlap , the `` close findings '' measure does not meet the objectivity and reliability attribute . for example , data inaccuracies in past `` close findings '' data raised questions about the reliability of the measure . also , both measures do not assess the core program activity to evaluate grantees ' performance or governmentwide priorities , such as the quality of the triennial review program , and thus , as a whole , are not balanced , making it difficult for managers to not overemphasize one priority at the expense of others .
