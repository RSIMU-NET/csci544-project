by law , married persons who file joint tax returns are each fully responsible for the accuracy of the tax return and for the full tax liability . this is true even though only one taxpayer may have earned the wages or income shown on the tax return . under the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) innocent spousal program , irs can relieve taxpayers of tax debts on the basis of equity considerations , such as not knowing that their spouse failed to pay taxes due . since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 , irs has received thousands of requests from taxpayers for innocent spouse relief . irs 's inability to provide timely responses to such requests has generated concerns among taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders . irs reached decisions on 21 percent more cases than it received in fiscal year 2001 , reducing some of its backlog from previous years . the agency accomplished this through a variety of initiatives , including a substantial staffing commitment , centralization and specialization , automated tools , and routine estimating of future workload and staffing needs . irs 's procedures conform to applicable guidance for transferring tax liabilities from joint tax accounts to individual tax accounts when innocent spouse relief has been granted . the procedures follow federal internal control guidelines by requiring a mix of checks , verifications , reconciliations , and documentation to support steps throughout the process . the web site for irs 's innocent spouse program -- part of irs 's agency wide web site -- went on - line in december 1999 to help taxpayers determine their eligibility for innocent spouse relief . because irs has not evaluated the web site , the agency does not know how useful the web site has been to taxpayers in determining their eligibility for innocent spouse relief .
