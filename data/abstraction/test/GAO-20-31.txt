for decades , the government has contracted and entered into agreements to sponsor academic , nonprofit , or private organizations to operate ffrdcs . dod military departments and other dod components sponsor 10 ffrdcs to help develop innovative solutions to diverse national security threats . five ffrdcs — referred to as s & a centers — aim to provide independent analyses to support dod policy development . federal regulation and dod guidance specify sponsors ' oversight activities , including the establishment , use , and review of ffrdcs . a senate armed services committee report included a provision that gao review dod 's use of ffrdcs . this report describes , among other objectives : dod obligations ( in dollars ) to dod 's ffrdcs from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 ; factors that led dod to use s & a centers for research ; and how dod used this research . gao analyzed obligation data for dod 's 10 ffrdcs . gao focused further review on dod 's five s & a centers that primarily provide studies and analysis . gao analyzed sponsoring agreements , comprehensive reviews , and 22 s & a center research projects selected based on factors such as obtaining a mix of project costs , and interviewed dod and ffrdc representatives . from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , the department of defense ( dod ) obligated about $ 2 billion annually to 10 dod - sponsored federally funded research and development centers ( ffrdc ) , excluding obligations related to two intelligence programs and capital equipment costs ( such as antenna or radar systems ) . of these obligations , roughly $ 400 million annually went to a subset of five ffrdcs called study and analysis ( s & a ) centers . note : obligation amounts were not adjusted for inflation and totals may be affected by rounding . a numbers in parentheses refer to the number of ffrdcs within each category . dod primarily cited strategic relationships between the sponsor ( the agency responsible for the overall use of the ffrdc ) and the ffrdc and the core competencies of the ffrdc as factors when sponsoring s & a centers and initiating projects . for example : strategic relationships . the army determined that an s & a center was uniquely qualified to conduct a research project that required knowledge of defense planning scenarios , noting that awarding the project to an industry contractor would have given that contractor a competitive advantage . core competencies . the center for naval analyses has core competencies in navy policy , strategy , and doctrine , among other things . s & a centers perform hundreds of research projects annually on behalf of dod , and dod reported using them to inform decisions , shape guidance , and identify opportunities to improve efficiency . for example , one s & a center 's study on the causes of weapons system cost overruns found dod needed to re - examine its assumptions when estimating program cost , schedule , and performance . dod officials told us the study contributed to policy , process , and training updates .
