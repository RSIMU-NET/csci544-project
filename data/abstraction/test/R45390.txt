or ( 2 ) the veteran resides in a state without a full - service va medical facility ; or ( 3 ) the veteran previously qualified under the 40-mile criterion of the vcp ; or ( 4 ) the va can not provide the veteran with care and services that comply with designated access and quality standards ; or ( 5 ) the veteran and the veteran 's primary care provider agree that it is in the best interest of the veteran to receive care in the community . in addition , the va is required to enter into contracts to build a network of private community providers . expansion of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers the va mission act expands the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers to pre - 9 / 11 veterans in two phases . under the first phase , veterans with serious service - connected injuries incurred on or before may 7 , 1975 , would qualify for benefits over a two - year period beginning on the date when the va certifies to congress that it has fully implemented the information technology system required for this program . under the second phase , those with serious service - connected injuries incurred between may 7 , 1975 , and september 11 , 2001 , would qualify for the comprehensive assistance for family caregivers program two years after implementation of the first phase . capital asset review the va mission act establishes a process for realigning and modernizing facilities of the vha . under this process , the va will develop criteria for selecting vha facilities to dispose of , modernize , or acquire , so as to better meet the health care needs of veterans . va must then create a list of recommendations based on those criteria and submit it to a newly created asset infrastructure review ( air ) commission . the air commission shall review the va 's recommendations but may not alter them , unless it determines that one or more recommendations are inconsistent with the criteria . the commission shall submit the list of recommendations to the president , who shall either approve the list in its entirety or send it back to the air commission . the air commission may change the recommendations and resubmit a revised list to the president for reconsideration . the president may approve or disapprove of the revised list . if the president approves of the original or revised list , then va must begin implementation of the recommendations within three years , unless congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval , in which case the asset review process terminates . recruiting and retaining health care providers in the vha the va mission act authorizes or expands several programs , with the intention of recruiting and retaining health care providers in the vha . among other things , the act increases the maximum amount of student loan debt that may be reduced under va 's education debt reduction program ( edrp ) ; authorizes designated scholarships for physicians and dentists under the va health professional scholarship program ( hpsp ) ; establishes the va specialty education loan repayment program to incentivize vha employees to pursue education and training in medical specialties for which va determines there is a shortage ; establishes a pilot veterans healing veterans medical access and scholarship program ; and extends eligibility for va 's edrp to clinical staff working at vet centers . the act also requires the vha to establish a program to deploy mobile health teams to serve in underserved va medical facilities . lastly , the va mission act authorizes and appropriates $ 5.2 billion in mandatory funding for the vcp until the vccp is operational .
