the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) , enacted in 1938 , is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers . while the flsa mandates broad minimum wage coverage , states have the option of establishing minimum wage rates that are different from those set in it . under the provisions of the flsa , an individual is generally covered by the higher of the state or federal minimum wage . as of 2019 , minimum wage rates are above the federal rate of $ 7.25 per hour in 29 states and the district of columbia , ranging from $ 0.25 to $ 6.75 above the federal rate . another 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate . the remaining 7 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate or do not have a state minimum wage requirement . in the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage , only individuals who are not covered by the flsa are subject to those lower rates . in any given year , the exact number of states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate may vary , depending on the interaction between the federal rate and the mechanisms in place to adjust the state minimum wage . adjusting minimum wage rates is typically done in one of two ways : ( 1 ) legislatively scheduled rate increases that may include one or several increments ; ( 2 ) a measure of inflation to index the value of the minimum wage to the general change in prices . of the 29 states and the district of columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate , 9 currently have no scheduled increases beyond 2019 , 3 states have legislatively scheduled rate increases after 2019 , and 17 states and the district of columbia have scheduled increases through a combination of planned increases and current - or future - year indexation of state minimum wage rates to a measure of inflation . because the federal and state minimum wage rates change at various times and in various increments , the share of the labor force for which the federal rate is the binding wage floor has changed over time . since 1981 , there have been three series of increases in the federal minimum wage rate â€” 1990-1991 , 1996-1997 , and 2007-2009. during that same period , there have been numerous changes in state minimum wage policies . as a result of those interactions , the share of the u.s. civilian labor force living in states in which the federal minimum wage is the floor has fluctuated but generally declined , and is about 39 % as of 2018 .
