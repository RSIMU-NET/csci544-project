pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on u.s. antidrug efforts in peru , focusing on the : rationale for , and costs associated with , the construction , maintenance , and operations of the santa lucia antidrug base ; rationale for discontinuing support of the santa lucia base ; and current status of u.s. efforts to restructure antidrug programs in peru . gao found that : the santa lucia base was constructed to place u.s. personnel in the safest possible environment from which to conduct antidrug activities ; between fiscal years 1988 and 1993 , the state department spent about $ 49.2 million to construct , maintain , and operate the santa lucia base ; in december 1993 , the u.s embassy restructured its antidrug programs in peru because it could not continue to support the base while also supporting other u.s. antidrug efforts ; although the executive branch has approved a formal mobile basing concept to implement antidrug efforts , the u.s. embassy has been slow in implementing the concept because of maintenance problems with helicopters , internal differences within the u.s. embassy over how the operational planning group would function to coordinate law enforcement operations , and the decision to stop sharing information with the government of peru that could be used to shoot down civilian aircraft suspected of drug trafficking ; and although legislation has been passed to allow information sharing on drug activities , the administration has not reached agreement with peru on certain required preconditions .
