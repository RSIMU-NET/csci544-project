rightsizing is the aligning of the number and location of staff assigned to u.s. embassies with foreign policy priorities , security , and other constraints . gao is developing a framework to enable the executive branch to assess the number and mix of embassy staff . the framework will link staffing levels to the following three critical elements of overseas operations : physical security and real estate , mission priorities and requirements , and operational costs . gao reviewed policies and practices at the u.s. embassy in paris because of its large size and history of rightsizing decisions . gao found that about 700 employees from 11 agencies work in main buildings at the paris embassy . serious security concerns in at least one embassy building in paris suggest the need to consider staff reductions unless building security can be improved . staffing levels are hard to determine because agencies use different criteria and priorities to place staff . the lack of comprehensive cost data on all agencies ' operations , which is estimated at more than $ 100 million annually in france , and the lack of an embassywide budget eliminate the possibility of cost - based decisionmaking on staffing . the number of staff could be reduced , particularly those in support positions , which constitute about one - third of the total . options include relocating functions to the united states or to regional centers and outsourcing commercial activities .
