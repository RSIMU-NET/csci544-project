pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed research studies regarding the cycle of sexual abuse , focusing on the likelihood that individuals who are victims of sexual abuse as children will become sexual abusers of children in adulthood . gao found that : there was no consensus among the 23 retrospective and 2 prospective studies reviewed that childhood sexual abuse led directly to the victim becoming an adult sexual abuser ; the retrospective studies , which sought to determine whether a sample of known sex offenders had been sexually abused as children , differed considerably in the types of offenders studied , use of control or comparison groups , and definition and reporting of childhood sexual abuse ; although some of the retrospective studies concluded that childhood sexual abuse may increase the risk that victims will commit sexual abuse later , most of the studies noted that the majority of sex offenders had not been sexually abused as children ; the prospective studies , which tracked sexually abused children into adulthood to determine how many became sex offenders , studied sample populations that may not be representative of the entire population of childhood sexual abuse victims ; and the prospective studies found that victims of childhood sexual abuse were not more likely than nonvictims to be arrested for sex offenses .
