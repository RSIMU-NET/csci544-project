the coast guard is managing a multi - billion dollar effort to modernize aging assets , including ships , aircraft , and information technology to provide new capabilities to conduct missions ranging from marine safety to defense readiness . gao has reviewed the coast guard 's acquisitions since 2001 and has found it faces challenges managing its portfolio . in 2007 , the coast guard established a cost baseline of $ 24.2 billion for 13 assets . gao was asked to examine the coast guard 's current and planned acquisition portfolio . this report assesses : operational performance and testing of selected assets ; the current cost of the coast guard 's portfolio and funding plans ; and the extent to which the coast guard is experiencing capability gaps , if any , given known affordability issues . to conduct this work , gao analyzed the operational performance and test reports for all 4 newly fielded assets that the coast guard planned to test and the costs and capabilities of its major system acquisition portfolio . gao also interviewed coast guard , dhs , and navy officials . the selected coast guard assets that gao reviewed are generally demonstrating improved performance — according to coast guard operators — but gao found that they have yet to meet all key requirements . specifically , two assets , the hc - 144 patrol aircraft and fast response cutter , did not meet all key requirements during operational testing before being approved for full - rate production , and department of homeland security ( dhs ) and coast guard guidance do not clearly specify when this level of performance should be achieved . additionally , the coast guard changed its testing strategy for the command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) system and , as a result , is no longer planning to test the system 's key requirements . completing operational testing for the c4isr system would provide the coast guard with the knowledge of whether this asset meets requirements . as acquisition program costs increase across the portfolio , consuming significant amounts of funding , the coast guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009 , in terms of the money needed to finish these programs . in 2009 , gao found that the coast guard needed $ 18.2 billion to finish its 2007 baseline , but now needs $ 20.7 billion to finish these assets . to inform congress of its budget plans , the coast guard uses a statutorily required 5-year capital investment plan , but the law does not require the coast guard to report the effects of actual funding levels on individual projects and , thus , it has not done so . for example , the coast guard has received less funding than planned in its annual budgets , but has not reflected the effects of this reduced funding in terms of increased cost or schedule for certain projects . without complete information , congress can not know the full cost of the portfolio . the coast guard has repeatedly delayed and reduced its capability through its annual budget process and , therefore , it does not know the extent to which it will meet mission needs and achieve desired results . this is because the coast guard does not have a long - term fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources . without such a plan , the coast guard can not know the extent to which its assets are affordable and whether it can maintain service levels and meet mission needs . congress should consider requiring the coast guard to include additional information in its capital investment plan . in addition , the secretary of dhs should clarify when minimum performance standards should be achieved , conduct c4isr testing , and develop a long - term modernization plan . dhs concurred with the recommendations , but its position on developing a long - term plan does not fully address gao 's concerns as discussed in the report .
