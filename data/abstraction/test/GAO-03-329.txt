making sure systems can work effectively together ( interoperability ) has been a key problem for the department of defense ( dod ) yet integral to its goals for enhancing joint operations . given the importance of being able to share intelligence data quickly , we were asked to assess dod 's initiative to develop a common ground - surface - based intelligence system and to particularly examine whether dod has adequately planned this initiative and whether its process for testing and certifying the interoperability of new systems is working effectively . dod relies on a broad array of intelligence systems to study the battlefield and identify and hit enemy targets . these systems include reconnaissance aircraft , satellites , and ground - surface stations that receive , analyze , and disseminate intelligence data . at times , these systems are not interoperable -- either for technical reasons ( such as incompatible data formats ) and / or operational reasons . such problems can considerably slow down the time to identify and analyze a potential target and decide whether to attack it . one multibillion - dollar initiative dod has underway to address this problem is to pare down the number of ground - surface systems that process intelligence data and upgrade them to enhance their functionality and ensure that they can work with other dod systems . the eventual goal is an overarching family of interconnected systems , known as the distributed common ground - surface system ( dcgs ) . to date , planning for this initiative has been slow and incomplete . dod is developing an architecture , or blueprint , for the new systems as well as an overarching test plan and an operational concept . although dcgs was started in 1998 , dod has not yet formally identified which systems are going to be involved in dcgs ; what the time frames will be for making selections and modifications , conducting interoperability tests , and integrating systems into the overarching system ; how transitions will be funded ; and how the progress of the initiative will be tracked . moreover , dod 's process for testing and certifying that systems will be interoperable is not working effectively . in fact , only 2 of 26 dcgs systems have been certified as interoperable . because 21 of the systems that have not been certified have already been fielded , dod has a greater risk that the new systems will not be able to share intelligence data as quickly as needed . certifications are important because they consider such things as whether a system can work with systems belonging to other military services without unacceptable workarounds and whether individual systems conform to broader architectures designed to facilitate interoperability across dod .
