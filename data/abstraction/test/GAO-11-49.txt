health care delivery in the united states often lacks coordination and communication across providers and settings . this fragmentation can lead to poor quality of care , medical errors , and higher costs . providers have formed integrated delivery systems ( ids ) to improve efficiency , quality , and access . the health care safety net act of 2008 directed gao to report on idss that serve underserved populations -- those that are uninsured or medically underserved ( i.e . , facing economic , geographic , cultural , or linguistic barriers to care , including medicaid enrollees and rural populations ) . in october 2009 , gao provided an oral briefing . in this follow - on report , gao describes organizational features idss use to support strategies to improve care ; approaches idss use to facilitate access for underserved populations ; and challenges idss encounter in providing care , including to underserved populations . gao selected a judgmental sample of 15 private and public idss that are clinically integrated across primary , specialty , and acute care ; they vary in their degree of integration , specific organizational features , and payer mix ( e.g . , extent to which they serve medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured ) . gao interviewed chief medical officers or other system officials at all 15 idss and conducted site visits at 4 idss , interviewing system executives and clinical staff . idss in gao 's sample reported that using electronic health records ( ehr ) , operating health insurance plans , and employing physicians all support strategies to improve patient care . an ehr contains patient and care information , such as progress notes and medications . some idss said that using ehrs supports their patient care strategies such as care coordination , disease management , and use of care protocols by increasing the availability of individual patient and patient population data and by improving communication among providers . idss also reported that operating a health insurance plan can support patient care strategies by providing to the ids both financial resources , such as savings from reducing avoidable hospitalizations for health insurance plan members , and data on plan members . for example , financial resources could be used to fund services such as care coordination -- which many insurers do not reimburse -- and the data could assist with strategies such as disease management . employment of physicians was reported to facilitate physician accountability for quality of care because physicians who are employed by the ids must meet certain performance indicators , and the idss collect data on and review physician performance . employment of physicians was also reported to increase adherence to care protocols and to facilitate provision of care to underserved populations through compensation that mitigates physicians ' concerns that they might not receive payment from uninsured patients . idss in the sample discussed several approaches they use to facilitate access to care for underserved populations . these approaches include using community - based settings , such as school - based health centers and federally qualified health centers ( fqhc ) ; conducting outreach ; helping patients apply for coverage programs such as medicaid ; providing financial assistance ; and collaborating with community organizations , including faith - based organizations . for example , some idss operate fqhcs within their system , and others collaborate with local fqhcs that are not part of their system . in addition , to improve access to mental health care services for patients , including those in underserved populations , some idss integrate mental health and primary care services . idss in the sample reported facing various operational challenges in providing care , including care for underserved populations . some reported that not receiving reimbursement from health care insurance companies for the care coordination services they provide to patients is a financial challenge . other operational challenges idss identified included finding specialty care for underserved patients , including mental health care ; sharing clinical information in patients ' ehrs with providers outside the system ; and changing management and physician cultures to adapt to organizational change . the department of health and human services reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
