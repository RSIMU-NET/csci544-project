as demand for transit and competition for available federal funding increases , transit project sponsors are increasingly looking to alternative approaches , such as public - private partnerships , to deliver and finance new , large - scale public transit projects more quickly and at reduced costs . gao reviewed the role of the private sector in u.s. public transit projects as compared to international projects ; the benefits and limitations of and barriers , if any , to greater private sector involvement in transit projects and how these barriers are addressed in the department of transportation 's ( dot ) pilot program ; and how project sponsors and dot can protect the public interest when these approaches are used . gao reviewed regulations , studies , and contracts and interviewed u.s. , canadian , and united kingdom officials ( identified by experts in the use of these approaches ) . in the united states , the private sector role in delivering and financing transit projects through alternative approaches , such as public - private partnerships , has been more limited than in international projects . the private sector role in u.s. projects has focused more on how they are delivered rather than how they are financed , while the private sector role in international projects has focused on both project delivery and financing . since 2000 , seven new large - scale construction projects funded through fta 's fixed guideway capital investment program -- new starts program -- have been completed using one of two alternative project delivery approaches , and none of these projects included private sector financing . in 2005 , congress authorized fta to establish a pilot program to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative approaches and how the new starts program could better allow for them . alternative approaches can offer potential benefits such as a greater likelihood of completing projects on time and on budget , but also involve limitations such as less project sponsor control over operations . the sequential and phased new starts process is a barrier because it is incompatible with alternative approaches and thus does not allow for work to be completed concurrently , which can lead to delays and increased costs . under its pilot program , fta can grant major streamlining modifications to the new starts process for up to three project sponsors , but has not yet granted any such modifications because fta has found that none of the projects has transferred enough risk , in particular financial responsibilities , to the private sector . fta has the ability within its pilot program to further experiment with the use of long - standing existing tools that could encourage a greater private sector role while continuing to balance the need to protect the public interest . this includes forms of conditional funding approvals used by other dot agencies and international governments . fta also lacks an evaluation plan to accurately and reliably assess the pilot program 's results , including the effect of its efforts to streamline the new starts process for pilot project sponsors . without such a plan , agencies and congress will be limited in their decision making regarding the pilot program . transit project sponsors protect the public interest in alternative approaches through , for example , the use of performance standards and financial assessments to evaluate the costs and benefits of proposed approaches . other governments have established entities to assist project sponsors in protecting the public interest . these entities have better equipped project sponsors to implement alternative approaches by creating a uniform approach to developing project agreements and serving as a repository of institutional knowledge . dot can serve as a valuable resource for transit project sponsors by broadening its current efforts , including providing technical assistance and encouraging the use of additional financial assessments , among other measures .
