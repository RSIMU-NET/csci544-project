the reclamation fund was established in 1902 to fund the development of irrigation projects on arid and semiarid lands of the 17 western states . it originated as a revolving fund for construction projects and was supported by the proceeds of the sale of land and water in the western united states . over time , it was amended to receive proceeds from a number of other sources . it is currently derived from repayments and revenues associated with federal water resources development as well as the sales , rentals , and leases ( including natural resource leasing ) of federal land in the western united states . portions of the fund 's balance are appropriated annually by congress for multiple purposes , including some of the operational expenditures of the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) and the power marketing administrations . through fy2012 , collections deposited into the reclamation fund totaled more than $ 40 billion , while total appropriations from the fund totaled more than $ 30 billion . the reclamation fund did not finance all reclamation investments in the western united states . as a result of limited funding availability , a number of large dams and other reclamation investments were financed by the general fund of the u.s. treasury . notwithstanding advances to the reclamation fund by congress in 1910 and 1931 , deposits into and appropriations out of the fund have been roughly equal over time . from the 1940s until the 1990s , the fund maintained a small , relatively stable balance . beginning in the mid - 1990s , balances in the fund began to increase significantly as receipts from mineral leasing and power sales increased , while appropriations from the fund largely remained static . at the end of fy2012 , the fund had a balance of more than $ 10.8 billion , and it is expected to continue to grow . receipts deposited into the reclamation fund are made available to reclamation by congress through annual discretionary appropriations bills , which are subject to congressional budgetary allocations . some have proposed that congress appropriate some portion of the surplus balance in the reclamation fund to reclamation activities in western states , including new water storage projects or the rehabilitation of existing projects . these interests argue that the reclamation fund was set up to benefit western states and should now be used to increase investments in these areas . as the balance of the reclamation fund continues to increase , congress may reevaluate the reclamation fund 's status , including its financing of new or ongoing activities . the omnibus lands act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-11 ) included provisions that will transfer $ 120 million per year from the fund from fy2020 through fy2034 , without further appropriation , to a separate fund that provides for indian water settlement construction projects . in the 113th congress , a bill before the senate ( s. 715 ) proposes to redirect funding that would otherwise go to the reclamation fund for the construction of rural water projects . major changes to the reclamation fund may have scoring implications in the annual budget and under congressional pay - as - you - go rules .
