individuals may be subject to certain restrictions when leaving the government for private employment or joining the government from the private sector . these restrictions were enacted in response to what is often referred to as the revolving door . generally , the revolving door is described as the movement of individuals between the public and private sector . individuals may move because they possess policy and procedural knowledge and have relationships with former colleagues that are useful to prospective employers . laws attempting to restrict the movement of individuals between the government and the private sector have existed since at least the late 1800s . today 's revolving door laws focus on restricting former government employees ' representational activities that attempt to influence federal officials with whom they used to work . found at 18 u.s.c . â§207 , revolving door laws for executive branch officials include ( 1 ) a lifetime ban on `` switching sides '' ( e.g . , representing a private party on the same `` particular matter '' involving identified parties on which the former executive branch employee had worked while in government ) ; ( 2 ) a two - year ban on `` switching sides '' on a broader range of issues ; ( 3 ) a one - year restriction on assisting others on certain trade and treaty negotiations ; ( 4 ) a one - year `` cooling off '' period for certain senior officials on lobbying ; ( 5 ) two - year `` cooling off '' periods for very senior officials from lobbying ; and ( 6 ) a one - year ban on certain former officials from representing a foreign government or foreign political party . in addition to laws , executive orders have been used to place further restrictions on executive branch officials , including officials entering government . for example , president trump issued an executive order ( e.o . 13770 ) to lengthen `` cooling off '' periods for certain executive branch appointees both entering and exiting government . to date , much of the empirical work concerning the revolving door has focused on former members of congress or congressional staff leaving capitol hill , especially those who become lobbyists in their postcongressional careers . this report provides some empirical data about a different aspect of the revolving doorâthe movement into and out of government by executive branch personnel . using research conducted by the bush school of government and public service at texas a & m university 's capstone class over the 2017-2018 academic year , this report presents data about the revolving door in the executive branch through the lens of president george w. bush 's and president barack obama 's administrations . the analysis includes cabinet department officials who were listed , for either administration , in the united states government policy and supporting positions ( the plum book ) . through an examination of appointees in president bush 's and president obama 's administrations , several findings emerge . first , approximately 92 % of executive branch officials in the examined dataset were never registered lobbyists , while 8 % were registered lobbyists at some point before or after their government service . second , cabinet departments differed greatly in the number of officials who were registered lobbyists either before or after their federal service . although every cabinet department surveyed had some percentage of officials registered as lobbyists either before or after their government service , the percentage of officials included in the dataset who registered as lobbyists before their government service , after their government service , or both ranged from a high of 18 % ( department of commerce ) to a low of 1 % ( department of justice ) . third , the data also show that for lobbyists entering government , the percentage of officials in the dataset who had been lobbyists before government serving in the bush and obama administrations ranged from 10 % in the department of labor to 61 % in the department of veterans affairs . the analogous percentages for government employees in the dataset leaving to become lobbyists ranged from 39 % in the department of veterans affairs to 82 % in the department of transportation . finally , the report identifies several areas for potential congressional consideration . in recent years , several bills have been introduced in congress to address many of these potential areas . these include options to amend existing `` cooling off '' periods and evaluate the administration and enforcement of revolving door regulations . alternatively , congress may choose to maintain current `` cooling off '' periods , administration , and enforcement practices .
