the department of defense ( dod ) has , in the past , lacked a strategic approach to human capital management . in april 2002 , dod issued two human capital strategic plans for military personnel . one plan addresses military personnel management and policies ; the second addresses quality of life issues affecting service members and their families . as a follow - on to its recent work on benefits for military personnel , gao reviewed the extent that these two plans , in addressing military benefits , promote the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions -- two critical success factors for human capital planning . gao also reviewed dod 's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans . dod 's human capital plans addressing military personnel and quality of life represent a positive step forward in fostering a more strategic approach to human capital management . the two plans lay some of the groundwork needed to incorporate benefits into the strategic management of human capital . the plans , for example , recognize that benefits are important elements to meeting recruiting and retention goals and to alleviating some of the hardships of military life . however , the two plans do not satisfy the two critical success factors gao has identified for human capital planning . the plans do not specifically address how dod will integrate and align benefits with other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals . dod 's plans identify a number of initiatives , but the plans do not describe how individual initiatives , many of which are studies , will work in conjunction with one another to meet dod 's goals and objectives . for example , one of dod 's initiatives is to study alternatives to the military retirement system , and another initiative is to study variable career lengths for officers . however , the human capital plans do not explain how these two initiatives may be integrated and aligned with each other to achieve desired outcomes . the military personnel strategic plan also does not identify outcome - oriented performance measures or discuss , at a strategic level , military workforce needs or gaps in meeting these needs -- the kinds of data used by high - performing organizations to manage their human capital . dod lacks a process for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans from a strategic vantage point . without such a process , dod may have difficulty integrating and aligning benefits and other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and promoting a data - driven , performance - oriented approach to human capital management . moreover , an oversight process could help dod officials maintain the momentum of their strategic human capital planning efforts . dod is considering establishing a defense human resources board to maintain the viability of its strategic human capital planning , but dod officials have not determined the roles and responsibilities of the board .
