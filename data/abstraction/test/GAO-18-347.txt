tickets for concerts , theater , and sporting events can be purchased — typically online — from the original seller ( primary market ) or a reseller ( secondary market ) . some state and federal officials and others have raised issues about ticketing fees , the effect of the secondary market on ticket prices , and the transparency and business practices of some industry participants . event ticketing is not federally regulated . however , federal legislation enacted in 2016 restricts bots ( ticket - buying software ) . also , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) has taken two enforcement actions related to deceptive marketing by ticket sellers under its broad ftc act authority . gao was asked to review issues around online ticket sales . this report examines what is known about online ticket sales , consumer protection issues related to such sales , and potential advantages and disadvantages of selected approaches to address these issues . gao focused on concert , theater , and major league sporting events for which there is a resale market . gao analyzed data on fees , ticket volume , and resale prices from a variety of sources ; reviewed the largest ticket sellers ' websites and purchase processes ; and reviewed federal and state laws and relevant academic literature . gao also interviewed and reviewed documentation from government agencies ; consumer organizations ; ticket sellers ; venue operators ; promoters and managers ; sports leagues ; and academics ( selected for their experience and to provide a range of perspectives ) . ticket pricing , resale activity , and fees for events vary . tickets to popular events sold on the primary market sometimes are priced below the market price , partly because performers want to make tickets affordable and maintain fans ' goodwill , according to industry representatives . tickets are often resold on the secondary market at prices above face value . in a nongeneralizable sample of events gao reviewed , primary and secondary market ticketing companies charged total fees averaging 27 percent and 31 percent , respectively , of the ticket 's price . consumer protection issues include difficulty buying tickets at face value and the fees and marketing practices of some market participants . professional resellers , or brokers , have a competitive advantage over consumers in buying tickets as soon as they are released . brokers can use numerous staff and software ( “ bots ” ) to rapidly buy many tickets . as a result , many consumers can buy tickets only on the resale market at a substantial markup . some ticket websites gao reviewed did not clearly display fees or disclosed them only after users entered payment information . “ white - label ” resale sites , which often appear as paid results of internet searches for venues and events , often charged higher fees than other ticket websites — sometimes in excess of 40 percent of the ticket price — and used marketing that might mislead users to think they were buying tickets from the venue . selected approaches gao reviewed , such as ticket resale restrictions and disclosure requirements , would have varying effects on consumers and businesses . nontransferable tickets . at least three states restrict nontransferable tickets — that is , tickets whose terms do not allow resale . nontransferable tickets allow more consumers to access tickets at a face - value price . however , they also limit consumers ' ability to sell tickets they can not use , can create inconvenience by requiring identification at the venue , and according to economists , prevent efficient allocation of tickets . price caps . several states cap the price at which tickets can be resold . but according to some state government studies , the caps generally are not effective because they are difficult to enforce . disclosure requirements . stakeholders and government research gao consulted generally supported measures to ensure clearer and earlier disclosure of ticket fees , although views varied on the best approach ( for example , to include fees in an “ all - in ” price or disclose them separately ) . some market - based approaches are being used or explored that seek to address concerns about secondary market activity . these approaches include technological tools and ticket - buyer verification to better combat bots . in addition , a major search engine recently required enhanced disclosures from ticket resellers using its advertising platform . the disclosures are intended to protect consumers from scams and prevent potential confusion about who is selling the tickets .
