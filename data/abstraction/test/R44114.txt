the u.s. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly - pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) has reported 223 cases of hpai in domestic flocks in 15 states . with the start of summer , the finding of new cases slowed . the last reported new case was in iowa on june 17 , 2015. more than 48 million chickens , turkeys , and other poultry have been euthanized to stem the spread of the disease . cases have been caused by several highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza ( ai ) strains that result in substantial mortality in domestic poultry . turkey and egg - laying hen farms in minnesota and iowa have been hardest hit . commercial broiler farms have not been affected to date . according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , no infections in humans have been associated with the hpai outbreak , and the public health risk is low . under the animal health protection act ( ahpa ; 7 u.s.c . ยง8301 et seq . ) , aphis , in cooperation with state and local animal health officials , has the authority to take extraordinary measures , such as seizing , restricting movement , or euthanizing animals to protect the health of animals . during the current outbreak , aphis has paid to euthanize poultry , clean and disinfect poultry premises and equipment , and then test for the ai virus to ensure poultry farms can be safely repopulated . usda has indemnified poultry owners for euthanized poultry . usda has received approval to use nearly $ 700 million in additional funds from the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) to address hpai . as of july 7 , 2015 , aphis has committed over $ 500 million of the $ 700 million to help producers control the spread of hpai , including $ 190 million for indemnity payments . the agency is committed to covering cleaning and disinfecting costs on affected farms . the cost of the hpai outbreak to the poultry industry is high . the value of turkey and laying hen losses is estimated at nearly $ 1.6 billion . economy - wide losses are estimated at $ 3.3 billion . since the hpai outbreak in december 2014 , 18 u.s. trading partners have imposed bans on all shipments of u.s. poultry and products , and 38 trading partners have imposed partial , or regional , bans on shipments from states or parts of states with hpai cases . china , russia , and south korea , 3 of the top 10 destinations for u.s. poultry meat in 2014 , have banned all imports of u.s. poultry . it is believed that an hpai outbreak is likely to occur again in the fall when wild birds begin their migrations through the four flyways . this may result in more spread of ai , possibly in the poultry - producing eastern and southeastern regions untouched by the current outbreak . aphis and the poultry industry are taking lessons from the current outbreak to prepare for the fall . usda is developing a vaccine to be available for manufacture if the agency decides to adopt a vaccination policy to manage any future outbreak . aphis and the poultry industry are reassessing biosecurity , indemnity payment formulas , and other measures that aim to improve the containment and elimination process .
