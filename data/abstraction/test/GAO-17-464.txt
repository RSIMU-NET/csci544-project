gsa is responsible for contracts providing telecommunications services for federal agencies . transitions involving previous contracts faced significant delays resulting in increased costs . because gsa 's current telecommunications program , networx , expires in may 2020 , planning for the next transition has begun . gao was asked to review preparations for the transition . this report addresses the extent to which gsa 's plans and guidance to agencies incorporate lessons learned from prior transitions , and agencies are following established planning practices in their transitions . in performing this work , gao analyzed gsa lessons learned and transition guidance . gao also selected five agencies — usda , dol , dot , sec , and ssa — based on size , structure , and networx spending . gao then reviewed the agencies ' documentation to determine how they followed five planning practices identified in previous gao reports . the general services administration 's ( gsa 's ) transition guidance to agencies addressed roughly half of its previously identified lessons learned . gsa identified 35 lessons learned from previous telecommunications contract transitions that identify actions that agencies should take . in transition guidance released to agencies , gsa fully addressed 17 of the 35 lessons . two lessons from previous transitions were not appropriate for the current transition . gsa partially addressed an additional nine lessons . seven lessons were not addressed at all ( see figure ) . for example , gsa 's guidance did not address the previous lesson that agencies should not assume that a transition to a new contract with the same vendor will be easier than a change in vendors . by not including all lessons learned in its plans and guidance to agencies , gsa limits agencies ' ability to plan for actions that will need to be taken later in the transition . as a result , agencies face an increased risk that they could repeat prior mistakes , including those that could result in schedule delays or unnecessary costs . selected agencies — the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , labor ( dol ) , and transportation ( dot ) ; the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and the social security administration ( ssa ) — have yet to fully apply most of the five planning practices previously identified by gao as key to a successful telecommunications transition . the practices encompass : developing inventories , incorporating strategic needs into transition planning , incorporating strategic needs into transition planning , developing a structured transition - management approach , identifying resources necessary for the transition , and establishing transition processes and measures of success . sec fully implemented one practice , partially implemented three practices , and did not implement another . the other four agencies partially implemented each of the five practices . agencies provided various reasons for not following planning practices , including uncertainty due to delays in gsa awarding the new contracts , plans to implement practices later as part of established agency procedures for managing it projects , and a lack of direction and contractor assistance from gsa . if agencies do not fully implement the practices in the next transition , they will be more likely to experience the kinds of delays and increased costs that occurred in previous transitions . gao recommends that gsa disseminate guidance that includes all agency - directed lessons learned . in addition , gao recommends that usda , dol , dot , sec , and ssa complete adoption of the planning practices to avoid schedule delays and unnecessary costs . five agencies agreed with all of our recommendations . ssa agreed with two recommendations , partially disagreed with one , disagreed with two , and provided updated information . gao stands by the recommendations , as discussed in the report , and revised the report based on ssa 's new information .
