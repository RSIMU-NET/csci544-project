kosovo , a country in the western balkans with a predominantly albanian - speaking population , declared independence from serbia in 2008 , less than a decade after a brief but lethal war . it has since been recognized by about 100 countries . the united states and most european union ( eu ) member states recognize kosovo . serbia , russia , china , and various other countries ( including some eu member states ) do not . key issues for kosovo include the following : resuming talks with serbia . an eu - facilitated dialogue between kosovo and serbia , aimed at normalization of relations , stalled in 2018 when kosovo imposed tariffs on serbian goods in response to serbia 's efforts to undermine kosovo 's international legitimacy . despite u.s. and eu pressure , the parties have not resumed talks . on april 1 , 2020 , acting prime minister albin kurti conditionally lifted tariffs against serbian imports ; this step was praised by eu officials but drew u.s. criticism because of the government 's simultaneous pledge to gradually introduce measures to match serbian barriers to the movement of goods and people . government collapse . the governing coalition led by albin kurti of the self - determination party ( vetã « vendosje ) lost a vote of confidence in march 2020 , less than two months after it had formed . the outgoing government comprises two parties formerly in opposition , both of which had campaigned on an anti - corruption platform . among other factors , the collapse was attributed to divisions over managing relations with serbia amid u.s. pressure on the government to immediately lift tariffs against serbian imports , as well as to domestic political infighting . kosovo 's leaders disagree over how to proceed from the current political crisis . strengthening the rule of law . the victory of kurti 's vetã « vendosje in the october 2019 election partly reflected widespread voter dissatisfaction with corruption . weakness in the rule of law contributes to kosovo 's difficulties in attracting foreign investment and complicates the country 's efforts to combat transnational threats . relations with the united states . kosovo regards the united states as a key ally and security guarantor . kosovo receives the largest share of u.s. foreign assistance to the balkans , and the two countries cooperate on numerous security issues . the united states is the largest contributor of troops to the nato - led kosovo force ( kfor ) , which has contributed to security in kosovo since 1999. in 2019 , the trump administration appointed a special representative for the western balkans and a special presidential envoy for serbia and kosovo peace negotiations . these appointments are considered to reflect the administration 's interest in securing a comprehensive settlement between kosovo and serbia and may signal a potentially greater u.s. role in a process that the eu has largely facilitated to date . leaders in kosovo generally have welcomed greater u.s. engagement , but some observers expressed concern over reported u.s. pressure on the kurti government to lift tariffs on serbian goodsâincluding pausing some u.s. assistance to kosovoâand over perceived u.s. support for the no - confidence session that resulted in the march 2020 government collapse . u.s. officials maintain that the united states is committed to working with any government formed in compliance with constitutional processes . transatlantic cooperation . since the kosovo war ended in 1999 , the united states , the eu , and key eu member states have largely coordinated their efforts to promote regional stability in the western balkans , including efforts to normalize relations between kosovo and serbia . more recently , however , some observers have expressed concern that transatlantic coordination has weakened on some issues relating to the kosovo - serbia dialogue and to kosovo 's current political impasse . congress was actively involved in debates over the u.s. response to a 1998-1999 conflict in kosovo and subsequently supported kosovo 's declaration of independence . today , many members of congress continue to support kosovo through country - or region - specific hearings , congressional visits , and foreign assistance funding levels averaging around $ 50 million per year since 2015 .
