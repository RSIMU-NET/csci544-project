in 2002 , the united states experienced one of the worst wildland fire seasons in the past 50 years -- almost 7 million acres burned . these fires included the largest and costliest fire in oregon in the past century -- the biscuit fire . following a lightning storm , five fires were discovered in the siskiyou national forest over a 3- day period beginning july 13. these fires eventually burned together to form the biscuit fire , which burned nearly 500,000 acres in southern oregon and northern california and cost over $ 150 million to extinguish . gao evaluated whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified ; what resource management issues , if any , affected the ability of personnel to fight the fire ; and what differences , if any , existed in key certification standards for personnel among federal and state agencies and whether these differences affected efforts to respond to the fire . in commenting on a draft of this report , the forest service stated that the report appears to be accurate and the agency generally agrees with its contents . the department of the interior did not provide comments . national policies and procedures were in place and provided the framework to guide personnel in the local interagency dispatch center in grants pass , oregon , who were responsible for acquiring resources to fight the biscuit fire . these policies and procedures provide for a multilevel dispatching system where , if sufficient firefighting personnel and equipment are not available locally , resource requests can be elevated to other dispatch centers at the regional and , if necessary , national level . to facilitate the swift suppression of new fires , local dispatch center personnel can contact neighboring centers directly , including those in adjacent regions , before elevating resource requests . when the first two fires were found on july 13 , the grants pass dispatch center did not have sufficient firefighting resources available locally . grants pass personnel requested resources from the responsible regional center in portland , as well as from a dispatch center in central oregon , but no resources were immediately available in the region due to other higher priority fires that were threatening lives and property . grants pass personnel did not request resources from a neighboring interagency dispatch center in fortuna , california , located in an adjoining dispatch region , because they believed the center had no available resources due to fire activity there . state officials working at the fortuna dispatch center later said that a fortuna - based helicopter fighting fires in northern california near the first of the five biscuit fires could have been made available to suppress this fire . however , forest service officials working with fortuna personnel disagreed , saying that the helicopter had been needed to fight fires in california . because no request was made , there was no discussion on that first day about whether the biscuit fire would have been the best use of the helicopter , and it is unclear , in any case , what the outcome of such a request would have been . following the initial days of the biscuit fire , delays in obtaining needed personnel hampered efforts to fight the rapidly growing fire . specifically , officials faced problems obtaining highly experienced management teams to direct suppression strategies and crews to carry the strategies out , supervisors to manage crews and equipment , and support staff to monitor the training and experience of contracted crews . an unusually severe fire season , with many other higher priority fires , affected the availability of personnel needed to fight the biscuit fire . finally , while some differences exist in certification standards for personnel between federal and state agencies responsible for fighting wildland fires , these differences did not appear to affect efforts to respond to the biscuit fire .
