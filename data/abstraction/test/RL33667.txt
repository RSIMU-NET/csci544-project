presidential signing statements are official pronouncements issued by the president contemporaneously to the signing of a bill into law that , in addition to commenting on the law generally , have been used to forward the president 's interpretation of the statutory language ; to assert constitutional objections to the provisions contained therein ; and , concordantly , to announce that the provisions of the law will be administered in a manner that comports with the administration 's conception of the president 's constitutional prerogatives . while the history of presidential issuance of signing statements dates to the early 19th century , the practice has become the source of significant controversy in the modern era as presidents have increasingly employed the statements to assert constitutional and legal objections to congressional enactments . president reagan initiated this practice in earnest , transforming the signing statement into a mechanism for the assertion of presidential authority and intent . president reagan issued 250 signing statements , 86 of which ( 34 % ) contained provisions objecting to one or more of the statutory provisions signed into law . president george h. w. bush continued this practice , issuing 228 signing statements , 107 of which ( 47 % ) raised objections . president clinton 's conception of presidential power proved to be largely consonant with that of the preceding two administrations . in turn , president clinton made aggressive use of the signing statement , issuing 381 statements , 70 of which ( 18 % ) raised constitutional or legal objections . president george w. bush continued this practice , issuing 161 signing statements , 127 of which ( 79 % ) contain some type of challenge or objection . the significant rise in the proportion of constitutional objections made by president george w. bush was compounded by the fact that his statements were typified by multiple objections , resulting in more than 1,000 challenges to distinct provisions of law . although president barack obama has continued to use presidential signing statements , the obama administration has used the interpretive tools with less frequency than previous administrations â€” issuing 20 signing statements , of which 10 ( 50 % ) contain constitutional challenges to an enacted statutory provision . the number and scope of such assertions in the george w. bush administration gave rise to extensive debate over the issuance of signing statements , with the american bar association ( aba ) publishing a report declaring that these instruments are `` contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers '' when they `` claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of congress . . however , in analyzing the constitutional basis for , and legal effect of , presidential signing statements , it becomes apparent that no constitutional or legal deficiencies adhere to the issuance of such statements in and of themselves . rather , it appears that the appropriate focus of inquiry in this context is on the assertions of presidential authority contained therein , coupled with an examination of substantive executive action taken or forborne with regard to the provisions of law implicated in a presidential signing statement . applying this analytical rubric , it seems evident that the issues involved center not on the simple issue of signing statements , but rather on the view of presidential authority that governs the substantive actions of the administration in question . this report focuses on the use of signing statements by recent administrations , with particular emphasis on the administrations of george w. bush and barack obama .
