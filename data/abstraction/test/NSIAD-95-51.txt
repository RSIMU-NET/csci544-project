pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the impact of peace operations on the u.s. military forces ' capability to respond to regional conflicts , focusing on the : force structure limitations that affect the military 's ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations ; and options available for increasing force flexibility and response capability . gao found that : peace operations have heavily stressed some u.s. military capabilities , including army support forces and specialized air force aircraft ; because there are relatively few support forces in the military 's active force , some of these units and personnel have been deployed to consecutive operations , the tempo of operations has increased , and the time available to prepare for combat missions has been reduced ; extended participation in multiple or large scale peace operations could impede the services ' ability to timely respond to major regional conflicts ( mrc ) ; disengaging support units and specialized aircraft from a peace operation and redeploying them to mrc could be more difficult than estimated because some of these units need training and supplies before deploying to another major operation ; the options available to dod to meet the demands of peace operations while maintaining the capability to respond to mrc include changing the mix of active and reserve forces and making greater use of reserves and contractors ; and the united states needs to determine the resources it needs and degree of risk it is prepared to take if it wishes to continue participating in sizeable peace operations for extended periods and still maintain the capability needed to rapidly respond to simultaneous mrc .
