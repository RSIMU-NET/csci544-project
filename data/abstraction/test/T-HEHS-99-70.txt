pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the privacy of medical records used for health research , focusing on : to what extent medical information used for research depends on personally identifiable information ; research that is and is not subject to current federal oversight requirements ; how the institutional review board ( irb ) ensures the confidentiality of health information used in research ; and what steps organizations have taken to safeguard information . gao noted that : the survey revealed that a considerable amount of health research relies on personally identifiable information ; while some of this research is subject to irb review -- either because it is federally supported or regulated research or because the organization voluntarily applies federal rules to all of its research -- some of the organizations conduct records - based research that is not reviewed by an irb ; the process of irb review does not ensure the confidentiality of medical information used in research -- primarily because the provisions of the common rule related to confidentiality are limited ; according to recent studies , the irb system on the whole is strained ; and nevertheless , although external review of their research is limited , most of the organizations in gao 's study told gao that they have various security safeguards in place to limit internal and external access to paper and electronic databases , and many say they have taken measures to ensure the anonymity of research and survey subjects .
