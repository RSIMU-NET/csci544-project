the internet offers consumers a convenient method for purchasing drugs that is sometimes cheaper than buying from traditional brick - and - mortar pharmacies . according to a recent fda survey , nearly 1 in 4 adult u.s. internet consumers have purchased prescription drugs online . however , many internet pharmacies are fraudulent enterprises that offer prescription drugs without a prescription and are not appropriately licensed . these rogue internet pharmacies may sell drugs that are expired , improperly labeled , or are counterfeits of other drugs . a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for administering and enforcing laws related to internet pharmacies , including state boards of pharmacy , fda , doj , cbp , and ice . the food and drug administration safety and innovation act directed gao to report on problems with internet pharmacies . this report identifies how rogue sites violate federal and state laws , challenges federal agencies face in investigating and prosecuting operators , efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and efforts to educate consumers about the risks of purchasing prescription drugs online . to conduct this work , gao interviewed officials from fda , doj , cbp , ice , and other federal agencies , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency data and documents . gao also interviewed officials from five state boards of pharmacy with varied approaches to regulating internet pharmacies , and stakeholders including nabp , drug manufacturers , and companies that provide services to internet businesses , such as payment processors . rogue internet pharmacies violate a variety of federal and state laws . most operate from abroad , and many illegally ship prescription drugs into the united states that have not been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , that is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs . many also illegally sell prescription drugs without a prescription that meets federal and state requirements . rogue sites also often violate other laws , including those related to fraud , money laundering , and intellectual property rights . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting those involved . according to federal agency officials , piecing together rogue internet pharmacy operations can be difficult because they may be composed of thousands of related websites , and operators take steps to disguise their identities . officials also face challenges investigating and prosecuting operators because they are often located abroad . the department of justice ( doj ) may not prosecute such cases due to competing priorities , the complexity of these operations , and challenges related to bringing charges under some federal laws . despite these challenges , federal and state agencies as well as stakeholders have taken actions to combat rogue internet pharmacies . federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions , fines , and asset seizures from rogue internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them . fda and other federal agencies have also collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to disrupt rogue internet pharmacy operations . the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , which are responsible for enforcing laws related to the importation of goods such as prescription drugs , have also worked with other agencies , including fda , to interdict rogue internet pharmacy shipments at the border . given that most rogue internet pharmacies operate from abroad , states have faced challenges combating them , and generally focus their oversight on licensed in - state entities that fulfill orders for rogue internet pharmacies . companies that provide services to internet - based businesses , such as search engines and payment processors , have also taken action -- primarily by blocking services to them . fda and others have taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of buying prescription drugs from rogue internet pharmacies . fda recently launched a national campaign to raise public awareness about the risks of purchasing drugs online , and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) posts information on its website about how to safely purchase drugs online . however , rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated marketing methods to appear legitimate , making it hard for consumers to differentiate between legitimate and rogue sites . hhs , doj , and dhs provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
