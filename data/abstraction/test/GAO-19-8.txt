poverty can have a profound effect on academic outcomes and college readiness and students from low - income families are less likely to go to college . the low rates of degree attainment for low - income students raises questions about whether the students who wish to pursue higher education have access to courses that support their readiness for college . gao was asked to review college preparatory course offerings in u.s. high schools . this report examines the extent to which high schools of different poverty levels offer courses to prepare students academically for college , and describes the challenges students in high - poverty schools face being prepared to attend college . gao analyzed 2015-16 education data on course offerings by school poverty level , type , and size , and developed a generalized linear regression model to explore whether certain school - level characteristics may be associated with course offerings ; reviewed a generalizable sample of public 4-year college websites for course requirements for admission ; and interviewed officials from education and the department of justice . gao also conducted site visits to 12 high - poverty high schools in 3 states selected to provide variation in course offerings , among other things . in this review , gao focused on public 4-year colleges because they offer a bachelor 's degree and are generally a more affordable 4-year option . students in relatively poor and small schools had less access to high school courses that help prepare them for college , according to gao 's analysis of department of education ( education ) data for school year 2015-16 ( the most recent available ) . while most public high schools , regardless of poverty level , offered courses like algebra and biology , disparities in access were associated with school poverty level for more advanced courses like calculus , physics , and those that may allow students to earn college credit , like advanced placement ( ap ) courses ( see figure ) . high - poverty schools were less likely to offer the math and science courses that most public 4-year colleges expect students to take in high school , according to gao 's analysis of college websites . gao 's regression analysis also showed that smaller schools and certain types of schools , like charter schools , are less likely to offer the college preparatory math or science courses that many colleges look for during the admissions process . officials gao interviewed in selected high - poverty high schools said their students can face a number of complex challenges in preparing for college . for instance , officials said that many students are academically behind when they enter high school and are unable to progress to more advanced courses . further , high - poverty schools may not offer rigorous courses , such as ap courses , due to lack of resources or teaching staff . students in high - poverty schools also face other stressors that can make going to college challenging . officials at 9 of the 12 schools gao visited cited the effects of poverty on their students , such as homelessness , hunger , and trauma , that make preparing for college difficult . school officials also said the steps involved in applying to and enrolling in college can be difficult to navigate for many students in high - poverty schools . officials in selected schools reported efforts to address these challenges , such as offering free college courses and obtaining outside supports to assist with college advising .
