future demographic trends include a doubling of the nation 's retiree population and only modest labor force growth , leading to concerns about retirement income adequacy for future generations . credible projections of the effects of policy proposals on federal spending and future retirees ' income are necessary . because adequate data is critical to the analysis of retirement income and wealth , gao was asked to identify data improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement income and wealth , as well as factors limiting efforts to obtain the needed information . experts consulted by gao cited priorities for improving retirement data that fit into two broad categories : obtaining better data from employers on employee benefits and obtaining better data by linking more individual and household surveys with administrative data ( such as employer records , and social security earnings history records ) . information from employers , such as documents describing the features of their pension plans , would enable analysts to forecast future retirement income of pension holders , based on the specific features of their pension plans and the likely distribution of pension income and wealth for different segments of the population . linking individual and household surveys with administrative data creates new information , such as the demographic characteristics of employees whose pensions are affected by the formulas that employers use to calculate contributions or pension payments . analysts attribute the shortcomings in retirement income data primarily to fragmentation of the responsibility for data collection and analysis , the burden of data collection on respondents , and confidentiality considerations that restrict access to these data . fragmentation of responsibility occurs , in their view , because no single agency has a statutory mandate to collect or to analyze all the data needed to support a more comprehensive study of retirement income and wealth . with regard to respondent burden , some information on pension plans is no longer collected , in part , out of concern that it was an unnecessary burden on the firms having to submit it . finally , certain kinds of data needed to make projections are not widely available to all analysts because of the confidentiality laws that authorize their collection .
