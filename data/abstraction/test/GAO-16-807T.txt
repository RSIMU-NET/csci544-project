va operates one of the nation 's largest health care systems , serving millions of veterans each year . for almost two decades , the department has undertaken a patchwork of initiatives with dod to increase interoperability between their respective electronic health record systems . during much of this time , va has also been planning to modernize its system . while the department has made progress in these efforts , it has also faced significant information technology challenges that contributed to gao 's designation of va health care as a high risk area . this statement summarizes gao 's august 2015 report ( gao - 15-530 ) on va 's efforts to achieve interoperability with dod 's electronic health records system . it also summarizes key content from gao 's reports on duplication , overlap , and fragmentation of federal government programs . lastly , this statement provides updated information on va 's actions in response to gao 's recommendation calling for an interoperability and electronic health record system plan . even as the department of veterans affairs ( va ) has undertaken numerous initiatives with the department of defense ( dod ) that were intended to advance the ability of the two departments to share electronic health records , the departments have not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts . in an august 2015 report , gao recommended that the two departments establish a time frame for identifying outcome - oriented metrics , define related goals as a basis for determining the extent to which the departments ' systems are achieving interoperability , and update their guidance accordingly . since that time , va has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome - oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas and has begun to establish baseline measurements . gao is continuing to monitor va 's and dod 's efforts to define metrics and report on the interoperability results achieved between the departments . following an unsuccessful attempt to develop a joint system with dod , va switched tactics and moved forward with an effort to modernize its current system separately from dod 's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system . the department took this course of action even though , in may 2010 , it identified 10 areas of health care business needs in common with those of dod . further , the results of a 2008 study pointed out that more than 97 percent of inpatient requirements for electronic health record systems are common to both departments . gao noted that the departments ' plans to separately modernize their systems were duplicative and recommended that their decisions should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches . the departments agreed with gao 's recommendations and stated that their initial comparison indicated that separate systems would be more cost effective . however , the departments have not provided a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous approaches . further , both departments developed schedules that indicated their separate modernization efforts will not be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the previous joint system approach . va has developed a number of plans to support its development of its electronic health record system , called vista , including a plan for interoperability and a road map describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018. according to the road map , the first set of capabilities was delivered by the end of september 2014 and included a foundation for future functionality , such as an enhanced graphical user interface and enterprise messaging infrastructure . however , a recent independent assessment of health information technology ( it ) at va reported that lengthy delays in modernizing vista had resulted in the system becoming outdated . further , this study questioned whether the modernization program can overcome a variety of risks and technical issues that have plagued prior va initiatives of similar size and complexity . although va 's under secretary for health has asserted that the department will complete the vista evolution program in fiscal year 2018 , the chief information officer has indicated that the department is reconsidering how best to meet its future electronic health record system needs . in prior reports , gao has made numerous recommendations to va to improve the modernization of its it systems . among other things , gao has recommended that va address challenges associated with interoperability , develop goals and metrics to determine the extent to which the modernized systems are achieving interoperability , and address shortcomings with planning . va generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
