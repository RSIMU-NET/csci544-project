pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the readiness of the insurance industry to meet the year 2000 date change , focusing on : what state regulators were doing to oversee the year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry ; how the regulatory oversight of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness compared with the oversight of the banking and securities industries ; the status of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; and the nature and extent of year 2000 liability exposures that insurers face and the mitigation efforts taken to address such exposures . gao noted that : the 17 state insurance regulators gao visited differed in their approach and level of oversight activity directed to the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; these state regulators also differed in how they assessed and ranked insurance companies in terms of year 2000 readiness ; such variations raise a question about the extent to which states can rely on one another 's judgments regarding the preparedness of nondomiciled insurance companies doing business in their states ; this question is especially applicable to those states where the level of year 2000 oversight is relatively limited or the criteria for assessing readiness may be considered lax ; variations in oversight approaches among state regulators also made it difficult to ascertain the overall status of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; regulatory oversight of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness began later than the oversight of the banking and securities industries ; the state insurance regulators gao visited were less active in their efforts to promote year 2000 readiness and efforts to validate information on the status of companies ' readiness ; they were also less active in planning for and pursuing formal enforcement actions against companies identified as inadequately preparing for 2000 and at a high risk of not being ready for the millenium change ; regulatory information on the year 2000 readiness of the nation 's insurance industry , consisting primarily of self - reported information obtained through surveys , does not provide the necessary information to judge whether the industry will be ready for 2000 ; insurance regulators and other observers gao contacted generally have a favorable view of the industry 's year 2000 readiness ; these regulators and industry observers expressed confidence that companies were actively preparing for the year 2000 date change because of competitive pressures and the business need to process date - sensitive information before 2000 ; the magnitude of insurers ' year 2000-related liability exposures can not be estimated at this time , and the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate these exposures remains uncertain ; costs associated with year 2000-related exposures could be substantial for some property - casualty insurers , due to potential claims and legal defense costs ; and despite efforts to mitigate potential exposures , the year 2000-related costs that may be incurred by insurers will remain uncertain until key legal issues and actions on pending legislative initiatives are resolved .
