the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) requires or authorizes various federal financial regulators to issue hundreds of rules to implement reforms intended to strengthen the financial services industry . gao is required to annually study financial services regulations . this report examines the regulatory analyses , including cost - benefit analyses , financial regulators have performed to assess the impact of selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; how financial regulators consulted with each other in implementing the selected final rules to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and what is known about the impact of the final rules . gao examined the 32 final dodd - frank act rules in effect as of july 21 , 2011 ; the regulatory analyses conducted for 10 of the 32 rules that allowed for some level of agency discretion ; statutes and executive orders requiring agencies to perform regulatory analysis ; and studies on the impact of the dodd - frank act . gao also interviewed regulators , academics , and industry representatives.. federal financial regulators are required to conduct a variety of regulatory analyses , but the requirements vary and none of the regulators are required to conduct benefit - cost analysis . all financial regulators must analyze the paperwork burden imposed by their rules and consider the impact of their rules on small entities as part of their rulemaking process . the commodity futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission are also required under their authorizing statutes to consider certain benefits and costs of their rules . as independent regulatory agencies , the federal financial regulators are not subject to executive orders requiring federal agencies to conduct detailed benefit - cost analysis in accordance with a guidance issued by the office of management and budget ( omb ) . financial regulators are not required to follow omb 's guidance , but most told gao that they attempt to follow the guidance in principle or spirit . gao 's review of regulators ' rulemaking policies and 10 final rules found inconsistencies in the extent to which omb 's guidance was reflected . gao recommends that to the extent the regulators strive to follow omb 's guidance , they should take steps to more fully incorporate the guidance into their rulemaking policies and ensure that it is consistently followed . although federal financial regulators have coordinated their rulemaking , they generally lacked formal policies to guide these efforts . the dodd - frank act establishes interagency coordination requirements for certain agencies and for specific rules or subject matters . however , for other rules , the regulators have discretion as to whether interagency coordination should occur . the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) is tasked with facilitating coordination among member agencies but , to date , has played a limited role in doing so beyond its own rulemakings as it continues to define its role . several regulators voluntarily coordinated with each other on some of the rules gao reviewed . however , most of the regulators , including the bureau of consumer financial protection , lacked written protocols for interagency coordination , a leading practice that gao has previously identified for interagency coordination . gao recommends that fsoc work with the financial regulators to develop such protocols for dodd - frank act rulemaking . little is known about the actual impact of the final dodd - frank act rules , given the short amount of time the rules have been in effect . regulators are required to conduct reviews of existing regulations to assess their impact , but some have not yet developed plans to review their dodd - frank act rules . to maximize the usefulness of these reviews , gao recommends that the regulators identify what data will be needed to retrospectively assess the impact of the rules in the future . fsoc is also required to examine , among other things , financial market and regulatory developments and make recommendations to enhance the efficiency , competitiveness , and stability of u.s. financial markets . although fsoc officials said that fsoc plans to include an impact analysis of the dodd - frank act rules in its future reports , it has not yet begun identifying and collecting the data needed for this type of analysis . gao recommends that fsoc direct the office of financial research , an entity created to support the research needs of fsoc , to work with the regulators to identify and begin collecting data needed for future analyses . gao is making four recommendations to the regulators and fsoc to strengthen the prospective and retrospective analyses of the impact of dodd - frank act regulations on financial markets and improve coordination among financial regulators on rulemaking . regulators and fsoc generally agreed with the report 's findings but most neither agreed nor disagreed with the report 's recommendations .
