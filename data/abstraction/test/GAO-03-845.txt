in june 2002 , gao reported that the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) had not yet adequately revised its regulatory and oversight approach for the natural gas and electricity industries ' transition from regulated monopolies to competitive markets . gao also concluded that ferc faced significant human capital challenges to transform its workforce to meet such changes . in responding to the report , ferc said that the new office of market oversight and investigations ( omoi ) it was creating and human capital improvements under way would address these concerns . gao was asked to report on ferc 's progress in establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and improving agency - wide human capital management . ferc has made strides in putting an energy market oversight and enforcement capability in place , but work remains to ensure that its efforts will be comprehensive and systematic . since ferc declared omoi functional in august 2002 , the office has focused primarily on outlining its vision , mission , and primary functions ; developing basic work processes ; integrating its use of an array of tools to oversee the markets ; and hiring staff with market experience . omoi is also assessing its data needs and developing its working relationships with others , such as the industry 's market monitoring units . nonetheless , the office still has work to do in the following two key areas . clearly defining its role : omoi has not clearly defined its role and the activities that it will engage in to achieve its mission . for example , the office has not yet decided on the level of detail at which it will review electricity markets . this decision has substantial implications for the office 's data , technology , resource , and staff skill mix needs . developing formal processes and written procedures : omoi 's processes are largely informal and ad hoc , and it has few written procedures to ensure that its efforts are coordinated , systematic , understood by its staff , and transparent to its stakeholders . although omoi has had some early accomplishments -- such as a $ 20 million civil penalty against a company for anticompetitive behavior -- it is difficult to judge how effective the office will be until its role and major processes are clearly set out . ferc is also making progress toward addressing its considerable human capital management challenges , but additional actions could increase its likelihood of success . ferc 's success in these efforts is important because the extent to which it can carry out its mission in a changing environment depends on its ability to adjust its staff skills and abilities in a difficult context . for example , over half of its workforce will be eligible to retire by 2007. in response , ferc has , among other things , expanded its use of certain personnel flexibilities , such as recruiting and retention bonuses , and is considering use of additional flexibilities . more importantly , ferc , in february 2003 , developed a human capital plan . however , the plan does not contain some elements key to successful implementation , including details on specific activities and resources needed to implement its human capital initiatives and results - oriented measures that can be used to track the agency 's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness . ferc also has not established time frames for many of its human capital initiatives .
