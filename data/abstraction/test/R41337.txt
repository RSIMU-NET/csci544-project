congress and the executive , as well as outside organizations , have long been attentive to the evaluation of federal programs , with frequent interest paid to the independent status of the evaluator . this interest continues into the current era , with numerous illustrations of the multi - faceted approaches adopted and proposed . an evaluation may provide information at any stage of the policy process about how a federal government policy , program , activity , or agency is working . congress has required evaluations through legislation ( or requested these via its committee and member offices ) ; and the executive branch has pursued evaluations through presidential or agency directives . part of choosing how to carry out an evaluation involves deciding if some kind of `` independence '' would be a desirable attribute . observers often see independence as a means of avoiding or deterring bias and ensuring an objective , impartial assessment . in the context of evaluation , independence may apply to an evaluation or to an evaluator . on one hand , for example , the term may relate to independence of an evaluation from the policy preferences of an individual or group ( `` independent evaluation '' ) , perhaps by prohibiting political appointees from revising or evaluating a program . independence may refer to an entity that conducts evaluations that also is located outside the immediate organization responsible for policy implementation ( `` independent evaluator '' ) . there is some diversity of opinion regarding the definition of independence and how it might be ensured . for example , an evaluator 's `` external '' status , outside the organization that is implementing a program , does not necessarily equate with independence . nor would an evaluator 's `` internal '' status , inside the implementing organization , necessarily equate with a lack of independence for an evaluation ( e.g . , if an expert panel reviewed the internally produced evaluation for bias ) . there is varying opinion concerning when independence is necessary , or possibly counterproductive , and what value it may bring . the differences of opinion among definitions and perceived need notwithstanding , instances of independent program evaluators appear to be growing in number and variety at the federal level . this report focuses on examples of independent evaluators ( ies ) : when an evaluation is to be conducted by an entity outside the immediate organization that is responsible for policy implementation , and the entity also is intended to have one or more dimensions of independence . ies and similar constructs , however , vary across a number of characteristics and attributes : structure , jurisdiction , authority , resources , length of tenure , and specific duties and responsibilities . these differences , in turn , could affect their capabilities , effectiveness , and assistance to others , including their contributions to the oversight of a program or project by congress and the executive branch . after an overview of such entities — which encompass new units created specifically for conducting an evaluation as well as existing ones , such as the government accountability office and offices of the inspectors general — this report suggests possible broad characteristics and criteria of independent evaluators or similar units , which could be valuable in oversight or legislative endeavors . the appendix describes a number of such offices — past , present , and proposed — along with citations to relevant official documents and other materials for each example ( public laws , legislative proposals , executive branch directives , and secondary analyses ) . this report will be updated as conditions warrant .
