gao discussed proposed amendments to the single audit act of 1984 and the act 's importance . gao noted that : congress enacted the act in response to state and local governments ' poor accounting practices and lack of accountability for federal funds ; audits were not uniform and some grantees were subjected to multiple annual audits while others were not audited for long periods of time ; state and local governments have greatly improved their accountability and financial management under the act ; proposed amendments would reduce administrative burdens on grantees who receive comparatively small amounts by raising audit thresholds so that audit coverage returns to the 95-percent level ; grantees below the thresholds would still have to maintain records and be subject to monitoring ; the amendments require the office of management and budget to develop a risk - based approach to targeting audit resources at higher - risk programs ; the amendments ' required summary reports would increase audit timeliness and usefulness ; shortening the audits ' due date to 9 months from the fiscal year 's close would also improve the audits ' timeliness ; bringing nonprofit organizations under the act would subject all grantees to uniform requirements ; and the proposed amendments would make the single audits the basis for other audits .
