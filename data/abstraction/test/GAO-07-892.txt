responders to the world trade center ( wtc ) attack were exposed to many hazards , and concerns remain about long - term health effects of the disaster and the availability of health care services for those affected . in 2006 , gao reported on problems with the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) wtc federal responder screening program and on the centers for disease control and prevention 's ( cdc ) distribution of treatment funding . gao was asked to update its 2006 testimony . gao assessed the status of services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , efforts by cdc 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area , and niosh 's awards to grantees for treatment services and efforts to estimate service costs . gao reviewed program documents and interviewed hhs officials , grantees , and others . hhs 's wtc federal responder screening program has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of services for federal responders . from january 2007 to may 2007 , the program stopped scheduling screening examinations because there was a change in the administration of the wtc federal responder screening program , and certain interagency agreements were not established in a timely way to keep the program fully operational . in april 2006 the program also stopped scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services because a contract with the program 's new provider network did not cover these services . almost a year later , the contract was modified , and the program resumed scheduling and paying for these services in march 2007. niosh is considering expanding the wtc federal responder screening program to include monitoring -- follow - up physical and mental health examinations -- and is assessing options for funding and service delivery . if federal responders do not receive monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 , niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in 7 states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in may 2007 , it took steps toward expanding the provider network . however , these efforts are incomplete . niosh has awarded treatment funds to four nyc - area programs , but does not have a reliable cost estimate of serving responders . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded $ 44 million for outpatient treatment and set aside $ 7 million for hospital care . the new york / new jersey wtc consortium and the new york city fire department wtc program , which received the largest awards , used niosh 's funding to continue outpatient services , offer full coverage for prescriptions , and cover hospital care . program officials expect that niosh 's outpatient treatment awards will be spent by the end of fiscal year 2007. niosh lacks a reliable estimate of service costs because the estimate that niosh and its grantees developed included potential costs for certain program changes that may not be implemented , and in the absence of actual treatment cost data , they relied on questionable assumptions . it is unclear whether the estimate overstates or understates the cost of serving responders . to improve future cost estimates , hhs officials have required the two largest grantees to report detailed cost data .
