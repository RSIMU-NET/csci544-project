farmers and other agricultural producers are exposed to natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes , and tornadoes . in the aftermath of such events , fsa and sba disaster assistance programs can provide an important safety net for these producers . however , after past natural disasters , industry groups and others have raised concerns that some small agricultural producersparticularly aquaculture ( such as farmed fish and shellfish ) and nursery ( such as trees and plants ) producersreported being ineligible to obtain this assistance . gao was asked to examine fsa and sba disaster assistance programs and the coverage they provide to small producers ; identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers participation in these disaster assistance programs ; and examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing such assistance to these producers . gao reviewed the 10 fsa and sba disaster assistance programs that become available following a natural disaster and that provide direct financial assistance or loans to these producers , interviewed agency officials and industry representatives , and reviewed agency documents and regulations . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) and the small business administration ( sba ) have 10 disaster assistance programs that small agricultural producers and businesses that support agriculture can use to recover from natural disasters . these programs serve largely different populations but leave few gaps in the disaster assistance available to most small agricultural producers . aquaculture and nursery producers could be eligible for six of these programs , but their participation is limited by awareness and eligibility issues . gao identified three factors that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers ' participation in the 6 disaster assistance programs for which they could be eligible . in particular , the producers are often not aware of the programs , have other options for assistance , or do not qualify because they do not meet certain program requirements . both fsa and sba conduct outreach related to their disaster assistance programs , but neither agency has specifically targeted its efforts toward small aquaculture and nursery producers . as a result , eligible producers are missing opportunities to obtain assistance that could help them maintain a viable business after experiencing a natural disaster . fsa and sba engaged in some informal efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers . however , the efforts were limited because fsa field staff know little about sba 's disaster assistance programs , and sba staff know little about the factors that affect whether an agricultural loan will be repaid . gao has reported that agencies with complementary programs can enhance the value of these programs through interagency collaboration . without more formal collaboration , small producers may not be consistently referred by one agency to the other , leading to fewer opportunities for these small producers to get assistance for which they otherwise might qualify . gao recommends that usda and sba target outreach to small aquaculture and nursery producers , for example , by building on existing outreach , and develop a strategy to formally collaborate on disaster assistance for such producers . usda and sba generally concurred with gao 's recommendations .
