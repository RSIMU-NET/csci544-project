pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on whether : the social security administration 's ( ssa ) plan to process 8.1 million continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) during fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will result in cdrs being done for all beneficiaries for whom cdrs are required by law ; and disability determination services ' ( dds ) cdr processing capacity and the cdr funding authorized by congress for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will be sufficient to process the cdrs required by law . gao noted that : by the end of fiscal year ( fy ) 2002 , if ssa completes its new cdr plan as envisioned , all cdrs required by law will be complete or under way , including those that are overdue and those due to be started by the end of fy 2002 ; when ddss award disability benefits , they set due dates for starting cdrs , and every month these prescheduled cdr start dates come due for many beneficiaries ; because cdrs can require up to 1 year to complete from the time beneficiaries are selected for cdrs , many cdrs can not be completed by the end of the fiscal year in which they become due ; ssa estimates that about 835,000 of the required cdrs due to be started in fy 2002 will not be completed by yearend ; these cdrs will be completed in fy 2003 , according to ssa ; of the 8.1 million cdrs planned for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 , ssa plans to complete 53 percent through brief questionnaires mailed to selected beneficiaries and 47 percent through full medical reviews conducted by ddss ; according to ssa , in formulating its plan , ssa consulted with ddss to plan caseloads that will not exceed the ddss ' case processing capacity ; however , ddss could potentially encounter additional caseloads not envisioned in ssa 's plan ; for several beneficiary groups , ssa is still working to develop statistical formulas for selecting appropriate mailer recipients ; if ddss have to conduct more full medical reviews to replace cdr mailers , the authorized funds could prove inadequate because full medical reviews cost significantly more than mailers ; if ssa 's assumptions about economic growth and unemployment do not prove accurate or if the test results for ssa 's disability process redesign plan are not positive , the volume of initial disability applications and requests for reconsideration of denied applications could potentially be larger than assumed by ssa ; if so ddss could face even larger backlogs of these non - cdr cases in order to complete cdr full medical reviews in a timely manner ; recognizing the potential uncertainty of the cdr and non - cdr workloads , ssa plans to monitor them closely ; ssa acknowledged that its cdr plan may require revisions and that unexpected workload increases , if they occur , could lead ssa to decide to increase the case processing capacity of state ddss ; and potential barriers to the timely expansion of dds capacity exist as well , such as shortages of qualified applicants and office space , state hiring freezes , and the time required to train and mentor new staff .
