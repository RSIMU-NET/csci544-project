the federal crop insurance program provides farmers with risk management tools to address crop yield and / or revenue losses on their farms . farmers can purchase subsidized policies that pay an indemnity when their production or revenue falls below a guaranteed level . historically , the federal crop insurance program primarily has covered traditional farm program crops such as wheat , corn , and soybeans . however , the crop insurance program has expanded in recent decades , and policies are available now for a wide range of commodities , including specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables . in 2009 , specialty crop policies covered more than 7 million acres , which was roughly one - half to three - quarters of specialty crop area , depending on how total area is calculated . in total , crop insurance is available for over 80 specialty crops , making the program the primary financial safety net for specialty crop producers . the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the federal crop insurance act , as amended ( 7 u.s.c . 1501 et seq . ) . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) risk management agency ( rma ) operates the federal crop insurance corporation ( fcic ) , which is the funding mechanism for the program . insurance policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies . the insurance companies ' losses are reinsured by usda , and their administrative and operating costs are reimbursed by the federal government . federal crop insurance policies for specialty crops ( and other crops as well ) are generally either yield - based or revenue - based . for most yield - based policies , a producer can receive an indemnity if there is a yield loss relative to the farmer 's `` normal '' ( historical ) yield . insurable causes of loss include drought , excess precipitation , hail , frost , freeze , fire ( if due to natural causes ) , and insects and disease . revenue - based policies protect against crop revenue loss resulting from declines in yield , price , or both . nursery crop producers can be protected against loss of an `` asset '' due to weather damage ( but not price loss ) . also relevant for specialty crop producers is whole - farm insurance , which protects against losses in whole farm revenue rather than just for an individual crop . an endorsement is available in some areas for protecting against loss due to quarantine . while additional policies have been introduced in the last 10 years , producers and some members of congress would like to enhance crop insurance for specialty crop producers . in the 112th congress , several legislative proposals have been introduced . the local farms , food , and jobs act of 2011 ( h.r . 3286 / s . 1773 ) would enhance whole farm insurance and insurance for organic crops . the rural economic farm and ranch sustainability and hunger ( refresh ) act of 2011 ( s. 1658 and h.r . 3111 ) would also enhance whole farm insurance . the specialty crop insurance act of 2011 ( s. 1905 ) would support the development of new policies . in the 112th congress , specialty crop provisions in these and other proposals have been included in the senate - passed farm bill ( s. 3240 ) and the house committee - passed farm bill ( h.r . 6083 ) . the bills require usda to conduct more research on higher coverage levels for whole farm revenue insurance and study insurance for food safety and contamination - related losses . a provision would revise the value of crop insurance for all organic crops to reflect prices of organic ( not conventional ) crops . for crops not insurable with crop insurance , additional coverage would become available under the existing noninsured crop assistance program ( nap ) . finally , a provision in s. 3240 would subsidize the purchase of existing private - sector index - based weather insurance , which protects against specific weather events and not actual loss .
