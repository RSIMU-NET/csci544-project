the federal workforce , like the nation 's workforce as a whole , is aging , and increasingly large percentages are becoming eligible to retire . eventually baby boomers will leave the workforce and when they do , they will leave behind gaps in leadership , skills , and knowledge due to the slower - growing pool of younger workers . gao and others have emphasized the need for federal agencies to hire and retain older workers to help address these shortages . building upon earlier testimony , gao was asked to examine age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which agencies hire and retain older workers ; workforce challenges selected agencies face and the strategies they use to hire and retain older workers ; and actions taken by the office of personnel management ( opm ) to help agencies hire and retain experienced workers . to address these questions , gao analyzed data from opm 's central personal data file , interviewed officials at three agencies with high proportions of workers eligible to retire , and identified agencies ' promising practices to hire and retain older workers . what gao recommends the proportion of federal employees eligible to retire is growing . while this proportion varies across agencies , in four agencies -- the agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the small business administration , and the department of transportation -- 46 percent of the workforce will be eligible to retire by 2012 , well above the governmentwide average of 33 percent . while these eligibility rates suggest that many will retire , the federal government has historically enjoyed relatively high retention rates , with 40 percent or more of federal employees remaining in the workforce for at least 5 years after becoming eligible . beyond retaining older workers , in fiscal year 2007 , federal agencies hired almost 14,000 new workers who were 55 years of age or older and brought back about 5,400 federal retirees to address workforce needs . the increasing numbers of retirement - eligible federal workers present challenges and opportunities . the three agencies we reviewed ( hud , ssa , and usaid ) share common challenges . all have large proportions of employees nearing retirement , and according to officials , due to past hiring freezes all have relatively few midlevel staff to help pass down knowledge and skills to less experienced employees . officials from all three agencies also told us that they have difficulty attracting qualified staff with specialized skills . to address these challenges , the three agencies rely on older workers in different ways . usaid brings back its knowledgeable and skilled retirees as contractors to fill short - term job assignments and to help train and develop the agency 's growing number of newly hired staff . ssa uses complex statistical models to project potential retirements in mission critical occupations and uses these data to develop recruitment efforts targeted at a broad pool of candidates , including older workers . while all three agencies rely on older workers to pass down knowledge and skills to junior staff , hud officials told us this is the primary way they involve older workers , due in part to the agency 's focus on recruiting entry - level staff . in addition , some federal agencies have developed practices that other agencies might find useful in tapping older workers to meet short - term needs . for example , the department of state has developed databases to match interested retirees with short - term assignments requiring particular skills . to help agencies hire and retain an experienced workforce , opm provides guidance , including support tools and training , and has taken steps to address areas of concern to older workers . for example , opm has initiated actions to streamline the federal application process and to eliminate barriers that deter some federal retirees from returning to federal service or from working part - time at the end of their careers . however , although some federal agencies have developed strategies that could be used effectively by other agencies to hire and retain experienced workers to meet workforce needs , this information is not widely available . and , while opm has other methods available -- such as its human capital and electronic government practices web sites -- that could be used to efficiently package and broadly disseminate this information to a much larger audience , it currently has no plans to do so .
