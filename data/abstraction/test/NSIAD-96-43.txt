pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the reliability and mission capability of c - 5 aircraft and the department of defense 's ( dod ) plan for modifying c - 5 aircraft . gao found that : dod is relying on c - 5 aircraft to deliver about half of the wartime cargo carried by military aircraft , but c - 5 mission - capable rates have fallen short of the air force 's goal and those of other aircraft , because of a lack of spare parts and the complexity and poor reliability of the c - 5 ; the air force could improve the c - 5 mission capable rate by conducting a readiness evaluation similar to the one it completed for b - 1b aircraft and by giving a higher priority to certain c - 5 modernization initiatives ; the air force has not prioritized proposed c - 5 modifications and decisionmakers have not fully assessed the impact that these proposed improvements would have on overall aircraft mission capability ; and if peacetime c - 5 mission capable rates were raised to the air force 's goal , dod could better meet its airlift requirements .
