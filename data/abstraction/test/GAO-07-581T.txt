the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is responsible for addressing the threat of nuclear smuggling . radiation detection portal monitors are key elements in our national defenses against such threats . dhs has sponsored r & d and testing activities to develop a `` next generation '' portal monitor , known as the advanced spectroscopic portal monitor . however , each one costs 6 times more than a current portal monitor . in march 2006 , we recommended that dhs conduct a cost - benefit analysis to determine whether the new portal monitors are worth the additional cost . in june 2006 , dhs issued its analysis . in october 2006 , we issued our report that assessed the dhs study . gao 's statement , based on our october 2006 report , addresses whether dhs 's cost - benefit analysis provides an adequate basis for its decision to purchase and deploy the next generation portal monitors . dhs 's cost - benefit analysis does not provide a sound analytical basis for its decision to purchase and deploy the new portal monitor technology . our review of the analysis determined that it had the following problems . regarding the performance of the portal monitors : instead of using the results of its own portal monitor tests conducted in 2005 , dhs assumed that the new portal monitor technology would correctly detect and identify highly enriched uranium ( heu ) 95 percent of the time -- a performance level that far exceeds the new technology 's current capabilities . to determine the performance of the current generation of portal monitors in detecting heu , dhs used data from limited tests carried out in 2004 that test officials concluded were unreliable for such purposes . dhs 's analysis of the new technology portal monitors was incomplete because the analysis focused on identifying heu , but did not fully consider how well the new portal monitor technology could correctly detect or identify other dangerous radiological or nuclear materials . regarding cost estimates : in comparing the costs of the new and current technologies , the procurement costs of the current generation portal monitors were highly inflated because dhs assumed a unit cost of about $ 131,000 . however , the contract price at the time of the analysis was about $ 55,000 . according to officials who manage the contract , it was to expire and they expected portal monitor prices to increase , but not nearly as much as dhs assumed . dhs stated that the primary benefit of deploying the new portal monitors is reducing unnecessary secondary inspections . however , dhs 's analysis does not fully estimate today 's baseline costs for secondary inspections , which makes it impossible to determine whether the use of the new portal monitors as currently planned , will result in significant cost savings for these inspections . the new portal monitor contract price has exceeded dhs 's total cost estimate by about $ 200 million . the cost - benefit analysis shows the total cost for deploying both current and new portal monitors to be about $ 1 billion . however , in july 2006 , dhs announced that it had awarded contracts to develop and purchase up to $ 1.2 billion worth of the new portal monitors over 5 years . dhs 's cost - benefit analysis omitted many factors that could affect the cost of new portal monitors , such as understating the life - cycle costs for operating and maintaining the equipment over time . for these reasons , dhs 's cost - benefit analysis does not meet the intent of our march 2006 report recommendation to fully assess the costs and benefits before purchasing any new equipment .
