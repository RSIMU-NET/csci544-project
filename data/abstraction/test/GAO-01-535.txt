the u.s. tax system is based on voluntary reporting . the internal revenue service ( irs ) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with tax laws governing this voluntary system . despite these efforts , each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid , which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs , higher tax rates , or both . there are three types of voluntary compliance measures : filing compliance , which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner ; payment compliance , which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner ; and reporting compliance , which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns . this report reviews the status of irs ' plans to measure voluntary reporting compliance as well as six other federal programs that currently measure voluntary compliance . gao found that irs has tried to develop an approach for measuring voluntary compliance . it has established objectives and guiding principles for developing this measure as well as developed database software to collect and analyze data . as of march 2001 , irs ' preliminary draft plan included four alternatives for measuring voluntary reporting compliance . gao found that each of the six programs measure compliance by gathering different types and amounts of information from a random sample of clients . sample sizes range from about 1,400 to more than 500,000 annually . in all but one program , clients are randomly selected and interviewed in person .
