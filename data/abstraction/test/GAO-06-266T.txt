the u.s. commercial aviation industry has an extraordinary safety record . however , when passenger airlines have accidents or serious incidents , regardless of their rarity , the consequences can be tragic . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) works to maintain a high level of safety through an effective safety oversight system . keys to this system are to : establish programs that focus resources on areas of highest safety risk and on mitigating risks ; provide training and communication to ensure that inspectors can consistently carry out the agency 's oversight programs ; and have processes and data to continuously monitor , evaluate , and improve the numerous oversight programs that make up the safety oversight system . this statement focuses on these three key areas and is based on recent gao reports on faa 's inspection oversight programs , industry partnership programs , enforcement program , and training program . faa 's safety oversight system includes programs that focus on risk identification and mitigation through a risk - based system safety approach , leveraging of resources through designee and partnership relationships , and enforcement of safety regulations , but the benefits of these programs are not being fully realized . for example , faa 's system safety approach includes the addition of a program that emphasizes risk identification to its traditional inspection program for overseeing some airlines , which is not based on risk . however , it is likely that the benefits of this approach could be enhanced if the inspection workload was not as heavily oriented to the traditional inspection program 's non - risk based activities . faa leverages its resources through its designee programs , in which designated individuals and organizations perform about 90 percent of certification - related activities , and through its industry partnership programs , which are designed to assist the agency in receiving safety information . an outgrowth of faa 's inspection process is its enforcement program , which is intended to ensure industry compliance with safety regulations . however , gao has expressed concerns that this program may not be as effective as it could be in deterring violations . faa has made training an integral part of its safety oversight system , but several actions could improve the results of its training efforts , including ensuring that inspectors are well - trained in faa 's system safety approach and have sufficient knowledge of increasingly complex aircraft and systems to effectively identify safety risks . faa has established mandatory training requirements for its workforce and designees . we have reported that faa has generally followed effective management practices for planning , developing , delivering , and assessing the impact of its technical training for safety inspectors . gao has found inadequate evaluative processes and limitations with data for faa 's inspection programs , designee programs , industry partnership programs , and enforcement program . for example , faa lacked requirements or criteria for evaluating its designee programs . in another example , faa 's nationwide enforcement database is not as useful as it could be because of missing or incomplete historical information about enforcement cases .
