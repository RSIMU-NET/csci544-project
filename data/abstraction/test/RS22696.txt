in credit suisse securities v. billing , the supreme court examined whether entities in a heavily regulated industry are necessarily entitled to immunity from prosecution under the federal antitrust laws simply by virtue of their regulated status . the court had previously ruled that , absent a specific congressional mandate , such immunity may be granted only by findings either of `` clear repugnance '' between the regulatory scheme and enforcement of the antitrust laws , or sufficiently pervasive regulation of an industry as would be disrupted by application of the antitrust laws ; the credit suisse opinion reaffirms that reasoning . a class of securities investors alleged that they had paid artificially inflated prices for certain securities because of purportedly antitrust - violative actions taken by the underwriters of some initial public offerings ( ipos ) . the challenged practices included the formation of syndicates ; requiring purchasers of ipos to make future purchases ( `` laddering '' ) ; and requiring purchasers to buy other , less desirable securities ( `` tying '' ) . in response , defendants / appellants asserted that they were immune to prosecution under the antitrust laws because of the pervasive regulation of the securities industry by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , which administers a comprehensive system of regulation including major parts of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934. the sec , they argued , should be the sole arbiter of the validity of their actions , notwithstanding that congress had not expressly so provided in the applicable legislation . although the district court , which agreed with the underwriters , dismissed the case , the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed after a lengthy discussion of supreme court case law in the area . the supreme court reversed the court of appeals , accepting the `` pervasive regulation of the securities industry '' argument . specifically , it found that the conduct at issue was `` at the core of marketing new securities , '' noted that `` securities regulators proceed with great care to distinguish the encouraged and permissible from the forbidden , '' and concluded , therefore , `` that the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible with the application of the antitrust laws in this context . . this report will not be updated .
