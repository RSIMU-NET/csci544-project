the general services administration ( gsa ) controls more than 8,700 owned and leased buildings with 422 million square feet of floor space , which represents about 12.6 % of the government 's 3.354 billion total building square footage .sometimes referred to as the `` government 's landlord , '' gsa has the authority to acquire , operate , and dispose of real property on behalf of other federal agencies , including the judiciary . its portfolio includes courthouses , land ports of entry , and federal office space . prior to seeking appropriations , gsa is required to obtain congressional authorization for constructing , purchasing , leasing , or renovating real property . to that end , gsa submits a prospectus to two committees — the senate committee on environment and public works and the house committee on transportation and infrastructure — for each proposal that exceeds $ 2.85 million . the prospectus provides detailed information about the project , including its location and estimated cost . by law , a project that exceeds the $ 2.85 million threshold may not receive appropriations unless both committees pass resolutions approving of the prospectus . while the prospectus process provides congress an opportunity to evaluate gsa real property activities , oversight may be limited by data that are not available to the authorizing committees . gsa 's prospectuses , for example , do not always include a comparison of the costs of leasing versus owning space over time , which means congress is making decisions without knowing whether a proposed project is the most cost effective option . similarly , many lease prospectuses do not include the cost of altering space to meet agency needs , such as upgraded security , which means authorizing committees may not be aware of the full costs of the projects they are considering . in addition , there are instances where gsa fails to submit prospectuses for projects that exceed the threshold . several bills in the 113th congress propose reforms to the real property process , particularly the process for disposing of unneeded buildings . examples include the excess federal building and property disposal act ( h.r . 328 ) , the federal real property asset management reform act ( s. 1398 ) , and the civilian property realignment act ( h.r . 695 and s. 1715 ) . another bill , the public building service savings and reform act of 2013 ( h.r . 2612 ) proposes changing the prospectus approval process . the bill would require gsa to include in its prospectuses a plan to offset any new space acquired by eliminating an equal amount of existing space from its inventory . it would also require gsa to ensure it is obtaining the best possible rental rate for leases that fall below the prospectus threshold . other provisions would require gsa to provide the authorizing committees with an annual report listing all of the leases it entered into during the previous fiscal year ; to notify congress if a project 's costs increased by 5 % or more ; and , when requesting authorization to acquire space , to explain why existing federal space could not be used . h.r . 2612 could mitigate several long - standing weaknesses in the prospectus process . the bill proposes to help control costs by ensuring that the authorizing committees have access to comparative cost data , and by requiring gsa to provide cost estimates of alterations associated with a new lease that are not included in the estimate of rent . in addition , h.r . 2612 might enhance oversight by requiring gsa to provide a more detailed justification for requesting new space , and to notify congress when a project exceeds the cost and size parameters established in the prospectus . this report will be updated as events warrant .
