pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed operational and safety trends in the rail industry over the past 20 years and how the federal railroad administration ( fra ) has revised its rail safety program to address these trends . gao noted that : the railroad industry has changed significantly since the staggers rail act of 1980 made it federal policy that railroads would rely , where possible , on competition and the demand for services , rather than on regulation , to establish reasonable rates ; from 1976 to 1998 , mergers and acquisitions have significantly reduced the number of class i freight railroads ; these larger railroads have cut costs , increased the tonnage their trains carry , downsized their workforces , and eliminated , sold , or abandoned thousands of miles of unprofitable or little - used track ; during this same period , overall railroad safety has improved ; reported accident and fatality rates are down 75 and 36 percent , respectively , from 1976 levels ; despite this progress , each year about 1,000 people die as a result of grade - crossing accidents and trespassing , at least 9,000 railroad employees are injured , and thousands of people are evacuated from their homes because of hazardous materials released during train accidents ; fra instituted an important shift in its safety program in 1993 to address safety problems in the rail industry ; rather than continuing to use violations and civil penalties as the primary means to obtain compliance with railroad safety regulations , fra decided to emphasize cooperative partnerships with other federal agencies , railroad management , labor unions , and the states ; the partnering efforts generally focus on the nation 's larger railroads and have resulted in fra inspectors ' conducting fewer site - specific inspections of the railroad industry overall ; while 1996 and preliminary 1997 data , the latest data available , show improvements in safety , it is too early to determine if fra 's new approach will sustain a long - term decline in accidents and fatalities ; and in addition , fra 's new partnering efforts do not systematically respond to concerns about the level of workplace injuries for railroad employees and about the safety of railroad bridges .
