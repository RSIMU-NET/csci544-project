the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , formerly called the food stamp program , is designed primarily to increase the food purchasing power of eligible low - income households to help them buy a nutritionally adequate low - cost diet . this report describes the rules related to eligibility for snap benefits as well as the rules for benefits and their redemption . snap is administered by the u.s. department of agriculture 's food and nutrition service ( usda - fns ) . snap is authorized by the food and nutrition act of 2008. this law , formerly the food stamp act of 1977 , has since 1973 been reauthorized by the `` farm bill , '' omnibus legislation that also typically includes the authorization of other federal agricultural policies and programs . the program was most recently reauthorized by the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 , enacted february 7 , 2014 ) . many farm bill provisions expire in 2018 , and the 115th congress may undertake the next reauthorization of snap . snap eligibility and benefits are calculated on a household basis . financial eligibility is determined through a traditional or a categorical eligibility path . under traditional eligibility , applicant households must meet gross income , net income , and asset tests . specifically , household gross monthly income ( all income as defined by snap law ) must be at or below 130 % of the federal poverty level , and household net ( snap - specified deductions are subtracted ) monthly income must be at 100 % of the federal poverty level . the traditional asset rules are set at $ 2,000 per household ( inflation adjusted ) . ( households that contain an elderly or disabled member have a higher asset limit and also do not have to meet the gross income test . ) . under categorical eligibility , snap eligibility is automatically conveyed based upon the applicant 's participation in other means - tested programs , namely supplemental security income ( ssi ) , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , or general assistance ( ga ) . because tanf is a broad - purpose block grant , the state option to extend snap eligibility to applicants that receive a tanf - funded benefit allows states to offer program eligibility under rules that vary from those discussed in this paragraph , including an elimination of the asset test . applicants are also subject to non - financial rules , which include work - related requirements such as a time limit for able - bodied adults without dependents ( abawds ) . if eligible for snap , an applicant household also undergoes a calculation of its monthly benefit amount ( or allotment ) . this calculation utilizes the household 's net income as well as the maximum allotment , a figure that equals the current value of the `` thrifty food plan '' ( tfp ) . the american recovery and reinvestment act had temporarily increased this value ; this increase ended after october 31 , 2013. benefits are issued on an ebt card , which operates with a declining balance like a debit card . benefits are not cash , may not be accessed at an automatic teller machine , and are redeemable only for foods . benefits may be redeemed for foods at licensed retailers , which may include a wide variety of retailers so long as retailers meet licensing requirements . this report focuses on snap eligibility and the form and function of benefits . for an overview of snap along with the other usda - fns programs , such as the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) , commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) , and national school lunch program ( nslp ) , see crs report r42353 , domestic food assistance : summary of programs . for issues related to snap and the 2014 farm bill , see crs report r43332 , snap and related nutrition provisions of the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) . for a brief overview of the farm bill 's nutrition programs , see crs in focus if10663 , farm bill primer : snap and other nutrition title programs .
