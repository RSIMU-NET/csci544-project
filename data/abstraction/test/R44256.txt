several high - profile police shootings and other law enforcement - related deaths in the united states have sparked intense protests throughout the country and a fierce debate in congress concerning the appropriate level of force police officers should wield in a society that equally values public safety and the lives of each of its citizens under law . these incidents have been the subject of several congressional hearings , have prompted the introduction of various legislative measures , and have catalyzed a new civil rights movement in the united states aimed at reforming the criminal justice system . reformers claim that police work too closely with local prosecutors resulting in insufficient oversight and have called for greater involvement by the federal government . the law enforcement community and its supporters have countered that these recent deaths are anomalous in otherwise exemplary police conduct , and that placing the federal government in direct regulation of state and local police would present an unwarranted intrusion into state and local affairs . to provide legal context for this debate , this report will address three overarching questions : ( 1 ) what are the constitutional rules governing an officer 's use of force ; ( 2 ) what role has congress played in providing a remedy for a violation of these rules ; and ( 3 ) what are the potential reforms to these rules and remedies ? . rules . in a line of cases beginning in the mid - 1980s , the supreme court ruled that all claims of excessive force occurring during an arrest or investigatory stop — deadly or otherwise — are governed by the fourth amendment 's prohibition against unreasonable seizures . under prevailing judicial precedent , all uses of force must be `` objectively reasonable '' based on the totality of the circumstances viewed through the lens of the officer in the field . this requires a fact - intensive inquiry that is not easily reduced to categorical rules , but some general trends can be discerned from the case law . for instance , the courts have been deferential to officers in the field who are required to make split - second decisions in dangerous situations . also , officers need not use the least intrusive means to effectuate a seizure so long as their actions are reasonable . remedies . in an effort to provide teeth to federal constitutional restraints , congress has enacted three federal statutes that accord various remedies for police use of excessive force . first is the federal criminal statute , 18 u.s.c . section 242 , which prohibits officers from willfully depriving another of a constitutional right while acting under color of law . enacted shortly after the civil war , many have argued that section 242 's specific intent mens rea requirement is too high a threshold to provide an adequate deterrence to excessive force . moreover , the federal circuit courts are split on how to apply this test , with some requiring a strict form of intent and others permitting a reckless disregard jury instruction . second is the federal civil rights statute , 42 u.s.c . section 1983 , which provides a civil cause of action for deprivations of one 's constitutional rights . while generally viewed as successful in providing monetary damages to those injured by officers in the field , the doctrine of qualified immunity has frequently shielded officers from liability when the law was not `` clearly established '' at the time . third is the more recently enacted `` pattern or practice '' statute , 42 u.s.c . section 14141 , which authorizes the attorney general to sue local municipalities whose police forces have engaged in a pattern of excessive force under the fourth amendment . reforms . various reform bills have been introduced in the 114th congress to provide additional restraints on police use of force , including the excessive use of force prevention act of 2015 ( h.r . 2052 ) , which would criminalize the use of chokeholds , and the police accountability act of 2015 ( h.r . 1102 ) , which would create a new federal crime for certain homicides committed by law enforcement officers . additionally , several bills would place requirements on states to report use of force statistics to the federal government .
