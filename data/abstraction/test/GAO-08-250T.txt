the smithsonian institution ( smithsonian ) is the world 's largest museum complex . its funding comes from its own private trust fund assets and federal appropriations , with the majority of funds for facilities coming from federal appropriations . in 2005 , gao reported that the smithsonian 's current funding would not be sufficient to cover its estimated $ 2.3 billion in facilities projects through 2013 and recommended that the smithsonian board of regents , its governing body , develop and implement a funding plan . recently , problems related to a lack of adequate oversight of executive compensation and other issues have raised concerns about governance at the smithsonian . this testimony discusses gao 's recently issued work on the smithsonian 's real property management efforts and its efforts to develop and implement strategies to fund its facilities projects . in addition , it describes preliminary results of gao 's ongoing work on the smithsonian 's governance challenges . the work for this testimony is based on gao 's september 2007 report , smithsonian institution : funding challenges affect facilities ' conditions and security , endangering collections , which included recommendations . for ongoing governance work , gao reviewed smithsonian documents and interviewed smithsonian officials , academics , and representatives of nonprofit associations . while the smithsonian has made some improvements to its real property management , the continued deterioration of many smithsonian facilities has caused problems , and the smithsonian 's real property management efforts face challenges . the deterioration of facilities has caused access restrictions and threatened collections . in addition , the smithsonian 's estimate for facilities projects increased to $ 2.5 billion . while the smithsonian follows key security practices , communication of security information and funding constraints pose challenges . the smithsonian has made significant strides in improving its real property portfolio management . however , the smithsonian omitted privately funded projects from its capital plan , making it challenging to assess the total funding and scope of projects . gao 's september 2007 report recommended that the smithsonian increase awareness of security issues and include privately funded projects in its capital plan . the smithsonian concurred . to address gao 's 2005 recommendation that the smithsonian develop a funding plan for facilities projects , the board of regents created an ad - hoc committee that reviewed nine options and chose to request increased federal funding . some of the smithsonian 's evaluations of the nine funding options were limited in that they did not always provide complete analysis , fully explain assumptions , benchmark with other organizations , or consider combining options to increase revenue . gao 's september 2007 report recommended that the smithsonian more comprehensively analyze funding options and report to congress and the office of management and budget on a funding strategy . the smithsonian concurred . the board of regents recently established a prioritized list of funding options . preliminary results of gao 's ongoing work on broader governance issues indicate that the board of regents has made some changes to strengthen governance , such as more clearly defining the regents ' oversight responsibilities and improving access between the board and key members of senior management . the board is also studying whether changes to its size and composition would strengthen governance . gao 's preliminary work suggests that the board appears to have taken some positive steps toward governance reform , but that success will depend in part on how regents embrace their new responsibilities and on their level of engagement .
