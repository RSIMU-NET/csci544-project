protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance . most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so . gao was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities ' security risks . this report examines : how selected agencies ' assessment methodologies align with the isc 's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and what management challenges , if any , selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results . gao selected four agencies — cbp , faa , ars , and the forest service — based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency 's assessment methodology to the isc standard ; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016 ; and interviewed security officials . gao also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies , selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level . none of the four agencies gao reviewed — u.s . customs and border protection ( cbp ) , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , the agricultural research service ( ars ) , and the forest service — used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the interagency security committee 's risk management process for federal facilities standard ( the isc standard ) . this standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures — such as fences and closed - circuit televisions — must : 1. consider all of the undesirable events ( i.e . , arson and vandalism ) identified by the isc standard as possible risks to facilities . 2. assess three factors — threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences — for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk . all four agencies used methodologies that included some isc requirements when conducting assessments . cbp and faa assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences . ars and the forest service assessed threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences , but did not use these factors to measure risk . in addition , the agencies considered many , but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities . agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies . for example , ars and the forest service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy . although cbp and faa have updated their methodologies , their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the isc standard . as a result , these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities . all four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results . specifically , cbp , ars , and the forest service have not met the isc 's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments . for example , security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ars and one forest service higher - level facilities . while these three agencies have plans to address backlogs , cbp 's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities , such as updating its policy manual , and ars and the forest service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments . furthermore , cbp , ars , and the forest service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities , and their policies did not specify such data requirements . for example , ars and the forest service do not collect and analyze security - related data , such as countermeasures ' implementation . faa does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program . without improved monitoring , agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs , may leave facilities ' vulnerabilities unaddressed , and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives . this is a public version of a sensitive report that gao issued in august 2017. information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted . gao recommends : that cbp and faa update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the isc standard ; that cbp revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog ; and that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs . all four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations .
