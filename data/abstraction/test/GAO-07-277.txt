the negative perceptions of the united states associated with u.s. foreign policy initiatives have underscored the importance of the united states presenting a complete portrayal of the benefits that many in the world derive from u.s. foreign assistance efforts . congress has expressed concerns that the united states has frequently understated or not publicized information about its foreign assistance programs . as requested , this report describes the policies , regulations , and guidelines that agencies have established to mark and publicize foreign assistance ; describes how state , usaid , and other agencies mark and publicize foreign assistance ; and identifies key challenges that agencies face in marking and publicizing foreign assistance . most of the agencies we reviewed involved in foreign assistance activities have established some marking and publicity requirements in policies , regulations , or guidelines . usaid has the most detailed policies and regulations relating to marking and publicity . usaid has also established a network of communications specialists at its missions to publicize its assistance efforts and has issued communications guidelines to promote that assistance . according to state officials , its policy is to allow its program managers and ambassadors to use their discretion when determining which programs and activities to mark or publicize . usda , dod , hhs , treasury , and mcc have also established some policies for marking and publicizing assistance , though these policies vary in their level of formality and detail . to increase awareness of u.s. assistance abroad , key agencies that we reviewed used various methods to mark and publicize some of their activities and exercised flexibility in deciding when it was appropriate to do so . these agencies used different methods of marking , or visibly acknowledging , their assistance . in addition , agencies generally used embassy public affairs offices for publicizing , information about the source of their assistance and , in some cases , augmented these efforts with their own publicity methods . we identified some challenges to marking and publicizing u.s. foreign assistance , including the lack of a strategy for assessing the impact of marking and publicity efforts on increasing the awareness of u.s. foreign assistance and governmentwide guidance for marking and publicizing u.s. foreign assistance . first , although some agencies conduct surveys in recipient countries that primarily capture information on public opinion of the united states , little reliable work has been done to assess the impact of u.s. assistance on foreign citizens ' awareness of the source of u.s. provided assistance . second , while the newly appointed director of foreign assistance has begun to address the issue of developing a governmentwide policy for marking and publicizing all u.s. foreign assistance , it is unclear to what extent this policy will be implemented by agencies whose foreign assistance programs are not under dfa 's direct authority .
