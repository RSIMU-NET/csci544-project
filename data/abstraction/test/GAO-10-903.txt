policymakers have raised questions about geoengineering -- large - scale deliberate interventions in the earth 's climate system to diminish climate change or its impacts -- and its role in a broader strategy of mitigating and adapting to climate change . most geoengineering proposals fall into two categories : carbon dioxide removal ( cdr ) , which would remove carbon dioxide ( co2 ) from the atmosphere , and solar radiation management ( srm ) , which would offset temperature increases by reflecting sunlight back into space . gao was asked to examine the state of geoengineering science , federal involvement in geoengineering , and the views of experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering , and any governance challenges . gao examined relevant scientific and policy studies , relevant domestic laws and international agreements , analyzed agency data describing relevant research for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 , and interviewed federal officials and selected recognized experts in the field . few geoengineering experiments or modeling studies have been conducted , and major uncertainties remain on the efficacy and potential consequences of geoengineering approaches . gao 's review of relevant studies and discussions with selected experts indicated that relatively more laboratory and field research relevant to certain cdr approaches exists , although most of this research was not designed to apply to geoengineering . in contrast , few modeling studies or field experiments have focused on srm approaches , according to experts and recent studies . experts identified only one srm field experiment with published results -- a 2009 russian experiment that injected aerosols into the middle troposphere to measure their reflectivity . experts , as well as relevant studies , identified several major uncertainties in need of further investigation for cdr and srm . federal agencies identified 52 research activities , totaling about $ 100.9 million , relevant to geoengineering during fiscal years 2009 and 2010. gao 's analysis found that 43 activities , totaling about $ 99 million , focused either on mitigation strategies or basic science . most of the research focused on mitigation efforts , such as geological sequestration of co2 , which were identified as relevant to cdr approaches but not designed to address them directly . gao found that nine activities , totaling about $ 1.9 million , directly investigated srm or less conventional cdr approaches . officials from interagency bodies coordinating federal responses to climate change indicated that their offices have not developed a coordinated strategy , and believe that , due to limited federal investment , it is premature to coordinate geoengineering activities . however , federal officials also noted that a large share of existing federal climate science research could be relevant to geoengineering . agencies requested roughly $ 2 billion for such activities in fiscal year 2010. without a coordinated federal strategy for geoengineering , it is difficult for agencies to determine the extent of relevant research , and policymakers may lack key information to inform subsequent decisions on geoengineering and existing climate science efforts . according to legal experts and federal officials , the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering is unclear . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has taken steps to regulate one cdr approach and has determined that it has sufficient authority to regulate two other approaches . epa officials said epa has not assessed the applicability of other laws because geoengineering research is in its initial stages . similarly , legal experts and department of state officials said that , except for three instances , parties to international agreements have not addressed their agreements ' applicability to geoengineering , largely due to limited geoengineering activity and awareness of the issue . legal experts ' and officials ' views differed on the best approach for international governance , but generally agreed that the federal government should take a coordinated , interagency approach on domestic regulation . experts and officials also identified governance challenges , such as the need to address liability . gao recommends that within the executive office of the president , the appropriate entities , such as the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , establish a clear strategy for geoengineering research in the context of the federal response to climate change to ensure a coordinated federal approach . ostp neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation , but provided technical comments .
