the military services ' 21 depots maintain the readiness of critical weapon systems such as ships , aircraft , and tanks needed for military operations . the condition of depot facilities and equipment directly affects the timeliness of maintenance and the readiness of the weapon systems they repair . the services have invested over $ 13 billion in the depots from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2017. senate report 115-125 included a provision for gao to examine the services ' investment in and performance of their depots . gao evaluated the condition of depot facilities and equipment , their relationship to depot performance , and the services ' tracking of the relationship to depot performance and the extent to which dod and the services have developed an approach for guiding depot investments to address key challenges . gao also provides an overview summary for each depot . gao reviewed data from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 on depot investment , performance , and the age and condition of facilities and equipment ; reviewed agency guidance ; and interviewed dod , service , and depot officials . the condition of facilities at a majority of the department of defense 's ( dod ) depots is poor and the age of equipment is generally past its useful life , but the services do not consistently track the effect that these conditions have on depot performance . twelve of the 21 depots gao reviewed – – more than half – – had “ poor ” average facility condition ratings ( see figure ) . some facilities also serve functions for which they were not designed , reducing their efficiency . in addition , the average age of depot equipment exceeded its expected useful life at 15 of the 21 depots . these factors contributed , in part , to a decline in performance over the same period . from 2007 to 2017 , performance at the depots generally declined , reducing the availability of the weapon systems repaired for training and operations . optimizing facilities and equipment at the depots can improve their maintenance efficiency . for example , the navy estimates that its shipyard optimization effort will save over 325,000 labor days per year , which would allow an additional submarine overhaul annually . however , the services lack data on the effect that facilities and equipment conditions have on maintenance delays , hindering dod 's ability to effectively target investments to the highest priorities . dod and the services ' approach for managing investments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its depots lacks elements important to addressing key challenges . the services have efforts underway to complete their plans by february 2019 to address their depots ' facility and equipment needs . however , gao found that these plans are preliminary and will not include key elements , such as analytically - based goals ; results - oriented metrics ; a full accounting of the resources , risks , and stakeholders ; and a process for reporting on progress . addressing the poor conditions at dod 's 21 depots will cost billions and require sustained management attention over many years . however , the dod office responsible for depot policy does not monitor or regularly report on depot improvement efforts to dod decision makers and congress . until dod and the services incorporate these key elements into the management approach for their depot investments , they risk continued deterioration of the depots , hindering their ability to meet the secretary of defense 's goals for improving readiness and reducing operating and support costs . gao is making 13 recommendations to improve data collection on the effect of facilities and equipment condition on depot performance , and develop plans that incorporate key elements to guide depot investments . dod concurred with 12 recommendations , but did not agree to monitor and report on depot investments . we continue to believe monitoring and reporting will enhance dod 's efforts to improve its depots .
