in recent years , many entities in the private , public , and government sectors have reported the loss or theft of sensitive personal information . these breaches have raised concerns in part because they can result in identity theft -- either account fraud ( such as misuse of credit card numbers ) or unauthorized creation of new accounts ( such as opening a credit card in someone else 's name ) . many states have enacted laws requiring entities that experience breaches to notify affected individuals , and congress is considering legislation that would establish a national breach notification requirement . gao was asked to examine the incidence and circumstances of breaches of sensitive personal information ; the extent to which such breaches have resulted in identity theft ; and the potential benefits , costs , and challenges associated with breach notification requirements . to address these objectives , gao reviewed available reports on data breaches , analyzed 24 large data breaches , and gathered information from federal and state government agencies , researchers , consumer advocates , and others . while comprehensive data do not exist , available evidence suggests that breaches of sensitive personal information have occurred frequently and under widely varying circumstances . for example , more than 570 data breaches were reported in the news media from january 2005 through december 2006 , according to lists maintained by private groups that track reports of breaches . these incidents varied significantly in size and occurred across a wide range of entities , including federal , state , and local government agencies ; retailers ; financial institutions ; colleges and universities ; and medical facilities . the extent to which data breaches have resulted in identity theft is not well known , largely because of the difficulty of determining the source of the data used to commit identity theft . however , available data and interviews with researchers , law enforcement officials , and industry representatives indicated that most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft , particularly the unauthorized creation of new accounts . for example , in reviewing the 24 largest breaches reported in the media from january 2000 through june 2005 , gao found that 3 included evidence of resulting fraud on existing accounts and 1 included evidence of unauthorized creation of new accounts . for 18 of the breaches , no clear evidence had been uncovered linking them to identity theft ; and for the remaining 2 , there was not sufficient information to make a determination . requiring affected consumers to be notified of a data breach may encourage better security practices and help mitigate potential harm , but it also presents certain costs and challenges . notification requirements can create incentives for entities to improve data security practices to minimize legal liability or avoid public relations risks that may result from a publicized breach . also , consumers alerted to a breach can take measures to prevent or mitigate identity theft , such as monitoring their credit card statements and credit reports . at the same time , breach notification requirements have associated costs , such as expenses to develop incident response plans and identify and notify affected individuals . further , an expansive requirement could result in notification of breaches that present little or no risk , perhaps leading consumers to disregard notices altogether . federal banking regulators and the president 's identity theft task force have advocated a notification standard -- the conditions requiring notification -- that is risk based , allowing individuals to take appropriate measures where the risk of harm exists , while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level of risk warrants such action . should congress choose to enact a federal notification requirement , use of such a risk - based standard could avoid undue burden on organizations and unnecessary and counterproductive notifications of breaches that present little risk .
