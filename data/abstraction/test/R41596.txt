concern has increased over the size and sustainability of the united states ' recent budget deficits and the country 's long - run budget outlook . this concern has brought the issues of the government 's revenue needs and fundamental tax reform to the forefront of congressional debates . congress may choose to address these issues by reforming the set of tax benefits for homeowners . according to the joint committee on taxation , federally provided tax benefits for homeowners will cost approximately $ 136.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2017. reducing , modifying , or eliminating all or some of the current tax benefits for homeowners could raise a substantial amount of revenue , while simultaneously simplifying the tax code , increasing equity among taxpayers , and promoting economic efficiency . this report focuses on the two largest federal tax benefits available to homeowners â€” the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for state and local property taxes . while other tax benefits for homeowners exist , these two particular benefits are the most expensive in terms of forgone revenue to the federal government . between 2014 and 2017 the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction are estimated to cost around $ 77.3 billion and $ 31.5 billion annually . congress may therefore consider modifying these two tax benefits to raise revenue . the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction are also the two tax benefits proponents most often argue promote homeownership . economists , however , have questioned this claim . the analysis presented in this report is structured along two dimensions . first , the analysis focuses on the rationales commonly offered for providing tax benefits for homeowners , mainly that homeownership ( 1 ) bestows certain benefits on society as a whole such as higher property values , lower crime , higher civic participation , among others ; ( 2 ) is a means of promoting a more even distribution of income and wealth ; and ( 3 ) has a positive effect on living conditions , which can lead to a healthier population . although these benefits may exist , the analysis presented in this report highlights the difficulties that economists have encountered in attempting to establish their existence or magnitude . the analysis then turns to examining the effect that the mortgage interest deduction and state and local property tax deduction have on the homeownership rate , housing consumption , and the economy . the analysis in this report suggests that these tax incentives may have a larger effect on the size of homes purchased than on the decision to become a homeowner . the possibility that attempting to promote homeownership via the tax code may distort the allocation of capital and labor , which could hinder the performance of the economy in the short - run and long - run , is also raised . in the process of conducting the analysis , this report briefly summarizes the historical trends in homeownership and the more recent trends in foreclosures . the report concludes with policy options that congress may find useful as it moves forward , including proposals made by house ways and means chairman dave camp , president obama 's fiscal commission , president george w. bush 's tax reform panel , and the congressional budget office .
