ongoing trade negotiations among the united states and several pacific rim countries regarding the proposed trans pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement and between the united states and the european union with respect to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) agreement have rekindled debate over the value of including investor - state dispute settlement ( isds ) provisions in bilateral investment treaties ( bit ) and trade agreements . congress plays an important role in the approval and implementation of u.s. international investment agreements ( iia ) , and , therefore , in the approval of isds provisions within those agreements . isds provisions in iias enable an aggrieved investor , with an investment in the territory of a foreign host government , to bring a claim against that government for breach of an investment agreement before an international arbitration panel . the united states has negotiated a number of bits and free trade agreements ( fta ) that contain isds arbitration procedures for resolving investors ' claims that a host country has violated substantive obligations intended to protect foreign investors and investments from discriminatory , unfair , or arbitrary treatment by the host government . under u.s. iias , the investor and respondent country may agree that the tribunal will conduct the proceedings according to certain procedural rules , such as the international centre for settlement of investment disputes ( icsid ) rules of procedure for arbitration proceedings ; the united nations commission on international trade law ( uncitral ) arbitration rules ; or the icsid additional facility rules for disputes in which either the investor 's home country or the host country , but not both , is a member of icsid . this report focuses on the legal implications of isds provisions in u.s. iias . among other things , it discusses who may bring a claim under an iia ; how arbitrators conduct such proceedings ; the remedies available to the disputing parties ; and how tribunals have interpreted certain substantive obligations contained in u.s. iias . furthermore , the report will discuss the interplay between iias containing isds provisions , investment arbitration decisions , and domestic law within the united states , as well as the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards against countries in u.s. courts . notably , the isds provisions within one iia may differ from the isds provisions in other agreements . this report will focus on the provisions contained in the investment chapter of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) because nearly all isds cases brought by investors against the united states have been brought under that agreement . it will also focus on the investment provisions contained in the united states ' 2012 model bit , which is the document that u.s. officials use to negotiate u.s. bits , and the korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus ) , which has the most recent congressionally approved fta investment chapter , to show the types of provisions u.s. diplomats may seek to include in the tpp and t - tip . table 1 of this report contains summaries of isds cases brought against the united states . table 2 includes summaries of several isds cases under various iias that may be of interest to congress .
