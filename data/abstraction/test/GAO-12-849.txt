congress established the enterprises to provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages and serve the mortgage credit needs of targeted groups . but in september 2008 , fhfa placed the enterprises in conservatorship out of concern that their deteriorating financial condition would destabilize the financial system . as congress and the executive branch have explored options for restructuring\ the enterprises , most of the discussion has focused on the single - family market . but the enterprises also play a large role in providing financing for\ multifamily properties ( those with five\ or more units ) . gao was asked to describe how the enterprises multifamily loan\ activities have changed , the financing marketplace and how they met affordable housing goals , and how the enterprises multifamily delinquency rates compare with those of other mortgage capital sources and how they have managed their credit risk . to address these objectives , gao analyzed loan - level data from 1994 ( the earliest period for which loan - level data were available ) through 2011 from the enterprises and data from the mortgage bankers association ; interviewed key multifamily housing stakeholders ; and reviewed fhfa examination reports . fhfa , fannie mae , and freddie mac provided technical comments , which gao incorporated where appropriate . from 1994 through 2011 , the multifamily loan activities of fannie mae and freddie mac ( the enterprises ) generally increased . in this period , fannie mae held a lower percentage of multifamily loans in its portfolio than freddie mac . while the enterprises multifamily business operations generally were profitable , both enterprises reported losses in 2008 and 2009. in recent years , fannie mae and freddie mac played a larger role in the multifamily marketplace , and their multifamily activities contributed considerably to meeting their affordable housing goals ( set by their regulator for the purchase of mortgages that serve targeted groups or areas ) . before 2008 , the enterprises financed about 30 percent of multifamily loans . their share increased to 86 percent in 2009 , but decreased to 57 percent in 2011 as other participants reentered the market . gao 's analysis showed that multifamily activities greatly contributed to the enterprises ' ability to meet affordable housing goals . for example , the enterprises ' multifamily activities constituted 4.5 percent of their total business in 2008 , but about a third of the units used to meet the goal of serving low - and moderate - income persons were multifamily units . the enterprises have purchased multifamily loans that generally performed as well as or better than those of other market participants , but the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) has identified deficiencies in their credit risk management . in 2005-2008 , the enterprises ' serious delinquency rates ( less than 1 percent ) were somewhat lower than the rates on multifamily loans made by commercial banks and much lower than rates for multifamily loans funded by commercial mortgage - backed securities . fhfa , through its examination and oversight of the enterprises , identified a number of credit risk deficiencies over the past few years . for example , fhfa found deficiencies in fannie mae 's delegated underwriting and servicing program , risk - management practices , and information systems ; and freddie mac 's management of its lower - performing assets . both enterprises have been taking steps to address these deficiencies .
