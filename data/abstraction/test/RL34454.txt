scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences not just policy related to science and technology , but also many of today 's public policies as policymakers seek knowledge to enhance the quality of their decisions . science and technology policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for and encouragement of scientific and engineering research and development , the use of scientific and technical knowledge to enhance the nation 's response to societal challenges , and the education of americans in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics . science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nation 's economy in areas such as transportation , communication , agriculture , education , environment , health , defense , and jobs . as a result , policymakers are interested in almost every aspect of science and technology policy . the three branches of government — executive , congressional , and judiciary — depending on each branch 's responsibility , use science and technology knowledge and guidance to frame policy issues , craft legislation , and govern . the science and engineering community , however , is not represented by one individual or organization . on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance , its opinions are consensus - based with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence . in the end , consensus is achieved if there is widespread agreement on the evidence and its implications , which is conveyed to policymakers . policymakers then determine , based on this knowledge and other factors , whether or not to take action and what actions to take . if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community , however , consensus is not yet achieved , and taking policy actions in response to a concern can be challenging . several organizations , when requested by the federal government or congress , provide formal science and technology policy advice : federal advisory committees , congressionally chartered honorific organizations , and federally funded research and development corporations . in addition , many other organizations and individuals — international intergovernmental organizations , policy institutes / think tanks , the public , professional organizations , disciplinary societies , universities and colleges , advocacy , special interest , industry , trade associations , and labor — also provide their thoughts . these organizations may agree on the scientific and technical knowledge regarding an issue , but disagree on what actions to take in response , as their values on a proposed policy may differ . policymakers may be overwhelmed with an abundance of information from these organizations . despite these challenges , scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can provide policymakers with an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best information available , along with other factors they might take into account , such as cultural , economic , and other values , so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigated .
