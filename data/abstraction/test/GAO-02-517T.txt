the office of pipeline safety ( ops ) oversees 2.2 million miles of pipelines that transport potentially dangerous materials , such as oil and natural gas . ops has been slow to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry and implement critical pipeline safety improvements . as a result , ops has the lowest rate of any transportation agency for implementing the recommendations of the national transportation safety board . in recent years , ops has taken several steps to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry , including requiring `` integrity management '' programs for individual operators to assess their pipelines for risks , take action to mitigate the risks , and develop program performance measures . ops has also revised forms and procedures to collect more complete and accurate data , which will enable ops to better assess the causes of incidents and focus on the greatest risks to pipelines ; allowed more states to oversee a broader range of interstate pipeline safety activities ; and increased the use of fines . ops has made progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , but some key open recommendations and requirements , such as requiring pipeline operators to periodically inspect their pipelines , are now more than a decade old . ops faces challenges that include developing performance measures for the integrity management approach , ensuring sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators ' integrity management programs , providing consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and issuing requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines .
