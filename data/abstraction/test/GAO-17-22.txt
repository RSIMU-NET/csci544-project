as of june 2016 , 24 percent of direct loan borrowers repaying their loans ( or 5.3 million borrowers ) were doing so in idr plans , compared to 10 percent in june 2013. education expects these plans to have costs to the government . gao was asked to review education 's idr plan budget estimates and estimation methodology . this report examines : current idr plan budget estimates and how those estimates have changed over time , and the extent to which education 's approach to estimating costs and quality control practices help ensure reliable estimates . gao analyzed published and unpublished budget data covering direct loans made from fiscal years 1995 through 2015 and estimated to be made in 2016 and 2017 ; analyzed and tested education 's computer code used to estimate idr plan costs ; reviewed documentation related to education 's estimation approach ; and interviewed officials at education and other federal agencies . for the fiscal year 2017 budget , the u.s. department of education ( education ) estimates that all federally issued direct loans in income - driven repayment ( idr ) plans will have government costs of $ 74 billion , higher than previous budget estimates . idr plans are designed to help ease student debt burden by setting loan payments as a percentage of borrower income , extending repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years , and forgiving remaining balances at the end of that period . while actual costs can not be known until borrowers repay their loans , gao found that current idr plan budget estimates are more than double what was originally expected for loans made in fiscal years 2009 through 2016 ( the only years for which original estimates are available ) . this growth is largely due to the rising volume of loans in idr plans . education 's approach to estimating idr plan costs and quality control practices do not ensure reliable budget estimates . weaknesses in this approach may cause costs to be over - or understated by billions of dollars . for instance : education assumes that borrowers ' incomes will not grow with inflation even though federal guidelines for estimating loan costs state that estimates should account for relevant economic factors . gao tested this assumption by incorporating inflation into income forecasts , and found that estimated costs fell by over $ 17 billion . education also assumes no borrowers will switch into or out of idr plans in the future despite participation growth that has led budget estimates to more than double from $ 25 to $ 53 billion for loans made in recent fiscal years . predicting plan switching would be advisable per federal guidance on estimating loan costs . education has begun developing a revised model with this capability , but this model is not complete and it is not yet clear when or how well it will reflect idr plan participation trends . insufficient quality controls contributed to issues gao identified . for instance : education tested only one assumption for reasonableness , and did so at the request of others , although such testing is recommended in federal guidance on estimating loan costs . without further model testing , education 's estimates may be based on unreasonable assumptions . due to growing idr plan popularity , improving education 's estimation approach is especially important . until that happens , idr plan budget estimates will remain in question , and congress 's ability to make informed decisions may be affected . gao is making six recommendations to education to improve the quality of its idr plan budget estimates . these include adjusting borrower income forecasts for inflation , completing planned model revisions and ensuring that they generate reasonable predictions of participation trends , and testing key assumptions . education generally agreed with gao 's recommendations and noted actions it would take to address them .
