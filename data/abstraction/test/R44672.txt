uruguay is a small nation of 3.4 million people located on the atlantic coast of south america between brazil and argentina . the country stands out in latin america for its strong democratic institutions ; high per capita income ; and low levels of corruption , poverty , and inequality . as a result of its domestic success and commitment to international engagement , uruguay plays a more influential role in regional and international affairs than its size might suggest . uruguay has drawn increased congressional attention in recent years as a result of several high - profile and controversial decisions . some members of congress are tracking the implementation of uruguay 's cannabis - legalization measure as they consider the implications of marijuana - legalization initiatives in a growing number of u.s. states . uruguay 's decision to grant refugee status to six individuals who had been detained at the u.s. naval station at guantanamo bay , cuba , in 2014 also has drawn congressional scrutiny . some members contend that the obama administration failed to ensure that the uruguayan government would take steps to `` substantially mitigate the risk '' of the transferred individuals engaging in activities that threaten the united states as required by the national defense authorization act for fy2014 ( p.l . 113-66 ) . the administration disputes that assertion . domestic situation the center - left broad front ( frente amplio ) coalition has governed uruguay since 2005 , having won the presidency and legislative majorities in three consecutive elections . since taking office , the coalition has pursued a social democratic policy mix that has combined market - oriented economic policies with progressive taxation , an expansion of the social welfare system , and union - empowering labor reforms . the broad front also has enacted several far - reaching social policy changes , legalizing abortion ; expanding rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) individuals ; and legalizing and regulating uruguay 's marijuana market . president tabaré vázquez , who began his second nonconsecutive five - year term in march 2015 , has spent much of his time in office dealing with uruguay 's deteriorating economic situation . after nearly a decade of strong growth , the uruguayan economy has slowed dramatically as a result of softening global commodity prices and economic turbulence in argentina and brazil — uruguay 's main trading partners and fellow members of the mercosur customs union . this economic weakness has depressed tax collection and contributed to growing fiscal deficits but has not brought down uruguay 's persistently high inflation . vázquez has sought to address these economic challenges by reducing expenditures , increasing taxes , holding down wage increases , and investing in infrastructure through public - private partnerships . as economic growth has continued to slow in 2016 to an estimated 0.1 % , the vázquez administration 's approval rating has fallen to 33 % and its disapproval rating has risen to 45 % . u.s. - uruguayan relations u.s. - uruguayan relations have strengthened over the past decade despite initial expectations by some analysts that ties would deteriorate following the broad front 's assumption of power . the united states and uruguay signed a bilateral investment treaty in 2005 and a trade and investment framework agreement in 2007. in 2015 , the stock of u.s. foreign direct investment in uruguay reached $ 1.6 billion and bilateral merchandise trade amounted to $ 1.9 billion . the united states and uruguay also collaborate on efforts to address international security concerns . uruguay is serving alongside the united states on the u.n. security council for the 2016-2017 term and is one of the largest per capita contributors globally to u.n. peacekeeping missions . the united states has provided more than $ 14.6 million in assistance to uruguay over the past four years to bolster the country 's peacekeeping capabilities .
