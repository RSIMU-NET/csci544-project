the threat posed by an electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) or solar weather event could have a debilitating impact on the nation 's critical electrical infrastructure , as well as other key assets that depend on electricity . these events could lead to power outages over broad geographic areas for extended durations . addressing these risks requires collaboration among multiple government and industry stakeholders ; with dhs in the lead role for overall infrastructure protection efforts , working in coordination with doe . the emp commission , established by statute and comprised of subject matter experts , issued recommendations in 2008 addressing the preparation , protection and recovery of critical infrastructures against a possible emp attack . the majority of these recommendations were made to dhs and doe . this testimony is based on preliminary observations from gao 's ongoing review of dhs 's efforts to address electromagnetic threats . specifically , this testimony addresses the extent to which dhs has : taken action to address recommendations from the 2008 emp commission report and coordinated with other principal federal agencies , such as doe and industry stakeholders to mitigate risks to the electric grid from electromagnetic threats . gao reviewed emp commission recommendations and dhs program documents , and interviewed relevant stakeholders who provided insights on key issues and coordination activities with the federal government to address these threats . as of july 2015 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) reported taking several actions that could help address electromagnetic threats to the electric grid . gao 's preliminary analysis of dhs 's actions indicates that they generally fell under four categories : developing reports , identifying mitigation efforts , strategy development and planning , and conducting exercises . for example : impacts of severe space weather on the electric grid . this 2011 report evaluated how previous solar storms have affected electric grids , and identified potential cost - effective mitigation equipment available to protect these grids , among other topics . recx . in 2012 , dhs science & technology partnered with industry to develop a prototype transformer that could significantly reduce the time to transport , install , and energize a transformer to aid recovery from power outages associated with transformer failures from several months to less than one week . dhs reported its actions were not taken in response to the 2008 recommendations of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack ( emp commission ) . gao also recognizes that dhs does not have a statutory obligation to specifically address the recommendations , but implementation of them could help mitigate electromagnetic impacts to the electric grid , such as helping to assure the protection of high - value transmission assets . moreover , gao 's preliminary work suggests that dhs , in conjunction with the department of energy ( doe ) , has not fully addressed a key critical infrastructure protection responsibility â€” identification of clear internal agency roles and responsibilities related to addressing electromagnetic threats . for example , although dhs recognized one component as the lead for assessing solar weather risks , the component has not yet identified any specific roles related to collecting or analyzing risk information . dhs has also coordinated with federal and industry stakeholders to address some , but not all risks to the electrical grid since the emp commission issued its recommendations . gao preliminarily identified eight projects in which dhs coordinated with stakeholders to help protect the grid including developing plans to address long term power outages , participation in exercises , and research and development activities . although these are positive steps , gao 's preliminary work indicates that dhs has not effectively coordinated with stakeholders to identify critical assets or collect necessary risk information , among other responsibilities . gao will continue to assess the issues in this statement as it completes its work and will issue a report with the final results later this year .
