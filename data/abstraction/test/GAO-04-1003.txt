congress has established a legislative framework that shapes the careers and the management of general and flag officers . the department of defense ( dod ) has proposed eliminating or amending a number of legislative provisions , such as revising existing statutory retirement limits based on age and years of service , to provide greater flexibility in managing its senior officers in order to retain experienced leaders . gao is issuing this report in response to a mandate in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003. gao 's objectives were to develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and assess dod 's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals . general and flag officers who have retired over the past several years typically retired at age 56 after having served an average of 33 years of active commissioned service and 3-1 / 2 years in their last pay grade . on average , retired general and flag officers were first promoted to general and flag officer at age 49 , upon reaching 26 years of active commissioned service , and served 6 years as a general or flag officer before retiring . dod did not present evidence that the legislative provisions it seeks to change hinder the management of general and flag officers or the agency 's ability to perform its mission . dod presented various rationales for its proposals and sponsored a study of general and flag officer management but did not provide data to support the need for these proposals . gao found that dod can achieve its goal of extending some general and flag officers ' careers and assignments within the parameters of the current legislative framework since many general and flag officers retire several years before reaching the statutory retirement limits . more specifically , the career profile data show that more than three - fourths of general and flag officers who retired in grades o - 9 and o - 10 between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 could have served at least 3 more years before reaching the current statutory retirement limits . existing legislative authority provides some flexibility in managing general and flag officers , but the executive branch has not made frequent use of this authority . in particular , the executive branch has rarely used its existing authority to defer the retirement of general and flag officers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory limits on age and years of service . additionally , factors other than the statutory limits , such as personal considerations and military service culture , may account for early retirements of general and flag officers . gao also found that the proposals would reduce congressional oversight and provide broad latitude to the executive branch in managing general and flag officers , could impede the upward flow of officers by limiting promotion opportunities due to the extension of general and flag officer careers , and would likely increase federal retirement outlays for retirement compensation , based on a cost estimate developed by gao .
