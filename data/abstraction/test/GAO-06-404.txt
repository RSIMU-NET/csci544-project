the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a multibillion - dollar program -- u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) -- to control and monitor the pre - entry , entry , visa status , and exit of foreign visitors . to deliver system and other program capabilities , the program relies extensively on contractors , some of whom are managed directly by us - visit and some by other agencies ( including both dhs agencies , such as customs and border protection , and non - dhs agencies , such as the general services administration ) . because of us - visit 's heavy reliance on contractors to deliver program capabilities , gao was asked to determine whether dhs has established and implemented effective controls for managing and overseeing us - visit - related contracts . us - visit - related contracts have not been effectively managed and overseen . the us - visit program office established and implemented certain nonfinancial controls for those contracts that it managed directly , such as verifying that contractor deliverables satisfied established requirements . however , it did not implement effective controls for overseeing its contracts managed by other dhs agencies and by non - dhs agencies . moreover , effective financial controls were not in place on any contracts that gao reviewed . the program office did not know the full extent of us - visit - related contract actions , and it had not performed key nonfinancial practices associated with understanding contractor performance in meeting the terms of these contracts . this oversight gap was exacerbated by the fact that the other agencies had not always established and implemented effective controls for managing their respective contracts . these other agencies directly managed more than half ( 56 percent ) of the total us - visit - related contract obligations reported to gao . the program office and other agencies did not implement effective financial controls . without these controls , some agencies were unable to reliably report us - visit contracting expenditures . further , the program office and these other agencies improperly paid and accounted for related invoices , including making duplicate payments and payments for non - us - visit services with funds designated for us - visit . according to the us - visit program official responsible for contract matters , the program office has focused on contracts that it manages directly and decided to rely on the responsible agencies to manage the other contracts . further , it has decided to use other agencies to properly manage financial matters for their respective contracts , and it also decided to rely on another agency for its own financial management services . without effective contract management and oversight controls , the program office does not know that required program deliverables and mission results will be produced on time and within budget , and that proper payments are made .
