dhs plays a vital role in securing the nation , and its intelligence analysis capabilities are a key part of this effort . within dhs , i & a has a lead role for intelligence analysis , but other operational components also perform their own analysis activities . gao was asked to review the management of departmental analysis efforts . this report addresses the extent to which dhs intelligence analysis activities are integrated to support departmental intelligence priorities , i & a customers find analytic products and services useful , and i & a has addressed challenges in maintaining a skilled analytic workforce . gao examined mechanisms dhs used to coordinate analysis across components , i & a reports and feedback surveys , and human capital plans . gao also interviewed officials from i & a , the five dhs components with intelligence analysis as a core function , the office of the director of national intelligence who represent the intelligence community , 7 of 78 fusion centers ( focal points within states that analyze and share information ) , and the private sector . the fusion center and sector interviews , chosen based on geographic location and other factors , are not generalizable , but provided insight on progress . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established mechanisms — including an intelligence framework and an analytic planning process — to better integrate analysis activities throughout the department , but the mechanisms are not functioning as intended . for example , the framework does not establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities that can be used to inform annual planning decisions , such as what analytic activities to pursue and the level of investment to make , as called for in dhs guidance . according to officials from dhs 's office of intelligence and analysis ( i & a ) , it can be challenging for dhs components to focus on developing both strategic priorities and more tactical priorities that support their specific operations . absent strategic priorities , dhs used component subject matter experts and other information to develop key questions of common interest they would address through analysis . as a result , dhs does not have reasonable assurance that component analytic activities and resource investments are aligned to support departmental priorities . the mechanisms to integrate analysis , however , gave components insight into one another 's work and helped them avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication . i & a customers had mixed views on the extent to which its analytic products and services are useful . gao 's interviews with representatives of i & a 's five customer groups indicate that two groups — dhs leadership and state , local , tribal , and territorial partners — found products to be useful , while three groups — dhs components , the intelligence community , and the private sector — generally did not . representatives of four of the five groups said that they found other types of services , such as briefings , to be useful . results from surveys that are attached to i & a products indicate that most customers were very satisfied with the products ' usefulness , but the results are not generalizable because they reflect only the views of customers who chose to respond . to address this issue , i & a is conducting more comprehensive surveys and interviews with customers to evaluate the products and services that best meet their needs . i & a expects to complete this effort by the end of june 2014. i & a has taken steps to address challenges it faced in maintaining a skilled workforce , but has not assessed whether its efforts are resolving the challenges . for example : i & a faced challenges in recruiting and hiring analysts , in part because of its hiring authority , which put it at a disadvantage compared with other agencies that were able to process hiring actions more quickly . i & a 's hiring authority was changed in 2013 , a fact that could help ease these challenges . i & a experienced low morale and high rates of attrition , particularly among its lower - level analysts . to help address these issues , i & a restructured its grade levels in 2012 to provide additional career advancement opportunities . however , i & a has not established mechanisms to evaluate its efforts and use the results to make any needed changes because i & a leadership has focused on other priorities . such mechanisms will help i & a evaluate if efforts are achieving their intended results of improving recruiting and hiring , bolstering morale , and reducing attrition . in addition , using the evaluation results to determine any needed changes will help ensure that i & a is making sound workforce decisions . gao recommends , among other things , that dhs establish strategic intelligence priorities and use them to inform analytic activities and establish mechanisms to evaluate workforce initiatives and use results to determine any needed changes . dhs concurred with our recommendations .
