hipaa and its implementing regulations , as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act , require health care providers to give patients , upon request , access to their medical records , which contain protected health information ( i.e . , diagnoses , billing information , medications , and test results ) . this right of access allows patients to obtain their records or have them forwarded to a person or entity of their choice — such as another provider — in a timely manner while being charged a reasonable , cost - based fee . third parties , such as a lawyer or someone processing disability claims , may also request copies of a patient 's medical records with permission from the patient . the 21st century cures act included a provision for gao to study patient access to medical records . among other things , this report describes what is known about the fees for accessing patients ' medical records and challenges identified by patients and providers when patients request access to their medical records . gao reviewed selected hipaa requirements and implementing regulations and guidance , and relevant laws in four states selected in part because they established a range of fees associated with obtaining copies of medical records . gao also interviewed four provider associations , seven vendors that work for providers , six patient advocates , state officials , and department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) officials . the information gao obtained and its analysis of laws in the selected states are not generalizable . hhs provided technical comments on this report . available information suggests that the fees charged for accessing medical records can vary depending on the type of request and the state in which the request is made . under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and its implementing regulations , providers are authorized to charge a reasonable , cost - based fee when patients request copies of their medical records or request that their records be forwarded to another provider or entity . in the case of third - party requests , when a patient gives permission for another entity — for example , an attorney — to request copies of the patient 's medical records , the fees are not subject to the reasonable cost - based standard and are generally governed by state law . according to stakeholders gao interviewed , the fees for third - party requests are generally higher than the fees charged to patients and can vary significantly across states . the four states gao reviewed have state laws that vary in terms of the fees allowed for patient and third - party requests for medical records . for example , three of the states have per - page fee amounts for patient and third - party records requests . the amounts charged are based on the number of pages requested and vary across the three states . one of the three states has established a different per - page fee amount for third - party requests . the other two do not authorize a different fee for patient and third - party requests . one of the three states also specifies a maximum allowable fee if the provider uses an electronic health records system . the other two do not differentiate costs for electronic or paper records . in the fourth state , state law entitles individuals to one free copy of their medical record . the statute allows a charge of up to $ 1 per page for additional copies . patient advocates , provider associations , and other stakeholders gao interviewed identified challenges that patients and providers face when patients request access to their medical records . patients ' challenges include incurring what they believe to be high fees when requesting medical records — for example , when facing severe medical issues that have generated a high number of medical records . additionally , not all patients are aware that they have a right to challenge providers who deny them access to their medical records . providers ' challenges include the costs of responding to patient requests for records due to the allocation of staff time and other resources . in addition , according to provider associations and others gao interviewed , fulfilling requests for medical records has become more complex and challenging for providers , in part because providers may store this information in multiple electronic record systems or in a mix of paper and electronic records .
