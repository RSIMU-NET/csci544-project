the freedom of information act ( foia ) establishes that federal agencies must provide the public with access to government information , thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions . to help ensure appropriate implementation , the act requires that agencies report annually to the attorney general , providing specific information about their foia operations . gao has reported previously on the contents of these annual reports for 25 major agencies . gao was asked to describe the foia process and discuss the reported implementation of foia . although the specific details of processes for handling foia requests vary among agencies , the major steps in handling a request are similar across the government . agencies receive requests , usually in writing ( although they may accept requests by telephone or electronically ) , which can be submitted by any organization or member of the public . once requests are received , the agency responds through a process that includes several phases : initial processing , searching for and retrieving responsive records , preparing responsive records for release , approving the release of the records , and releasing the records to the requester . according to data reported by agencies in their annual foia reports , citizens have been requesting and receiving an ever - increasing amount of information from the federal government through foia . the number of requests that agencies received increased by 71 percent from 2002 to 2004. further , agencies reported they have been processing more requests -- 68 percent more from 2002 to 2004. for 92 percent of requests processed in 2004 , agencies reported that responsive records were provided in full to requesters . however , the number of pending requests carried over from year to year -- known as the backlog -- has also been increasing , rising 14 percent since 2002 .
