the military selective service act ( mssa ) , first enacted as the selective service act of 1948 , provides the statutory authority for the federal government to maintain a selective service system ( sss ) as an independent federal agency responsible for delivering appropriately qualified civilian men for induction into the armed forces of the united states as authorized by congress . the annual budget for the agency is just under $ 23 million . one of the sss 's main functions is to maintain a database of registrants in case of a draft . the agency stores approximately 78 million records in order to verify registration status and eligibility for certain benefits that require certification of registration for eligibility . the sss has a staff of about 124 full - time employees , complemented by a corps of volunteers and military reservists . the mssa requires most males between the ages of 18 and 26 who are citizens or residents of the united states to register with selective service . women in the united states have never been required to register for the draft . men who fail to register may be subject to criminal penalties , loss of eligibility for certain federal or state employment opportunities and education benefits , and denial of security clearances . documented or undocumented immigrants who fail to register may not be able to obtain united states citizenship . registration compliance rates were 92 % in calendar year 2016. while individuals may still register at u.s. post offices , the sss attributes high compliance rates to a system of automatic electronic registration supported by state legislation and interagency cooperation . the mssa does not currently authorize the use of a draft for induction into the armed forces . when the draft has been implemented , it has met some public resistance . such resistance to the draft drives much of the opposition toward maintaining the sss and the registration requirement . even some who are not opposed to the government 's use of conscription in a time of national need are opposed to maintaining the current sss agency infrastructure . they argue that a stand - alone agency is unnecessary and expensive and that there are a number of alternatives that could more effectively and efficiently enable the country to reestablish conscription , if necessary . others counter that , at the cost of $ 23 million annually , maintaining the sss is a relatively inexpensive insurance policy should the draft need to be quickly reinstated . they also argue that maintaining the sss sends a signal to potential adversaries that the united states is willing to draw on its full national resources for armed conflict if necessary . some are concerned that the registration requirements are inequitable , arguing that it is unfair to men that women can voluntarily serve in all military occupations but are exempt from the registration requirement and the prospect of being drafted . in addition , some have raised concerns about the statutory penalties for failing to register and whether these penalties are more likely to be levied on vulnerable groups . some contend that congress should amend mssa and associated statute to remove penalties for failing to register . others argue that weakening or removing penalties would cause registration compliance rates to fall to unacceptably low levels . in response to these issues , congress has established a national commission on military , national , and public service to provide research support and recommendations on the future of the sss .
