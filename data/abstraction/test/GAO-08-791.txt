the united states enacted legislation in may 2008 applying federal immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) subject to a transition period . the cnmi is subject to most u.s. laws but has administered its own immigration system , including admitting foreign workers , tourists , and foreign investors . the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the secretaries of the interior , labor , and state , and the attorney general , has the responsibility to establish a transition program . gao was asked to review how the legislation 's implementation may affect the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi 's labor market , including foreign workers ; tourism sector ; and foreign investment . this report is based on gao 's march 2008 report ( gao - 08-466 ) and analysis of data on the cnmi 's labor market , tourism sector , and foreign investment . the potential impact on the cnmi 's labor market of the recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law will largely depend on decisions that the u.s. departments of homeland security ( dhs ) and labor ( dol ) make in implementing a required permit program for foreign workers . the interaction of dhs and dol decisions about , respectively , the number of permits to allocate annually and whether and when to extend the permit program past 2014 will significantly affect employers ' access to foreign workers . however , federal agencies have not yet identified an interagency process to coordinate such decisions . further , the agencies may have difficulty obtaining relevant data on the cnmi labor market . given foreign workers ' prominence in key cnmi industries , any substantial and rapid decline in permits for foreign workers would have a negative effect on the cnmi economy . however , federal agencies may reduce permits more modestly , resulting in minimal effects on the economy . at the same time , continuing declines in the garment industry , challenges to the tourism industry , and the scheduled increases in the minimum wage may reduce demand for foreign workers , lessening any potential adverse impact of the legislation on the economy . although the legislation and the cnmi government have stated goals of preparing cnmi residents to replace foreign workers , factors such as the limited number of available cnmi residents may impede these efforts ' effectiveness . any impact of the recent legislation on the cnmi 's tourism sector will depend largely on federal regulations specifying the countries to be included in a joint cnmi - guam visa waiver program required by the legislation . for countries likely to be included in this program , such as japan and south korea , the impact is likely to be minimal . for countries that may not be part of the joint visa waiver program , possibly including china and russia , applying for a visa from u.s. embassies or consulates will likely be more costly and more time - consuming than obtaining a visitor entry permit under cnmi immigration law . to the extent that any increase in the cost and time required to obtain a visa discourages tourists from visiting the cnmi , the legislation could negatively affect cnmi tourism . the recent legislation 's impact on cnmi foreign investment will depend in part on dhs decisions regarding the application of u.s. nonimmigrant treaty investor status -- `` grandfathering '' -- for investors with cnmi foreign investor entry permits . however , lack of data on foreign investment in the cnmi makes it difficult to assess the likely impact of these decisions and may hamper dhs 's ability to make informed decisions . because long - term business entry permits account for a large proportion of cnmi foreign investor entry permits , more cnmi foreign investors will be grandfathered if dhs applies the status to these permit holders . any impact on foreign investment in the cnmi will likely affect the labor market and tourism sector , and any impact on the labor market or tourism sector may also affect foreign investment .
