since its inception , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has undertaken numerous programs that have greatly advanced scientific and technological knowledge . nasa 's activities span a broad range of complex and technical endeavors . but the agency is at a critical juncture , and major management improvements are needed . in january of this year , we identified four challenges facing nasa : strengthening strategic human capital management , improving contract management ; controlling international space station costs , and reducing space launch costs . in summary , these challenges affect nasa 's ability to effectively run its largest programs . nasa 's ultimate challenge will be in tackling the root problems impeding those programs . this will require instituting a results - oriented culture that fosters knowledge sharing and empowers its workforce to accomplish programmatic goals ; ensuring that the agency adheres to management controls to prevent cost overruns and scheduling problems ; transforming the financial management organization so it better supports nasa 's core mission ; and sustaining commitment to change .
