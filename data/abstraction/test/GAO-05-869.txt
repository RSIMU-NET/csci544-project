ranchers pay a fee to graze their livestock on federal land . grazing occurs primarily on federal land located in the western states managed by 10 federal agencies . generally , the fee is based on animal unit months ( aum ) -- the amount of forage that a cow and her calf can eat in 1 month . for most federal land , the fee per aum is established by a formula . advocates argue that grazing uses federal land productively and that the grazing fee is fair . opponents argue that grazing damages public resources and that grazing fees are too low . gao was asked to determine the extent of , and purposes for , grazing in fiscal year 2004 on lands 10 federal agencies manage ; amount federal agencies spent in fiscal year 2004 to manage grazing ; total grazing receipts the 10 agencies collected in fiscal year 2004 and amounts disbursed ; and fees charged in 2004 by the 10 agencies , western states , and ranchers , and reasons for any differences . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the interior and the forest service neither agreed nor disagreed with the findings . the forest service stated that the report accurately described the purpose of the grazing fee . the army and air force and the department of energy provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . the departments of commerce and of justice responded that they did not have comments . the 10 federal agencies managed more than 22.6 million aums on about 235 million acres of federal lands for grazing and land management in fiscal year 2004. of this total , the department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) and the u.s. department of agriculture 's forest service managed more than 98 percent of the lands used for grazing . the agencies manage their grazing programs under different authorities and for different purposes . for blm lands and western forest service lands , grazing is a major program ; the eight other agencies generally use grazing as a tool to achieve their primary land management goals . in fiscal year 2004 , federal agencies spent a total of at least $ 144 million . the 10 federal agencies spent at least $ 135.9 million , with the forest service and blm accounting for the majority . other federal agencies have grazing - related activities , such as pest control , and spent at least $ 8.4 million in fiscal year 2004. the 10 federal agencies ' grazing fees generated about $ 21 million in fiscal year 2004- - less than one - sixth of the expenditures to manage grazing . of that amount , the agencies distributed about $ 5.7 million to states and counties in which grazing occurred , returned about $ 3.8 million to the treasury , and deposited at least $ 11.7 million in separate treasury accounts to help pay for agency programs , among other things . the amounts each agency distributed varied , depending on the agencies ' differing authorities . fees charged in 2004 by the 10 federal agencies , as well as state land agencies and private ranchers , vary widely . the grazing fee blm and the forest service charge , which was $ 1.43 per aum in 2004 , is established by formula and is generally much lower than the fees charged by the other federal agencies , states , and private ranchers . the other agencies , states , and ranchers generally established fees to obtain the market value of the forage . the formula used to calculate the blm and forest service grazing fee incorporates ranchers ' ability to pay ; therefore the current purpose of the fee is not primarily to recover the agencies ' expenditures or to capture the fair market value of forage . as a result , blm 's and the forest service 's grazing receipts fell short of their expenditures on grazing in fiscal year 2004 by almost $ 115 million . the blm and forest service fee also decreased by 40 percent from 1980 to 2004 , while grazing fees charged by private ranchers increased by 78 percent for the same period . if the purpose of the fee were to recover expenditures , blm and the forest service would have had to charge $ 7.64 and $ 12.26 per aum , respectively ; alternately , if the purpose were to gain a fair market value , the agencies ' fees would vary depending on the market . differences in resources and legal requirements can cause fees to vary ; however , the approaches used by other agencies could close the gap in expenditures and receipts or more closely align blm and forest service fees with market prices . the purpose of the grazing fee is , ultimately , for the congress to determine .
