in august 2001 , the administration announced competitive sourcing as one of five initiatives in the president 's management agenda . under competitive sourcing , federal agencies open their commercial activities to competition among public and private sector sources . while competitive sourcing is expected to encourage innovation and improve efficiency and performance , it represents a major management change for most agencies . this report describes the progress selected agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program , identifies major challenges these agencies are facing , and discusses strategies they are using to select activities for competition . since the president announced competitive sourcing as a governmentwide initiative , the six civilian agencies gao reviewed created a basic infrastructure for their competitive sourcing programs , including establishing offices , appointing officials , hiring staff and consultants , issuing guidance , and conducting training . with infrastructures in place and leadership involvement , each agency has developed competitive sourcing plans and conducted some competitions . the department of defense ( dod ) has had an extensive competitive sourcing program since the mid - 1990s . interagency forums for sharing competitive sourcing information also have been established . while such activities are underway , each agency gao reviewed , including dod , cited several significant challenges in achieving its competitive sourcing goals . key among these is maintaining workforce inventories that distinguish inherently governmental positions from commercial positions -- a prerequisite to identifying potential positions to compete . agencies also have been challenged to develop competitive sourcing approaches that would improve efficiency , in part because agencies have focused more on following omb guidance on the number of positions to compete -- not on achieving savings and improving performance . ensuring adequate personnel with the skills needed to run a competitive sourcing program also challenged agencies . many civilian department - level offices have only one or two full - time staff to interpret new laws , implement new omb guidance , maintain inventories of competable positions and activities , and oversee agency competitions . the federal acquisition council is currently identifying agency staffing needs to address this challenge . finally , some of the civilian agencies we reviewed reported funding challenges in implementing their competitive sourcing programs . omb told agencies to include a line item for competitive sourcing activities in their fiscal year 2005 budget requests . several agencies integrated their strategic , human capital , and competitive sourcing plans -- an approach encouraged by the commercial activities panel , which was convened to conduct a congressionally mandated study of the competitive sourcing process . for example , the internal revenue service ( irs ) used business case analyses to assess the economic benefits of various sourcing alternatives . an irs official said this approach required minimal investment to determine an activity 's suitability for competitive sourcing . the national institutes of health , the army , and the department of education also took a strategic approach to competitive sourcing . omb 's task in balancing the need for transparency and consistency with the flexibility agencies need is not an easy one . while omb is addressing funding and human capital challenges , it needs to do more to assure that the agencies ' inventories of commercial positions and goal - setting processes are more strategic and helpful to agencies in achieving savings and improving performance .
