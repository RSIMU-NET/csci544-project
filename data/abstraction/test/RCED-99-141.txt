pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of energy 's ( doe ) progress in implementing performance - based contracting at its national laboratories , focusing on : the status of performance - based contracting in doe 's national laboratory contracts ; and doe 's efforts to determine the impact of performance - based contracting . gao noted that : doe 's use of performance - based contracting for its laboratories is in a state of transition ; while all laboratory contracts gao examined had some performance - based features , gao found wide variance in the number of performance measures and the types of fees negotiated ; about half of the 18 laboratory contracts have performance fees to encourage superior performance -- a major goal of performance - based contracting ; most of the remaining laboratory contracts are still based on doe 's traditional fixed - fee arrangement in which the fees are paid regardless of performance ; doe has not evaluated the impact of performance - based contracting on its laboratory contractors and , as a result , does not know if this new form of contracting is achieving the intended results of improved performance and lower costs ; specifically , doe has not determined whether giving higher fees to encourage superior performance by its laboratory contractors is advantageous to the government , although gao recommended in 1994 that doe develop criteria for measuring the costs and benefits to the government of using higher fees ; fees for the laboratories totalled over $ 100 million for fiscal year 1998 ; while the contractors were unable to cite measurable benefits achieved by switching to performance - based contracting , they support its goals ; and the main benefits from performance - based contracting cited by laboratory contractors was that it has helped doe clarify what it expects from the contractors and that it has improved communication .
