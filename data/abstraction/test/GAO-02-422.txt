preventive medicine , including immunizations for many diseases and screening for some types of cancer , holds the promise to extend and improve the quality of life for millions of americans . medicare now covers three preventive services for immunizations and three for screenings , and the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) sponsors `` interventions '' to increase the use of preventive services . gao found that the use of preventive services varies widely by service , state , ethnic group , income , and education . the greatest differences among ethnic groups were for immunization rates . cancer screening rates tended to differ according to income and education level . cms pays for interventions that promote breast cancer screenings and pneumonia and flu shots . most of the techniques being used , such as reminder systems that medical offices can use to alert doctors and patients to needed cancer screenings , have been effective . cms is evaluating what its current efforts have accomplished and expects the results later this year .
