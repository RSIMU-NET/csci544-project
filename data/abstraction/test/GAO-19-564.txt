school - age children without internet access may have difficulty in completing homework . those without in - home fixed access may go online wirelessly outside the home to do homework . a provision was included in statute for gao to review wireless internet access for school - age children in lower - income households . this report examines challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework involving internet access , and selected school district efforts to expand wireless access for students and the federal role in those efforts . gao analyzed 2017 cps data ; reviewed six local projects that were selected based in part on education industry stakeholders ' recommendations , that included a range of geographic locations , and that took steps to address the homework gap ; compared fcc efforts to federal standards for internal controls and pilot - program design best practices ; reviewed fcc and department of education documents ; and interviewed 17 stakeholders , including school districts . according to gao 's analysis of 2017 census bureau current population survey ( cps ) data , children ages 6 to 17 in lower - income households are more likely than peers in higher - income households to lack high - speed in - home internet and rely on mobile wireless service . gao found that students who use mobile wireless for homework may face challenges , including slower speeds and limitations smartphones present in completing tasks like typing papers . these “ underconnected ” students may seek out ways to access wireless internet outside of the home to do homework ; however , these methods also pose challenges ( see figure ) . the inequity in internet access — and therefore in the ease of doing homework involving access — between students of varying income levels is known as the “ homework gap. ” efforts by six selected projects involving seven school districts expanding wireless access for students who may lack it at home varied . according to officials with most school district projects gao reviewed , rules for the federal communications commission 's ( fcc ) e - rate program , which allows schools to purchase discounted internet equipment , may limit schools ' ability to provide wireless access off - premises . specifically , off - premises access is not eligible for e - rate support , and schools that provide such access using existing services supported by e - rate must reduce their e - rate discounts . fcc conducted a pilot project in 2011 and 2012 to help decide whether to make wireless off - premises access eligible for e - rate support , but fcc did not determine and execute a methodology to assess the potential costs , benefits , and challenges of doing so . in 2016 , fcc received two requests from school districts seeking waivers of rules to allow them to use e - rate program support to provide off - premises access , but fcc has not made a decision on the waivers . determining and executing a methodology to analyze data about the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of easing e - rate rules on off - premises use and publishing the results could provide transparency to stakeholders such as school districts . this step could also help fcc act on pending and future waiver - of - rule requests and broader changes to rules that may help schools address the homework gap . gao recommends that fcc take steps to assess and publish the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises wireless access eligible for e - rate support . fcc agreed with gao 's recommendation .
