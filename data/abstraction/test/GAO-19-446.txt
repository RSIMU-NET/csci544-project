misuse and abuse of prescription opioids can lead to overdose and death . according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , 47,600 overdose deaths in the united states in 2017 involved an opioid . gao and other federal entities have raised concerns about opioid misuse and abuse in medicare . the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2016 ( cara ) authorized cms and medicare plan sponsors to establish voluntary dmps that may limit access to frequently abused prescription drugs , such as opioids , for medicare beneficiaries who are identified as being at risk for prescription drug abuse . dmps will become mandatory in medicare starting in january 2022. cara included a provision for gao to review dmps under medicare . this report : 1 ) describes how medicare identifies beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse and abuse and how it attempts to mitigate that risk ; and 2 ) identifies the factors likely to affect the success of medicare dmps . gao reviewed cdc 's guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain , cms regulations , and other relevant cms guidance . gao also interviewed officials from cms , the five largest medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors , and officials from six other stakeholder organizations representing medicare plan sponsors , physicians ( including pain specialists ) , pharmacy benefit managers , state medicaid programs , and patients . medicare 's drug management programs ( dmp ) identify beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse or abuse , and attempt to mitigate that risk through the use of case management and coverage limitations . dmps are overseen by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and voluntarily implemented by medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors ( private health plans ) . cms established a two - step framework for identifying at - risk beneficiaries under dmps . first , cms identifies potentially at - risk beneficiaries based on key factors , such as beneficiaries ' daily dosage of opioids and the number of prescribers and pharmacies from which they receive opioids , with higher numbers possibly putting the beneficiary at more risk . second , medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors ' clinicians coordinate the provision of care among prescribers and pharmacists ( referred to as case management ) to determine if those potentially at - risk beneficiaries are actually at risk . if a patient is deemed to be at risk , coverage limitation tools — such as limiting a beneficiary to a selected prescriber or pharmacy , and implementing point - of - sale restrictions on certain drugs or amounts — can be used to limit the at - risk beneficiary 's access to opioids . beneficiaries have an opportunity to appeal an at - risk designation . none of the five plan sponsors gao interviewed expressed concerns about beneficiaries not receiving clinically appropriate doses of opioids under the medicare dmps . medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors and other stakeholders gao interviewed reported several factors beyond the case management process that could contribute to the success of dmps . these factors included communication among sponsors , opioid prescribers , and pharmacies dispensing opioids to reduce potential resistance to participating in dmps by opioid prescribers or beneficiaries . according to plan sponsors and stakeholders , plan sponsors could communicate with stakeholders to ensure that dmps are not viewed as a punitive tool by beneficiaries , but rather as tools for keeping them safe . plan sponsors and stakeholders noted that it is important for plan sponsors to have flexibility in varying coverage limitation features to fit regional and other differences in population groups . they noted that cms should periodically reassess and adjust the elements of the dmp program where appropriate , to incorporate evidence from the outcomes of the dmp — such as how at - risk beneficiaries are identified , or which drugs are selected as frequently abused drugs . finally , cms officials told gao that they are taking steps to assess the dmps and gather the information required to make periodic changes to the dmp program . for example , cms officials plan to analyze data for at - risk beneficiaries that dmps are required to report to cms , update their medicare part d audit protocol , and obtain feedback from plan sponsors about how the dmps are working . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
