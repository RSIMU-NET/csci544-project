federal employees participate in one of two retirement systems . the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) was established in 1920 and covers only employees hired before 1984. participants in the csrs do not pay social security payroll taxes and they do not earn social security benefits . for a worker retiring after 30 years of federal service , a csrs annuity will be equal to 56.25 % of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of basic pay . the social security amendments of 1983 ( p.l . 98-21 ) required federal employees hired after 1983 to participate in social security . because the csrs was not designed to coordinate with social security , congress directed the development of a new retirement plan for federal workers hired after 1983. the result was the federal employees ' retirement system ( fers ) act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-335 ) . the fers has three elements : ( 1 ) social security , ( 2 ) the fers basic retirement annuity and fers supplement , and ( 3 ) the thrift savings plan ( tsp ) . the amount of the fers basic retirement annuity is determined by three factors : ( 1 ) the salary base , ( 2 ) the accrual rate , and ( 3 ) years of service . the salary base is the average of the worker 's highest three consecutive years of pay . under fers , the benefit accrual rate is 1.0 % per year of service , or 1.1 % for workers retiring at the age of 62 or later with 20 or more years of service . a worker with 30 years of service retiring at the age of 62 will receive a fers pension equal to 33 % of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of pay , or about 32 % of final annual salary . the tsp is a defined contribution retirement plan similar to the 401 ( k ) plans provided by many employers in the private sector . the income that a retired worker receives from the tsp will depend on the balance in his or her account . in 2015 , employees covered by fers or csrs can contribute up to $ 18,000 to the tsp . employees aged 50 or older can contribute an additional $ 6,000 . contributions of up to 5 % of pay made by workers under fers are matched by the federal government . workers covered by csrs can contribute to the tsp , but they receive no matching contributions . the tsp is a key element of the fers , especially for workers at the upper ranges of the federal pay scale . the social security benefit formula is designed to replace a greater share of income for low - wage workers than for high - wage workers . the fers basic annuity will replace about 32 % of final salary for an employee retiring at the age of 62 with 30 years of service . higher - wage federal workers need to contribute a greater percentage of pay to the tsp to reach the same level of income replacement as lower - paid workers can achieve from just the fers retirement annuity and social security . at an annual rate of return of 6.0 % , income from the tsp can replace about 33 % of final pay for a federal employee who contributes 10 % of pay over 30 years .
