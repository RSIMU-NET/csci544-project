the 2007-2009 financial crisis focused attention on weaknesses in the u.s. regulatory structure , including the lack of an agency or mechanism responsible for monitoring and addressing risks across the financial system . to address this weakness , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act created fsoc to identify and address threats to financial stability . among other statutorily defined authorities , fsoc may designate nonbank financial companies for heightened supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system . fsoc consists of 10 voting members and 5 nonvoting members . the 10 voting members include 9 federal regulators and an independent insurance expert . in september 2012 , gao issued a report on fsoc 's challenges , efforts to establish management mechanisms , activities for supporting collaboration among its members and external stakeholders , and processes for issuing reports and rules . gao made nine recommendations to fsoc to improve the transparency and accountability of its decisionmaking , among other things . this testimony is based on gao 's september 2012 report ( gao - 12-886 ) . it discusses fsoc 's efforts to respond to gao 's 2012 recommendations . from june through september 2014 , gao obtained updated information from fsoc staff and reviewed documents related to gao 's recommendations . the financial stability oversight council 's ( fsoc ) has taken steps to address some of gao 's september 2012 recommendations , but additional efforts are needed . gao made nine recommendations to fsoc in three areas : emerging threats and risks identification , transparency and accountability , and collaboration and coordination . gao recommended , among other things , that fsoc : develop a systematic approach that includes collecting and sharing key financial risk indicators to help identify potential threats to financial stability ; develop a strategy to improve communications with the public ; keep detailed records of closed - door sessions ; create a framework for assessing the impact of its decisions to designate nonbanks for enhanced supervision ; develop policies to clarify when collaboration or coordination should occur ; adopt leading practices , such as joint strategies , for collaboration ; and clarify roles and responsibilities for monitoring threats to the financial system . fsoc still lacks a comprehensive , systematic approach to identify emerging threats to financial stability . in 2012 , gao reported that fsoc 's approach might not help identify new risks or threats that member agencies had not already identified . the office of financial research ( ofr ) has made some progress in developing data tools to support fsoc since the 2012 report , but gao 's observations of two of these tools suggest that one tool does not focus on risks to the financial system , while another remains in a prototype phase . fsoc has taken steps to improve its communication with the public but could do more to improve transparency and accountability . in may 2014 , fsoc approved a revised transparency policy , and fsoc staff said they had attempted to provide more information in the minutes of meetings . but fsoc staff said that they did not intend to keep detailed minutes because of the confidential information discussed . also , fsoc staff also said that the impact of designating nonbanks for enhanced supervision would be assessed as part of a mandated january 2016 study . however , fsoc has not begun to prepare for this study . gao has reported on the importance of advance planning for retrospective studies so that needed data are collected . fsoc has taken steps to improve collaboration and coordination among member agencies but does not plan to act on some of gao 's recommendations on coordination . in may 2014 , fsoc approved one formal mechanism that supported coordination â€” bylaws for the deputies committee of senior officials from member agencies that describe its role in coordinating fsoc activities . fsoc staff said they did not plan to clarify the roles and responsibilities of fsoc , ofr , and member agencies because the overlapping responsibilities for monitoring systemic risk had not been problematic . officials also said that fsoc would not adopt practices to coordinate rulemaking across member agencies , as it does not have the authority to direct independent agencies . gao maintains that action is needed as its past work has shown that the lack of clear roles and coordination can lead to duplication , confusion , and regulatory gaps .
