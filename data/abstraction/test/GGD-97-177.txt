pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the government printing office 's ( gpo ) procedures for managing its inventory of excess publications , particularly its management of a major inventory reduction that took place in september 1996 , focusing on : whether gpo followed existing policies and procedures ; and how 3,258 copies of the senate 1789-1989 , a four - volume set written by senator byrd , were destroyed as part of that reduction . gao noted that : when for the first time in 15 years a potential financial loss was identified in gpo 's sales program in june 1996 , the superintendent of documents , who heads the sales program , initiated several actions intended to improve the program 's long - term financial condition ; the superintendent of documents said he wanted to dispose of the excess inventory by september 30 , 1996 , to take the losses in fiscal year ( fy ) 1996 rather than in later years , when it otherwise would have been identified , disposed of , and charged to expense ; the superintendent of documents also said he had erroneously believed that it was necessary to physically remove excess publications from inventory storage by september 30 , 1996 , in order to record them as an expense in the financial records for fy 1996 ; although the superintendent of documents had policies and procedures in place to prevent the disposal of publications that the issuing agency still wanted , in june 1996 he instructed his staff to disregard those policies that would interfere with his goal of disposing of as much excess publications inventory as possible by september 30 , 1996 ; acting under the superintendent 's overall instructions , gpo sales program staff disregarded a policy that has existed since at least 1984 , which provides that , before disposing of any excess copies of publications , gpo should offer them to the issuing agencies ; in explaining its inventory reduction to senator byrd , gpo said that it had found that it was generally more cost - effective to dispose of excess inventory and reprint if necessary , than to hold it in storage indefinitely ; however , gpo officials said that they knew that the reprint costs would substantially exceed the holding costs for these copies , given their relatively high printing and binding costs ; in july 1997 , after senator byrd inquired about the major inventory reduction , the superintendent of documents orally instructed his staff to retain the remaining volumes of the senate history and , at gao 's recommendation , put this instruction in writing in august 1997 ; and the superintendent further said that gpo was developing a new integrated processing system that would help designate publications that should not be excessed and , at gao 's recommendation , agreed to develop a systematic process for identifying publications to be held indefinitely for valid reasons .
