state juvenile justice systems face critical problems when it comes to juvenile delinquency issues such as reentry -- when offenders return home from incarceration -- and substance abuse . gao was asked to review juvenile reentry and substance abuse program research and efforts by the department of justice 's ( doj ) office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) to provide information on effective programs ( i.e . , whether a program achieves its intended goal ) and cost - beneficial programs ( i.e . , whether the benefits of programs exceeded their costs ) . this report addresses expert opinion and available research on these types of reentry and substance abuse programs , the extent to which ojjdp assesses its efforts to disseminate information on effective programs , and ojjdp 's plans to accomplish its research and evaluation goals . gao , among other things , reviewed academic literature , and ojjdp 's dissemination efforts and research goals . gao also interviewed ojjdp officials and a nonprobability sample of 26 juvenile justice experts selected based on their experience with juvenile reentry and substance abuse issues . the majority of the juvenile justice reentry and substance abuse experts gao interviewed cited evidence that shows cognitive behavioral therapy -- programs that help individuals change their beliefs in order to change their behavior -- and family therapy -- programs that treat juveniles by focusing on improving communication with family members -- are effective and cost beneficial when addressing reentry and substance abuse issues . for example , two juvenile reentry experts cited studies showing that 1 year after participating in a cognitive behavioral therapy program , participants were less likely to commit another offense than nonparticipants . additionally , experts cited a study that reported that a family therapy program provides about $ 80,000 in savings per participant when accounting for savings from a decline in crime , such as the cost the police would have incurred . most experts indicated that there was limited evidence on the effectiveness and cost benefits of reentry programs , such as aftercare -- programs that assist juvenile offenders in returning to their communities during the reentry process -- and substance abuse programs , such as drug courts -- specialized courts that provide programs for substance - abusing juveniles and their families . gao reviewed two ojjdp efforts that provide information on effective programs across the range of juvenile justice issues , the national training and technical assistance center ( nttac ) and the model programs guide . ojjdp has mechanisms in place to regularly assess the utility of the information provided by nttac , but does not have such a mechanism for the guide . ojjdp ensures the utility of nttac 's information through evaluations in accordance with federal guidelines that highlight the importance of regularly soliciting feedback from users . however , ojjdp could better ensure the utility of the information disseminated by the model programs guide by having a mechanism in place to solicit regular feedback from members of the juvenile justice field -- for example , program practitioners -- that is specifically related to the guide . ojjdp has articulated research and evaluation goals to support its mission of improving the juvenile justice system and is developing plans to assist in meeting these goals . ojjdp is required under the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act , as amended , to publish an annual program plan that describes planned activities under accounts authorized for research and evaluation activities , among other things . additionally , the office of management and budget ( omb ) recommended that ojjdp develop a comprehensive evaluation plan for juvenile justice programs . while ojjdp has not published an annual program plan since 2002 , in december of 2009 , it issued a proposed plan for public comment and aims to publish the final program plan once public comments are incorporated . additionally , although the office has considered developing a comprehensive evaluation plan to address omb recommendations , it had not previously done so because of a lack of resources . however , ojjdp is committed to developing a comprehensive evaluation plan once the program plan is finalized .
