the fiscal year 2009 budget request for the internal revenue service ( irs ) is a road map for how irs plans to allocate resources and achieve ambitious goals for improving enforcement , improving taxpayer service , increasing research , and continuing to invest in modernized information systems . one complicating factor in implementing irs 's plans in the immediate future is the recent passage of the economic stimulus act of 2008 , which creates additional , unanticipated workload for irs . gao was asked to assess how the president 's budget request for irs allocates resources and justifies proposed initiatives ; determine the status of irs 's efforts to develop and implement its business systems modernization ( bsm ) program ; and determine the total costs of administering the economic stimulus legislation . to meet these objectives , gao drew upon and updated recently issued reports . the president 's fiscal year 2009 budget request for irs is $ 11.4 billion , 4.3 percent more than last year 's enacted amount . the request proposes to maintain taxpayer service at recent levels , in part by realizing efficiency gains from electronic filing , despite a decrease in staffing . it also proposes a 7 percent increase in enforcement spending , including spending for 21 legislative and nonlegislative initiatives . the legislative proposals are projected to cost $ 23 million in fiscal year 2009 , funding that irs would not need if the proposals are not enacted . similarly , if irs were to fall behind in its proposed enforcement hiring efforts , it would not need all $ 226 million of the associated funding . irs justified its nonlegislative enforcement initiatives with return on investment ( roi ) analyses , which are useful , despite limitations , for making resource allocation decisions . the budget request does not provide roi information for activities that constitute a large part of the budget request -- activities other than the proposed initiatives . the request for bsm is over $ 44 million lower than the fiscal year 2008 enacted amount . irs said this funding level will allow it to continue its primary modernization projects , but it did not describe how specific projects or benefits to taxpayers would be affected . irs has continued to make progress in implementing bsm projects and improving modernization management controls and capabilities . however , further improvements are needed . for example , the agency has yet to develop long - term plans for completing bsm and consolidating and retiring legacy systems . irs estimated that the costs of implementing the economic stimulus legislation may be up to a total of $ 767 million -- including a $ 202 million supplemental appropriation . in addition to the supplemental appropriation , irs is reallocating hundreds of collections staff to answering taxpayer telephone calls , resulting in up to $ 565 million in foregone enforcement revenue . in addition , irs expects some deterioration in telephone service because of the increased call volume . for example , irs is expecting its assistor level of service to drop to as low as 74 percent compared to its goal of 82 percent .
