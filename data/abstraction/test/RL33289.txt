social security plays an important role in reducing poverty , not only among the aged but among children as well . children may be eligible for social security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies , becomes disabled , or retires . in addition to receiving social security in their own right , children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members receiving benefits . based on a congressional research service ( crs ) analysis of u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data , in april 2013 , an estimated 8.5 million children lived in families in which one or more family members received social security â€” 11.6 % of all children . of this number , an estimated 5.1 million were either child beneficiaries in their own right , or lived with a parent or guardian who reported receiving social security . the remaining 3.4 million children lived in families in which social security was received only by extended family members ( e.g , grandparents , aunts , uncles , nieces or nephews ) or other family members ( adult siblings ) . for the former group , social security 's effect on child poverty is more directly related to social security policy , whereas for the latter group , social security 's effect on child poverty is more directly related to children 's incidental family living arrangements . children living in families who received social security were about equally as likely to be poor ( 24.4 % ) in april 2013 as children living in families who did n't ( 23.3 % ) . children estimated to have received social security benefits on their own behalf and / or to live with a parent or guardian who received social security were more likely to be poor ( 27.2 % ) than children who incidently were living in families in which social security is received only by extended family members ( e.g . , grandparent , aunt , uncle ) or adult sibling ( 21.3 % ) . social security benefits lifted an estimated 1.952 million children above the official poverty line in april 2013. among children in families that received social security , an estimated 47.8 % ( 4.062 million ) would have been considered poor based on family income other than social security . the addition of social security to family income reduces the incidence of poverty among these children to 24.8 % ( 2.110 million ) . in april 2013 , it 's estimated that over two - fifths of social security dollars paid to families with children helped children who otherwise would be counted as poor . social security benefits paid on behalf of children and / or their parents or guardians amounted to nearly an estimated $ 3.847 billion in april 2013 , or $ 46.167 billion on an annualized basis . of this amount , nearly half ( 49.2 % ) , $ 22.072 billion on an annualized basis , went to families who would have been considered poor based on their pre - transfer income ( i.e . , excluding social security ) , about two and one - half times the estimated $ 8.738 billion in combined federal and state cash welfare spending under the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program in fy2013 , and five times the federal ( only ) share of $ 4.485 billion .
