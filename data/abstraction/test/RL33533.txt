the kingdom of saudi arabia , ruled by the al saud family since its founding in 1932 , wields significant global influence through its administration of the birthplace of the islamic faith and by virtue of its large oil reserves . close u.s. - saudi official relations have survived a series of challenges since the 1940s . in recent years , shared concerns over sunni islamist extremist terrorism and iranian government policies have provided some renewed logic for continued strategic cooperation . political upheaval and conflict in the middle east and north africa have created new challenges , and the trump administration has sought to strengthen u.s. ties to saudi leaders as the kingdom implements a series of new domestic and foreign policy initiatives . successive u.s. administrations have referred to the saudi government as an important partner , and u.s. arms sales and related security cooperation have continued with congressional oversight and amid some congressional opposition . the trump administration , like its recent predecessors , praises saudi government counterterrorism efforts . since 2009 , the executive branch has notified congress of proposed foreign military sales to saudi arabia of major defense articles and services with a potential aggregate value of nearly $ 139 billion . the united states and saudi arabia concluded arms sale agreements worth more than $ 65 billion , from fy2009 through fy2016 . since march 2015 , the u.s. - trained saudi military has used u.s. - origin weaponry , u.s. logistical assistance , and shared intelligence in support of military operations in yemen . legislation has been proposed in the 115th congress to condition or disapprove of some u.s. weapons sales and condition or direct the president to end u.s. support to saudi operations without specific authorization ( h.j.res . 102 , h.j.res . 104 , s.j.res . 40 , s.j.res . 42 , s.j.res . 54 , s.j.res . 55 ) . in parallel to close security ties , official u.s. reports describe restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in the kingdom . some saudi activists advocate for limited economic and political reforms , continuing decades - long trends that have seen saudi liberals , moderates , and conservatives advance different visions for domestic change . saudi leaders in 2018 reversed a long - standing ban on women 's right to drive , amid some arrests of women 's rights advocates and critics of social liberalization . while some limited protests and arrests have occurred since unrest swept the region in 2011 , clashes involving saudi security forces have not spread beyond certain predominantly shia areas of the oil - rich eastern province . since assuming the throne in 2015 , king salman bin abd al aziz ( age 82 ) has made a series of appointments and reassignments that have altered the responsibilities and relative power of leading members of the next generation of the al saud family , who are the grandsons of the kingdom 's founder . the king 's son , crown prince mohammed bin salman ( age 33 ) , is the central figure in saudi policymaking . he has asserted control over national security forces , sidelined potential rivals , proposed and begun implementing bold economic and social changes , and arrested prominent figures accused of corruption , including some fellow royal family members . ambitious plans for the transformation of the kingdom 's economy seek to provide opportunity for young saudis and bolster nonoil sources of revenues for the state . abroad , the kingdom pursues a multidirectional policy and has aggressively confronted perceived threats . saudi decisionmaking long appeared to be risk - averse and rooted in rulers ' concerns for maintaining consensus among different constituencies , including factions of the royal family , business elites , and conservative religious figures . crown prince mohammed bin salman 's assertive and more centralized leadership has challenged this model of governance . the change is leading saudis and outsiders alike to reexamine their assumptions about the kingdom 's future . congress may examine these developments when considering the scope , terms , and merits of u.s. - saudi partnership , proposed arms sales and nuclear cooperation , and security commitments .
