agencies can use several different types of contracts to leverage the government 's buying power for goods and services . these include interagency contracts -- where one agency uses another 's contract for its own needs -- such as the general services administration ( gsa ) and the department of veterans affairs multiple award schedule ( mas ) contracts , multiagency contracts ( mac ) for a wide range of goods and services , and governmentwide acquisition contracts ( gwac ) for information technology . agencies spent at least $ 60 billion in fiscal year 2008 through these contracts and similar single - agency enterprisewide contracts . however , concerns exist about duplication , oversight , and a lack of information on these contracts , and pricing and management of the mas program . gao was asked to assess the reasons for establishing and the policies to manage these contracts ; the effectiveness of gsa tools for obtaining best mas contract prices ; and gsa 's management of the mas program . to do this , gao reviewed statutes , regulations , policies , contract documentation and data , and interviewed officials from omb and six agencies . gwacs , macs -- two types of interagency contracts -- and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to the government in buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services . however , data are lacking and there is limited governmentwide policy to effectively leverage , manage , and oversee these contracts . the total number of macs and enterprisewide contracts is unknown , and existing data are not sufficiently reliable to identify them . in addition , gwacs are the only interagency contracts requiring omb approval . agencies gao reviewed followed statutes , acquisition regulations , and internal policies to establish and use macs and enterprisewide contracts . avoiding fees associated with using other agencies ' contracts and more control over procurements are some of the reasons agencies cited for establishing macs and enterprisewide contracts . however , many of the same contractors provided similar products and services on multiple contracts -- a condition that increases costs to both the vendor and the government and misses opportunities to leverage the government 's buying power . recent legislation and omb 's office of federal procurement policy initiatives are expected to strengthen management of macs , but no such initiatives exist for enterprisewide contracts . gsa 's mas program -- the largest interagency contracting program -- uses several tools and controls to obtain best prices , but the limited application of certain tools hinders its ability to determine whether it achieves this goal . gsa has established two regulatory pricing controls for mas contracts : seek the best prices vendors provide to their most favored customers ; and a price reduction clause that provides the government a lower price if a vendor lowers the price for similarly situated commercial customers . gsa uses other pricing tools -- e.g . , pre - award contract audits by its inspector general and procurement management reviews -- on a limited basis . for example , the inspector general performs pre - award audits on a small sample of mas contracts annually , but has identified contract cost avoidance of almost $ 4 billion in recent years . in 2008 , gsa established a mas advisory panel that recommended changes to the pricing controls noted above ; concerns remain that such changes could adversely affect gsa 's ability to negotiate best prices . a lack of data , decentralized management , and limitations in assessment tools create challenges for gsa in managing the mas program . the agency lacks data about customer agencies ' use of the program , limiting its ability to determine how well the program meets customers ' needs . the mas program office lacks direct program oversight , as gsa has dispersed authority for managing mas among nine acquisition centers under three business portfolios . program stakeholders have identified concerns that this structure has impaired consistent policy implementation . shortcomings in assessment tools also result in management challenges . for example , performance measures are inconsistent , including inconsistent emphasis on pricing . gsa 's customer satisfaction survey has such a low response rate that its utility for evaluating program performance is limited .
