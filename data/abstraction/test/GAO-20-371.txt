dod 's mtfs are critical to the medical readiness of servicemembers and providing readiness training for about 107,000 active - duty medical providers . about 9.6 million beneficiaries are eligible for dod health care through mtfs and civilian network providers . to further support readiness , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 required dod to plan to restructure mtfs . dod 's february 2020 plan included decreasing capabilities at 43 mtfs and closing five . the ndaa included a provision for gao to review the plan . this report addresses the extent to which 1 ) the plan 's methodology prioritized statutory elements and considered complete information , and 2 ) dod is positioned to execute mtf restructuring transitions . gao reviewed dod 's plan , mtf workload and cost data , and interviewed dod leaders and officials at 11 mtfs selected on the basis of military department , restructuring action , and location . the department of defense 's ( dod ) methodology to determine medical treatment facilities ' ( mtf ) restructuring actions in its implementation plan ( the plan ) prioritized statutory elements . these included military readiness , adequacy of nearby civilian health care , and cost - effectiveness . however , dod based part of its methodology on incomplete and inaccurate information . civilian health care assessments did not consistently account for provider quality . dod generally assumed that identified providers were of sufficient quality . gao found that dod considered the quality of nearby civilian providers for one of 11 selected mtfs . in this instance , information from the mtf about the variable quality of nearby civilian health care led to dod 's determination that such care was not yet adequate to support mtf restructuring . officials gao interviewed from other mtfs discussed concerns about quality of care from nearby civilian providers . civilian health care assessments did not account for access to an accurate and adequate number of providers near mtfs . dod may have included in its assessments providers who do not meet dod 's access - to - care standards for certain beneficiaries . for 11 selected mtfs , gao found that about 56 percent of civilian primary care providers and 42 percent of civilian specialty providers that dod identified as being nearby exceeded dod 's drive - time standards . including such providers in its assessments means that dod could have overestimated the adequacy of civilian health care providers in proximity to some mtfs . cost - effectiveness assessments were based on a single set of assumptions . dod concluded that civilian health care was more cost - effective than care in its mtfs without considering other assumptions that could affect its conclusions . for example , dod applied assumptions about the cost of military personnel salaries , mtf workloads , and reimbursement rates for tricare that likely underestimated the cost - effectiveness of mtfs . gao also found that dod conducted limited assessments of mtfs ' support to the readiness of military primary care and nonphysician medical providers â€” an issue dod officials stated they will address during mtf transitions . until dod resolves methodology gaps by using more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness , dod leaders may not fully understand risks to their objectives in restructuring future mtfs . dod 's plan identified actions needed to facilitate mtf restructuring , but the department is not well positioned to execute the transitions . dod 's plan poses challenges for the military departments and the defense health agency ( dha ) related to mtf providers ' readiness . yet , dod plans to move forward with restructuring without a process to monitor progress and challenges . by establishing roles and responsibilities for executing and monitoring mtf restructuring transitions , dod can be better positioned to navigate organizational boundaries between the dha that manages the mtfs and the military departments that provide staff . additionally , by defining measurable objectives and progress thresholds , dod can better ensure it is meeting objectives and facilitating timely adjustments to mtf restructuring transitions , as needed . gao is making six recommendations , including that future mtf assessments use more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness ; and that dod establish roles , responsibilities , and progress thresholds for mtf transitions . dod partially concurred with four recommendations and concurred with two . as discussed in the report , gao continues to believe that all six recommendations are warranted .
