pursuant to a congressional request , gao evaluated the department of the interior 's high - level implementation plan for improving its management of the indian trust funds and resources under its control , focusing on whether the interior has reasonable assurance that : the high - level plan provides an effective solution for addressing its long - standing problems ; and its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs . gao noted that : interior does not have reasonable assurance that its high - level plan for improving indian trust operations provides an effective solution for addressing long - standing management weaknesses ; the plan : recognizes the severity of long - standing weaknesses in managing trust fund assets ; identifies 13 projects intended to improve information systems , enhance the accuracy and completeness of its data regarding the ownership and lease of indian lands , and address deficiencies with respect to records management , training , policy and procedures , and internal controls ; and assigns responsibility for oversight and management of the 13 projects ; however , interior has not properly analyzed its information technology needs which are essential to the overall success of the plan ; until interior develops an information systems architecture addressing all of its trust management functions , it can not ensure that its information systems will not be duplicative or incompatible or will optimally support its needs across all business areas ; interior also does not know whether its acquisition of a new service for managing indian assets and land records will cost - effectively meet trust management needs ; before deciding to contract with a service vendor , interior did not adequately define important service requirements or sufficiently analyze technical alternatives ; interior also did not take the steps needed to minimize acquisition risks ; in particular , it did not develop a risk management plan , ensure that the vendor 's system could work with interior 's data and systems , or establish realistic project timeframes ; and thus , interior faces an unnecessarily high risk that the service will not meet its general business and specific performance needs , and it lacks the means for dealing with this risk .
