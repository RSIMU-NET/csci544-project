the federal budget deficit was the largest it has been since world war ii as a percentage of gdp from 2009 to 2012 , peaking at 10.1 % of gdp . this occurred because spending reached its highest share of gdp since 1945 and revenues reached their lowest share of gdp since 1950. since then , the deficit has declined to a projected 2.8 % of gdp in 2014 , which is still above the 1946 to 2008 average . over the next 25 years , deficits are projected to become very large again under current law . the recent decline in the deficit is partly due to improvements in the economy , the expiration of temporary measures taken in response to the recession , and spending cuts ( mainly to discretionary spending ) . spending was cut by the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l . 112-25 ) and the reduction in overseas contingency operations ( oco ) , primarily in iraq and afghanistan . since september 2008 , legislative changes to spending have added a cumulative $ 1.12 trillion to deficits and legislative changes to revenues , mainly the extension of expiring tax provisions , have added $ 1.75 trillion to deficits , excluding resulting interest costs . looking forward , several uncertainties are inherent in the baseline that may lead to different outcomes than projected . there have been large errors to budget projections historically , in part because economic forecasting is subject to large errors . the budget has also proven to be highly sensitive to recessions , and cbo does not project a recession in its 10-year projection . budget projections also do not assume any significant changes in spending on future wars or disasters . the baseline projection follows current law , assuming that the `` doc fix '' and tax `` extenders '' will expire as scheduled . if congress temporarily extends either , as it has done regularly in the past , the deficit will be larger than projected . in the long run , legislative changes will be needed to reduce spending or increase taxes to keep the debt on a sustainable path . postponing action requires larger changes to be made in the long run , and limits the ability to phase in changes gradually . economists view the debt as currently unsustainable because it is projected to grow faster than gross domestic product ( gdp ) indefinitely under current policy , causing an ever growing share of national income to be devoted to servicing the debt . the main source of long - term fiscal unsustainability is the growth in elderly entitlement spending . in particular , spending on major health programs , such as medicare and medicaid , is assumed to continue to grow faster than gdp , as it has historically . overall , mandatory spending has grown as a share of gdp , rising from 4.7 % of gdp , when data were first compiled in 1962 , to a projected 12.3 % of gdp in 2014 , and is projected to continue rising . by contrast , discretionary spending has fallen from 12.3 % of gdp in 1962 to a projected 6.8 % of gdp in 2014 , and under the baseline it is projected to decline to its lowest share of gdp ever , primarily because of the bca 's statutory caps . revenues are projected to stay near their historical average over the next 10 years . economic theory predicts that deficits have a stimulative effect on the economy during recessions , but harm economic growth by resulting in an increase in interest rates or the trade deficit during economic booms . thus , the state of the economy is a consideration for the timing of deficit reduction . options for deficit reduction on the spending side are constrained by the fact that social security , medicare , net interest , and defense discretionary spending make up almost two - thirds of total spending . on the revenue side , 80 % of revenue is raised by income and payroll taxes .
