the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act authorizes the president to issue declarations that provide states , tribes , and localities with a range of federal assistance in response to natural and man - made incidents . since 1953 the frequency of declarations has increased . for example , the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 1960 to 1969 was roughly 18.6 per year . in contrast , the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 2000 to 2009 was 57.1 per year . the highest number was declared in 2011 , with 97 major disaster declarations . declarations are of concern to members of congress and state delegations when incidents occur in their states and / or congressional districts . declarations are also of broader congressional interest for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the costs involved with the federal assistance provided by the declarations , and ( 2 ) concerns that declarations may be used as political tools â€” especially during election years . analysis of stafford act declarations from 1953 to 2016 demonstrates that : most emergency declarations are for winter storms and hurricanes ; most major disaster declarations are for floods , tornados , winter storms , and hurricanes ; the average number of declarations issued per year in presidential election years from 1974 to 2016 is slightly higher than the average number of declarations in other years from 1974 to 2016 , but the number is not significant enough to draw a decisive conclusion regarding their use as a political tool . after providing an overview of each type of declaration , this report discusses factors that may be responsible for the increase in frequency of declarations , including federal policy changes , increases in severe weather incidents , population growth , and development . some may contend that declaration policies should not be changed because they trigger important federal assistance to states and localities . others argue that policies should be implemented to reduce either the number of declarations being issued each year , or the amount of federal assistance that they provide , or both . these policies include amending certain stafford act policies ; changing the per capita threshold formula used to recommend the issuance of a declaration ; implementing a state capacity indicator to assess whether the state is capable of addressing an incident on its own ; substituting federal loans to states for recovery grants ; and adjusting the federal to state cost - share . such changes could reduce declarations and shift a portion of the funding back to the states . on the other hand , reducing declarations could hamper the ability of states and localities to recover from an incident and could create long - term consequences . the selected approach will likely be influenced by how policymakers view the role of the government when a disaster strikes . it is generally agreed that the government should help disaster victims in times of need , but it is debatable whether the fiscal responsibility resides primarily with the federal or the state government . many of the policy options described in this report shift a greater share of disaster - related costs to states and localities . it remains to be seen if reducing declarations and / or limiting the amount of disaster assistance provided to requesting states would severely disrupt the state 's ability to respond and recover from an incident . this report concludes that the upward trend in declarations will likely continue if declaration policies remain unchanged and severe weather patterns , population growth , and development continue to increase . all of these variables appear to play a role in declaration activity . it could be argued that the policy mechanisms used to address the increase in declarations should be shaped in response to the given variable or variables . this may prove to be difficult because it is unclear which of the variables ( or combination of variables ) has had the greatest impact on the increase in disaster declarations over the years . this report will be updated as events warrant .
