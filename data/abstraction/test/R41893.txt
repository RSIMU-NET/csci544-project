expanded investment in clean and renewable energy resources continues to be a policy priority of the obama administration and an area of interest to the 112th congress . in recent years , the primary policy vehicle for promoting investment in renewable energy has been tax credits , particularly the renewable energy investment and production tax credits . a lack of tax liability , however , has limited the renewable energy sector 's ability to fully take advantage of these and other tax benefits . the result has been an increased interest in exploring other options for promoting investment in renewable energy . one option might be to allow renewable energy entities access to the master limited partnership ( mlp ) business organizational form . an mlp is a type of business structure that is taxed as a partnership , but whose ownership interests are traded on financial markets like corporate stock . being treated as a partnership for tax purposes implies that mlp income is generally subject to only one layer of taxation in contrast to publically traded c corporations , which are subject to two layers of taxation . the ability to access equity markets in a manner similar to corporations allows mlp to obtain greater amounts of capital . access to a greater pool of capital , when combined with the favorable partnership tax treatment , may allow mlps to secure capital at a lower cost than similar businesses operating under a different organizational structure . the lower cost of capital , in turn , could increase investment in the renewable energy sector . congress first established rules relating to mlps in the 1980s . at that time , the mlp structure was limited to businesses deriving 90 % of their income from primary sources , which included dividends , interest , rents , capital gains , and mining and natural resources income . effectively , this definition allowed oil and gas extraction and transportation activities access to the mlp structure , while renewable energy resources were generally excluded . the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) expanded the definition of income from qualifying sources to include transportation of certain renewable and alternative fuels , such as ethanol and biodiesel . provisions enacted under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) enhanced the value of certain renewable energy tax credits for many renewable energy projects . by transforming existing tax credits into cash grants , the section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits program enhanced access to capital for many in the renewable energy sector . the section 1603 grant program is scheduled to expire at the end of 2011. as congress evaluates other policies to attract additional capital to the renewable energy sector , allowing renewable energy entities to structure as mlps might be one option . extending the mlp structure to renewables could possibly attract additional capital to and stimulate investment in the renewable energy sector . there are , however , a number of potential policy concerns to consider . first , expanding access to the mlp structure could narrow the corporate tax base , which is one of the reasons access to this structure was limited in the first place . second , if changes to the tax code allowing renewable entities to access the mlp structure are enacted alongside changes to current passive activity loss rules , there may be concerns about the possibility of renewable energy investments being used as a tax shelter . finally , if the concern is that renewable entities are disadvantaged relative to fossil fuels currently able to use the mlp structure , one option would be to prevent other energy entities from structuring as mlps .
