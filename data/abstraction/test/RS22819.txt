revelations in early 2008 that cattle were mistreated at a california slaughter plant raised questions about enforcement of the humane methods of slaughter act . evidence emerged that the plant had permitted nonambulatory ( `` downer '' ) cattle to be slaughtered for human food , also potentially jeopardizing food safety . the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) announced the largest meat recall ever , alerted school food authorities to destroy any unconsumed products from the plant , and launched an investigation . since then , animal welfare activists have alleged additional cases of mistreatment at livestock markets . the 110th congress responded with hearings and proposals to alter current policy , but no statutory changes were enacted . in the 111th congress , the senate - passed version of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( h.r . 1 ) included a provision to permanently prohibit the use of federal funds for inspecting any nonambulatory disabled cattle for use as human food , regardless of the reason or time the animal became nonambulatory . ( uninspected cattle can not enter the food supply . ) . however , the provision was removed by house - senate conferees prior to final enactment ( as ( p.l . 111-5 ) ; the house version lacked the provision . additional bills are possible in the 111th congress . meanwhile , usda published a final rule in the march 18 , 2009 , federal register that now specifically requires cattle slaughter establishments to notify fsis inspectors when cattle become nonambulatory disabled even if they have already passed ante - mortem inspection ; all such cattle must be condemned ( diverted from the human food supply ) and properly disposed of . usda already was condemning them if they were nonambulatory at the time of ante - mortem inspection , as a safeguard against the introduction into the human food supply of the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , or `` mad cow disease '' ) .
