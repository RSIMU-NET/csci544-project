when sponsors terminate underfunded plans during bankruptcy , it can deplete resources of the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) , which protects the pensions of almost 44 million american workers and retirees who participate in over 29,000 defined benefit pension plans . in 2009 , pbgc reported an estimated deficit of over $ 30 billion . gao was asked to determine what pay and other compensation executives received in the years preceding their company 's termination of an underfunded defined benefit pension plan . to identify case study examples gao analyzed a listing of the 1,246 underfunded plans that were terminated from 1999 to 2008 and selected public companies with large unfunded liabilities , large unfunded liabilities per participant , and a large number of plan participants . gao reviewed documents provided by companies and executives , and interviewed pbgc and company officials . gao also reviewed securities and exchange commission ( sec ) filings and pbgc documents disclosing plan underfunding at the time of termination and missed contributions . executive compensation figures may be understated because some company executives could not be located , did not respond to document requests , declined interviews , and did not give gao access to their tax records . gao found that 40 executives for 10 companies received approximately $ 350 million in pay and other compensation in the years leading up to the termination of their companies ' underfunded pension plans . gao identified salaries , bonuses , and benefits provided to small groups of high - ranking executives at these companies during the 5 years leading up to the termination of their pension plans . for example , beyond the tens of millions in base salaries received , gao found that executives also received millions of dollars in stock awards , income tax reimbursements , retention bonuses , severance packages , and supplemental executive - only retirement plans . in some cases , plan participants had their benefits reduced due to the underfunding of the plan when it was terminated . for example , a retired pilot saw his monthly pension payment reduced by two - thirds . the reduction in benefits occurred because federal law caps the benefits pbgc can guarantee when it takes over an underfunded pension plan . in addition , pbgc has no oversight power with regard to executive compensation prior to a company 's bankruptcy . during bankruptcy , executive compensation must be approved by the bankruptcy court , and after this approval pbgc has extremely limited ability to recover those payments to executives . gao did not find any illegal activity with respect to executive compensation on the part of either the 10 companies or the 40 executives under review .
