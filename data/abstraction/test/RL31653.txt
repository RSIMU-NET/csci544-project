supervised release replaces parole for federal crimes committed after november 1 , 1987. like parole , supervised release is a term of restricted freedom following a defendant 's release from prison . the nature of supervision and the conditions imposed during supervised release are also similar to those that applied in the old system of parole . however , whereas parole functions in lieu of a remaining prison term , supervised release begins only after a defendant has completed his full prison sentence . where revocation of parole could lead to a return to prison to finish out a defendant 's original sentence , revocation of supervised release can lead to a return to prison for a term in addition to that imposed for the defendant 's original sentence . a sentencing court determines the duration and conditions for a defendant 's supervised release term at the time of initial sentencing . as a general rule , federal law limits the maximum duration to five years , although it permits , and in some cases mandates , longer durations for relatively serious drug , sex , and terrorism - related offenses . a sentencing court retains jurisdiction to modify the terms of a defendant 's supervised release and to revoke the term and return a defendant to prison for violation of the conditions . several conditions are standard features of supervised release . some conditions , such as a ban on the commission of further crimes , are mandatory . other conditions , such as an obligation to report to a probation officer , have become standard practice by the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines , which courts must consider along with other statutorily designated considerations . together with these regularly imposed conditions , the sentencing guidelines recommend additional conditions appropriate for specific circumstances . a sentencing court may impose any of these discretion conditions , as long as they offend no constitutional limitations and as long as they involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and `` reasonably relate '' to the nature of the offense ; the defendant 's crime - related history ; deterrence of crime ; protection of the public ; or the defendant 's rehabilitation . both a defendant 's constitutional rights and federalism concerns create outer limits for the application and scope of supervised release conditions . by nature , such conditions restrict a releasee 's freedom , and some conditions involve systems , such as child support orders , ordinarily governed by the states . nonetheless , federal courts have upheld a wide range of such conditions against constitutional challenges . the conditions of supervised release have been a source of constitutional challenges . yet a constitutionally suspect condition is also likely to run afoul of statutory demands . in which case , the courts often resolve the issue on statutory grounds . this report is available in an abridged form , without footnotes or citations to authority , as crs report rs21364 , supervised release : an abbreviated outline of federal law .
