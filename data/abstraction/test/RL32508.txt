intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) functions are principal elements of u.s.defense capabilities , and include a wide variety of systems for acquiring and processing informationneeded by national security decisionmakers and military commanders . isr systems range in sizefrom hand - held devices to orbiting satellites . some collect basic information for a wide range ofanalytical products ; others are designed to acquire data for specific weapons systems . some are '' national '' systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to washington - area agencies ; others are `` tactical '' systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield . collectively , they account for a major portion of u.s. intelligence spending that , according to mediaestimates , amounts to some $ 40 billion annually . for some time congress has expressed concern about the costs and management of isrprograms . with minor exceptions , isr acquisition has been coordinated by the defense departmentand the intelligence community . although there are long - existing staff mechanisms for reviewingand coordinating isr programs in the context of the annual budget submissions , many in congressbelieve that existing procedures have not avoided duplication of effort , excessive costs , and gaps incoverage . examples that some observers cite are separate efforts to acquire a new generation ofreconnaissance satellites and a high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) known as global hawk . both systems acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers , but theyare acquired in distinctly different ways ; moreover , in both cases procurement efforts have beenbeset by increasing costs and schedule delays . recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of isr capabilities and require that thedefense department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of isr capabilitiesover the next fifteen years . an effective roadmap , if developed , could potentially ensure morecomprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money . to establish responsibilityfor an intelligence community - wide effort , the 9 / 11 commission recommended that a new positionof director of national intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program ( butnot joint military and tactical intelligence programs , which would continue to be managed by thedefense department ) . this position was included , after extended debate , in the intelligence reformand terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-458 ) that was approved by the president ondecember 17 , 2004. the implications of this legislation for isr programs are as yet uncertain , butcongress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long - existing concernswith isr programs . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
