institutions that serve large proportions of low - income and minority students may receive funding under titles iii and v of the higher education act . in fiscal year 2008 , $ 667 million in grants were awarded to over 500 institutions . gao was asked to determine the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v and characteristics of students served ; any challenges grantees face , and how they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges ; and the extent to which the department of education ( education ) monitors the financial and programmatic performance of grantees , and uses this information to target its technical assistance . to address these objectives , gao analyzed data from a representative sample of grant applications and annual performance reports for the entire population of fiscal year 2006 grantees . gao also interviewed officials from education and 27 grantee institutions , and conducted financial site visits at other 7 grantee institutions . twenty - eight percent of all 2-year and 4-year public and private , not - for - profit institutions are eligible to receive title iii and v grants . eligible institutions had fewer resources , including endowment holdings and revenue from tuition and fees , and lower per student spending on equipment than ineligible institutions . eligible institutions also served more students who were minority , low - income , and attended part - time . in their grant applications , title iii and v grantees reported challenges in all four grant focus areas : academic quality , student support , institutional management , and fiscal stability . grantees reported spending almost $ 385 million in fiscal year 2006 grant funds to address challenges in these areas , primarily to strengthen academic quality and student support services . specifically , grantees reported using 43 percent of grant funds on efforts designed to improve academic quality , such as using the latest technology in the classroom and improving academic space . efforts to improve student support services , including remedial courses , tutoring , and academic counseling represented about one - third of grantee expenditures . while nearly all grantees reported challenges related to strengthening institutional management and fiscal stability , expenditures in these areas represented less than one - quarter of all grant funds spent . since gao reported and made recommendations on the management of these programs in 2004 and 2007 , education has continued to take steps to improve monitoring , but many of its initiatives have not been completed . education has made recent progress in developing an electronic monitoring system and risk - based criteria to improve monitoring , but it discontinued the use of annual plans to guide its efforts . also , limited progress in addressing staff skill gaps and substantial declines in site visits to grantees has impeded education 's ability to adequately monitor grantees . because education lacks a comprehensive approach to target monitoring , it lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds , increasing the potential for fraud , waste , or abuse . for example , gao identified more than $ 100,000 in questionable expenditures at one grantee institution , including student trips to locations such as resorts and amusement parks , and an airplane global positioning system . education provides limited technical assistance to grantees , but it has not developed a systematic approach that targets the needs of grantees . for example , some grantees told gao that education could strengthen grantee performance by sharing more information regarding common implementation challenges and successful projects . additionally , gao found that education 's ability to target technical assistance is limited because its current approach for obtaining feedback does not encourage candor , and it does not use the feedback it currently receives from grantees .
