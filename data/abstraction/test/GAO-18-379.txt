during emergencies , reliable communications are critical . disasters , such as 2017 's hurricanes , continue to test the nation 's emergency communications capabilities . as disasters can cross jurisdictional boundaries , collaboration within and across regions is very important . gao was asked to review implementation of the post - katrina act 's provisions related to disaster preparedness , response , and recovery . this report examines : challenges related to emergency communications that selected stakeholders have experienced ; their views on dhs 's emergency communications assistance ; and the regional working groups established by the post - katrina act and their effect on emergency communications capabilities . gao reviewed dhs 's reports and grant data for fiscal years 2011 – 2016 and conducted case studies of three cities — houston , los angeles , and boston — selected based on the number of declared disasters , dhs grant funding , and geographic diversity . gao interviewed dhs officials ; leaders of all 10 regional working groups and other stakeholders , including public safety officials in the case study cities ; and others chosen for their expertise . selected first responders and public safety officials identified various challenges related to emergency communications . these challenges include attaining the interoperability of communication systems , obtaining funding , ensuring ongoing training , and increasing the emphasis on communications during emergency response exercises . for example , some stakeholders told gao about challenges related to equipment that is not interoperable , and others said first responders need training after investments are made in new interoperable communications equipment . to help address these challenges and as required by the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has provided technical assistance , such as training , and federal emergency management agency ( fema ) grants . it has also established regional emergency communications coordination working groups , which bring together stakeholders from different levels of government and the private sector within fema 's 10 regions . while emergency communications challenges persist , stakeholders told gao that dhs 's technical assistance generally meets their needs and that fema grants have helped them enhance emergency communications capabilities . in particular , stakeholders found training for specific communications positions was useful . houston - area officials said this training was critical in preparing first responders for hurricane harvey . some stakeholders told gao that fema grants helped them address needs that would otherwise go unfunded , including interoperable communications networks and equipment . gao found that the regional working groups have enhanced emergency communications capabilities through building relationships and sharing information . within the respective regions , group members have : assisted each other during disasters and emergencies , developed technical solutions to enhance interoperability , and addressed policy concerns , such as the use of interoperable radio channels during emergencies . however , most regional group leaders told gao that more collaboration across the groups was needed . gao 's prior work has also found that including all relevant participants can enhance collaborative efforts . further , dhs 's strategic plan for emergency communications established a vision of collaboration among stakeholders across the nation . while fema has encouraged collaboration among regional working - group leaders , cross - regional efforts have been limited and do not involve all group members . developing and implementing an appropriate ongoing mechanism for collaboration could enhance emergency communications capabilities , such as by helping group members address common challenges . without ways for all members of these groups to collaborate across regions , members may be missing opportunities to share information and leverage the knowledge and experiences of their counterparts throughout the nation . fema should work with regional working - group members to reach consensus and implement an ongoing mechanism , such as a national - level working group , to encourage nationwide collaboration across regions . dhs concurred with this recommendation .
