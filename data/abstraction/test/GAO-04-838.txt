the maritime transportation security act of 2002 , as implemented by the coast guard , calls for owners and operators of about 3,150 port facilities ( such as shipping terminals or factories with hazardous materials ) and about 9,200 vessels ( such as cargo ships , ferries , and tugs and barges ) to develop and implement security plans by july 1 , 2004. the coast guard intends to conduct on - site compliance inspections of all facilities by january 1 , 2005 , and all vessels by july 1 , 2005 , to ensure plans are adequately implemented . the coast guard estimated the act 's security improvements would cost $ 7.3 billion over 10 years -- most of it borne by facility and vessel owners and operators . gao was asked to assess the progress towards developing , reviewing , and approving plans by july 1 , 2004 , the coast guard 's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that plans are implemented , and the accuracy of the coast guard 's cost estimate . owners and operators have made progress in developing security plans for their port facilities and vessels . however , the extent to which the coast guard will have reviewed and approved the approximately 12,300 individual plans by july 1 , 2004 , varies considerably . about 5,900 plans were being developed under an option allowing owners and operators to self - certify that they would develop and implement plans by july 1 , using industry - developed , coast guard - approved standards and templates . these individual plans will not be reviewed before july 1 unless owners or operators choose to submit them for review . the remaining 6,400 plans went through a review process established by the coast guard . every plan required revisions , some of which were significant . as of june 2004- - 1 month before the deadline for implementation -- more than half of the 6,400 plans were still in process . the coast guard took steps to speed up the process and to allow facilities and vessels to continue operating with less than full plan approval after july 1 , as long as the coast guard was satisfied with their progress . the coast guard 's strategy for monitoring and overseeing security plan implementation will face numerous challenges . whether the coast guard will be able to conduct timely on - site compliance inspections of all facilities and vessels is uncertain because questions remain about whether the coast guard will have enough inspectors ; a training program sufficient to overcome major differences in experience levels ; and adequate guidance to help inspectors conduct thorough , consistent reviews . another challenge is to ensure inspections reflect assessments of the normal course of business at facilities and aboard vessels . the accuracy of the coast guard 's $ 7.3 billion estimate for implementing security improvements is likewise uncertain . the estimate , while a goodfaith effort on the coast guard 's part , is based on limited data and on assumptions that are subject to error . the estimate should be viewed more as a rough indicator than a precise measure of costs .
