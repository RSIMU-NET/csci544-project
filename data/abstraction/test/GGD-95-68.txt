pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the impact of title i assistance on : sustainable economic development in recipient countries ; and long - term market development for u.s. agricultural goods in those countries . gao found that : u.s. agricultural exports and world food aid have decreased because there are other donor countries and new programs such as the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) market development program ; title i has had minimal effect on sustainable economic development in recipient countries ; the primary way in which title i food aid can contribute to broad - based sustainable development in the recipient country is to give the country the foreign exchange savings it needs to invest in long - term economic development projects ; the link between title i and market development is uncertain , since usda and other agency studies have not shown a link between title i assistance and the establishment of a long - term commercial market share for u.s. agricultural products ; price - sensitive exports restrict title i market development opportunities ; title i program management has been streamlined by assigning title i programs to usda and titles ii and iii to the agency for international development ( aid ) ; and while the objectives of p.l . 480 legislation can support u.s. foreign policy and trade interests , they can also impede the development of an effective program strategy .
