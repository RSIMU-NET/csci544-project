carbon capture and sequestration ( or storage ) — known as ccs — is a physical process that involves capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co2 ) at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere . the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) has pursued research and development ( r & d ) of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated ccs system since 1997. congress has appropriated nearly $ 7 billion in total since fy2008 for ccs research , development , and demonstration ( rd & d ) at doe 's office of fossil energy : nearly $ 3.5 billion in total annual appropriations ( including fy2015 ) and $ 3.4 billion from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( recovery act ; p.l . 111-5 ) . the large influx of recovery act funding for industrial - scale ccs projects was intended to accelerate development and deployment of ccs in the united states . since enactment of the recovery act , doe has shifted its rd & d emphasis to the demonstration phase of carbon capture technology . to date , however , there are no commercial ventures in the united states that capture , transport , and inject industrial - scale quantities of co2 solely for the purpose of carbon sequestration . the success of doe ccs demonstration projects likely will influence the outlook for widespread deployment of ccs technologies as a strategy for preventing large quantities of co2 from reaching the atmosphere while u.s. power plants continue to burn fossil fuels , mainly coal . one project , the kemper county facility , has received $ 270 million from doe under its clean coal power initiative ( ccpi ) round 2 program and is slated to begin commercial operation in 2016. the 582 megawatt - capacity facility anticipates capturing 65 % of its co2 emissions , making it equivalent to a new natural gas - fired combined cycle power plant . cost and schedule overruns at the kemper plant , however , have raised questions over the relative value of environmental benefits from ccs technology compared with construction costs of the facility and its effect on ratepayers . in 2014 , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed emission standards for new and existing fossil - fueled electric generating units under section 111 of the clean air act . new natural gas - fired stationary power plants should be able to meet the proposed standard for new plants without additional cost and without the need for add - on control technology . however , the only apparent technical way for new coal - fired plants to meet the standard would be to install ccs technology . the proposed rule has sparked increased scrutiny of the future of ccs as a viable technology for reducing co2 emissions from coal - fired power plants . given the pending epa rule , congressional interest in the future of coal as a domestic energy source appears directly linked to the future of ccs . debate has been mixed as to whether the rule would spur development and deployment of ccs for new coal - fired power plants or have the opposite effect . congressional oversight of the ccs rd & d program could help inform decisions about the level of support for the program and help congress gauge whether it is on track to meet its goals . in the 114th congress , a bill has been introduced ( s. 601 ) that would promote ccs for coal - fired utilities by a combination of loan guarantees , tax credits , and supporting the doe r & d effort in its coal program , among other things . a similar bill was introduced in the 113th congress but was not enacted . one issue is whether congressional oversight is needed of the ccs r & d program , particularly of the results from the demonstration projects as they progress . such a review could help congress evaluate whether doe is on track to meet its goal of allowing for an advanced ccs technology portfolio to be ready by 2020 for large - scale demonstration and deployment in the united states .
