some of the largest federal programs , including medicare , social security , and postal services , are funded through trust funds and other dedicated funds , which link collections that have been dedicated to a specific purpose with the expenditures of those collections . while these funds have the ability to retain accumulated balances , these collections do not necessarily fund the full current or future cost of the government 's commitments to the designated beneficiaries . gao was asked to review issues related to federal trust funds and other dedicated funds . this report examines how the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds in the federal budget have changed over time , the extent to which these funds are supported by their dedicated collections , and the extent to which these funds support mandatory programs , including major entitlement programs . gao analyzed omb data on trust funds and other dedicated funds for fiscal year 2014 through 2018 and the department of the treasury 's ( treasury ) fiscal year 2018 combined statement of receipts , outlays , and balances . gao also examined 13 case study accounts in nine agencies , selected to include the largest of each type of these funds and a variety of program designs . gao reviewed agency reports , cbo trust fund estimates for 2018 and projections for 2019 to 2029 , and prior gao reports , and interviewed omb staff and officials from treasury and each of the case study agencies . gao also is providing an online dataset of these funds at https : / / www.gao.gov / products / gao - 20-156 . every major federal department has at least two trust funds or other dedicated funds . according to gao analysis of office of management and budget ( omb ) data , balances in these funds , which can be used to support covered programs , grew 13 percent in nominal terms from fiscal year 2014 through 2018. fund balances are affected by complex interactions of factors , but the total increase was driven largely by military and civilian retirement fund balances . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projects the total balance to start declining in fiscal year 2022 as decreases in medicare and social security will exceed increases in military and civilian retirement balances . to offset the overall decrease , the federal government is projected to borrow more from the public . gao found that 11 of 13 case studies recently received general revenue â€” collections that are not dedicated by law for a specific purpose . for example , medical insurance premiums for medicare part b are set to cover 25 percent of expected costs ; the remaining 75 percent are covered by general revenues . even funds that rely primarily on their dedicated collections may not be fiscally sustainable . for example , the social security old - age and survivors insurance trust fund only uses dedicated collections for benefit payments , but its balances are projected to be depleted by 2034. nearly 98 percent of outlays and transfers from trust funds and other dedicated funds was through mandatory authority , which allows agencies to make payments without further congressional action . most of the 23 largest funds also have entitlement authority , which generally requires payments to eligible parties based on legal requirements . status as a trust fund , mandatory program , or entitlement does not prevent congress and the president from changing related laws to alter future collections or payments .
