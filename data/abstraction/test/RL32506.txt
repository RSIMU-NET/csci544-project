the 9 / 11 commission , in its recent report on the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , criticized the u.s. intelligence community 's ( ic ) fragmented management structure and questioned whether theu.s . government , and the ic , in particular , is organized adequately to direct resources and build theintelligence capabilities that the united states will need to counter terrorism , and to address thebroader range of national security challenges in the decades ahead . the commission made a number of recommendations , one of which was to replace the current position of director of central intelligence ( dci ) with a national intelligence director ( nid ) whowould oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest -- including a nationalcounterterrorism center ( nctc ) -- across the u.s. government , manage the national intelligence program ; oversee the agencies that contribute to it ; and have hiring , firing , and budgetary authorityover the ic 's 15 agencies . although the commission recommended that the director be located inthe executive office of the president , the commission vice chairman in testimony before congresson september 7 , 2004 , withdrew that portion of the recommendation in light of concerns that thenid would be subject to undue influence . the commission further recommended that a deputy nidbe established to oversee the day - to - day operations of the central intelligence agency ( cia ) . thecommission 's recommendation to strengthen management authority over the ic is the latestcontribution to an ic structural reform debate that dates at least to 1955 , when arguments forstronger ic authority began to surface . omb deputy director james schlesinger in 1971 firstbroached the nid concept . congress currently is considering two principal bills , s. 2845 , introduced by senators collins and lieberman , and h.r . 10 , introduced by representative hastert , that would establish the nid position . [ for a comprehensive comparison of all recent nidlegislative proposals , see crs report rl32600 ( pdf ) and crs report rl32601 ( pdf ) ] . reactions to the concept of an nid have been mixed since its inception . supporters argue that the dci can not manage the ic , the cia and serve as the president 's chief intelligence advisor , anddo justice to any of the jobs . other than at the cia , the dci also lacks hiring , firing and budgetauthority . they argue that the absence of strong , centralized leadership has resulted in dividedmanagement of intelligence capabilities ; lack of common standards and practices across theforeign - domestic intelligence divide ; structural barriers that undermine the performance of jointintelligence work ; and a weak capacity to set priorities and move resources . opponents counter that an nid would lose day - to - day control over the cia , a natural power base and , as a result , influence . they also contend that an nid will shift the balance of control awayfrom dod , risking intelligence support to the warfighter . the congressional role includes decidingwhether to establish the position of the nid and its authority . this report will be updated as eventswarrant .
