congress established the superfund program in 1980 to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites . among other things , the law established a trust fund to help the environmental protection agency ( epa ) pay for cleanups and related program activities . the trust fund was financed primarily by three dedicated taxes until 1995 , when the taxing authority expired . epa continues to discover sites eligible for cleanup under the superfund program . gao was asked to examine the current status of the superfund program , the factors guiding epa 's selection of sites to be placed on its national priorities list , and the program 's future outlook . the balance of the superfund trust fund available for future appropriations has decreased significantly since 1996 , while highly contaminated hazardous waste sites continue to be added to the national priorities list ( npl ) , epa 's list of the nation 's most contaminated sites . a decline in revenues to the trust fund has led the superfund program to rely increasingly on appropriations from the general fund . in epa 's fiscal year 2004 budget request for the superfund program , the general fund appropriation would make up about 80 percent of the program 's total appropriation . at the end of fiscal year 2002 , the npl had 1,233 sites in various stages of cleanup . epa considers many factors in selecting from the sites that are eligible to be listed , the most prominent of which are the availability of alternative federal or state programs that could be used to clean up the site , the status of responsible parties associated with the sites , and the cost and complexity of the cleanup required . as the superfund program continues to add sites to the npl and funding sources shift toward general fund appropriations , the effect of epa 's actions to address future program challenges remains uncertain . because superfund lacks indicators to fully measure the outcomes of the program 's cleanup efforts , epa has asked an advisory council to develop criteria by which to measure the program 's progress . however , it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations , and its findings are not expected until december 2003 , at the earliest . performance indicators could help epa and the congress make the difficult funding , policy , and program decisions that the current budget environment demands .
