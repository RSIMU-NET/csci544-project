through title ii of the food for peace act , the united states provides u.s. agricultural commodities to meet emergency food needs in foreign countries . in fiscal years 2007 to 2012 , usaid delivered $ 9.2 billion in emergency food aid to recipient countries through cooperating sponsors . in 2000 , congress authorized usaid to order , transport , and store food for prepositioning in both overseas and domestic locations . through prepositioning , the agency orders food before it is requested and stores it in warehouses in or near regions with historically high needs . gao was asked to examine u.s. international food aid procurement . this report examines the effects of prepositioning on emergency food aid delivery time frames , the effects of prepositioning on the costs of the food aid , and the extent to which the agency monitors prepositioning to maximize time savings and cost effectiveness . gao analyzed data on delivery time frames and costs ; reviewed agency documents ; and interviewed agency officials and representatives from wfp , other cooperating sponsors , and ocean freight contractors . the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) reduces the average delivery time frame for emergency food aid by prepositioning food domestically — that is , in warehouses in the united states — and overseas . gao estimates that compared with usaid 's standard shipping process , which can take several months , prepositioning food aid shortened delivery time frames by an average of almost a month for shipments to the world food program ( wfp ) . gao also estimates that prepositioning shortened delivery time frames by an average of more than 2 months for other organizations — “ cooperating sponsors ” — that receive usaid grants . in addition , usaid reduces delivery time frames when it diverts shipments en route to overseas prepositioning warehouses to areas with immediate needs . for all cooperating sponsors , gao estimates that diversions saved , on average , about 2 months . prepositioning food can increase the cost of emergency food aid because of additional warehouse , shipping , and commodity costs . for example , in fiscal year 2012 , usaid paid approximately $ 8 million for its overseas and domestic prepositioning warehouses . usaid also paid $ 13 million to ship food by ocean freight from overseas prepositioning warehouses to recipient countries , in addition to the cost of shipping from the united states to the warehouses . further , usaid generally paid higher weighted annual average prices for domestically prepositioned commodities than for standard shipment commodities . u.s. officials and vendors noted that factors such as limited commodity supplies and few participating suppliers may have contributed to higher prices . usaid has taken some steps to evaluate prepositioning , but the agency does not collect and analyze data needed to systematically monitor delivery time frames for prepositioned commodities . in addition , some available data are unreliable . further , usaid does not systematically monitor the total cost of prepositioning . according to usaid policy and federal internal control standards , the agency should monitor its programs by collecting and analyzing data to guide higher - level decision making and allocate resources . without such monitoring , usaid is limited in its ability to assess prepositioning 's impact on delivery time frames and costs and to maximize emergency food aid 's timeliness and cost effectiveness . gao recommends that usaid systematically collect , and ensure the reliability of , data for prepositioned food aid and systematically monitor and assess the effectiveness of food aid 's delivery time frames and costs . usaid concurred with the recommendations and is working to improve both the collection of reliable data and its monitoring of prepositioning .
