members of the uniformed services and u.s. citizens who live abroad are eligible to register and vote absentee in federal elections under the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act ( uocava , p.l . 99-410 ) of 1986. the law was enacted to improve absentee registration and voting for this group of voters and to consolidate existing laws . since 1942 , a number of federal laws have been enacted to assist these voters : the soldier voting act of 1942 ( p.l . 77-712 , amended in 1944 ) , the federal voting assistance act of 1955 ( p.l . 84-296 ) , the overseas citizens voting rights act of 1975 ( p.l . 94-203 ; both the 1955 and 1975 laws were amended in 1978 to improve procedures ) , and the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act of 1986. the law is administered by the secretary of defense , who delegates that responsibility to the director of the federal voting assistance program ( fvap ) at the department of defense ( dod ) . improvements to uocava were necessary as the result of controversy surrounding ballots received in florida from uniformed services and overseas voters in the 2000 presidential election . both the national defense authorization act for fy2002 ( p.l . 107-107 ) and the help america vote act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-252 ) included provisions concerning uniformed services and overseas voting . the ronald w. reagan defense authorization act for fy2005 ( p.l . 108-375 ) amended uocava as well , and the john warner national defense authorization act for fy2007 ( p.l . 109-364 ) extended a dod program to assist uocava voters . in the 111th congress , a major revision of uocava was completed when president obama signed the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fy2010 ( p.l . 111-84 ) on october 28 , 2009. it included an amendment ( s.amdt . 1764 ) that contained the provisions of s. 1415 , the military and overseas voter empowerment act ( the move act ) . in july 2014 , the election assistance commission issued its election administration and voting survey report that included data on uocava as well as domestic registration and voting in the 2014 election cycle . the biennial uocava report is mandated by the help america vote act and had previously been issued separately from the general survey report . according to the results , ballots were transmitted to uocava voters by election officials in all 50 states and four of the territories , but more than half of all ballots were sent from california , florida , new york , and washington . the rate of ballots returned for counting was slightly lower than in the midterm election of 2010 , and substantially lower than in the presidential election of 2012. states counted 94.6 % of the ballots that were returned . the overseas vote foundation released the results of its 2014 post - election survey in february 2015. overall , 74 % of those who requested an absentee ballot received it and 23 % did not ( slightly more than 2 % did not know or remember whether a ballot was received ) . two bills introduced in the 114th congress would amend uocava . these include h.r . 12 which is primarily related to other voting issues ; and s. 2814 , a version of the fy2017 ndaa bill introduced `` by request '' but that did not advance . in addition , a provision in the house - passed ndaa bill ( h.r . 4909 ) would continue some uocava reporting requirements , despite terminating some unrelated reports . in the 113th congress , the senate committee on rules and administration held a hearing on s. 1728 on january 29 , 2014 , and reported the bill with an amendment in the nature of a substitute on april 10 , 2014. it would have required states to report statistics on the number of absentee ballots sent to uocava voters before the election , established online voter registration and updating for uniformed services voters , and made an absentee ballot request valid for the entire two - year federal election cycle . the legislation did not advance .
