the department of defense ( dod ) planned to spend $ 7.9 billion on acquiring munitions in fiscal year 2002. ongoing military operations associated with the global war on terrorism have heightened concerns about the unified combatant commands having sufficient quantities of munitions . since 1994 , the dod inspector general and gao have issued numerous reports identifying weaknesses and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the process used by the department to determine munitions requirements . dod has improved its munitions requirements process by eliminating most of the systematic problems -- correcting questionable and inconsistently applied data , completing target templates , and resolving issues involving the level of detail that should be included in planning guidance . however , a fundamental problem remains unaddressed -- inadequate linkage between the near - term munitions needs of the combatant commands and the purchases made by the military services based on computations derived from the department 's munitions requirement determination process . the department 's munitions requirements process provides varied answers for current munitions acquisitions questions because of the aforementioned disjunction . as a result , the services , in the short term , are purchasing some critically needed munitions based on available funding and contractors ' production capacity . although this approach may be necessary in the short term , it raises questions as to whether over the long term it would position the services to make the most efficient use of appropriated funds and whether the needs of combatant commands to carry out their missions will be met .
