pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on canadian grain exports to the united states , focusing on the operations of the canadian wheat board ( cwb ) and the trade remedies applicable to the activities of state trading enterprises ( ste ) . gao noted that : the cwb is a ste with a monopoly on certain canadian grain sales and receives canadian government subsidies in a number of direct and indirect ways ; the canadian government also provides other assistance to its wheat and barley farmers ; the cwb 's operating environment is undergoing changes , some of which are expected to make the united states a more attractive market for canadian grain ; at the same time , there is a greater presence of u.s. grain companies operating in canada , and the cwb is dealing more frequently with private companies in the sale of canadian grain ; little information on actual cwb contracts is publicly available ; although u.s. customs service and the department of agriculture collect a great deal of information on imports of canadian grain into the united states , these data can not be used to ascertain cwb export prices ; the format that countries use to report on their stes ' activities to the world trade organization has recently been revised ; however , u.s. officials are concerned that it does not go far enough to increase the openness of the pricing practices of certain stes , such as the cwb ; trade remedies to combat disruptive or trade - distorting imports under u.s. trade laws do not treat stes any differently from other entities involved in international trade ; these u.s. trade laws can address trade issues such as dumping , actionable subsidies , and surges in imports ; in addition , ste activities may be subject to dispute settlement provisions under international trade agreements if the activities are inconsistent with an obligation agreed to by the government of the ste ; and relatively few trade remedy actions have been taken involving stes .
