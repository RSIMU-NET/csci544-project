long - standing u.s. policy has treated the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency . when the united states is involved in an extended military conflict overseas , 90 % or more of military cargoes are typically carried by ship . to support the u.s. merchant marine , congress has required that `` government - impelled '' cargo sent overseas be carried on u.s. - flag ships . government - impelled cargo ( a.k.a . `` preference cargo '' ) is government - owned cargo , such as military supplies and food aid , and any cargo that is somehow financed by the federal government , such as by the export - import bank . while export shipments account for the vast bulk of government - impelled cargo , in 2008 congress extended the law to require that state and local governments and private entities importing goods with federal financial assistance ship at least 50 % of such cargo in u.s. - flag vessels . regulations to implement that requirement have not been issued . historically , cargo preference law has been used to assure that a large proportion of government - impelled cargoes is shipped in privately owned u.s. - flag ships rather than in government - owned vessels such as those now controlled by the military sealift command ( msc ) . military cargo then , and more so now , accounts for the overwhelming bulk of preference cargoes . since 1954 , an agreement between u.s. government cabinet departments has restricted the size of the military - owned fleet and has required the military to turn first to the private fleet before using its own ships . the cost of employing u.s. citizens aboard u.s. - flag commercial vessels appears to be higher than the costs of employing the federal civilian mariners that crew government - owned ships . it appears preference cargo now accounts for almost all of the revenues of the u.s. - flag international fleet . u.s. - flag ships do not appear competitive with foreign - flag ships in carrying the overwhelming bulk of exports and imports transacted in the private sector . however , congress has directed that the u.s. government pay the additional cost of u.s. - flag shipping in order to maintain the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency . this cost may be influenced by the level of competition among u.s. - flag carriers bidding for preference cargoes and the procedures for determining `` fair and reasonable rates . . the needs of the commercial market increasingly have diverged from those of the military , as the trend toward highly specialized and larger ships in the commercial sector appears inconsistent with the military 's shipping requirements . however , the knowledge and skills of the mariners aboard u.s. - flag commercial ships are transferrable to manning a military reserve fleet of ships . in the 114th congress , several disparate bills would have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the volume of preference cargo significantly . the bills involve the future of food - aid policy , the existence of the export - import bank , and the level of operating subsidy provided to u.s. - flag carriers . the boom in domestic oil and gas production also has led to discussions in congress about whether u.s. - flag tankers should be guaranteed a portion of the cargo if these products are exported . these issues are arising at a time when u.s. - flag operators face a potential decline in the amount of preference cargo due to overseas troop withdrawals and changes in food - aid policy .
