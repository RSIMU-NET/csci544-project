the mtw demonstration gives 39 participating public housing agencies the flexibility to use funding for hud - approved purposes other than housing assistance , such as developing affordable housing ; change hud 's tenant rent calculation ; and impose work requirements and time limits on tenants . in 2015 , congress authorized the expansion of mtw by adding 100 new agencies . gao was asked to evaluate the mtw demonstration . gao examined hud oversight of mtw agencies , including its monitoring of demonstration effects on tenants . for this report , gao reviewed hud and mtw agency policies and documentation ; interviewed officials at hud and seven mtw agencies ( selected based on type of policy changes , size , and geographic diversity ) ; and interviewed tenants served by selected agencies . gao also conducted a statistical analysis comparing data for mtw and non - mtw agencies on public housing occupancy rates , voucher utilization rates , and program expenses . the department of housing and urban development ‘ s ( hud ) oversight of the moving to work ( mtw ) demonstration has been limited . improving oversight — particularly for information collection and analysis — would help hud assess what mtw agencies have done , including funding use . hud took steps to improve oversight and reporting , but gao found limitations in the following areas : workforce planning . while hud has taken steps to address staffing to oversee the current 39 mtw agencies , hud has not finalized its workforce planning for 100 agencies to be added to the demonstration . according to a 2015 hud analysis , a large number of additional staff would be needed for the expansion . hud officials said field office staff might assume greater oversight responsibilities to fill this gap , but a joint ( headquarters - field ) oversight structure is not final and hud 's workforce analysis has not been updated to reflect this proposed oversight structure . data collection . due to limited data , hud can not fully determine the extent to which demonstration flexibilities affected the performance of mtw agencies , especially in relation to outcomes that affect the number of tenants served — occupancy and voucher utilization rates and program expenses . gao found that mtw agencies had lower yearly median rates for public housing occupancy and housing choice voucher ( voucher ) unit utilization and higher yearly median program expenses than comparable non - mtw agencies . the differences may be partly the result of demonstration funding flexibilities , such as the ability to use public housing and voucher funding for purposes such as gap financing for affordable housing ( a nontraditional activity ) . but limitations in hud data ( such as not differentiating expenses for nontraditional activities ) make it difficult to fully explain differences in outcomes gao analyzed . oversight of reserves . hud has not implemented a process to monitor mtw reserves or agencies ' plans for such reserves , which led to agencies accruing relatively large amounts of unused funds that could be used for vouchers . according to hud data as of june 30 , 2017 , the 39 mtw agencies had more voucher reserves than the 2,166 non - mtw agencies that administer the voucher program combined ( $ 808 million compared to $ 737 million ) . without a monitoring process , hud can not provide reasonable assurance that mtw agencies have sound plans for expending reserves . monitoring the effect of rent reform , work requirements , and time limits on tenants . hud is limited in its ability to evaluate the effect of mtw policies on tenants . hud does not have a framework — including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans — for monitoring the effect of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies . hud guidance instructs agencies to analyze the impact of their rent reform activities , describe how they will reevaluate them , and develop a tenant hardship policy for such policies ( but not for time limits or work requirements ) . but the guidance does not describe what must be included in the analyses or policies , leading to wide variation in how agencies develop them . also , hud does not assess the results of agencies ' analyses . gao makes 11 recommendations to hud , which include completing workforce planning , developing processes to track use of funds and monitor agencies ' reserves , and developing a framework — including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans — to monitor effects on tenants . hud generally agreed with eight of the recommendations and disagreed with three , citing the need for flexibility . gao maintains the recommendations , as discussed further in the report .
