the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in a particular position in congress — or congressional staff tenure — is a source of recurring interest to members , staff , and the public . a congressional office , for example , may seek this information to assess its human resources capabilities , or for guidance in how frequently staffing changes might be expected for various positions . congressional staff may seek this type of information to evaluate and approach their own individual career trajectories . this report presents a number of statistical measures regarding the length of time senate office staff stay in particular job positions . it is designed to facilitate the consideration of tenure from a number of perspectives . this report provides tenure data for a selection of 18 staff position titles that are typically used in senators ' offices , and information on how to use those data for different purposes . the positions include administrative director , casework supervisor , caseworker , chief counsel , chief of staff , communications director , counsel , executive assistant , field representative , legislative assistant , legislative correspondent , legislative director , office manager , press secretary , regional representative , scheduler , staff assistant , and state director . senators ' staff tenure data were calculated as of march 31 , for each year between 2006 and 2016 , for all staff in each position . an overview table provides staff tenure for selected positions for 2016 , including summary statistics and information on whether the time staff stayed in a position increased , was unchanged , or decreased between 2006 and 2016. other tables provide detailed tenure data and visualizations for each position title . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in 10 position titles in senators ' offices , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position . for eight positions , the median tenure trend was unchanged . these findings may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . pay may be one of many factors that affect an individual 's decision to remain in or leave a particular job . senate office staff holding positions that are generally lower - paid typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in generally higher - paying positions . lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level roles ; if so , tenure for senators ' office employees in these roles appears to follow national trends for other entry - level jobs , which individuals hold for a relatively short period of time . those in more senior positions , where a particular level of congressional or other professional experience is often required , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . generalizations about staff tenure are limited in some ways , because each senator 's office serves as its own hiring authority . variations from office to office , which might include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which data provided here might match tenure in another office . direct comparisons of congressional employment to the general labor market may have similar limitations . an employing senator 's retirement or electoral loss , for example , may cause staff tenure periods to end abruptly and unexpectedly . this report is one of a number of crs products on congressional staff . others include crs report r43946 , senate staff levels in member , committee , leadership , and other offices , 1977-2016 , and crs report r44324 , staff pay levels for selected positions in senators ' offices , fy2001-fy2014 .
