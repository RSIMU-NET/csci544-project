pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) effort to modernize information technology ( it ) at its field service centers , focusing on : usda 's plans and ongoing efforts , including estimated costs , to modernize it for its service centers ; and any significant risks in these plans and ongoing efforts . gao noted that : usda 's service center it modernization effort , as currently being planned , will be the biggest , most costly , and complex in the department 's history ; it involves projects to : develop new business processes ; acquire and install telecommunications equipment ; acquire , implement , and maintain a common computing environment at about 3,100 locations ; and acquire and develop geospatial data ; usda 's life - cycle cost estimates show that the department could ultimately spend more than $ 3 billion for these projects by 2011 ; the department reported spending about $ 145 million since starting its service center it modernization in 1996 , and plans to spend over $ 200 million more during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 ; usda 's multibillion dollar undertaking faces significant risks ; specifically : usda continues to acquire new technology before it has reengineered business processes for providing one - stop service in all of its service centers ; usda is not managing its it - related projects for its service centers as investments , using cost , benefit , risk , and performance information to select , control , and evaluate projects throughout their life - cycle ; usda has not completed a comprehensive plan identifying critical milestones , project dependencies , and resources required for the modernization ; in acquiring technology , usda is not following an incremental approach that uses cost justifications and performance measures for each increment to reduce risks associated with large - scale acquisitions or projects ; and usda lacks the project management structure needed to manage a modernization of this magnitude ; specifically , usda has not assigned a senior - level official with overall responsibility , authority , and accountability for managing and coordinating the separate , service center it modernization projects and for ensuring that the clinger - cohen mandates have been met and that critical tasks are completed on time and within budget ; as a result of these risks , even after spending billions of dollars on its service center it modernization , the department may not obtain an adequate return on its investment , meet the needs of its customers , or achieve the secretary of agriculture 's vision of one - stop service ; and many of the weaknesses gao identified are similar to those that caused usda 's earlier info share program , which cost more than $ 100 million , to fail .
