three catastrophic hurricanes affected more than 28 million people living in texas , florida , puerto rico , and the u.s. virgin islands in 2017. hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria — which all made landfall within four weeks — caused a combined $ 265 billion in damage , and led to unprecedented demands for food and shelter , according to fema . fema and the red cross are the primary agencies responsible for coordinating mass care under the federal disaster response framework . gao was asked to review their efforts . this report examines fema 's and the red cross ' coordination of mass care in response to the 2017 hurricanes , and fema 's support and use of assessments of mass care capabilities for the 2017 hurricanes . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , federal frameworks , and written agreements between federal , state , or local governments and various voluntary organizations providing mass care services . gao also interviewed state , territorial , local , and voluntary organization officials in florida , puerto rico , texas , and the u.s. virgin islands ; as well as officials from red cross , fema , other relevant federal agencies , and voluntary organizations . following the three major u.s. hurricanes in 2017 , disaster relief efforts of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and the american red cross ( red cross ) benefitted from locating key partners in the same place . in - person coordination was critical to maintaining communication in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands given the prolonged power outages and damage to public structures ( see photo ) . however , some needs related to mass care — such as shelter , food , and supply distribution — were unmet . for example , local officials in texas said flooded roads prevented trucks from delivering supplies . providers encountered challenges in part because state and local agreements with voluntary organizations did not always clearly detail what mass care services could be provided . additionally , fema guidance and training materials do not explicitly encourage states and localities to include in their written agreements the specific assistance each agency or organization can provide . this limits the benefits of mass care coordination and may put disaster victims at risk . state , territorial , and local grantees of federal disaster preparedness grants are required to regularly submit information on their capabilities to fema , and fema has provided related guidance and technical assistance . however , the information some grantees provided to fema was not specific enough to aid its response in 2017. moreover , fema does not require grantees to specify the organizations providing mass care services in their capabilities assessments . also , fema does not have systematic protocols for providing feedback to grantees to improve their assessments . these limitations hinder fema 's efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness . gao is making six recommendations , including that fema emphasize the importance of defining roles and responsibilities in its guidance to states and localities , require them to solicit information from key mass care providers in assessing capabilities , and develop protocols for providing feedback to grantees on capability assessments . fema agreed with all but one of gao 's recommendations ; gao maintains its recommendations are valid .
