u.s. forests are crisscrossed by thousands of miles of logging roads . when it rains or snow melts , runoff from these roads can be environmentally harmful , so how to address this runoff under the clean water act ( cwa ) has long been an issue . on march 20 , 2013 , the supreme court in decker v. northwest environmental defense center addressed one aspect of this issue : logging road runoff that is discharged into cwa - covered waters from ditches , culverts , or other channels . such conveyances arguably make the runoff a `` point source '' under the cwa , which normally means that a permit under the act 's national pollutant discharge elimination system ( npdes ) is required . special cwa provisions , however , exempt stormwater runoff , unless , as relevant here , it is `` associated with industrial activity . . in decker , the supreme court upheld 7-1 epa 's long - standing reading of its industrial stormwater rule that logging road runoff , even if channeled , is not `` associated with industrial activity '' and so does not require a npdes permit . this reversed the ninth circuit and affirmed epa 's view that logging road runoff is subject only to a requirement of best management practices . in upholding epa 's reading of its rule as exempting logging road runoff from the npdes program , the court observed that references in the industrial stormwater rule suggest that its natural reading should be confined to traditional industrial buildings , and so does not extend to logging operations . moreover , epa had espoused this reading for a long time ; it had not been adopted recently in response to this litigation . in light of these factors , the court viewed the precept that courts owe deference to agency interpretations of their own rules as applying in full force . finally , the state of oregon had invested much effort in developing best management practices for stormwater runoff from logging roads , so epa , as the court saw it , could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be unnecessary . epa 's response to the ninth circuit ruling was to amend the industrial stormwater rule . the amended rule , issued in november 2012 three days prior to the oral argument before the supreme court , makes explicit the agency 's long - standing position that logging roads do not need cwa discharge permits for stormwater runoff . the supreme court opinion actually deals with epa 's reading of the prior , less explicit version of the industrial stormwater rule . the amended rule may or may not be resurrected on remand to the district court . for the moment , however , the status quo is unchanged : npdes permits have never been required for logging road runoff , and they are not required as of now . epa also is considering designating a subset of stormwater discharges from forest roads for regulation under flexible mechanisms available in the cwa , including non - permitting approaches , but the agency has not issued a proposal or announced a timetable for further action . congressional interest in responding to the ninth circuit ruling has been strong . congress enacted temporary measures that barred epa until september 30 , 2013 , from requiring a permit for stormwater runoff associated with silviculture activities . the 2013 farm bill reauthorization ( h.r . 2642 , p.l . 113-79 ) includes a provision stating that discharges resulting from specified silviculture activities shall not require cwa discharge permits .
