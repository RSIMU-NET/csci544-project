in march 2009 , a number of cases of an influenza - like illness and severe respiratory infections in humans were reported in parts of mexico . these cases were later confirmed to be a strain of influenza a ( h1n1 ) , commonly referred to as `` swine flu '' and later called 2009 h1n1 . by the end of april 2009 , confirmed human cases of 2009 h1n1 infection were reported throughout mexico , in parts of the united states , and in several countries worldwide . reports of the outbreak — coupled with the use of the initial moniker `` swine flu '' — initially caused a downturn in domestic and international pork markets . domestic pork demand and prices dropped sharply because of consumer fears that eating pork might result in infection . several pork - importing countries also began to institute trade bans and restrictions on live pig and pork imports from certain countries , including the united states . this initial reaction further rippled throughout pork and other agricultural markets , such as feed grain and other livestock markets , as market analysts attempted to speculate about the short - and long - term consequences of a decline in pork demand and prices . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the world health organization ( who ) , and the world organization for animal health ( oie ) confirm that there is no evidence that the 2009 h1n1 virus is transmitted by food and that humans can not get the illness from eating properly handled pork or pork products . four global organizations — who , oie , the world trade organization ( wto ) and the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) — also issued a joint statement that `` pork products handled in accordance with hygienic practices are not a source of infection . . despite these assurances from u.s. and global food and health organizations , several u.s. trading partners began to implement or were considering implementing full or partial trade restrictions on u.s. swine and pork products . administration officials and many in congress are strongly urging u.s. trading partners to base any food safety measures on scientific evidence and to act in accordance with their international obligations under the world trade organization ( wto ) , oie guidelines , and wto member obligations under the sanitary and phytosanitary ( sps ) agreement . oie , among other international organizations , has stated that there currently is no justification for imposing trade measures against the importation of pork and pork products . as some countries are continuing to pursue trade restrictions on north american pork products , some affected exporting countries are considering formal trade actions in the wto . in june 2009 , u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) reported that 16 u.s. trading partners had officially notified the united states of trade restrictions on swine and pork products ; usda reported that as many as 27 countries had imposed such trade restrictions . of these countries , the two largest in terms of their overall importance to u.s. pork markets , china and russia , account for an estimated with 15 % of the value of annual u.s. pork exports . both china and russia lifted their restrictions several months later , following negotiations with the united states . u.s. pork producers hope that efforts to avoid further negative effects on u.s. pork and other agricultural markets are successful . the national pork producers council ( nppc ) has asked usda to provide financial assistance for u.s. pork producers to address the general economic downturn in u.s. hog markets , including assistance to address issues regarding the h1n1 virus .
