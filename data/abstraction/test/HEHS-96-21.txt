pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed medicare payments to health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) , focusing on : current trends in medicare beneficiary enrollment in hmo ; flaws in medicare 's rate - setting method that prevent it from realizing potential savings from hmo ; and the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) efforts to test hmo payment reforms . gao found that : since 1993 , the annual increase in medicare beneficiary hmo enrollment has exceeded 20 percent ; hmo enrollment increases have been concentrated in 15 states ; medicare links hmo payment rates to the average cost of fee - for - service care and fails to adjust hmo payment rates to reflect beneficiaries ' health status or local differences in utilization rates ; strategies to improve medicare hmo payments include giving hcfa new authority to use competitive bidding or to negotiate with hmo , modifying the hmo rate - setting formula to include a health status risk adjuster , and requiring larger discounts from hmo in areas where hmo payment rates are too high ; hcfa could generate the most savings if it combines all three cost - reduction strategies and tailors the strategy to local conditions ; and although hcfa is planning demonstration projects using competitive bidding and improved risk adjustments , hcfa needs to gather and use available data to adjust hmo payments .
