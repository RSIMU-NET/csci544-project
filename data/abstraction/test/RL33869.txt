the impoundment control act ( ica ) was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 , signed into law on june 12 , 1974 ( 88 stat . 332 ) . under the ica , unless congress takes action to approve a rescission request from the president within the 45-day review period prescribed by the law , the funds must be released . with respect to a presidential rescission message , congress may approve more or less than the amount requested by the president . in addition , absent a specific request from the president , congress on its own accord may initiate rescission actions , by cancelling previously appropriated funds in a subsequent law . according to data compiled by the government accountability office ( gao ) , from fy1974 through fy2008 , presidents requested 1,178 rescissions under the ica , totaling somewhat over $ 76 billion . close to a third of the proposals were approved by congress , with approximately 40 % of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests ( $ 25 billion ) enacted by congress . the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequently enacted exceeded $ 1 billion in only four of the 35-plus years ( fy1981 , fy1982 , fy1992 and fy1994 ) . during this period congress initiated 1,880 rescission actions amounting to $ 197.1 billion , nearly eight times the total of presidentially requested rescission subsequently enacted , reflecting a trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress . the line item veto act of 1996 ( p.l . 93-344 ) , in effect for less than eighteen months before being overturned by the supreme court in 1998 , gave the president enhanced rescission authority by reversing the burden of action regarding rescission proposals ; cancellations of the president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ( ultimately requiring rejection by a 2 / 3 majority in both chambers ) . during this time , the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending . figures from the congressional budget office indicate that the 82 cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 ( including those overturned ) totaled some $ 355 million , with a projected five - year savings just under $ 1 billion . president clinton 's use of the short - lived enhanced rescission authority thus was not notably different from the prior annual record of presidential rescissions under the ica framework . during his two terms in office , president george w. bush sent no formal ica rescission requests to congress , but some controversy developed over his use of alternative means to propose spending reductions . president bush , while evidently reluctant to use existing rescission authority contained in the ica , called repeatedly for enactment of a measure that would give the president greater authority to reject items of spending . such a bill passed the house in the 109th congress and was reported in the senate . a contentious issue is whether such a measure might give preference to presidential spending priorities over congressional spending priorities , arguably affecting the legislative power of the purse . during his first year in office , president barack obama sent no formal ica rescission requests to congress . on may 24 , 2010 , however , the president transmitted to congress a draft proposal , the `` reducing unnecessary spending act , '' which would establish expedited procedures for congressional consideration of certain rescission messages . this report will be updated as events warrant .
