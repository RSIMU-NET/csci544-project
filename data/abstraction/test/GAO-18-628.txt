the need for ltss to assist individuals with limited abilities for self - care is expected to increase , in part due to the aging of the population . medicaid is the nation 's primary payer of ltss , with spending estimated at $ 167 billion in 2016. state medicaid programs are generally required to cover ltss provided in institutions , such as nursing homes , but coverage of the same services outside of institutions — that is , hcbs — is generally optional . in recent years there have been efforts to shift the balance of ltss away from institutions through the expanded use of hcbs . national spending for hcbs has increased and now exceeds that for services in an institution . however , the extent to which medicaid programs cover hcbs varies by state , as does the structure of states ' hcbs programs . gao was asked to review the approaches states use to provide coverage for hcbs in the medicaid program . for selected states , this report describes decisions that influenced the structure of medicaid hcbs programs , and challenges providing hcbs to medicaid beneficiaries and efforts to respond to these challenges . gao reviewed information and conducted interviews with officials from a nongeneralizable sample of five states , which gao selected to obtain variation in the percentage of total medicaid ltss expenditures used for hcbs , geography , and other factors . gao also reviewed information and interviewed officials from four mcos — two in each of the two selected states that used managed care to provide hcbs . the mcos varied in enrollment size and population served . all state medicaid programs finance coverage of long - term services and supports ( ltss ) , which help beneficiaries with physical , cognitive , or other limitations perform routine daily activities , such as eating , dressing , and making meals . when these services are provided in beneficiaries ' homes or other community settings instead of nursing homes , the services are known as home - and community - based services ( hcbs ) . the structure of the 26 hcbs programs we reviewed in five states — arizona , florida , mississippi , montana , and oregon — reflected decisions about which populations to cover , whether to limit eligibility or enrollment , and whether to use managed care . populations : four of the five states had multiple hcbs programs that targeted specific populations . for example , mississippi had separate hcbs programs for aged or physically disabled individuals and individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities . the fifth state , arizona , had one program that targeted two specific populations . eligibility : all five states had at least one hcbs program that limited eligibility to beneficiaries whose needs would otherwise require care in a nursing home or other institutional setting . enrollment : four of the five states limited enrollment in one or more of their hcbs programs ; 19 of the 26 programs had enrollment caps , and 12 of these programs maintained a waiting list . managed care : two of the five states used managed care to provide hcbs , paying managed care organizations ( mco ) a fixed fee for each beneficiary rather than paying providers for each service delivered . state and mco officials identified several challenges providing hcbs and described their efforts to respond to them : hcbs workforce : officials cited challenges recruiting and retaining hcbs providers , particularly given the low wages these providers typically receive . to respond to this , officials from mississippi , montana , and two of the mcos reported offering providers higher payment rates . complex needs : officials described challenges serving beneficiaries with complex medical and behavioral health needs , including individuals who display aggressive or other challenging behaviors . officials from montana and one mco reported responding to this challenge by providing behavioral health training for providers . hcbs funding : state officials reported that limitations on overall hcbs funding levels posed a challenge , which they responded to by providing their state legislatures with information on the projected need for hcbs to inform future funding decisions , and leveraging other available resources , such as federal grants . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
