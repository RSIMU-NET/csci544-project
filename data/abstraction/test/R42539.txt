iron emerged in the eighth century b.c . , helping to usher in the use of cavalry instead of chariots . today 's new technologies , including the development of precision - guided weaponry , have given rise to new methods of war fighting , thus bringing dramatic change to the operational battlefield . as will other decision makers , members of congress will confront significant challenges in making their choices about how to adapt to the continually evolving environment , particularly with respect to what are called `` precision strike '' capabilities . the united states took the early lead in the development of precision strike and has enjoyed a monopoly on these systems for over 20 years . however , many experts agree that the u.s. advantage is eroding as these systems spread . a demonstration of this proliferation occurred in 2006 , when hezbollah successfully used a chinese - designed c - 802 anti - ship cruise missile ( ascm ) against an israeli corvette off the coast of lebanon . this event demonstrated a non - state terrorist organization 's successful use of precision strike technology . in addition , access to the global commons is fundamental to global commerce and security â€” the proliferation of technology could threaten u.s. unfettered access . effective use of precision strike weapons goes beyond that of the weapon itself . the weapon is one part of a much greater , elaborate system of capabilities the actor must either possess or to which it must have access . command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) , in particular , plays a critical role in precision strike . many experts believe the proliferation of precision strike has already begun and will continue to accelerate as more and more countries continue to develop and purchase precision strike weaponry . three such countries include china , iran , and russia . china 's recent military buildup and its strategy with an apparent focus on anti - access / area denial capabilities entails a number of precision strike weapon systems to include the df - 21d anti - ship ballistic missile , which some defense analysts have labeled a `` game changer . . iran , although at a much smaller and less elaborate scale , has also entered the precision - guided munitions regime with an outward belligerence toward closing the economically vital strait of hormuz , where 40 % of the world 's oil passes daily . russia continues to supply arms to the international community and is focusing on developing its own fifth generation fighter comparable to the u.s. f - 22 raptor . finally , a russian defense company is currently marketing a new cruise missile system that can be hidden inside a standard shipping container . the housing of the system blends in with the hundreds of thousands of shipping containers used every day in carrying the world 's commerce . some defense experts have expressed fear that a weapon with such camouflage capability could give any merchant vessel the capability to wipe out an aircraft carrier . the proliferation of precision strike creates potential issues for congress . these issues include whether the department of defense ( dod ) is properly taking adversary precision strike weapons into account in its own plans and programs , and whether congress should approve , reject , or modify proposed dod programs for responding to those weapons .
