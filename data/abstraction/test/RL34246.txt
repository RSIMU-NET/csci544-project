infectious diseases are estimated to cause more than 25 % of all deaths around the world . a number of infectious disease outbreaks over the past decade , such as h5n1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , have heightened concerns about how infectious diseases might threaten global security . international air travel and trade have complicated efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases . people could cross borders carrying a highly contagious disease before an infectious agent causes symptoms . non - health officials are becoming increasingly aware of the threat that infectious diseases pose . an event that illuminated the issue occurred in may 2007 , when a man known to be carrying a drug - resistant form of tuberculosis ( tb ) crossed a number of international borders unabated . the world health organization ( who ) estimates that someone contracts tb every second and that about one - third of all people in the world carry tb ; most of these cases , however , are latent . in 2006 , an estimated 14.4 million people were living with tb globally , including 9.2 million who contracted the disease that year . about 1.7 million people carrying tb died in 2006 , including 200,000 people co - infected with hiv / aids . about 80 % of all estimated new tb cases arising in the world each year occur in 22 high - burden countries ( hbcs ) . who indicates that the global incidence of tb per capita peaked around 2003 and since then , incidence per 100,000 population stabilized in europe and declined in all five who regions , although the absolute number of new cases increased between 2005 and 2006 in africa , the middle east , europe , and southeast asia . in sub - saharan africa , weak health systems , minimal access to health facilities , insufficient staffing and little human resource development , ill - equipped and substandard laboratories , and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) co - infection have limited countries ' ability to contain tb . in fy2008 , congress funded u.s. global tb operations at unprecedented levels . through fy2008 consolidated appropriations , congress provided $ 162.2 million to international tb programs and an additional $ 840.3 million for a u.s. contribution to the global fund to fight hiv / aids , tb , and malaria ( global fund ) . the house passed and the senate foreign relations committees reported out companion tb bills , stop tb now act ( h.r . 1567 and s. 968 ) to support global tb efforts and authorize $ 330 million in fy2008 and $ 450 million in fy2009 . they also authorized $ 70 million and $ 100 million for anti - tb programs at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) in fy2008 and fy2009 , respectively . although congress voted to increase support for global tb efforts , some members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs . the administration requested $ 97.1 million for fy2009 global tb efforts , some $ 55 million less than appropriated in fy2008 . this report , which will be updated periodically , discusses some key issues congress might consider as debate ensues about the proper level and use of global tb funds .
