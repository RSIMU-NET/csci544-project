from the washington administration to the present , congress and the president have enacted 11 separate formal declarations of war against foreign nations in five different wars . each declaration has been preceded by a presidential request either in writing or in person before a joint session of congress . the reasons cited in justification for the requests have included armed attacks on united states territory or its citizens and threats to united states rights or interests as a sovereign nation . congress and the president have also enacted authorizations for the use of force rather than formal declarations of war . such measures have generally authorized the use of force against either a named country or unnamed hostile nations in a given region . in most cases , the president has requested the authority , but congress has sometimes given the president less than what he asked for . not all authorizations for the use of force have resulted in actual combat . both declarations and authorizations require the signature of the president in order to become law . in contrast to an authorization , a declaration of war in itself creates a state of war under international law and legitimates the killing of enemy combatants , the seizure of enemy property , and the apprehension of enemy aliens . while a formal declaration was once deemed a necessary legal prerequisite to war and was thought to terminate diplomatic and commercial relations and most treaties between the combatants , declarations have fallen into disuse since world war ii . the laws of war , such as the hague and geneva conventions , apply to circumstances of armed conflict whether or not a formal declaration or authorization was issued . with respect to domestic law , a declaration of war automatically triggers many standby statutory authorities conferring special powers on the president with respect to the military , foreign trade , transportation , communications , manufacturing , alien enemies , etc . in contrast , no standby authorities appear to be triggered automatically by an authorization for the use of force , although the executive branch has argued , with varying success , that the authorization to use force in response to the terrorist attacks of 2001 provided a statutory exception to certain statutory prohibitions . most statutory standby authorities do not expressly require a declaration of war to be actualized but can be triggered by a declaration of national emergency or simply by the existence of a state of war ; however , courts have sometimes construed the word `` war '' in a statute as implying a formal declaration , leading congress to enact clarifying amendments in two cases . declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force waive the time limitations otherwise applicable to the use of force imposed by the war powers resolution . this report provides historical background on the enactment of declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force and analyzes their legal effects under international and domestic law . it also sets forth their texts in two appendices . the report includes an extensive listing and summary of statutes that are triggered by a declaration of war , a declaration of national emergency , and / or the existence of a state of war . the report concludes with a summary of the congressional procedures applicable to the enactment of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of force and to measures under the war powers resolution . the report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
