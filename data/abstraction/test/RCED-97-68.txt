gao reviewed the results of federal and state inspections of mexican trucks entering the united states in 1996 , focusing on : actions by the federal government and border states to increase truck safety enforcement at the border ; and the federal enforcement strategy to ensure that trucks from mexico comply with safety standards when entering the united states . gao noted that : from january through december 1996 , federal and state officials conducted more than 25,000 inspections of trucks from mexico ; on average each month , about 45 percent of the vehicles were placed out of service for serious safety violations , such as for having substandard tires or for being loaded unsafely ; this rate compares unfavorably to the 28 percent out - of - service rate for u.s. trucks inspected across the united states in fiscal year 1995 ; however , because inspectors target for inspection those vehicles and drivers that appear to have safety deficiencies , their selections are not random ; as a result , the out - of - service rates may not necessarily reflect the general condition of all vehicles ; although border inspection officials believe that trucks from mexico are safer than they were in late 1995 , the monthly out - of - service rates for trucks from mexico in 1996 ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent , with no consistent trend ; the border states of arizona , california , and texas have increased their capability to inspect trucks at major border locations ; collectively , the three states had 93 state truck inspectors assigned to border crossing locations as of january 1997 ; in addition , the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) approved 13 new temporary positions ( 2-year appointments ) to place federal safety inspectors at major border crossing locations ; california , with about 24 percent of the truck traffic from mexico , opened two large permanent inspection facilities ; it has the most rigorous inspection program , with the goal of inspecting , at least once every 90 days , every truck entering the state from mexico ; while both texas and arizona , collectively with more than three - quarters of the truck traffic from mexico , have more than doubled the number of inspectors at border crossing locations , their efforts are less comprehensive ; under a broad strategy to help create a `` compliance mind - set '' for mexican trucks crossing into u.s. commercial zones , dot has undertaken a number of activities to promote truck safety ; in february 1997 , dot announced that its program that provides grants for statewide safety enforcement activities will incorporate performance - based goals to increase truck and driver safety ; and also , in march 1997 , dot submitted a legislative proposal to the congress as part of the reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act that would incorporate this initiative .
