in early october 2004 , the nation lost about half its expected influenza vaccine supply when one of two major manufacturers announced it would not release any vaccine for the 2004-05 season because of potential contamination . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) had earlier recommended vaccination for 188 million individuals , including those at high risk of severe complications from influenza ( such as seniors and those with chronic conditions ) , and other groups ( such as their close contacts ) . although health officials took actions to distribute the limited supply of influenza vaccine , reports persisted of high - risk individuals and others in priority groups who could not find a vaccination , including those who were turned away and never returned when supplies became available . such reports raised questions about the adequacy of u.s. preparedness to respond to significant vaccine shortages . gao was asked to examine actions taken at federal , state , and local levels to ensure that high - risk individuals had access to influenza vaccine during the shortage , including any lessons learned . federal , state , and local health officials took several actions beginning in october 2004 to help ensure that individuals at high risk of severe complications from influenza had access to vaccine . federal officials , for example , quickly revised vaccination recommendations to target available vaccine to high - risk individuals and to other priority groups . additional actions were aimed to distribute vaccine expeditiously and to communicate with providers and the public as events unfolded and vaccine supplies changed . beginning in mid - december , health officials took steps to distribute additional vaccine , broadening recommendations on who should be vaccinated . although these actions helped achieve vaccination rates approaching past levels for certain priority groups , such as those aged 65 years and older , several lessons emerged , including some that could help with future shortages . first , unless planning for problems is already in place , action is delayed . cdc 's lack of a contingency plan contributed to delays and uncertainty about how to ensure that high - risk individuals had access to vaccine . second , when actions occur late in the influenza season , they are likely to have little effect . third , effective response requires communication that is both clear and consistent . cdc has taken a number of steps , including issuing interim guidelines in august 2005 , to respond to possible future shortages . it is too early , however , to assess the effectiveness of these efforts in coordinating actions of federal , state , and local health agencies and others . in commenting on a draft of this report , hhs concurred with gao 's finding that contingency planning would improve response efforts , and the agency indicated that additional preparations were under way .
