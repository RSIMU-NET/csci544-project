federal agencies are increasingly using electronic means to create , exchange , and store information , and in doing so , they frequently create federal records : that is , information , in whatever form , that documents government functions , activities , decisions , and other important transactions . as the volume of electronic information grows , so does the challenge of managing electronic records . both federal agency heads and the national archives and records administration ( nara ) have responsibilities for managing federal records . as requested , after providing some context about records management in the federal government and the roles of federal agencies and nara , this testimony describes the challenges of electronic records management and potential means of addressing these challenges . in preparing this testimony , gao relied primarily on its previous work , supplemented by analysis of publicly available documents . under the federal records act , agencies are to manage the creation , maintenance , use , and disposition of records in order to achieve adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the federal government and effective and economical management of agency operations . if records are poorly managed , individuals might lose access to benefits for which they are entitled , the government could be exposed to legal liabilities , and records of historical interest could be lost forever . nara is responsible , among other things , for providing records management guidance , assistance , and oversight . however , as gao has previously reported , records management has received low priority within the federal government . prior reports have identified persistent weaknesses in federal records management , including a lack of policies and training . gao 's most recent report , in 2008 , found weaknesses in e - mail management at the four agencies reviewed due in part to insufficient oversight and training . this year , nara published the results of its first annual agency records management self - assessment survey , indicating that almost 80 percent of agencies were at moderate to high risk of improper disposition of records . electronic records are challenging to manage , especially as electronic information is being created in volumes that pose a significant technical challenge to the ability to organize and make it accessible . further , electronic records range in complexity from simple text files to highly complex formats with embedded computational formulas and dynamic content , and new formats continue to be created . finally , in a decentralized environment , it is difficult to ensure that records are properly identified and managed by end users on individual desktops ( the `` user challenge '' ) . e - mail is particularly problematic , because it combines all these challenges and is ubiquitous . technology alone can not solve the problem without commitment from agencies . electronic recordkeeping systems can be challenging to implement and can require considerable resources for planning and implementation , including establishing a sound records management program as a basis . in addition , the `` user problem '' is not yet solved , particularly for e - mail messages . further , automation will not solve the problem of lack of priority , which is of long standing . however , several developments may lead to increased senior - level attention to records management : nara 's use of public ratings as a spur to agency management , growing recognition of risks entailed in poor information and records management , the requirements and emphasis of the recent open government directive , and the influence of congressional oversight . senior management commitment , if followed through with effective implementation , could improve the governmentwide management of electronic and other records .
