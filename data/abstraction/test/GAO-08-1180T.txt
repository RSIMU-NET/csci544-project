los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) is one of three national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) laboratories that designs and develops nuclear weapons for the u.s. stockpile . lanl employees rely on sensitive and classified information and assets that are protected at different levels , depending on the risks posed if they were lost , stolen , or otherwise compromised . however , lanl has experienced several significant security breaches during the past decade . this testimony provides gao 's views on physical security at lanl , as discussed in los alamos national laboratory : long - term strategies needed to improve security and management oversight , gao - 08-694 ( june 13 , 2008 ) ; preliminary observations on physical security at lawrence livermore national laboratory ; and views on cyber security at lanl as discussed in information security : actions needed to better protect los alamos national laboratory 's unclassified computer network , gao - 08-1001 ( sept. 9 , 2008 ) . to conduct this work , gao analyzed data , reviewed policies and procedures , interviewed laboratory officials , and conducted site visits to the two laboratories . physical security at lanl is in a period of significant improvement , and lanl is implementing over two dozen initiatives to better protect its classified assets . however , while lanl 's current initiatives address many physical security problems previously identified in external security evaluations , other significant security problems have received insufficient attention . in addition , the management approaches that lanl and nnsa intend to use to sustain security improvements over the long term are in the early stages of development or contain weaknesses . furthermore , lanl 's ability to sustain its improved physical security posture is unproven because the laboratory appears not to have done so after a significant security incident in 2004 , with another significant security breach in 2006 , and nnsa 's los alamos site office -- which is responsible for overseeing security at lanl -- may not have enough staff or the proper training to execute a fully effective security oversight program . gao 's report made recommendations to help further improve physical security at lanl and ensure that these improvements are sustained over the long term . as a result of poor performance on an april 2008 physical security evaluation conducted by the department of energy 's ( doe ) office of independent oversight , gao is reviewing physical security at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( livermore ) . gao 's preliminary observations are that livermore appears to experience difficulties similar to lanl 's in sustaining security performance . furthermore , it appears that nnsa has not always provided effective oversight of livermore . specifically , an nnsa security survey conducted only 6 months prior to the april 2008 doe evaluation gave livermore the highest possible rating on its security program 's performance . these results differ markedly from those documented by doe 's office of independent oversight . lanl has implemented measures to enhance cyber security , but weaknesses remain in protecting information on its unclassified network . this network possesses sensitive information such as unclassified controlled nuclear information , export control information , and personally identifiable information about lanl employees . gao found vulnerabilities in critical areas , including identifying and authenticating users , encrypting sensitive information , and monitoring and auditing security policy compliance . a key reason for these information security weaknesses is that the laboratory has not fully implemented an information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained . furthermore , deficiencies in lanl 's policies and procedures raise additional concern , particularly with respect to foreign nationals ' accessing the network from the laboratory and remotely . finally , lanl cyber security officials told gao that funding to address some of their security concerns with the laboratory 's unclassified network has been inadequate . however , nnsa officials asserted that lanl had not adequately justified its requests for additional funds . gao made 52 recommendations to help strengthen lanl 's information security program and controls over the unclassified network .
