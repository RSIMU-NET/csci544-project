congress recently completed action on the bush administration 's fy2004 supplemental budget request to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan . it wassigned into law , p.l . 108-106 , on november 6 , 2003. a major issue in the congressional debate onthis , and other such supplementals of the past , is whether military and peacekeeping operationsshould be funded with supplemental requests or via the regular defense appropriations process . some members of congress have urged the president to include the costs of current and futureoperations in iraq and afghanistan in the department of defense 's ( dod 's ) regular appropriations , arguing that these are now ongoing operations that should be planned for and funded in the annualdefense budget . others prefer supplementals due to the unpredictability of military andpeacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan . this unpredictability , they argue , makes itextremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type of operation in advance . this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations , supplemental appropriations , or acombination of the two . the report shows that since 1990 , congress generally has funded combatoperations with supplemental appropriations . in initial stages of post - combat peacekeepingoperations , however , congress has tended to rely on a combination of supplemental and regularappropriations . as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing , congress has switched to usingregular appropriations .
