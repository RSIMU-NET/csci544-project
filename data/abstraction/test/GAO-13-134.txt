gao has designated dod support infrastructure as an area of high risk and included one key related category -- installation support -- as an area for potential savings . in 2005 , dod recommended to the base realignment and closure commission combining 26 installations into 12 joint bases to generate efficiencies and cost savings and , in 2010 , completed this consolidation . gao assessed the extent to which dod developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases , joint base common standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for installation support services , and dod has a process to consistently identify and address any implementation challenges . gao reviewed dod policies and guidance on joint basing , visited 3 joint bases and obtained answers to written questions from the other 9 , interviewed osd and military service officials , and analyzed performance data on joint base support services . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) has not developed or implemented a plan to guide joint bases in achieving cost savings and efficiencies . the department of defense ( dod ) originally estimated saving $ 2.3 billion from joint basing over 20 years , but in the absence of a plan to drive savings , that estimate has fallen by almost 90 percent . osd also does not yet have a fully developed method for accurately collecting information on costs , savings , and efficiencies achieved specifically from joint basing . gao previously reported that organizational transformations such as merging components and transforming organizational cultures should be driven by top leadership , have implementation goals and a timeline to show progress , and include a communication strategy . although the joint bases anecdotally reported achieving some savings and efficiencies , without an implementation plan to drive savings and a means to collect reliable information on the specific costs , estimated savings , and efficiencies from joint basing , dod will not be able to facilitate achievement of the goals of cost savings and efficiencies , track the extent to which these goals have been achieved , or evaluate the continuation or expansion of joint basing . the joint bases implemented common standards for installation support services developed by osd , and in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 reported meeting the standards more than 70 percent of the time . however , three factors limited the usefulness of the reported standards as a common tool for managing installation support services : the lack of clarity in some standards , unclear standards that were not reviewed and changed in a timely manner , and data collection and reporting on the standards that in some cases adhered to individual service standards rather than the common standard . dod guidance states that the purpose of the joint base common standards framework was to provide a common language to serve as a basis for planning and management across the joint bases , and gao previously reported that performance measures should be clear and follow standard procedures . without a consistent interpretation and reported use of the standards , osd and the joint bases will not have reliable or comparable data with which to assess their service support levels . osd and the joint bases have various mechanisms in place to address challenges in achieving joint basing goals , such as a joint management oversight structure and annual osd - joint base review meetings , but none of these routinely facilitates communication among the joint bases to identify solutions to common challenges . the reported challenges cover a wide range of issues , from different expectations among military services as to how base support services should be provided to incompatible information technology networks . however , the absence of a formal method to routinely share information on common challenges and possible solutions , or guidance on developing and providing training for new personnel on how joint bases provide installation support , means dod is likely to miss opportunities to develop common solutions to common challenges . federal internal control standards state that for an entity to control its operations , it must have relevant and timely communications , and information is needed throughout the agency to achieve objectives . in addition , without processes to identify common challenges and share information across the joint bases , dod may miss opportunities for greater efficiencies and be unable to provide uniform policies across the joint bases . gao recommends that dod take six actions , such as developing a plan to achieve cost savings , prioritizing review and revision of unclear common standards , and developing a strategy to share solutions to common challenges . dod partially agreed with five recommendations and did not concur with the recommendation to develop a plan to achieve cost savings , because it stated that such goals are not appropriate at this time . gao continues to believe that the recommendations are valid as discussed further in the report .
