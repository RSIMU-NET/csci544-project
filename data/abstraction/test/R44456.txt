after five years of drought , rain and snowstorms in northern and central california in the winter of 2016-2017 significantly improved water supply conditions in the state in 2017. according to the u.s. drought monitor , as of late april 2017 , less than 1 % of the state was in severe drought conditions . this represents an improvement from one year prior to that date , when 73 % of the state was in severe drought conditions , and two years prior , when 92 % fell under this designation . stress on water supplies due to drought resulted in cutbacks in water deliveries to districts receiving water from federal and state facilities , in particular the federal central valley project ( cvp , operated by the bureau of reclamation ) and the state water project ( swp , operated by the state of california ) . in 2015 , california mandated a 25 % reduction in water use for nonagricultural water users , and overall swp deliveries were limited to 20 % of contractor requests . some of these restrictions have since been relaxed . reclamation estimated its initial water allocations for cvp contractors for the 2017 water year in a series of announcements in february , march , and april 2017. for the first time in years , initial water allocations for most cvp water contractors were 100 % . contractors south of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers ' delta ( bay delta ) initially received lower allocations in march 2017 ( 65 % for agricultural contractors and 90 % for municipal and industrial contractors , respectively ) , but reclamation subsequently revised these allocations upward to 100 % in april . the allocations represented a drastic change from recent years , in which no supplies were made available to many of these contractors , who farm some of the most valuable irrigated agricultural land in the country . most expect that the historically wet conditions of 2016-2017 will not continue in future years and that future water years will continue to see deliveries limited to some extent . previous cutbacks to cvp deliveries ( in particular during periods of increased precipitation ) have caused some to criticize reclamation 's management of the cvp and question the extent to which factors beyond limited water supplies ( e.g . , restrictions to protect endangered species and water quality ) influence water management and the quantity of water delivered to contractors . they argue that congressionally directed changes in the operation of the cvp that would result in increases to water allocations are needed . other stakeholders argue that some of these changes could undercut environmental regulations , harm fish and wildlife , and potentially lower water quality . they also worry that legislative proposals that would alter the implementation of the endangered species act could harm species in the region and set a precedent that could be used to affect other listed species in the future . legislation enacted in the 114th congress ( subtitle j of s. 612 , the water infrastructure improvements for the nation [ wiin ] act ) incorporated provisions from multiple california drought - related bills that had been considered dating to the 112th congress . among other things , these provisions directed pumping to `` maximize '' water supplies for the cvp ( in accordance with applicable biological opinions ) , allowed for increased pumping during certain high water events , and authorized expedited reviews of water transfers . similar to recent congresses , the 115th congress is considering legislation that proposes additional changes to cvp operations . h.r . 23 , the gaining responsibility on water act ( grow act ) incorporates a number of provisions that were included in previous legislation but were not in the final version of the wiin act . congress may consider this and similar legislation , as well as oversight of cvp operations and implementation of wiin act cvp provisions . this report provides an abbreviated background on the cvp and swp . it also provides a summary of recent hydrologic conditions in california and their effect on water deliveries .
