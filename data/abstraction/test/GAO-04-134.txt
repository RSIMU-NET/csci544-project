the local tv act required that gao perform an annual audit of the administration of the provisions of the act , and financial position of each applicant who receives a loan guarantee under the act , including the nature , amount , and purpose of investments made by the applicant . in fiscal year 2002 , the local tv program was funded ; however , because it was not fully implemented in that year , there were no loan guarantee applicants for gao to audit . therefore , this report primarily addresses whether program administration during fiscal year 2002 satisfied the provisions of the act . in december 2000 , the congress passed the launching our communities ' access to local television act of 2000 ( local tv act or act ) . the act created the local television loan guarantee program ( program or local tv program ) and established the local television loan guarantee board ( board ) to approve guaranteed loans , totaling no more than $ 1.25 billion , to finance projects that will provide local television access to households with limited over - the - air television broadcast signals or cable service . the board is comprised of the secretary of the treasury , the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system , the secretary of agriculture , and the secretary of commerce , or their designees . the department of agriculture ( usda ) rural utilities service serves as program administrator ( administrator ) . the local tv program has not been established in an expeditious fashion as specified by the act . given that funds were appropriated in november 2001 , thus starting the clock on the 120 days allowed for completing program regulations and underwriting criteria , the program should have been ready for implementation by march 2002. according to the board and administrator , three factors contributed to program delays : initial uncertainties over program funding , inadequate dedicated staff resources for program activities , and the decision to issue a proposed rule . as of the end of august 2003 , neither of these key documents , which provide the overall framework for the program , was ready for implementation , thus delaying lending activities and ultimately , realization of improved television reception in target areas throughout the united states . further , the full costs of administering the program , including those incurred by the respective agencies and departments providing support to the board , were not accumulated and charged to the program as called for by federal accounting standards . statement of federal financial accounting standard no.4 , managerial cost accounting standards requires federal agencies to capture the costs of federal programs to assist the congress in authorizing , modifying , and discontinuing programs and to provide agencies with reliable cost data for making informed managerial decisions and evaluating performance . further , the capacity to capture these costs going forward is key to fully recovering certain costs of administering the program through loan application and loan guarantee origination fees .
