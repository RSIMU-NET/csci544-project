for more than 70 years , the technological superiority of the united states military has offset the size and geographic advantages of potential adversaries . the department of defense ( dod ) , due in large part to the magnitude of its investments in research and development ( r & d ) , has driven the global r & d and technology landscape . however , dod and the federal government more broadly are no longer overriding funders of r & d , and this shift in support for r & d has substantial implications for how dod obtains advanced technology and maintains the battlefield overmatch that technology has historically provided . in 1960 , the united states accounted for 69 % of global r & d , with u.s. defense - related r & d alone accounting for more than one - third of global r & d ( 36 % ) . additionally , the federal government funded approximately twice as much r & d as u.s. business . however , from 1960 to 2016 , the u.s. share of global r & d fell to 28 % , and the federal government 's share of total u.s. r & d fell from 65 % to 24 % , while business 's share more than doubled from 33 % to 67 % . as a result of these global , national , and federal trends , federal defense r & d 's share of total global r & d fell to 3.7 % in 2016. this decline resulted primarily from more rapid increases in the r & d of other nations ( public and private ) and partially from increases in u.s. business r & d and federal nondefense r & d . some defense experts and policymakers have recognized the shift in the global r & d landscape and the need for dod to rely increasingly on technologies developed by commercial companies for commercial markets . among the challenges dod faces in acquiring new , innovative technologies and maintaining u.s. military technical superiority are developing / modifying organizations and business models to access this technology ; adapting the dod business culture to seek and embrace technologies developed outside of dod , the united states , and its traditional contractor base ; and finding ways to adapt and leverage commercial technologies for defense applications . congress plays a central role in how dod creates and acquires leading - edge technologies , including establishing and refining the organizational structure of dod r & d activities , providing policy direction , establishing acquisition policies and authorities , and appropriating funds for r & d and innovation - related activities . congress and the administration have undertaken a number of actions to address the perceived decline in technical superiority , including establishing the position of the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to coordinate dod 's research enterprise , drive the development of key technologies , and create a more agile and innovative department ; increasing dod collaboration and engagement with industry and academia . for example , dod has increased its presence in u.s. commercial technology hubs through the defense innovation unit , established partnership intermediary agreements with various organizations , and co - located dod research and development personnel at partner institutions across the country ; and working to alter the culture of dod to increase the speed technologies are developed , adapted , and acquired , including through the use of other transaction authority . as dod implements these reform efforts congressional oversight may include monitoring how effectively dod is addressing congressional directives and intent to create a more risk tolerant and innovative dod .
