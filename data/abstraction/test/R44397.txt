the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) was created in 1958 by the national aeronautics and space act ( p.l . 85-568 ) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities . it has four mission directorates . the science mission directorate manages robotic science missions , such as the hubble space telescope , the mars rover curiosity , and satellites for earth science research . the aeronautics research mission directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems . the space technology mission directorate develops technologies for use in future space missions , such as advanced propulsion and laser communications . the human exploration and operations mission directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities , including the international space station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft . in addition , nasa 's office of education manages formal and informal education programs for school children , college and university students , and the general public . while congress is generally supportive of most nasa programs , government - wide fiscal constraints make funding decisions challenging . the administration has requested $ 19.025 billion for nasa in fy2017 . this amount is 1.3 % less than the fy2016 appropriation of $ 19.285 billion . unusually , the fy2017 request includes $ 763 million in mandatory funds . the house bill ( h.r . 5393 ) would provide $ 19.508 billion . the senate bill ( s. 2837 ) would provide $ 19.306 billion . neither bill includes mandatory funding . the fy2017 request for the science mission directorate is $ 5.601 billion , an increase of 0.2 % from fy2016 . within this total , funding for earth science , astrophysics , and heliophysics would increase , while funding for planetary science and the james webb space telescope would decrease . the house bill would provide $ 5.597 billion for science , while the senate bill would provide $ 5.395 billion . within these totals , the bills differ considerably in their allocation of funding between earth science and planetary science . the fy2017 request for the aeronautics research mission directorate is $ 790 million , an increase of 23.5 % from fy2016 . the request includes new aviation horizons ( nah ) , a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations . the house and senate bills would provide $ 712 million and $ 601 million , respectively , for aeronautics . the fy2017 request for the space technology mission directorate is $ 827 million , an increase of 20.4 % from fy2016 . the house and senate bills would provide $ 739 million and $ 687 million . for the human exploration and operations mission directorate , the fy2017 request for exploration is $ 3.337 billion , a decrease of 17.2 % from fy2016 , while the request for space operations is $ 5.076 billion , an increase of 0.9 % . the exploration request includes $ 1.263 billion , a decrease of 35.2 % , for space launch system launch vehicle development . funding for the commercial crew program ( formerly requested in exploration ) is combined with funding for operational cargo and crew transport to the international space station in a new space transportation item within space operations . the house bill would provide $ 4.183 billion for exploration , including $ 2.000 billion for sls development , and $ 4.890 billion for space operations . the senate bill would provide $ 4.330 billion for exploration , including $ 2.150 billion for the sls , and $ 4.951 billion for space operations . the fy2017 request for the office of education is $ 100 million , a decrease of 13.0 % from fy2016 . the house and senate bills would provide $ 115 million and $ 108 million , respectively . the request would reduce funding for the national space grant college and fellowship program , the experimental program to stimulate competitive research , and the minority university research education program . both bills would fund these programs at their fy2016 levels .
