for at least four decades , congress has been concerned about the coast guard 's ability to maintain an adequate staff of experienced marine safety personnel to ensure that vessels meet federal safety standards . the 2015 sinking of the u.s. - flag cargo ship el faro during a hurricane near the bahamas with the loss of 33 lives renewed attention to the coast guard 's persistent difficulty with hiring and training a marine safety workforce with technical knowledge of vessel construction and accident investigation , as the safety inspections of the vessel were found to have been inadequate . in the hamm alert maritime safety act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-265 ) , congress directed the coast guard to brief congressional committees of jurisdiction on its efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff . in the frank lobiondo coast guard authorization act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-282 ) , congress requested a report from the coast guard detailing the courses and other training a marine inspector must complete to be considered qualified , including any courses that have been dropped from the training curriculum in recent years . congress 's concern about the coast guard 's inspection staff comes at a time when the agency 's vessel inspection workload is increasing by about 50 % because towing vessels have been added to its responsibilities . additionally , congress has been increasing the agency 's role in fishing vessel safety . adding to the coast guard 's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel . vessel safety inspections are especially critical for the u.s. - flag fleet , like the el faro , because a majority of it is much older than the 15 to 20 years of age at which ships in the foreign - flag worldwide oceangoing fleet are typically scrapped . over half of the u.s. - flag commercial fleet is over 20 years old ; the el faro had been in service for 40 years . vessels that transport cargo or passengers domestically ( from one u.s. point to another u.s. point ) must be built in the united states , as required by the jones act . the comparatively high cost of domestic ship construction encourages ship owners to keep jones act vessels in service well beyond their normal retirement age . in general , older vessels are believed to have a higher risk of structural defects and to require more intensive inspection . currently , the coast guard 's marine inspection staff consists of 533 military and 138 civilian personnel , while its accident investigation staff consists of 120 military staff and 38 civilians . as a military organization , the coast guard frequently rotates its staff among various duty stations , so personnel may not develop the knowledge and experience required of a proficient marine inspector or investigator . a common perception inside the agency that marine safety is an area that retards promotion also may be thwarting efforts to boost this mission 's workforce . the coast guard recently has stated its intention to improve the quality of its inspection workforce and to make marine safety an attractive long - term career path by extending promotion potential . however , its recent statements are similar to statements made 10 years ago , when some members of congress advocated transferring the marine safety function to a civilian agency . it is unclear what the agency has accomplished over the last decade regarding its inspection workforce . government audits dating to 1979 have been consistently critical of the proficiency level of coast guard inspectors and accident investigators . reorganizing the marine safety function under a civilian agency , perhaps as an element of a larger reorganization of navigation functions in the federal government , might improve the quality of safety inspections and investigations , but other federal agencies with transportation - related safety inspection workforces have had similar issues with retaining experienced personnel .
