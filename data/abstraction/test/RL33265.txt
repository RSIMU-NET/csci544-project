the logan act , codified at 18 u.s.c . ยง 953 , states : any citizen of the united states , wherever he may be , who , without authority of the united states , directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof , in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states , or to defeat the measures of the united states , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years , or both . this section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply , himself or his agent , to any foreign government or the agents thereof for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects . the logan act was intended to prohibit united states citizens without authority from interfering in relations between the united states and foreign governments . there appear to have been no prosecutions under the act in its more than 200-year history . however , there have been a number of judicial references to the act , and it is not uncommon for it to be used as a point of challenge concerning dealings with foreign officials there has been renewed interest in the logan act in 2015 as the result of a letter signed by 47 u.s. senators to iran suggesting that negotiations about a nuclear deal between the president and the iranian leadership would be an executive agreement that another president or congress would be able to abrogate . some have raised questions about the constitutionality of the act , whether it applies to members of congress , and its current viability . commenters have provided arguments that both support and oppose the legality of the senators ' letter . although attempts have been made to repeal the act , it remains law and at least a potential sanction which could be used against anyone who without authority interferes in the foreign relations of the united states .
