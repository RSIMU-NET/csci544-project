the indian health service ( ihs ) , an agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides health care for eligible american indians / alaskan natives through a system of programs and facilities located on or near indian reservations and in certain urban areas . the ihs health delivery program is organized into 12 regional area offices and 161 local service units , and serves federal reservations , indian communities , and urban indians . in general , persons eligible for ihs services must be in ihs service areas and belong to federally recognized tribes . the ihs - served population generally has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than the u.s. population as a whole . several ihs publications compare the health conditions and causes of death of the ihs service population with those for the entire u.s. population . according to the latest of these , the average life expectancy at birth for the ihs service area population in 1999-2001 was 74.5 years , or 2.4 years less than the 76.9 years for the total u.s. population . ihs appropriations are separated into two budget categories : health services and health facilities . for fy2008 , the total appropriation for ihs was $ 3.35 billion , of which $ 2.97 billion ( 89 % ) was for health services and $ 374.6 million ( 11 % ) was for health facilities . other sources of ihs funding include a special diabetes program and reimbursements from medicare , medicaid , and private insurance . total ihs `` program - level '' funding , including all sources , was $ 4.28 billion in fy2008 . indian health advocates argue that ihs funding falls short of the need . although a number of legislative issues concerning ihs face the 111th congress , the primary focus has been on the reauthorization of the indian health care improvement act ( ihcia ) . two bills ( s. 1200 and h.r . 1328 ) were introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize the ihcia . both reauthorization bills would have expanded health services , eased processes for reimbursements from medicaid and other federal programs , coordinated behavioral health programs , and authorized other actions . s. 1200 was reported , amended , by the senate indian affairs committee on october 17 , 2007 ( s.rept . 110-197 ) . s. 1200 was passed , amended , by the senate february 28 , 2008 , and sent to the house . h.r . 1328 was reported , amended , by the house natural resources committee on april 4 , 2008 ( h.rept . 110-564 , part 1 ) . separately h.r . 1328 was forwarded , amended , by the house energy and commerce committee 's health subcommittee to the full committee on november 7 , 2007. h.r . 1328 was discharged by the energy and commerce and ways and means committees on june 6 , 2008 , and the natural resources version reported in april was placed on the calendar . concerns continue about many issues in the ihcia bills , including provisions on medicaid and other issues listed in a january 2008 statement of administration policy on s. 1200 , which threatened a veto of that bill . neither s. 1200 nor h.r . 1328 were passed by congress . no ihcia bill has been introduced in the 111th congress as of the date of this report , but certain medicaid - related provisions have been included in draft economic - stimulus legislation . this report will be updated .
