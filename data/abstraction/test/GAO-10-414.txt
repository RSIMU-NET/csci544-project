to improve aviation safety , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) plans to have in place the initial capabilities of a risk - based approach to safety oversight , known as a safety management system ( sms ) , by the end of fiscal year 2010. faa is also implementing new procedures and technologies to enhance the safety , capacity , and efficiency of the national airspace system . data are central to sms and faa 's ability to test the impact of these changes on safety . this congressionally requested report addresses faa 's current and planned use of data to oversee aviation safety , access to data for monitoring aviation safety and the safety performance of various industry sectors , and efforts to help ensure data quality . to perform this work , gao reviewed 13 databases that contain data on key aviation safety events , assessed data quality controls for the databases , and interviewed agency and industry officials , as well as 10 experts in aviation safety and data . faa analyzes data on past safety events , such as engine failures , to prevent their recurrence and plans to use data to support a more proactive approach to managing risk . for example , weather and air traffic control data helped identify factors associated with injuries from turbulence . as part of sms , faa plans to analyze data proactively to support a risk - based approach to safety oversight . for example , faa plans to use data to model the impact of proposed changes in procedures and technologies on the safety of the national airspace system . experts said that identifying risks is necessary to maintain the current level of safety and possibly achieve a higher level of safety in the future . because sms relies on data to identify emerging risks , faa has an effort under way to enhance its access to industry data and improve its capability for automated analysis of multiple databases . according to faa , this effort will allow for more efficient safety analyses . faa is also developing a plan for managing data under sms , but the plan does not fully address data , analysis , or staffing requirements . without such requirements , the plan will not provide timely guidance for implementing sms . faa has access to some voluntarily reported data , which are important for sms , but not all carriers and aviation personnel participate in faa 's voluntary reporting programs . such data are gathered electronically by equipment on aircraft or reported by aviation personnel or carriers following noncriminal , unintentional violations or safety events . industry personnel have some incentives to participate in voluntary programs , such as promised immunity from disciplinary action , but concerns about sanctions and the cost of equipment have deterred full participation , especially by smaller carriers . while faa has some information on reasons for nonparticipation and has taken some steps to promote greater participation , it lacks carrier - specific information on why air carriers are not participating . faa also lacks data to assess the safety performance of certain industry sectors , such as air cargo and air ambulance operators . gao has previously made recommendations to address this lack of data . faa concurred with gao 's prior recommendations and is taking actions to address them . to help ensure data quality -- that is , data that are reliable ( complete and accurate ) and valid ( measure what is intended ) -- faa has implemented a number of data quality controls that are consistent with gao 's standards for data quality , but some weaknesses exit . for example , all the databases gao reviewed had at least some controls in place to ensure that erroneous data are identified , reported , and corrected . however , about half the databases lack an important control -- managers do not review the data prior to entry into the data system . faa is taking steps to address its data weaknesses , but vulnerabilities remain , potentially limiting the usefulness of faa 's data for the safety analyses planned to support sms .
