the postal accountability and enhancement act of 2006 required gao to evaluate strategies and options for reforms of the united states postal service ( usps ) . usps 's business model is to fulfill its mission through self - supporting , businesslike operations ; however , usps has experienced increasing difficulties . due to volume declines , losses , a cash shortage , and rising debt , gao added usps 's financial condition to its high - risk list in july 2009. gao 's objectives were to assess the viability of usps 's business model , strategies and options to address challenges to its business model , and actions congress and usps need to take to facilitate progress toward financial viability . gao primarily drew on its past work ; other studies ; usps data ; interviews with usps , unions , management associations , postal regulatory commission , and mailing industry officials ; and stakeholder input . usps 's business model is not viable due to usps 's inability to reduce costs sufficiently in response to continuing mail volume and revenue declines . mail volume declined 36 billion pieces ( 17 percent ) over the last 3 fiscal years ( 2007 through 2009 ) with the recession accelerating shifts to electronic communications and payments . usps lost nearly $ 12 billion over this period , despite achieving billions in cost savings by reducing its career workforce by over 84,000 employees , reducing capital investments , and raising rates . however , usps had difficulty in eliminating costly excess capacity , and its revenue initiatives have had limited results . usps also is nearing its $ 15 billion borrowing limit with the u.s. treasury and has unfunded pension and retiree health obligations and other liabilities of about $ 90 billion . in 2009 , congress reduced usps 's retiree health benefit payment by $ 4 billion to address a looming cash shortfall , but usps still recorded a loss of $ 3.8 billion . given its financial problems and outlook , usps can not support its current level of service and operations . usps projects that volume will decline by about 27 billion pieces over the next decade , while revenues will stagnate ; costs will rise ; and , without major changes , cumulative losses could exceed $ 238 billion . this report groups strategies and options that can be taken to address challenges in usps 's business model by better aligning costs with revenues ( see table on next page ) . usps may be able to improve its financial viability if it takes more aggressive action to reduce costs , particularly compensation and benefit costs that comprise 80 percent of its total costs , as well as increasing revenues within its current authority . however , it is unlikely that such changes would fully resolve usps 's financial problems , unless congress also takes actions to address constraints and legal restrictions . action by congress and usps is urgently needed to reach agreement on actions to achieve usps 's financial viability , provide financial relief through deferral of costs by revising usps retiree health benefit funding while continuing to fund these benefits over time to the extent that usps 's finances permit , and require that any binding arbitration resulting from collective bargaining would take usps 's financial condition into account . congress may also want assurance that any financial relief it provides is met with aggressive actions by usps to reduce its costs and increase revenues , and that usps is making progress toward addressing its financial problems . usps 's new business plan recognizes immediate actions are needed , but usps has made limited progress on some options , such as closing facilities . if no action is taken , risks of larger usps losses , rate increases , and taxpayer subsidies will increase . to facilitate progress in these difficult areas , congress could set up a mechanism , such as one similar to the military base realignment and closure commission , where independent experts could recommend a package of actions with time frames . key issues also need to be addressed related to what changes , if any , should be made to delivery or retail services ; to allow usps to provide new products or services in nonpostal areas ; and to realign usps operations , networks , and workforce .
