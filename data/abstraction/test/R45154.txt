a `` lame duck '' session of congress occurs whenever one congress meets after its successor is elected but before the end of its own constitutional term . under present conditions , any meeting of congress between election day in november and the following january 3 is a lame duck session . prior to 1933 , when the twentieth amendment changed the dates of the congressional term , the last regular session of congress was always a lame duck session . today , however , the expression is primarily used for any portion of a regular session that falls after an election . congress has held 21 lame duck sessions since the implementation of the twentieth amendment . from the first modern lame duck session in 1941 to 1998 , the sessions occurred sporadically . beginning in 2000 , both houses of congress have held a lame duck session following every election . in this report , the data presentation is separate for the sporadic period ( 76th - 105th congresses ) and the consistent period ( 106th - present ) in order to identify past and emerging trends . lame duck sessions can occur in several ways . either chamber or both chambers may ( 1 ) provide for an existing session to resume after a recess spanning the election ; ( 2 ) continue meeting in intermittent , or pro forma , sessions during the period spanning the election ; or ( 3 ) reconvene after an election pursuant to contingent authority granted to the leadership in a recess or adjournment resolution . two other possibilities have not occurred : ( 4 ) congress could set a statutory date for a new session to convene after the election , then adjourn its existing session sine die ; and ( 5 ) while congress is in recess or sine die adjournment , the president could call it into extraordinary session at a date after the election . during both the sporadic and the consistent periods , election breaks have usually begun by mid - october and spanned between one and two months . congress has most often reconvened in mid - november and adjourned before christmas so that the lame duck session lasted about a month . however , in four out the past five congresses , lame duck sessions have continued into january , producing later adjournments , longer sessions , and more days convened in daily sessions . lame duck sessions have been held for a variety of reasons . their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation . however , they have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes , to consider motions of censure or impeachment , or to keep congress assembled on a standby basis . in recent years , most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations , trade agreements , appropriations , and the budget . this report will be updated after any additional lame duck session occurs .
