dod relies on pme and jpme to prepare its military personnel throughout their careers for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service . however , according to dod 's summary of the 2018 national defense strategy , pme “ has stagnated , focused more on the accomplishment of mandatory credit at the expense of lethality and ingenuity. ” the conference report accompanying the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 included a provision for gao to evaluate dod pme and jpme institutions . this report examines the extent to which the military services ' pme programs have met civilian and jpme accreditation requirements , osd has assessed the effectiveness of the military services ' pme programs , and usd ( comptroller ) has monitored the military services ' pme program budget data . gao analyzed applicable laws and policy , analyzed accreditation and budget information , and interviewed officials from the military services ' intermediate - and senior - level resident pme programs . all of the military services ' intermediate - and senior - level officer professional military education ( pme ) programs have met civilian and met or partially met joint pme ( jpme ) accreditation requirements . however , not all of the military services ' pme programs met the jpme seminar student mix requirement of at least one student from the nonhost military department . for example , the army 's intermediate - level pme program did not meet its sea service ( i.e . , navy , marine corps , and , in certain instances , coast guard ) requirement ( see table ) . gao 's analysis found that the navy could have assigned officers to air force and army programs while not harming participation in its own seminars . without taking steps to improve sea service participation , students lose opportunities to interact with students from other military departments , which officials have identified as critical to joint acculturation . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) has taken steps to improve its oversight of the military services ' pme programs , but is limited in its ability to assess their effectiveness . department of defense ( dod ) guidance states that performance measurement is a means of evaluating efficiency , effectiveness , and results and that a balanced performance measurement scorecard includes nonfinancial and financial measures focusing on quality , cycle time , and costs . while osd is in the process of developing some performance measures , it is not planning to require the military services to track program costs . implementing its planned measures and establishing costs as a performance measure will better position osd to assess the effectiveness of pme programs . the under secretary of defense ( usd ) ( comptroller 's ) ability to monitor the military services ' pme programs is limited by incomplete and inconsistent reporting of service budget request data . dod guidance does not require the marine corps to submit an annual budget request data exhibit for its senior - level pme program and existing guidance for programs that are reported does not specify how to uniformly account for costs . without complete and uniform budget request data , usd ( comptroller ) is challenged in monitoring these programs . gao is making seven recommendations , including that dod take steps to determine its ability to assign navy officers to pme programs of other services , implement performance measures – including tracking of costs , and issue guidance for service reporting of pme budget request data . dod concurred with all of gao 's recommendations .
