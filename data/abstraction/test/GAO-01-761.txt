the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan have the potential for focusing the department 's missions , but these efforts are compromised in several areas . usda 's goals and measures are too general to give insight into what usda is actually trying to achieve . it is difficult to assess usda 's progress when it uses unrealistic goals to achieve strategic outcomes and when it uses untimely data that has not been consistently verified . in two areas -- strategic human capital management and information security -- progress in measuring usda 's performance has been frustrated by the lack of goals and measures for identified issues . finally , by not sharing information about the major management challenges identified by its own inspector general , usda 's agencies miss the opportunity to develop strategies and plans to respond to these issues .
