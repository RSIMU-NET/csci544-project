pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed intermodal freight transportation issues , focusing on : the department of transportation 's ( dot ) efforts to track how states use intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) funds to facilitate intermodal transportation ; the nature and extent of istea funds used by states for intermodal freight projects ; how some local and regional areas that handle large volumes of freight have considered intermodal freight transportation issues as part of their planning processes ; impediments some areas face in improving intermodal freight transportation ; and trends in intermodal freight transportation . gao found that : dot has not developed the statutorily required database on public and private intermodal transportation investments , or tracked how states use istea funds for such projects ; dot says that its limited role in allocating funds , states ' inconsistent identification of projects , and intermodal projects ' multiple financing sources make establishing the database difficult ; as of september 1995 , 10 states had obligated about $ 35.6 million in istea funds for 23 intermodal - freight - related projects ; as of december 1995 , 9 states had obligated $ 68.4 million , or 36 percent of the $ 191.8 million in istea funds authorized , for 20 priority intermodal freight projects ; the total amount of funds obligated for intermodal freight projects through the first four istea fiscal years equals less than 1 percent of istea funds apportioned to the states for highways and other nontransit infrastructure projects during the same period ; metropolitan planning organizations have to balance intermodal freight issues with a wide range of other transportation needs ; public transportation planners lack experience and planning tools for intermodal transportation , but states are slowly developing such expertise and tools ; local and regional planners are addressing problems specific to their areas ; and impediments to improving intermodal freight transportation include obtaining necessary proprietary information on freight movements and coordinating public and private - sector planning , but public - private partnerships may help overcome such impediments .
