the current economic downturn has brought significant financial stress to the auto manufacturing industry . recent deteriorating financial , real estate , and labor markets have reduced consumer confidence and available credit , and automobile purchases have declined . while auto manufacturers broadly have experienced declining sales in 2008 as the economy has worsened , sales of the `` big 3 '' ( general motors , chrysler , and ford ) have also declined relative to those of some other auto manufacturers in recent years because higher gasoline prices have particularly hurt sales of sport utility vehicles . in addition to causing potential job losses at auto manufacturers , failure of the domestic auto industry would likely adversely affect other sectors . officials from the big 3 have requested , and congress is considering , immediate federal financial assistance . this testimony discusses principles that can serve as a framework for considering the desirability , nature , scope , and conditions of federal financial assistance . should congress decide to provide financial assistance , we also discuss how these principles could be applied in these circumstances . the testimony is based on gao 's extensive body of work on previous federal rescue efforts that dates back to the 1970s . from our previous work on federal financial assistance to large firms and municipalities , we have identified three fundamental principles that can serve as a framework for considering future assistance . these principles are identifying and defining the problem , determining the national interests and setting clear goals and objectives that address the problem , and protecting the government 's interests . first , problems confronting the industry must be clearly defined -- separating out those that require an immediate response from those structural challenges that will take more time to resolve . second , congress should determine whether the national interest will be best served through a legislative solution , or whether market forces and established legal procedures , such as bankruptcy , should be allowed to take their course . should congress decide that federal financial assistance is warranted , it is important that congress establish clear objectives and goals for this assistance . third , given the significant financial risk the federal government may assume , the structure congress sets up to administer any assistance should provide for appropriate mechanisms , such as concessions by all parties , controls over management , compensation for risk , and a strong independent board , to protect taxpayers from excessive or unnecessary risks . these principles could help the congress in deciding whether to offer financial assistance to the domestic auto manufacturers . if congress determines that a legislative solution is in the national interest , a two - pronged approach could be appropriate in these circumstances . specifically , congress could 1 ) authorize immediate , but temporary , financial assistance to the auto manufacturing industry and 2 ) concurrently establish a board to approve , disburse , and oversee the use of these initial funds and provide any additional federal funds and continued oversight . this board could also oversee any structural reforms of the companies . among other responsibilities , congress could give the board authority to establish and implement eligibility criteria for potential borrowers and to implement procedures and controls in order to protect the government 's interests .
