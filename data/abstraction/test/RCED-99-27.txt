pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) progress in closing completed grants and contracts , focusing on : epa 's efforts to close out inactive grants and contracts ; the progress that epa has made in reducing the number of inactive grants and contracts , the number of remaining inactive grants and contracts , and the dates by which they are expected to be closed out ; and the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts . gao noted that : over the last 8 years , epa has taken several initiatives to reduce the backlogs of inactive grants and contracts needing closeout ; in 1992 , epa developed a policy specifying procedures for closing out nonconstruction grants , and in 1998 , the agency developed a strategy for eliminating the existing backlog of inactive nonconstruction grants and preventing a future backlog ; however , closeout procedures and strategies for nonconstruction grants were not consistently followed , and strategies at the regional level frequently did not include specific actions for implementation ; epa also developed automated systems to improve the monitoring of the nonconstruction grant closeout process ; in 1990 and 1997 , epa developed strategies to reduce the backlog of wastewater treatment construction grants ; in fiscal year ( fy ) 1994 , epa established goals for closing out a specific number of inactive contracts ; epa has made significant progress in closing out inactive grants and contracts , but a considerable number remain to be closed ; in 1996 , the agency had a backlog of nearly 18,000 nonconstruction grants , but by june 1998 , the backlog was reduced to approximately 4,100 ; epa estimated in 1996 that the backlog of nonconstruction grants would be eliminated by july 2000 ; with closeouts progressing at the current rate , it is likely that this goal will be attained ; the number of inactive wastewater treatment construction grants needing closeout was about 500 as of march 1998- - reduced from about 5,900 at the end of fy 1990 ; while the construction grant backlog was initially projected to be eliminated by the end of fy 1997 , this goal was not attained , and in december 1996 , epa revised its projection to eliminate the backlog by 2002 ; recent estimates from epa 's offices implementing the closeout strategy for construction grants indicate that this goal is unlikely to be attained ; in march 1993 , epa had approximately 2,000 inactive contracts needing closeout , and by august 1998 , that number had been reduced to 1,028 ; significant amounts of unliquidated obligations remain for inactive grants and contracts and could potentially be allocated for other epa projects and programs ; the unliquidated obligations for construction and nonconstruction grants totalled about $ 612.1 million , and for about $ 423.8 million of this total amount , there are no statutory time restrictions on the use of funds ; and therefore , a large portion of these funds is potentially available for recovery and could be used for other approved projects .
