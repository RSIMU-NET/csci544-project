when an emergency call is placed to 911 , prompt response depends on knowing the location of the caller . enhanced 911 ( e911 ) service automatically provides this critical information . e911 is in place in most of the country for traditional wireline telephone service , where the telephone number is linked to a street address . expanding e911 capabilities to mobile phones is inherently more challenging because of the need to determine the caller 's geographic location at the moment the call is made . concerns have been raised about the pace of wireless e911 implementation and whether this service will be available nationwide . gao reviewed the progress being made in implementing wireless e911 service , the factors affecting this progress , and the role of the federal government in facilitating the nationwide deployment of wireless e911 service . implementation of wireless e911 is several years away in many states , raising the prospect of piecemeal availability of this service across the country for an indefinite number of years to come . successful implementation depends on coordinated efforts by wireless carriers , local telephone companies , and more than 6,000 public safety answering points ( psaps ) -- the facilities that receive 911 calls and dispatch assistance . according to a database sponsored by the department of transportation ( dot ) , as of october 2003 , nearly 65 percent of psaps had phase i wireless e911 service , which provides the approximate location of the caller , while only 18 percent had phase ii , which provides a more precise location and is the ultimate goal of wireless e911 service . though valuable , the database does not differentiate between psaps that will require equipment upgrades and those that will not , thereby limiting its usefulness in accurately assessing progress toward full implementation . looking forward , 24 state 911 contacts said in response to a gao survey that their state will have phase ii implemented by 2005 or sooner ; however , all other state contacts estimated dates beyond 2005 or were unable to estimate a date . key factors hindering wireless e911 implementation involve funding and coordination . the wireless carriers , states , and localities must devise the means to fund more than $ 8 billion in estimated deployment costs over the next 5 years . some states and localities have established funding mechanisms ( such as e911 surcharges on phone bills ) , but others have not done so or have used their e911 funds for unrelated purposes . in addition , there is also a lack of coordination in some cases among the wireless carriers , local telephone companies , and psaps that can lead to delays in wireless e911 implementation . states with knowledgeable and involved coordinators were best able to work through these coordination issues . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and dot are involved in promoting wireless e911 , but their authority in overseeing its deployment is limited because psaps traditionally fall under state and local jurisdiction . fcc has set deadlines on the wireless carriers ' e911 responsibilities and has taken actions to identify best practices and improve coordination among the parties . dot is developing an action plan and clearinghouse for wireless e911 planning , implementation , and operations .
