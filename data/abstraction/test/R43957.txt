congress has played an active role in u.s. policy toward sudan for more than three decades . efforts to support an end to the country 's myriad conflicts and human rights abuses have dominated the agenda , as have counterterrorism concerns . when unified ( 1956-2011 ) , sudan was africa 's largest nation by area , bordering nine countries and stretching from the northern borders of kenya and uganda to the southern borders of egypt and libya . strategically located along the nile river and the red sea , sudan was historically described as a crossroads between the arab world and africa . domestic and international efforts to unite the country 's ethnically , racially , religiously , and culturally diverse population under a common national identity fell short , however , and in 2011 , after decades of civil war and a six - year transitional period , sudan split in two . mistrust between the two sudans — sudan and south sudan — lingers , and unresolved disputes and related security issues still threaten to pull the two countries back to war . the north - south split did not resolve other simmering sudanese conflicts , notably in darfur , blue nile , and southern kordofan . roughly 3.7 million people are displaced , internally or as refugees , by violence in these areas . like the rest of the sahel , sudan is susceptible to drought and food insecurity , despite significant agricultural potential in some areas . civilians in conflict zones are particularly vulnerable . instability and government restrictions limit relief agencies ' access to conflict - affected populations . logistical challenges , particularly during seasonal rains , also constrain access to those who have fled to remote refugee camps in south sudan . the internal conflict that unfolded in south sudan in late 2013 further threatens access to those refugees , and has led more than 146,000 south sudanese to flee into sudan . harassment of aid workers is a problem in both countries , further hindering aid responses . the peaceful separation of sudan and south sudan was seen by some as an opportunity to repair relations between sudan 's islamist government and the united states . those ties have long been strained over khartoum 's human rights violations and history of relations with terrorist groups . among the arguments in favor of normalizing relations has been the notion that the united states , given robust sanctions already in place , has few additional unilateral `` sticks '' to apply . advocates have argued that certain `` carrots , '' such as easing sanctions or elevating the level of diplomatic engagement , might advance u.s. policy goals . efforts by the obama administration to improve relations , given sudan 's reported counterterrorism cooperation and acceptance of south sudan 's separation , have been impeded by reports of ongoing abuses , including allegations that sudan continues to commit war crimes against civilians . diplomatic relations are also complicated by the fact that several sudanese officials , notably president omar al bashir , stand accused of war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide at the international criminal court . in 2014 , under domestic and international pressure to address calls for reform and to resolve ongoing conflicts , president bashir announced a national dialogue , under which the government would engage opposition and civil society groups on the development of a new constitution . the african union , the united nations , the obama administration and other international actors expressed cautious support for the initiative , although the extent of the government 's commitment to major political reforms remains unclear , and efforts to facilitate the participation of armed opposition groups in the process have been , to date , unsuccessful . major opposition parties boycotted elections held in april 2015 ; president bashir was reelected with 94 % of the vote . this report provides an overview of political , economic , and humanitarian conditions , examines conflict dynamics in the country , and outlines u.s. policy and congressional engagement .
