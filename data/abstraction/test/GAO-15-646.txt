federal , state , and local agencies play an important role in improving social outcomes for society 's most vulnerable populations . a small number of state , local , and foreign governments are employing pfs to fund efforts designed to better serve these vulnerable populations . gao was asked to provide information about pfs . this report examines how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and the potential roles for the federal government 's involvement in pfs projects . to address these objectives , gao reviewed relevant literature on pfs ; selected 10 pfs projects that reflected a variety of policy areas and were in different stages of implementation in state and local governments in the united states and the united kingdom , where pfs originated ; reviewed key documents and interviewed stakeholders from organizations that played a role in the selected projects ; and reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the eight federal agencies that participated in an informal pfs working group . pay for success ( pfs ) , also known as social impact bonds , is a new contracting mechanism to fund prevention programs , where investors provide capital to implement a social service â€” for example , to reduce recidivism by former prisoners . if the service provider achieves agreed upon outcomes , the government pays the investor , usually with a rate of return , based on savings from decreased use of more costly remedial services , such as incarceration . stakeholders from the 10 pfs projects in gao 's study said that pfs offers potential benefits to all parties in the project . for example , governments can implement prevention programs that potentially lead to reduced spending on social services and transfer the risk of failing to achieve outcomes to investors . the pfs projects in gao 's review sought to manage potential risks in the feasibility assessment , design , and implementation of complex pfs contracts . for example , without safeguards , there is a risk that paying for outcomes could create perverse incentives , such as focusing on individuals who are easiest to serve rather than those most in need . to address this risk , pfs contracts included various provisions , such as only including those with the greatest need in the evaluation that determines if the government makes payments . to date , federal government involvement in pfs has been limited . the office of management and budget ( omb ) has encouraged agencies to explore the use of pfs as appropriate . potential roles federal agencies could play in pfs projects include making outcome payments or helping build capacity . we have previously reported that collaborative mechanisms , such as interagency groups , can be used to implement programs and share information . however , a formal mechanism for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs does not exist . given the evolving nature of pfs , a mechanism for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs would increase access to leading practices . to identify and broadly disseminate information on leading practices and lessons learned , the director of omb should establish a formal means for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs . omb concurred with this recommendation and is working with agencies to explore options for collaboration .
