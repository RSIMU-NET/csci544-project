the department of veterans affairs ( va ) and the department of defense ( dod ) have a long history of partnering to achieve more cost - effective use of health care resources . their partnerships have evolved to include joint ventures -- joint efforts to construct or share medical facilities . va has maintained eight joint ventures with dod across the country . va has also developed partnerships , or affiliations , with university medical schools to obtain health care services for veterans and provide training to medical residents . va has not entered into a joint venture with an academic affiliate to date . however , several proposals for such joint ventures have surfaced in the last decade . this congressionally requested report discusses the potential benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures and the extent to which they are documented and measured , lessons learned from existing and proposed va joint ventures , and steps va has taken to evaluate proposed joint ventures . to address these issues , gao conducted site visits to and interviews with officials from all existing and proposed joint venture sites . va and dod officials identified a number of potential benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures , but they have not routinely or comprehensively documented and measured them . among the potential benefits , va and dod officials and academic affiliate representatives cited improved access to care , lower or avoided costs , and improved training opportunities . while the identified benefits are many , these officials and representatives also cited a number of concerns associated with joint ventures , such as potential conflicts of missions and cultures , a loss of organizational identity and control , staffing uncertainties , and financial risks . although able to provide anecdotal information of the benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures , officials at the joint ventures do not use performance measures to routinely or comprehensively document and assess the outcomes of the joint ventures . without such efforts , it is difficult to know to what extent these benefits and concerns have materialized . va also does not use performance measures at the department level to determine what is being achieved through the joint ventures -- thereby making it difficult to determine the overall outcomes of the joint ventures and to hold joint venture partners accountable for results . officials from va and dod and representatives from academic affiliates identified several lessons they have learned from their experiences with the existing and proposed joint ventures . these lessons include the importance of establishing joint committees to work through issues , communicating frequently with their partners , securing leadership buy - in and support at all levels , developing contingency plans , allowing adequate time to implement change , and establishing clear roles and responsibilities . for example , at most va - dod joint venture sites , officials have created jointly staffed committees to tackle specific issues , such as clinical , financial , and information management . also , in new orleans , louisiana , va and its academic affiliate signed a memorandum of understanding that , among other things , identifies the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the proposed joint venture negotiations . va has taken steps to enhance its process for evaluating proposed joint ventures , but additional efforts are warranted . in response to our previous recommendations , va developed and issued criteria for evaluating joint venture proposals in november 2007. in addition , va established working groups in charleston , south carolina , and new orleans to examine joint venture proposals with academic affiliates . however , va 's criteria for evaluating joint venture proposals are not sufficiently specific , in terms of both the definition and the application of the criteria . as a result , va 's evaluations of joint venture proposals could be inconsistent and , therefore , may not serve as a reliable guide for federal investments in joint ventures . in addition , the criteria are not tailored to take into account differences in prospective joint venture partners to ensure that va applies the appropriate level of review and scrutiny to proposals .
