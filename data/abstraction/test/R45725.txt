the jones act , which refers to section 27 of the merchant marine act of 1920 ( p.l . 66-261 ) , requires that vessels transporting cargo from one u.s. point to another u.s. point be u.s. - built , and owned and crewed by u.s. citizens . the act provides a significant degree of protection for u.s. shipyards , domestic carriers , and american merchant sailors . it is a subject of debate because some experts point out that it leads to high domestic ocean shipping costs and constrains the availability of ships for domestic use . the jones act has come into prominence amid debates over puerto rico 's economic challenges and recovery from hurricane maria in 2017 ; in the investigation into the sinking of the ship el faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015 ; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas . the law 's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the administration develop a national maritime strategy , including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance u.s. shipbuilding capability . the jones act of 1920 was not the first law requiring that vessels transporting cargo domestically be u.s. - built , owned , and crewed . it restated a long - standing restriction that was temporarily suspended during world war i. since 1920 , congress has enacted provisions that could be said to tighten jones act requirements as well as provisions that exempt certain maritime activity from the requirements . in 1935 , congress forbade jones act - qualified vessels that were sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign flag to subsequently requalify as jones act - eligible ( p.l . 74-191 ) . this provides additional protection from competition for jones act carriers if coastal shipping demand increases , because it can take around two years to construct a new ship . in 1940 , congress expanded the jones act to include towing and salvage vessels ( p.l . 76-599 ) . in 1988 , congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material required use of a jones act - qualified vessel , such that transport of dredge spoil or municipal waste would fall under the law ( p.l . 100-329 ) . generally , dredging and towing vessels , as well as great lakes ships , have occasioned less debate about the jones act than oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels . congress has enacted numerous exemptions or exceptions to the jones act . in some cases , congress has enacted an exemption if there are no jones act - qualified carriers interested in providing service in a particular market ( for example , passenger travel to and from puerto rico ) . congress has allowed waivers of the jones act for national defense reasons , which most often have been executed to speed fuel deliveries to a region after a natural disaster disrupted normal supply lines . regulatory interpretations of the jones act have been significant in defining what constitutes a `` u.s. - built '' vessel , what constitutes `` transportation '' between two u.s. points , and what are `` u.s . points . . the coast guard has determined that a u.s. - built vessel can be assembled with major foreign components such as engines , propellers , and stern and bow sections . this interpretation has been consistent from the late 1800s . customs and border protection ( cbp ) has determined that cruise ship voyages that involve visits to foreign ports in addition to a domestic port are not domestic transportation and therefore not subject to the jones act . this interpretation also dates to the late 1800s . cbp 's interpretations of what constitutes domestic transportation and u.s. points are significant to the offshore oil industry , as some of the vessels supporting that industry must be jones act - compliant while others need not be . by long - standing agreement , the military is to utilize u.s. - flag commercial ships for sealift before it utilizes government - owned vessels in its reserve fleet . jones act mariners are expected to crew sealift ships when needed , and thus the decades - long shrinkage of the oceangoing jones act fleet and mariner pool has been raised as a concern . the department of defense is planning to buy more used foreign - built ships for sealift rather than building them in the united states for cost reasons . it also has found that repairing its current fleet in u.s. shipyards is three times more expensive and has taken twice as long as estimated . much of the commercial fleet is relatively old , raising safety concerns . some useful types of ships are missing from the jones act - qualified fleet , such as heavy - lift vessels , liquefied natural gas ( lng ) tankers , and deepwater offshore construction vessels . both situations appear to some observers to be contrary to the policy goal of the jones act , which is to `` have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in times of war or national emergency . .
