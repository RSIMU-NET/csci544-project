hospitals must meet certain conditions of participation established by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) in order to receive medicare payments . in 2003 , most hospitals -- over 80 percent -- demonstrated compliance with most of these conditions through accreditation from the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) . established in 1986 , joint commission resources , inc. ( jcr ) , a nonprofit affiliate of the joint commission , provides consultative technical assistance services to hospitals . both organizations acknowledge the need to ensure that jcr 's services do not -- and are not perceived to -- affect the independence of the joint commission 's accreditation process . gao was asked to provide information on the relationship between the joint commission and jcr . this report describes their organizational relationship , and the significant steps they have taken to prevent the improper sharing of information , obtained through their accreditation and consulting activities , respectively , since jcr was established . gao reviewed pertinent documents , including conflict - of - interest policies and information about the organizations ' financial relationship , and interviewed staff and board members from both organizations , jcr clients , and cms officials . the joint commission and jcr have a close relationship as demonstrated through their governance structure and operations . the joint commission has substantial control over jcr and the two organizations provide operational services to one another . for example , jcr manages all joint commission publications , while the joint commission provides support services to jcr . despite the joint commission 's control over jcr , the two organizations have taken steps designed to protect facility - specific information . in 1987 , the organizations created a firewall -- policies designed to establish a barrier between the organizations to prevent improper sharing of this information . for example , the firewall is intended to prevent jcr from sharing the names of hospital clients with the joint commission . beginning in 2003 , both organizations began taking steps intended to strengthen this firewall , such as enhancing monitoring of compliance . ensuring the independence of the joint commission 's accreditation process is vitally important . to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , it would be prudent for the joint commission and jcr to continue to assess the firewall and other related mechanisms . the joint commission agreed with gao 's concluding observations . cms did not comment on gao 's findings or concluding observations . both provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
