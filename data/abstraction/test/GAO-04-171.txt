microenterprises -- small businesses owned and operated by poor entrepreneurs -- have potential to help the world 's poorer populations . for this reason , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) included microenterprise development in its programming . in 2001 , the agency reported that its was conducting microenterprise projects in 52 countries and had obligated almost $ 2 billion since 1988 to support its program . the program supports micro loans , among other services , to assist poor entrepreneurs . since 1996 , usaid has annually reported the program 's results . to help congress oversee usaid 's management of its microenterprise development program , gao was asked to determine the extent to which the agency 's microfinance activities are meeting the program 's key objectives , assess the reliability of usaid 's reporting on its overall microenterprise activities , and examine the agency 's role in identifying and disseminating microenterprise best practices . usaid 's microfinance activities have met some , but not all , of the agency 's microenterprise program objectives . these objectives are to reduce poverty among participants ; target the poor and very poor ; encourage women 's participation ; and develop sustainable microfinance institutions ( mfi ) . first , regarding reducing poverty -- defined as alleviating its impacts or lifting and keeping a large number of people above the poverty line -- gao found that microfinance can help alleviate some impacts of poverty , incrementally improving borrowers ' income levels and quality of life and offering an important coping mechanism to poor workers and their families . however , there is little evidence that it can lift and keep many over the poverty line . second , microfinance generally has served the poor clustered around the poverty line but not the very poor . third , usaid has successfully encouraged the participation of women , who have comprised about two - thirds of micro loan clients since 1997. fourth , usaid has emphasized the importance of mfi sustainability . in fiscal 2001 , of 294 usaid - supported mfis that reported on sustainability , 38 percent reported achieving full sustainability -- a percentage consistent since 1999. the basic data in usaid 's microenterprise results reporting ( mrr ) system are reliable , but certain methodological problems may affect the accuracy of some of the agency 's reporting on key program objectives . specifically , usaid may not be reporting accurately the amounts it has obligated to microenterprise activities ; whether 50 percent of its resources went to the very poor , as required by congress ; and the sustainability of usaid - supported institutions . further , although the agency reports annually on the activities of institutions it supports , it does not show the percentage of those institutions ' total funding that its contribution represents . usaid has identified and disseminated microenterprise best practices , providing information to its missions and implementing partners through policy guidance , training , and technical assistance . in addition , usaid has collaborated with microenterprise development provider networks and others to publish information about these practices .
