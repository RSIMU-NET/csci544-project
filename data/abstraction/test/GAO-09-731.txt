in 2004 , the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) estimated that 29,400 deaths in the united states were related to consumer products . as required under section 107 of the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 , this study reviews what is known about the relative incidence of preventable injuries and deaths among minority children associated with products intended for children 's use and also examines what actions cpsc has taken through its public information and education initiatives to minimize these injuries and deaths . to address these issues , we assessed injury and death data sources used by cpsc , compared cpsc 's consumer education efforts with key practices , and interviewed federal officials and groups representing the health and consumer interests of minority populations . few studies have assessed racial and ethnic differences in child death rates from injuries related to consumer products , and cpsc has not analyzed whether specific racial or ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by product hazards because of data limitations . these limitations include incomplete and inconsistent race and ethnicity data on emergency room reports and the inconsistent presence of product - related information on death certificates . in 2007 , race and ethnicity data were not coded in about 31 percent of cases in cpsc 's national electronic injury surveillance system ( neiss ) , which collects data from a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency rooms . in addition , the hospitals that do record race and ethnicity information in cpsc 's neiss system do so inconsistently , in part because of limited cpsc guidance . while death certificates may include more complete race and ethnicity information compared with nonfatal injury data from hospitals , related product information is not consistently documented on the certificates . despite this lack of data , cpsc has developed or modified some consumer information efforts to reach specific minority populations , but it has not assessed the results of these efforts . cpsc provides information in spanish for many of its outreach efforts , including its telephone hotline , web site , television , radio , and print publications . cpsc has also identified and established relationships with other organizations to help disseminate consumer safety information to minority communities . and while cpsc has used some consumer input to develop safety information , it has not assessed outreach efforts for specific audiences . cpsc has also established goals for its overall consumer information efforts , but not for its messages targeted to specific populations . in addition , cpsc relies on its neighborhood safety network , a group of organizations that have expressed interest in receiving product safety information , to share information with audiences that can be hard to reach , but the agency has not assessed whether these populations are receiving and using the information . organizations we contacted for this report , including neighborhood safety network members and children 's safety groups , generally reported using safety information provided by cpsc , but some offered suggestions for improvement of efforts to reach minority communities , such as providing safety information in other languages and additional exposure through broadcast media .
