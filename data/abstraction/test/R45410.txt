the violence against women act ( vawa ; title iv of p.l . 103-322 ) was originally enacted in 1994. it addressed congressional concerns about violent crime , and violence against women in particular , in several ways . it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders ; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses ; and authorized grants to state , local , and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women , among other things . vawa has been reauthorized three times since its original enactment . most recently , congress passed and president obama signed the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-4 ) , which reauthorized most vawa programs through fy2018 , among other things . the fundamental goals of vawa are to prevent violent crime ; respond to the needs of crime victims ; learn more about crime ; and change public attitudes through a collaborative effort by the criminal justice system , social service agencies , research organizations , schools , public health organizations , and private organizations . the federal government tries to achieve these goals primarily through federal grant programs that provide funding to state , tribal , territorial , and local governments ; nonprofit organizations ; and universities . vawa programs generally address domestic violence , sexual assault , dating violence , and stalking — crimes for which the risk of victimization is highest for women — although some vawa programs address additional crimes . vawa grant programs largely address the criminal justice system and community response to these crimes , but certain programs address prevention as well . the office on violence against women ( ovw ) administers the majority of vawa - authorized programs , while other federal agencies , including the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the office of justice programs ( ojp ) , also manage vawa programs . since its creation in 1995 through fy2018 , ovw has awarded more than $ 8 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to state , tribal , and local governments , nonprofit organizations , and universities . in fy2019 , approximately $ 559 million was appropriated for vawa - authorized programs administered by ovw , ojp , and cdc . while several extensions of authorization for vawa were provided through fy2019 continuing appropriations , authorizations for appropriations for all vawa programs have since expired . however , all vawa programs funded in fy2018 have been funded in fy2019 ( select programs at slightly higher levels ) , and thus far it appears that the expiration of authorizations has not impacted the continuing operation of vawa programs . the administration has requested fy2020 funding for all vawa - authorized programs funded in fy2019 . there are several issues that congress may consider in efforts to reauthorize vawa . these include , but are not limited to , improvements to data collection on domestic violence and stalking or the rape kit backlog ; assessing the implementation and future direction of tribal jurisdiction over non - tribal members , including potentially adding new crimes under vawa ; new approaches for law enforcement in assisting victims ; and enforcement of the federal prohibition on firearms for those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and those who are subject to a domestic violence protective order . congress may also consider further changes to vawa programs . in the 116th congress , the house passed the violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r . 1585 ) . among other things , it would reauthorize funding for vawa programs and authorize new programs ; amend and add definitions used for vawa programs ; amend federal criminal law relating to firearms , custodial rape , and stalking ; and expand tribal jurisdiction over certain crimes committed on tribal lands .
