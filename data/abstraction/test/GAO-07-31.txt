the united nations ( un ) estimated in 2005 that renovating its headquarters will cost up to $ 1.75 billion . as the un 's host country and largest contributor , the united states has a substantial interest in the project 's success . in this report , we determine whether the development of the capital master plan ( cmp ) has been consistent with leading industry practices , examine factors that led to changes in the cost estimate and determine whether the 2005 estimate was updated using industry practices , review the status of financing of the renovation , identify decisions needed for the renovation to proceed , and review un oversight and state monitoring efforts . to address these objectives , we reviewed un design and planning documents , including the latest cost estimate , to compare them with industry standards . to assess oversight , we reviewed office of internal oversight services ( oios ) and un board of auditors reports and met with un officials . un officials continue to use leading industry practices in developing the un headquarters renovation project , but reliance on existing un procurement practices could impact the effective implementation of the renovation in the future . since the cmp office relies on current un procurement practices , implementation of future cmp procurements could become vulnerable to numerous un procurement weaknesses that gao previously reported in april 2006 ( gao - 06-577 ) , such as the lack of guidance for construction procurement in the procurement manual . the estimated total cost of the cmp increased from about $ 1.19 billion to almost $ 1.75 billion between 2002 and 2005 to reflect inflation arising from a later start date , refinements to the design , and a change in the renovation approach . the un continued to follow construction industry practices to develop the 2005 cost estimate and has included expected elements . however , the cost estimate is still preliminary and will likely change . while the un has passed a resolution expressing a preference for cash assessments , it has yet to decide how to finance the remaining renovation costs . in june 2006 , the general assembly passed a resolution stating that a cash payment option would be the simplest and most cost - effective approach for funding the cmp . under this approach , the un would assess member states for the cost of the renovation through single - or multiyear payments . the amount the un assessed member states would be likely based on each country 's rate for its annual regular budget contributions . the general assembly plans to revisit the financing issue by the end of 2006. without certain general assembly decisions by the end of 2006 , the renovation 's current schedule could be delayed and costs could increase . specifically , a general assembly decision on a financing arrangement for the total cmp budget would be needed to ensure that funds could be available by december 2007. without these decisions , the cmp office can not finalize a start date for the renovation . un oversight entities have continued to oversee the cmp while the department of state has monitored its progress . oios has conducted audits on cmp procurements and has issued several reports of its findings and recommendations . however , oios relies on funds from the cmp budget and must negotiate for those funds with the un budget office , which may impair its ability to secure sufficient funds . the un board of auditors has also conducted oversight of the cmp office by reviewing its financial records and internal controls and has found no material weaknesses in its review . similarly , state 's monitoring efforts have not identified any significant concerns , according to state officials .
