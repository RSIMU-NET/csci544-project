in may 2013 , a truck carrying an oversize load crashed into an interstate bridge in washington state causing it to collapse . this crash raised issues about oversize vehicles and public safety . dot develops regulations on vehicle size and weight , and states enforce these standards with some oversight from dot . states also issue their own regulations on vehicle size and weight and issue permits for oversize and overweight vehicles . the joint explanatory statement of the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 required gao to review the role of federal and state agencies in overseeing oversize vehicles . this report discusses how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and how states regulate oversize vehicles . gao collected information from 50 states and the district of columbia about their permitting practices ; reviewed relevant federal legislation and dot regulations and documents ; and interviewed dot and state officials from a non - generalizable sample of 10 states , chosen based on a variety of considerations , including geographic diversity and types of permitting requirements . the department of transportation 's ( dot ) federal highway administration ( fhwa ) has established some federal vehicle size and weight requirements and oversees some state activities . based on current legislation , fhwa has established rules and regulations for vehicle width , truck trailer length , and vehicle weight standards for certain federal - aid highways aimed at protecting highways and bridges from damage while providing a safe and efficient highway network . fhwa does not , however , have the authority to establish a height requirement , a decision that goes back to the interstate system 's construction in the 1950 's , when height clearances already varied from state to state . fhwa also oversees states ' processes for enforcing these standards by reviewing states ' documentation of enforcement operations . however , fhwa has more limited involvement in individual states ' permitting processes and requirements , which the agency considers largely a state matter . for example , it does not provide technical assistance on permitting to states . state laws and regulations set varying size and weight limits and permitting requirements for vehicles that exceed these limits and that operate on highways and bridges . specifically , gao found that the vehicle size and weight limits set by state laws and regulations vary by state , although they are within the parameters of federal requirements . for example , states ' length standards vary between the minimum federal standard of 48 feet and 65 feet for a semitrailer . gao also found that permitting practices for oversize vehicles often vary by state . in some cases , states follow similar practices ; for example , most states make use of online permitting systems and escort vehicles that travel with an oversize or overweight vehicle . however , other permitting practices vary by state â€” such as states ' use of automated routing systems to provide a route for oversize vehicles . a national transportation safety board investigation reported that differences among states on the various aspects of truck permitting could be a safety concern . state officials gao interviewed did not always agree on the benefits of the various permitting practices , and some spoke of the need for more information on this topic . while fhwa is conducting some research on the potential effect of changes to truck size and weight limits and working with the trucking industry to update a best practices guide on escort vehicle operations , it has not studied permitting best practices across states due to lack of authority over state permitting . in gao 's prior work on improving agency performance , gao found that identifying best practices can help identify changes that might be needed to improve performance . by conducting this type of research , fhwa would be better positioned to help states make sound decisions to improve safety and protect infrastructure . gao recommends that dot conduct a study on states ' oversize - and overweight - permitting practices , including automated vehicle routing and escort driver certification , to identify areas of best practice and share the results with states . dot agreed with gao 's recommendation and provided clarifying comments , which gao incorporated .
