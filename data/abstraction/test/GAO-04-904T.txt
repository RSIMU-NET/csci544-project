since the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 , the national capital region ( ncr ) , comprising jurisdictions including the district of columbia and surrounding jurisdictions in maryland and virginia , has been recognized as a significant potential target for terrorism . gao was asked to report on what federal funds have been allocated to ncr jurisdictions for emergency preparedness ; what challenges exist within ncr to organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs ; what gaps , if any , remain in the emergency preparedness of ncr ; and what has been the role of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) in ncr to date . in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 , grant programs administered by the departments of homeland security , health and human services , and justice awarded about $ 340 million to eight ncr jurisdictions to enhance emergency preparedness . of this total , the office for national capital region coordination ( oncrc ) targeted all of the $ 60.5 million urban area security initiative funds for projects designed to benefit ncr as a whole . however , there was no coordinated regionwide plan for spending the remaining funds ( about $ 279.5 million ) . local jurisdictions determined the spending priorities for these funds and reported using them for emergency communications and personal protective equipment and other purchases . ncr faces several challenges in organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs , including the lack of a coordinated strategic plan for enhancing ncr preparedness , performance standards , and a reliable , central source of data on funds available and the purposes for which they were spent . without these basic elements , it is difficult to assess first responder capacities , identify first responder funding priorities for ncr , and evaluate the effectiveness of the use of federal funds in enhancing first responder capacities and preparedness in a way that maximizes their effectiveness in improving homeland security .
