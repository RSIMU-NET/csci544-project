the number of older adults , those over age 65 , is expected to nearly double in the united states by 2050. when an older adult becomes incapable of making informed decisions , a guardianship may be necessary . generally , guardianships are legal relationships created when a state court grants one person or entity the authority and responsibility to make decisions in the best interest of an incapacitated individual — which can include an older adult — concerning his or her person or property . while many guardians act in the best interest of persons under guardianship , some have been reported to engage in the abuse of older adults . gao was asked to review whether abusive practices by guardians are widespread . this report describes what is known about the extent of elder abuse by guardians ; and what measures federal agencies and selected state and local guardianship programs have taken to help protect older adults with guardians . gao reviewed relevant research , reports , studies , and other publications issued by organizations with expertise on elder abuse and guardianship issues . gao also conducted interviews with various guardianship stakeholders including federal agencies such as hhs , six selected state courts , and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in guardianship - related issues . in addition , gao identified eight closed cases of abuse by guardians in which there was a criminal conviction or finding of civil or administrative liability to use as nongeneralizable illustrative examples . gao makes no recommendations in this report . the extent of elder abuse by guardians nationally is unknown due to limited data on key factors related to elder abuse by a guardian , such as the numbers of guardians serving older adults , older adults in guardianships , and cases of elder abuse by a guardian . court officials from six selected states gao spoke to noted various data limitations that prevent them from being able to provide reliable figures about elder abuse by guardians , including incomplete information about the ages of individuals with guardians . officials from selected courts and representatives from organizations gao spoke to described their observations about elder abuse by a guardian , including that one of the most common types appeared to be financial exploitation . some efforts are under way to try to collect better data on elder abuse and guardianship at the federal , state , and local levels to support decision making and help prevent and address elder abuse by guardians . for example , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) plans to launch the national adult maltreatment reporting system — a national reporting system based on data from state adult protective services ( aps ) agency information systems by early 2017. according to hhs and its contractor , this system has the capability to collect information that could specifically help identify cases of elder abuse where a guardian was involved . gao also identified state and local initiatives to capture key data points and complaint data as well as identify “ red flags ” such as unusually high guardian fees or excessive vehicle or dining expenses . the federal government does not regulate or directly support guardianship , but federal agencies may provide indirect support to state guardianship programs by providing funding for efforts to share best practices and facilitate improved coordination , as well as by sharing information that state and local entities can use related to guardianship . state and local courts have primary responsibility over the guardianship process and , as such , have a role in protecting older adults with guardians from abuse , neglect , and exploitation . measures taken by selected states to help protect older adults with guardians vary but generally include screening , education , monitoring , and enforcement .
