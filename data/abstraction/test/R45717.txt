the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking . addressing a federal budget deficit that is unsustainable over the long run involves choices . fundamentally , the issues require deciding what government goods , services , and transfers are worth paying taxes for . most people would agree that the country benefits from a wide range of government services — air traffic controllers , border security , courts and corrections , and so forth — provided by the federal government . yet federal government provision of goods and services comprises only a modest portion of the federal budget . transfers , including interest payments , accounted for around 75 % of the federal budget . central findings of this analysis include the following : a comparatively small share of federal spending is for the direct provision of domestic government goods and services . transfers and payments to persons and to state and local governments constitute most of federal spending , about 75 % of all federal spending . defense spending , accounting for about 15 % of federal spending , has declined as a share of output over the past 35 years , but it also tends to vary depending , in part , on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts . the problem with the debt lies not in the past but in the future , as growth in spending for health and social security is projected to continue faster than the economy as a whole . the increase in deficits and debt , in turn , leads to a significant increase in interest payments . because much of the pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in social security and medicare part a ( hospital insurance ) trust funds , keeping these funds and their sources of financing intact is a concern that could constrain choices . preserving entitlements would likely require significant increases in taxes , such as raising rates , reducing tax expenditures , increasing other taxes , or introducing new revenue sources . reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level , so limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending , including entitlement programs such as social security , medicare , and medicaid . because the federal government provides about one - fifth of the revenue for state and local governments , cutbacks in transfers to these governments may , in part , shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services .
