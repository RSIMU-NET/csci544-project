the workforce investment act of 1998 ( wia , p.l . 105-220 ) is the primary federal law that provides job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals , including vulnerable young people with barriers to employment . all youth job training programs and related services are authorized under title i of wia and administered by the department of labor ( dol ) . these programs include the wia youth activities formula program , job corps , and youthbuild . the job corps program was established in the 1960s and is the oldest federal job training and employment program ( among recent programs ) for young people . under the pilot and demonstration authority in title i , dol has also carried out the reintegration of ex - offenders program for both youth and adults . although the programs have distinct activities and goals , each of them seeks to connect eligible youth to educational and employment opportunities , as well as leadership development and community service activities . wia authorized funding through september 30 , 2003 ; however , wia programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts . both the senate and house of representatives have taken steps toward reauthorizing wia since the 108th congress . this report provides an overview of issues that have been raised by stakeholders about youth programs authorized under wia . first , some policy makers have proposed consolidating these and other workforce programs to make them more efficient and less costly . other stakeholders assert that at - risk youth and other groups with barriers to employment would be overlooked under such a consolidation . another issue is the perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems that serve youth , such as the education system . stakeholders have suggested that greater coordination can help meet the varied needs of youth , as intended by wia . members of congress and others have also continued to inquire about the effectiveness of programs that serve youth in meeting their objectives and serving the most at - risk youth . to date , only an impact evaluation of job corps has been completed ; however , dol recently awarded a contract to a social policy research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of youthbuild . in addition to these broader issues , congress is interested in issues specific to youth activities and job corps . youth activities provides funding for youth employment and training services overseen by a state workforce investment board ( wib ) and the governor , in coordination with local wibs and community organizations . the program targets youth ages 14 through 21 who are low - income and have one or more barriers to employment . since the start of the program , policy makers and others have considered the extent to which youth have had to prove their eligibility for the program . some local workforce investment boards have reported challenges with documenting income and other eligibility criteria , and some proposals would establish different methods for determining eligibility . further , stakeholders have raised issues about whether the program should focus more on out - of - school youth . local workforce investment boards have reported challenges recruiting and retaining these youth . related to this is the age of youth who ought to be eligible for the program . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l . 111-5 ) temporarily enabled youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the program . whether wia ought to target these older youth , particularly in light of the possible cost of doing so , could be addressed in any reauthorization legislation . congress has considered proposals to provide federal funding for states to operate job corps centers , as a state option , or to close centers . this is due to concerns that the program has had mixed performance outcomes , and that some centers are low performing . this report accompanies two crs reports â€” crs report r40929 , vulnerable youth : employment and job training programs , and archived crs report r40830 , vulnerable youth : federal policies on summer job training and employment , both by [ author name scrubbed ] .
