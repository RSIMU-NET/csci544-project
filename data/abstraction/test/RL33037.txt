federal farm support , food assistance , agricultural trade , marketing , and rural development policies are governed by a variety of separate laws . however , many of these laws periodically are evaluated , revised , and renewed through an omnibus , multi - year `` farm bill . . the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-171 ) was the most recent omnibus farm bill , and many of its provisions expire in 2007 , so reauthorization is expected to be addressed in the first session of the 110th congress . the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy — namely , the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers . however , farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid , conservation and environment , forestry , domestic food assistance ( primarily food stamps ) , agricultural credit , rural development , agricultural research and education , and marketing - related programs . often , such `` miscellaneous '' provisions as food safety , marketing orders , animal health and welfare , and energy are added . this omnibus nature of the farm bill creates a broad coalition of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that , individually , might not survive the legislative process . the scope and direction of a new farm bill may be shaped by such factors as financial conditions in the agricultural economy , competition among various interests , international trade obligations , and — possibly most important — a tight limit on federal funds . among the thorniest issues may be future farm income and commodity price support . questions of equity ( who should get aid and how much ) , program cost , conformance with wto trade obligations , effects on u.s. competitiveness in the global marketplace , and the unintended impacts of agricultural activities on the environment are among the considerations . the economic prosperity of the u.s. farm sector is heavily dependent upon exports , so the provisions of a new bill reauthorizing farm export and foreign food aid programs also will be of keen interest . moreover , the agricultural credit , research , conservation , domestic nutrition assistance , and rural development titles bring an array of interests into the debate , and their issues and concerns could prove equally contentious . several farm groups have strongly endorsed a continuation of current policies and programs . however , agriculture and rural interests not receiving much benefit from current programs oppose a simple extension and would like some of the spending to be aimed at solving their problems . furthermore , the secretary of agriculture has repeatedly stated that farm programs need to be made `` equitable , predictable and beyond challenge '' in the wto . this report will be updated as related developments transpire .
