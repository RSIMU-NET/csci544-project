the united states provides foreign assistance to latin american and caribbean nations to support development and other u.s. objectives . u.s. policymakers have emphasized different strategic interests in the region at different times , from combating soviet influence during the cold war to promoting democracy and open markets since the 1990s . the trump administration has sought to reduce foreign aid significantly and refocus u.s. assistance efforts in the region to address u.s. domestic concerns , such as irregular migration and transnational crime . fy2019 budget request for fy2019 , the trump administration requested $ 1.1 billion for latin america and the caribbean through foreign assistance accounts managed by the state department and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) . that amount would have been $ 581 million , or 34 % , less than the estimated $ 1.7 billion of u.s. assistance the region received in fy2018 . the proposal would have cut funding for every type of assistance and nearly every latin american and caribbean nation . the trump administration also proposed eliminating the inter - american foundation — a small , independent u.s. foreign assistance agency that promotes grassroots development in the region — and consolidating its programs into usaid . the administration 's efforts to scale back u.s. assistance could have significant implications for u.s. policy in latin america and the caribbean . faced with potential cuts , u.s. agencies could accelerate efforts to transition countries in the region away from traditional development assistance toward other forms of bilateral engagement . reductions in state department - managed security assistance could lead to the department of defense taking on a larger role in u.s. security cooperation . moreover , many argue that reductions in foreign aid , combined with other policy shifts , could contribute to a relative decline in u.s. influence in the region . legislative developments president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) , on february 15 , 2019. division f of the act — the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act , 2019 — includes funding for foreign assistance programs in latin america and the caribbean . the measure was preceded by three short - term continuing resolutions ( p.l . 115-245 , p.l . 115-298 , and p.l . 116-5 ) , which funded foreign assistance programs at the fy2018 level , and a 35-day lapse in appropriations from december 22 , 2018 , to january 25 , 2019. although the house and senate appropriations committees had approved their fy2019 foreign assistance appropriations measures ( h.r . 6385 and s. 3108 , respectively ) in june 2018 , neither bill received floor consideration prior to the end of the 115th congress . p.l . 116-6 and the accompanying joint explanatory statement do not specify appropriations levels for every latin american and caribbean nation . nevertheless , the amounts designated for key u.s. initiatives in central america , colombia , and mexico significantly exceed the administration 's request . the act provides $ 527.6 million to continue implementation of the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america , which is $ 92 million more than the administration requested but $ 99 million less than congress appropriated for the initiative in fy2018 . at least $ 418.3 million to support the peace process and security and development efforts in colombia , which is $ 153 million more than the administration requested and $ 27 million more than congress appropriated for colombia in fy2018 . $ 162.7 million to support security and rule - of - law efforts in mexico , which is $ 84 million more than the administration requested and $ 10 million more than congress appropriated for mexico in fy2018 .
