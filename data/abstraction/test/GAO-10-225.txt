the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) filing season is an enormous undertaking that includes processing tax returns , issuing refunds , and responding to taxpayer questions . irs 's efforts to ensure compliance begin during the filing season . gao was asked to assess irs 's 2009 filing season performance , identify ways to reduce taxpayers ' use of short - term , high - interest refund anticipation loans ( ral ) offered by paid preparers or banks , and identify ways to enhance compliance during processing . gao analyzed irs performance data , reviewed irs operations , interviewed irs officials , and reviewed its compliance programs and relevant statutes . irs processed 139 million returns and issued $ 298 billion in refunds as of october 2 , 2009. electronic filing , which provides irs with significant cost savings and taxpayers with faster refunds , increased to 68 percent of all returns filed . while taxpayers ' access to telephone assistors was better than last year , it remained lower than in 2007 in part because of calls about tax law changes . compared to 2005 through 2007 , irs reduced its goal for assistor answered calls in 2009 and set its 2010 goal at 71 percent . despite heavy call volume , the accuracy of irs responses to taxpayers ' questions remained above 90 percent . irs started a major data collection effort on why taxpayers call , but lacks a plan to analyze the data and improve telephone service . according to irs , issuing refunds faster reduces taxpayers ' use of rals , high - interest loans made by paid tax preparers or banks in anticipation of a refund . issuing refunds is a joint effort by irs , treasury 's financial management service , which checks for non - tax debt owed to the federal government , and the automated clearing house , which distributes funds . however , irs has not coordinated extensively with them to expedite refunds . further , irs has not studied the use of debit cards for unbanked taxpayers , which could also reduce taxpayers ' use of rals by providing faster and more secure refunds . irs automatically identifies and corrects select types of errors while processing tax returns . it could also correct tax returns that claim the hope credit , a tax credit to help offset qualified education expenses , for longer than the number of years allowed . however , irs lacks the authority to use prior years ' tax return information for this purpose . also , information reported by education institutions to taxpayers and irs about qualifying educational expenses on the form 1098-t is confusing for taxpayers and not useful for irs . many institutions report the total amount billed to students , but not what is actually paid after taking into account scholarships and grants . this results in some taxpayers under - claiming benefits , while others over - claim . finally , because form 1098-t can show the amount billed , which may not be the amount paid , irs is unable to use the information to automatically verify taxpayers ' claims for the credit through its computerized matching program .
