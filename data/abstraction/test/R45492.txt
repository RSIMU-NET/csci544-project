the 116th congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorization and funding of water resource development , management , and protection . congress engages in authorization and appropriations for water resource projects and activities of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) and the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) . usace constructs projects nationwide , primarily to improve navigation , reduce flood damage , and restore aquatic ecosystems . reclamation constructs projects in the 17 arid states west of the mississippi river ; these projects primarily provide water supply benefits , often to agricultural irrigation users . the 116th congress , like earlier congresses , also may consider indian water rights settlements and may evaluate the focus of and funding for the water resource science activities of the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) . development pressures , droughts and floods , and concerns about changing hydrology from land - use change and climate change have engendered nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects . stakeholders are interested in a range of water resource issues , including new water resource infrastructure ( e.g . , storm surge gates , water storage ) and new kinds of projects ( e.g . , groundwater recharge , nature - based flood risk reduction ) ; reinvestment in aging water resource infrastructure and use of water science and real - time monitoring and forecasting to improve infrastructure operations ; funding and financing of projects , and whether and how to shift from federally led projects to federal partnerships with state and / or local entities ; and activities to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems and enhance flood resilience ( including the use of nature - based approaches ) . some topics arise within the context of specific agencies . usace - related topics for the 116th congress may include funding and financing issues , such as use of the harbor maintenance trust fund ; the status of investments in projects to deepen coastal harbors ; usace budgeting priorities ; and oversight of usace efforts to implement public - private partnerships and develop alternative financing opportunities . some reclamation - related water project and management issues during the 116th congress may include the status of proposed new and augmented water storage projects , as well as efforts to address the agency 's aging infrastructure and transition certain qualifying projects to nonfederal ownership . congress also may address reclamation drought mitigation activities in the colorado river basin and other areas . in addition , congress may explore ongoing issues associated with reclamation 's project operations in california and other areas . it may address how these issues affect water deliveries to irrigation districts and municipalities and threatened and endangered species , among others . some topics are international in character . regarding freshwater bodies shared with canada , potential topics for the 116th congress include federal funding for activities supporting great lakes restoration and negotiations ( and any resulting agreements ) with canada to modify the columbia river treaty . potential topics related to mexico include oversight of a binational agreement on water sharing during dry conditions in the colorado river basin and mexico 's deliveries to the united states in the rio grande basin . crosscutting topics ( i.e . , topics relevant to multiple agencies and programs ) also are part of congressional water resource deliberations . for example , the 116th congress may consider the status and priority of new and ongoing federal efforts to restore large - scale aquatic ecosystems that have been altered or impaired by changes to their natural conditions ( e.g . , florida everglades , chesapeake bay ) . congress may explore the funding and performance of existing restoration efforts , including what changes ( if any ) may be necessary to improve project delivery and evaluation . the 116th congress may consider its guidance to multiple federal agencies on how to respond to flood hazards , including efforts related to enhancing the resilience of infrastructure and communities to flooding . there is interest in developing and evaluating approaches that protect natural elements that reduce flood risk ( e.g . , natural dunes ) or are `` nature - based '' in comprehensive flood risk management ( e.g . , constructed dunes ) . congress also may consider legislation and oversight on usace supplemental appropriations for response to and recovery from floods .
