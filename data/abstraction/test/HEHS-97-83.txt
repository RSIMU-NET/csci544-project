pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the military health services system 's ( mhss ) psychopharmacology demonstration project ( pdp ) , focusing on the : need for prescribing psychologists in the mhss ; implementation of the pdp ; and pdp 's costs and benefits . gao noted that : the mhss has more psychiatrists than it needs to meet its current and upcoming readiness requirements , according to gao 's analysis of the department of defense 's ( dod ) health care needs ; therefore , the mhss needs no prescribing psychologists or any other additional mental health care providers authorized to prescribe psychotropic medication ; moreover , dod does not even account for prescribing psychologists when determining its medical readiness needs ; although dod met its goal to train psychologists to prescribe drugs , it faced many difficulties in implementing the pdp ; not all of these were resolved ; for example , the mhss never had a clear vision of the prescribing psychologist 's role , did not meet recruitment goals , and repeatedly changed the curriculum ; consequently , the american college of neuropsychopharmacology recommended in 1995 that unless these issues were addressed , the pdp should end ; the total cost of the pdp , from start - up through the date the last participants will complete the program , is about $ 6.1 million or about $ 610,000 per prescribing psychologist , according to gao 's estimate ; ultimately , the pdp will have added 10 mental health care providers who can prescribe drugs to an mhss that already has a surplus of psychiatrists ; opinions differ on the effect of adding these prescribing psychologists to the mhss concerning such issues as quality of care and collaboration between psychologists and physicians ; without a clear purpose or role for prescribing psychologists and given the uncertainty about the extent to which they would replace higher cost providers , gao can not conclude that the benefits gained from training prescribing psychologists warrant the costs of the pdp ; and training psychologists to prescribe medication is not adequately justified because the mhss has no demonstrated need for them , the cost is substantial , and the benefits are uncertain .
