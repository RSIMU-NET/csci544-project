pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of commerce 's and the federal trade commission 's ( ftc ) controls over the acceptance and reporting of nonfederally reimbursed travel by their employees , focusing on : whether commerce and ftc met their review and reporting requirements ; and the implications of commerce denying the office of government ethics ( oge ) access to its records of reimbursed travel in 1992. gao found that : although commerce generally met applicable requirements for accepting and reporting travel reimbursements , certain procedural improvements could be implemented in the receipt and reporting of these funds ; commerce did not ensure that travel requests contained all of the required information , were prepared and reviewed before trips were approved , accurately disclosed the circumstances of each trip , or adequately documented the actual expenses reimbursed ; although ftc consistently met the requirements for controlling the acceptance and reporting of travel reimbursements by its employees , it could improve its reporting by better detailing the nature of events attended by ftc employees ; commerce 's decision to deny oge access to its travel records was based on its view that oge was not responsible for the applicable travel regulations ; and although commerce changed its position and acknowledged that oge did have the authority to review such records , the overall effect of commerce 's temporary denial of access was minimal .
