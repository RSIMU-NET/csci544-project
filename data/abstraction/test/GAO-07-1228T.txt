six years after the attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) , concerns persist about health effects experienced by wtc responders and the availability of health care services for those affected . several federally funded programs provide screening , monitoring , or treatment services to responders . gao has previously reported on the progress made and implementation problems faced by these wtc health programs . this testimony is based on and updates gao 's report , september 11 : hhs needs to ensure the availability of health screening and monitoring for all responders ( gao - 07-892 , july 23 , 2007 ) . in this testimony , gao discusses the status of services provided by the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) wtc federal responder screening program , efforts by the centers for disease control and prevention 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area , and niosh 's awards to wtc health program grantees for treatment services . in july 2007 , following a re - examination of the status of the wtc health programs , gao recommended that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the wtc attack , regardless of who their employer was or where they reside . as of early september 2007 the department has not responded to this recommendation . as gao reported in july 2007 , hhs 's wtc federal responder screening program has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of screening services for federal responders . from january 2007 to may 2007 , the program stopped scheduling screening examinations because there was a change in the program 's administration and certain interagency agreements were not established in time to keep the program fully operational . from april 2006 to march 2007 , the program stopped scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services associated with screening . niosh , the administrator of the program , has been considering expanding the program to include monitoring , that is , follow - up physical and mental health examinations , but has not done so . if federal responders do not receive monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in seven states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in may 2007 it took steps toward expanding the provider network . niosh has awarded treatment funds to four wtc health programs in the nyc area . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded $ 44 million for outpatient treatment and set aside $ 7 million for hospital care . the new york / new jersey wtc consortium and the new york city fire department wtc program , which received the largest awards , used niosh 's funding to continue outpatient services , offer full coverage for prescriptions , and cover hospital care .
