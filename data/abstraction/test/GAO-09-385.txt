as a separately organized agency within the department of energy , the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) administers the stockpile life extension program , whose purpose is to extend , through refurbishment , the operational lives of the weapons in the nuclear stockpile . nnsa encountered significant management problems with its first refurbishment for the w87 warhead . gao was asked to assess the extent to which nnsa and the department of defense ( dod ) have effectively managed the refurbishment of two other weapons -- the b61 bomb and the w76 warhead . this report summarizes the findings of gao 's classified report on the refurbishment of the b61 bomb and w76 warhead . nnsa and dod have not effectively managed cost , schedule , and technical risks for either the b61 or w76 life extension program . regarding the b61 program , although nnsa completed the refurbishment of the strategic variants of the b61 bomb -- the mods 7 and 11- - on schedule in november 2008 , the refurbished weapons do not meet all refurbishment objectives . according to nnsa and dod officials , nnsa established an unrealistic schedule and failed to fully implement its refurbishment guidance , known as the phase 6.x process . nnsa was able to meet its refurbishment schedule and avoid significant cost overruns for the b61 program only because some of the refurbishment objectives were changed , nnsa was able to reuse , rather than manufacture , a critical component when b61 bombs were decommissioned , and the nuclear weapons council significantly reduced the number of b61 bombs in the stockpile . despite dod concerns about the adequacy of nnsa testing of the b61 bombs under certain conditions , nnsa continued refurbishing the weapons . some of the b61 refurbishment problems could have been avoided if dod had fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in overseeing nnsa 's life extension program activities . for example , the air force did not adequately review nnsa 's design , engineering , and testing activities -- a review that would have alerted dod that nnsa was missing some of its refurbishment objectives . regarding the w76 program , nnsa did not effectively manage a high risk associated with manufacturing an essential material , known as fogbank , needed to refurbish the w76 warhead . nnsa had developed a risk mitigation strategy to avoid potential cost overruns and schedule delays related to the manufacture of this key material but failed to effectively implement this strategy . as a result , nnsa 's original plans to produce the first refurbished w76 weapon in september 2007 slipped to september 2008 ; nnsa spent $ 69 million to address fogbank production problems ; and the navy faced logistical challenges owing to the delay . furthermore , nnsa did not have a consistent approach to developing a cost baseline for the w76 program , which makes it difficult to track refurbishment costs over time and to know the actual cost of the program .
