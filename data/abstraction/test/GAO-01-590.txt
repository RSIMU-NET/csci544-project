the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , through the federal housing administration ( fha ) , insures billions of dollars in home mortgage loans made by private lenders . hud 's 2020 management reform plan , issued in 1997 , sought to downsize and reform the agency , including its single - family mortgage insurance program . as part of its 2020 plan , hud consolidated the single - family program 's field activities at four new regional homeownership centers and specified resources for the centers . although hud has substantially streamlined fha 's single - family mortgage insurance programs , human capital issues remain a concern . this report reviews hud 's implementation of the homeownership center concept under the 2020 plan , focusing on the deployment of center staff , the training provided to the center staff , and the centers ' monitoring of contractors . gao found that nearly half of the centers ' staff remain in 71 field offices across the country , even though hud envisioned that only a third of the staff would stay in the field offices . the deployment of staff across the centers is not consistent with their workload , and , as a result , the centers are having trouble supervising and making effective use of staff . gao also found that hud has not developed a standardized training curriculum for center staff . the centers have had difficulty using their training funds effectively because hud provided them late in the fiscal year and then pulled back some funds before they could be used . finally , increased responsibilities and staff shortage have caused the centers to expand their use of contractors . however , the centers ' ability to monitor contractors has not kept pace with their growing reliance on them .
