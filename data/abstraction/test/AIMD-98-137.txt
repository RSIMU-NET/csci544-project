pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the states ' fiscal decisions for the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant and whether states are taking steps to prepare for the effects of future economic downturns on their welfare programs , focusing on : how state budgetary resources , including federal aid , have been allocated since states have had access to tanf funds ; what plans states are making to ensure programmatic stability in times of fiscal and economic stress ; and the extent to which states have used , or plan to use , the program 's federal contingency fund for state welfare programs and the federal loans for state welfare programs ( loan fund ) which are available for downturns or other emergencies affecting states . gao noted that : more federal and state resources are available for states ' low - income family assistance programs since welfare reform passed in 1996 than would have been available under the previous system of financing welfare programs consolidated in the tanf block grant ; gao 's estimates showed that , taking caseload declines into account , 46 states would have more total resources -- both state and federal -- for their low - income family assistance programs than they would have had under the previous welfare programs ; states are transforming the nation 's welfare system into a work - focused , temporary assistance program for needy families and generally chose to spend these resources to expand programs and benefits by shifting the emphasis from entitlement to self - sufficiency , enhancing support services , and increasing work participation rates ; states also have achieved budgetary savings by reducing state funds to the statutory maintenance - of - effort level of 75 or 80 percent of previous state spending levels ; while states have gained greater resources under the block grant , they also take greater responsibilities for fiscal risks should program costs increase in the future ; most states , including 7 of the 10 gao visited , also have a general fund budget stabilization or rainy day funds that could be used to augment program spending during an economic downturn , but welfare programs would have to compete for these resources with other state funding priorities ; the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) includes features that could provide federal funding to cover future increases in program needs ; states can carry forward unused tanf funds without fiscal year limitation ; as of september 30 , 1997 , states had left about $ 1.2 billion in unspent balances in their accounts with the u.s treasury , or about 9 percent of the total grant ; it is unclear whether these balances will remain , shrink , or increase as states gain experience with the problem ; prwora also creates two federal safety - net mechanisms -- the contingency fund and the loan fund -- that were designed to provide states with access to additional funds during times of economic downturn or fiscal stress ; as of february 1998 , neither the contingency nor the loan funds had been used by any state ; officials in states gao visited said they did not view the contingency fund as a viable source of additional resources ; and officials in many states gao visited indicated they did not believe their states would borrow from the loan fund during an economic downturn .
