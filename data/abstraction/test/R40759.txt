using federally appropriated funds to procure commodities for international food aid in countries with emergency needs or in nearby countries is a controversial issue . in budget submissions for fy2006-fy2009 , the bush administration proposed allocating up to 25 % of the funds available for u.s. food aid ( title ii of p.l . 480 , or the food for peace act ) to local or regional procurement ( lrp ) of food aid commodities . each time congress rejected the proposal . the administration argued that lrp would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the u.s. response to overseas food emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by ocean carriers . congressional and other critics of the local procurement proposal maintain that allowing non - u.s. commodities to be purchased would undermine the coalition of commodity groups , agribusinesses , private voluntary organizations , and shippers that participate in and support the u.s. food aid program and would reduce the volume of u.s. commodities provided as aid . the united states is alone in providing practically all of its international food aid in the form of its own commodities . u.s. food aid legislation precludes the provision of any but u.s. commodities to meet international food aid needs . the foreign assistance act ( p.l . 87-195 ) , however , permits the use of some u.s. funds for lrp as part of the u.s. response to international disasters . the european union provides almost all of its food aid via the united nations world food program ( wfp ) in the form of cash ; canada 's food aid also is cash - based . the wfp has been using donor funding to procure commodities locally or regionally in developing countries for more than 30 years . several recent studies have evaluated the timeliness and cost - effectiveness of lrp versus commodity donations and conclude that lrp in sub - saharan africa ( ssa ) costs substantially less than shipping food aid from the united states to africa and that food aid delivery times are substantially shorter . the studies point to risks associated with lrp , including lack of reliable suppliers , poor infrastructure , weak legal systems , donor funding delays , and quality ( i.e . , food safety or nutrition ) considerations , that could impede the efficiency of lrp . on the other hand , the studies suggest that risks associated with lrp are no greater than risks associated with in - kind donations and that they could likely be countered with better market intelligence and effective management of lrp activities . one study suggests that in many food deficit situations , lrp may not be a feasible option . inadequate local supplies or adverse market effects on producers or consumers in a country or region could rule out using lrp . the u.s. department of agriculture has begun implementation of the pilot lrp program established in the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) . separately , the u.s. agency for international development is implementing lrp activities with funds appropriated in an fy2008 supplemental appropriations act ( p.l . 110-252 ) . in addition , the wfp has initiated a purchase for progress ( p4p ) program that will evaluate how small farmers in developing countries can participate in wfp procurement . the fy2010 foreign operations appropriation ( p.l . 111-117 ) includes funds in international disaster assistance appropriations that could be used to fund lrp and food - security - related activities such as cash vouchers or cash transfers for purchasing food . in addition , p.l . 111-117 directs that $ 1.17 billion of development assistance be allocated to agricultural development and food security efforts . proposed legislation , s. 384 and h.r . 3077 , would authorize a $ 500 million appropriation , separate from p.l . 480 food aid , for responding rapidly to emergency food needs , including with lrp . the fy2010 agriculture appropriations bill ( p.l . 111-80 ) provides $ 1.7 billion to finance provision of u.s. commodities under p.l . 480 .
