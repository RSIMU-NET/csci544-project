economic sanctions imposed by the united statesâthrough enacted legislation and executive actionâon iran , russia , and venezuela aim to pressure the ruling governments to change their behavior and policies . currently , these sanctions aim to either eliminate ( iran ) or restrict ( venezuela ) crude oil trade of as much as 3.3 million to 4.0 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , roughly 3 % - 4 % of global petroleum supply . estimated oil production volumes affected to date have been approximately 1.7 million bpd from iran . venezuela oil production has also likely been affected , although accurately quantifying volumes is difficult due to monthly oil production declines over a period of years prior to u.s. sanctions affecting oil trade in january 2019. sanctions imposed on russia 's oil sector generally target longer - term oil production and to date have not reduced russian oil supply or trade . oil production in russia has increased since oil - sector sanctions began in 2014 , although the country has arguably incurred economic costs in order to incentivize and support oil output levels . sanctions targeting iran 's oil sector date back to the 1980s and affect virtually every element of iran 's oil sector ( e.g . , investment , shipping , insurance , and exports ) . legislation enacted in 2011 ( p.l . 112-81 ) and 2013 ( p.l . 112-239 ) , along with subsequent executive orders ( e.o.s ) , created a sanctions framework designed to discourage oil importersâby sanctioning banks that transact with iran or facilitate oil transactions , as well as entities that buy iranian oilâfrom purchasing crude oil and other petroleum and petrochemical products from iran . iran oil export sanctions include design elements ( e.g . , significant reduction exceptions , requirements to certify oil markets are adequately supplied , and coordination with oil - producing countries ) intended to minimize oil price escalation that could result from sanctions - related oil supply reductions . iran oil export sanctions have been applied , waived , and reapplied since 2011. as of november 2019 , the trump administration 's stated goal has been to reduce iran 's oil exports to zero . trade data indicate that observed iranian crude oil exports declined by approximately 80 % between april 2018 and october 2019. should sanctions affecting iran 's oil exports be relieved or terminated , the reentry of 1 million to 2 million bpd of crude oil could , depending on market conditions and oil - producing country decisions , contribute to oil market oversupply that could lower oil prices . while u.s. petroleum product consumers may welcome such an outcome , severe and persistently low prices could have adverse effects on u.s. oil producers . oil sector sanctions imposed on russia via e.o . since 2014 , and codified ( p.l . 115-44 ) in 2017 , apply to certain russian oil companies and target two activities : ( 1 ) accessing debt finance , and ( 2 ) accessing oil exploration and production technology for deepwater , arctic offshore , and shale projects . near - term russian oil supply does not appear to have been affected by these sanctions to date ; oil production has increased since 2014. alternative financing , currency devaluation , and russia 's oil tax and export duty policies have provided russian companies with capital and incentives to increase oil production and exports . over the long term , russian oil output could be affected by oil production technology sanctions , as some european and u.s. companies have terminated participation in certain oil exploration and development projects . economic sanctions affecting venezuela 's oil trade are the product of e.o.s and u.s. department of the treasury designations in 2019 prohibiting transactions with petroleo s de venezuela s.a. ( pdvsa ) . petroleum trade between the united states and venezuela has been eliminated . as a result , venezuela has sought alternative buyers of crude oil previously destined for the united states and alternative suppliers of petroleum products previously sourced from u.s. exporters . although u.s. economic sanctions do not explicitly prohibit non - u.s. entities from trading oil and petroleum products with pdvsa , treasury has discretion to take action against foreign entities that provide material support to pdvsa . this sanctions framework element could make it difficult for pdvsa to secure alternative buyers and suppliers . rosneft , a russian - controlled oil company , has reportedly facilitated venezuelan crude oil trade with independent oil refiners in china and has provided venezuela with petroleum products previously sourced from u.s. suppliers . enacted legislation in the 116 th congress ( p.l . 116-94 ) requires the administration to coordinate venezuela sanctions with international partners and expresses concerns about certain pdvsa transactions with rosneft . sanctions - related oil supply constraints have affected oil production and trade . oil market characteristicsâgenerally inelastic supply and demand in the short termâcould contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both up and down ) when supply and demand are imbalanced by as little as 1 % to 2 % for a brief or sustained period . to date , persistently high crude oil prices have been moderated by several factors , including increasing u.s. oil production and exports , trade flow adjustments , expectations of slowing demand growth rates , and sanctions design elements . however , oil trade sanctions have affected price differentials for certain crude oil types ( e.g . , light vs. heavy ) .
