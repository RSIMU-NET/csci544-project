pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the status of states ' motor vehicle inspection programs , focusing on the : progress made by the 23 states that are required to implement enhanced inspection and maintenance ( i & m ) programs , including the difficulties that the states have encountered ; and impact that delays in implementing enhanced i & m programs may have on the states ' ability to comply with the national air quality standard for ozone . gao noted that : two of the 23 states had begun testing vehicles by the january 1995 deadline that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set for implementing enhanced i & m programs , and 12 had begun testing vehicles as of april 1998 ; a number of factors have contributed to delays in implementing programs ; opposition to epa 's enhanced i & m regulation -- including the reluctance of some state legislatures to provide the legislative authority and funding needed to implement these programs -- caused most of the 23 states to delay implementation ; in addition , the states had difficulty in obtaining new testing equipment and software support from vendors ; the delays in implementing enhanced i & m programs have jeopardized the states ' ability to meet the deadlines for attaining the national ozone standard ; epa has allowed the states to claim credit for future reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds ( voc ) from their enhanced i & m programs , provided they demonstrate that they will achieve the required reductions as soon as practical after november 1996 ; if states can not demonstrate that reductions in voc can be obtained from the mandatory enhanced inspection and maintenance programs , they may have to look to other mobile sources as well as stationary sources to meet their goals for reducing these emissions ; and however , achieving further reductions from other sources will be costly and take longer than achieving the reductions from enhanced inspection i & m programs .
