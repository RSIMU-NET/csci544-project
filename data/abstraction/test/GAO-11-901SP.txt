millions of americans rely on retirement savings plans for their financial well - being in retirement . plan sponsors are increasingly investing in assets such as hedge funds ( privately administered pooled investment vehicles that typically engage in active trading strategies ) and private equity funds ( privately managed investment pools that typically make long - term investments in private companies ) . given ongoing market challenges , it is important that plan fiduciaries apply best practices , and choose wisely when investing plans assets to ensure that plans are adequately funded to meet future promised benefits . this statement addresses what is known about the extent to which defined benefit plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , challenges that such plans face in investing in hedge funds and private equity , steps that plan sponsors can take to address these challenges , and the implications of these challenges for plan sponsors and the federal government . a growing number of private and public sector pension plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , but such investments generally constitute a small share of total plan assets . according to a survey of large plans , the share of plans with investments in hedge funds grew from 11 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010. over the same time period , investments in private equity were more prevalent but grew more slowly -- an increase from 71 percent of large plans in 2001 to 92 percent in 2010. still , the average allocation of plan assets to hedge funds was a little over 5 percent , and the average allocation to private equity was a little over 9 percent . available data also show that investments in hedge funds and private equity are more common among large pension plans , measured by assets under management , compared with midsize plans . survey information on smaller plans is unavailable , so the extent to which these plans invest in hedge funds or private equity is unknown . hedge funds and private equity investments pose a number of risks and challenges beyond those posed by traditional investments . for example , investors in hedge funds and private equity face uncertainty about the precise valuation of their investment . hedge funds may , for example , own thinly traded assets whose valuation can be complex and subjective , making valuation difficult . further , hedge funds and private equity funds may use considerable leverage -- the use of borrowed money or other techniques -- which can magnify profits , but can also magnify losses if the market goes against the fund 's expectations . also , both are illiquid investments -- that is they can not generally be redeemed on demand . finally , investing in hedge funds can pose operational risks -- that is , the risk of investment loss from inadequate or failed internal processes , people , and systems , or problems with external service providers rather than an unsuccessful investment strategy . plan sponsors gao spoke with address these challenges in a number of ways , such as through careful and deliberate fund selection , and negotiating key contract terms . for example , investors in both hedge funds and private equity funds may be able to negotiate fee structure and valuation procedures , and the degree of leverage employed . also , plans address various concerns through due diligence and monitoring , such as careful review of investment , valuation , and risk management processes . the department of labor ( labor ) has a role in helping to ensure that private plans fulfill their fiduciary duties , which includes educating employers and service providers about their fiduciary responsibilities under employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) . according to plan officials , state and federal regulators , and others , some pension plans , such as smaller plans , may have particular difficulties in addressing the various demands of hedge fund and private equity investing . in light of this , in 2008 , gao recommended that labor provide guidance on the challenges of investing in hedge funds and private equity and the steps plans should take to address these challenges . labor generally agreed with our recommendation , but has yet to take action . the agency explained that the lack of uniformity among these investments could complicate the development of comprehensive guidance for plan fiduciaries .
