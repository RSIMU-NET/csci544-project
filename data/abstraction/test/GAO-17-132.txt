in 2015 , more than 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving large trucks . to identify carriers with the highest crash risk , fmcsa uses information from roadside inspections and crashes to rank each carrier 's safety performance relative to other carriers in seven categories , including one on vehicle maintenance . some stakeholders have proposed a system for carriers or their drivers to self - report en route vehicle equipment problems to fmcsa . reported equipment problems that were repaired within a certain time period would not affect the carrier 's relative ranking , potentially incentivizing carriers to make repairs more quickly . the fixing america 's surface transportation act included a provision for gao to examine the cost and feasibility of establishing a system for carriers or drivers to self - report vehicle equipment problems to fmcsa . this report examines the potential safety impacts of a self - reporting system and factors that could affect its feasibility and cost . gao reviewed relevant regulations , information on other existing dot self - reporting systems , and prior related gao work . gao also interviewed a non - generalizable sample of representatives from six industry and safety associations , six carriers , and six drivers about this potential system for self - reporting equipment problems . gao selected carriers to include those with diverse fleet sizes and average distances traveled , and drivers from six additional carriers . dot provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . establishing a system that would provide incentives for trucking companies to self - report equipment problems may not necessarily yield safety benefits . most stakeholders gao interviewed — including selected carriers and drivers — thought a self - reporting system would be unlikely to produce safety benefits , stating that it would not incentivize quicker repairs . if repairs are not made more quickly , there would be no positive impact on safety . three drivers , however , thought a self - reporting system could yield some safety benefits if it incentivized drivers to do more thorough inspections of their vehicles . officials from industry groups and the federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) noted that a self - reporting system could negatively impact safety , such as by encouraging distracted driving if drivers report equipment problems on their cell phones while driving . moreover , estimating the potential safety impacts of such a system requires information that is not currently available , such as how equipment problems that would be permitted to be self - reported are related to crashes . example of a driver receiving a violation for a previously identified equipment problem under current system and under a self - reporting one fmcsa has the statutory and regulatory authority to establish a system for self - reporting equipment problems , and technology exists to create it , but its costs are unknown . also , establishing such a system could pose challenges for fmcsa , carriers , and drivers . for example , developing a new system could delay efforts fmcsa has under way to improve its information technology , and carriers or drivers may have difficulty selecting their specific equipment problem from the more than 300 potential vehicle maintenance violations . further , without information on key design features of a self - reporting system , such as whether reporting would be through a telephone hotline or a web - application , it is not possible to estimate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence . fmcsa developed a rough estimate that a self - reporting system would cost between $ 5 and $ 10 million to establish and operate for the first year .
