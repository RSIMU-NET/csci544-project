increasingly , congress and the bush administration are looking to utilize nonproliferation assistance programs , including cooperative threat reduction , to help reduce the risk of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) . in the fy2004 national defense authorization act ( p.l . 108-136 , sec . 1308 ) , congress authorized the bush administration to spend $ 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union . as of september 2006 , the administration had spent such funds only in albania ( $ 38.5 million ) for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles . the report of the 9 / 11 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups . this report , which will be updated as needed , analyzes the range of possible applications of ctr funds , the kinds of assistance that might be supplied , and describes legal , financial , technical , and political constraints on possible assistance . a key underlying issue is that the countries posing the greatest risks may be the least amenable to cooperative approaches . a second issue is that there is an array of u.s. domestic and international legal restrictions on the most useful kinds of cooperation . both the executive branch and congress may need to consider domestic and international legal and political restrictions on cooperation with states outside the nonproliferation regimes , low levels of transparency exhibited by most of the potential recipient states , and the lack of incentives for many of these states to pursue threat reduction measures . in addition , congress may wish to consider whether potentially expanding the geographic scope of ctr may have a negative effect on existing programs . one school of thought believes russia , as the largest source of stocks of biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons , should continue to be the main focus of attention . other observers believe there is now an opportunity to focus on states within the nexus of terrorism and wmd . this report complements crs report rl31957 , nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance : u.s. programs in the former soviet union ; crs report rl31589 , nuclear threat reduction measures for india and pakistan ; and crs report rs21840 , expanding threat reduction and nonproliferation programs : concepts and definitions ( pdf ) .
