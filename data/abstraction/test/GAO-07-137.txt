to support the education and training of health professionals , the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , administers health professions education programs authorized under title vii of the public health service act . one of these programs , the health careers opportunity program ( hcop ) , provides grants to health professions schools and other entities to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare for health professions education and training . funding preference is given to grant applications that demonstrate a comprehensive approach involving other educational or health - related partners . congressional committees have encouraged hrsa to give priority to applications from schools with a historic mission of educating minority students for health professions . in 2004 , the appropriations conference committee asked gao to review hrsa 's process for awarding grants . this report addresses , for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , hrsa 's process for awarding hcop grants and the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees . gao reviewed data from hrsa , interviewed hrsa officials , and reviewed relevant federal laws and agency documents from hhs and the department of education . hrsa followed a standard process to award hcop grants , distributing funds on a noncompetitive basis to continue funding existing hcop grants within their approved project periods , and then awarding the remaining funds on a competitive basis . for each of fiscal years 2002-05 , hrsa competitively awarded between $ 4 million and $ 15 million from the approximately $ 34 million annually available for hcop . to award competitive grants , hrsa used independent reviewers who assessed applications against published criteria , scored applications that met minimum criteria , and determined if they qualified for the funding preference . hrsa ranked the applications from highest to lowest score -- putting those with the funding preference first -- and awarded grants in decreasing rank order until the available funds were exhausted . although hrsa had discretion to award grants out of rank order , the agency did not do so for fiscal years 2002-05. for fiscal years 2002-05 , hrsa awarded a total of 99 competitive hcop grants from 439 grant applications reviewed . overall , minority - serving institutions submitted about 25 percent of the applications reviewed and received about 30 percent of the competitive grants ; historically black colleges and universities were the most numerous grantees among minority - serving institutions , followed by hispanic - serving institutions . hrsa commented that a draft of this report met the goals of describing the award process and outlining the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees .
