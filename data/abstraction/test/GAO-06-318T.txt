the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a program -- the u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) -- to collect , maintain , and share information , including biometric identifiers , on selected foreign nationals who enter and exit the united states . us - visit uses these biometric identifiers ( digital fingerscans and photographs ) to screen persons against watch lists and to verify that a visitor is the person who was issued a visa or other travel document . visitors are also to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning at selected air and sea ports of entry . gao was asked to testify on the status of us - visit and dhs progress in implementing recommendations that gao made as part of its prior reviews of us - visit annual expenditure plans . the testimony is based on gao 's prior reports as well as ongoing work for the house committee on homeland security . gao 's recommendations are directed at helping the department improve its capabilities to deliver us - visit capability and benefit expectations on time and within budget . according to dhs , the recommendations have made us - visit a stronger program . the us - visit program has met a number of demanding requirements that were mandated in legislation . a pre - entry screening capability is in place in overseas visa issuance offices , and an entry identification capability is operating at 115 airports , 14 seaports , and 154 land ports of entry . this has been accomplished during a period of dhs - wide change , and has resulted in preventing criminal aliens from entering the country and potentially deterring others from even attempting to do so . nevertheless , dhs has more to do to implement gao recommendations aimed at better ensuring that us - visit is maximizing its potential for success and holding itself accountable for results . dhs has taken steps to address those gao recommendations intended to ensure that us - visit as defined is the `` right thing . . for example , it is clarifying the strategic context within which us - visit is to operate , having drafted a strategic plan to show how us - visit is aligned with dhs 's mission goals and operations and to provide an overall vision for immigration and border management . however , the plan has yet to be approved , causing its integration with other departmentwide border security initiatives to remain unclear . in addition , the department has analyzed the program 's costs , benefits , and risks , but its analyses do not yet demonstrate that the program is producing or will produce mission value commensurate with expected costs and risks . in particular , the department 's return - on - investment analyses for exit options do not demonstrate that these solutions will be cost - effective . dhs has also taken steps to address those gao recommendations aimed at ensuring that the program is executed in the `` right way . . the department has made good progress in establishing the program 's human capital capabilities , which should help ensure that it has sufficient staff with the necessary skills and abilities . this is particularly important in light of the program 's more limited progress in establishing capabilities in certain program management process areas , such as test management . for example , a test plan used in a recent system acceptance test did not adequately trace between test cases and the requirements to be verified by testing . incomplete test plans reduce assurance that systems will perform as intended once they are deployed . dhs also has begun addressing gao 's recommendations to establish accountability for program performance and results , but more needs to be done . for example , dhs 's expenditure plans have not described progress against commitments made in previous plans . unless performance against commitments is measured and disclosed , the ability to manage and oversee the program will suffer . the longer the program proceeds without fully addressing gao 's recommendations , the greater the risk that it will not deliver promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget .
