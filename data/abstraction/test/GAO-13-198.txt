within dhs , tsa and uscg manage the twic program , which requires maritime workers to complete background checks and obtain biometric identification cards to gain unescorted access to secure areas of maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) - regulated entities . tsa conducted a pilot program to test the use of twics with biometric card readers in part to inform the development of a regulation on using twics with card readers . as required by law , dhs reported its findings on the pilot to congress on february 27 , 2012. the coast guard authorization act of 2010 required that gao assess dhs 's reported findings and recommendations . thus , gao assessed the extent to which the results from the twic pilot were sufficiently complete , accurate , and reliable for informing congress and the proposed twic card reader rule . gao reviewed pilot test plans , results , and methods used to collect and analyze pilot data since august 2008 , compared the pilot data with the pilot report dhs submitted to congress , and conducted covert tests at four u.s. ports chosen for their geographic locations . the test 's results are not generalizable , but provide insights . gao 's review of the pilot test aimed at assessing the technology and operational impact of using the transportation security administration 's ( tsa ) transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) with card readers showed that the test 's results were incomplete , inaccurate , and unreliable for informing congress and for developing a regulation ( rule ) about the readers . challenges related to pilot planning , data collection , and reporting affected the completeness , accuracy , and reliability of the results . these issues call into question the program 's premise and effectiveness in enhancing security . planning . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) did not correct planning shortfalls that gao identified in november 2009. gao determined that these weaknesses presented a challenge in ensuring that the pilot would yield information needed to inform congress and the regulation aimed at defining how twics are to be used with biometric card readers ( card reader rule ) . gao recommended that dhs components implementing the pilot -- tsa and the u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) -- develop an evaluation plan to guide the remainder of the pilot and identify how it would compensate for areas where the twic reader pilot would not provide the information needed . dhs agreed and took initial steps , but did not develop an evaluation plan , as gao recommended . data collection . pilot data collection and reporting weaknesses include : installed twic readers and access control systems could not collect required data , including reasons for errors , on twic reader use , and tsa and the independent test agent ( responsible for planning , evaluating , and reporting on all test events ) did not employ effective compensating data collection measures , such as manually recording reasons for errors in reading twics . tsa and the independent test agent did not record clear baseline data for comparing operational performance at access points with twic readers . tsa and the independent test agent did not collect complete data on malfunctioning twic cards . pilot participants did not document instances of denied access . tsa officials said challenges , such as readers incapable of recording needed data , prevented them from collecting complete and consistent pilot data . thus , tsa could not determine whether operational problems encountered at pilot sites were due to twic cards , readers , or users , or a combination of all three . issues with dhs 's report to congress and validity of twic security premise . dhs 's report to congress documented findings and lessons learned , but its reported findings were not always supported by the pilot data , or were based on incomplete or unreliable data , thus limiting the report 's usefulness in informing congress about the results of the twic reader pilot . for example , reported entry times into facilities were not based on data collected at pilot sites as intended . further , the report concluded that twic cards and readers provide a critical layer of port security , but data were not collected to support this conclusion . for example , dhs 's assumption that the lack of a common credential could leave facilities open to a security breach with falsified credentials has not been validated . eleven years after initiation , dhs has not demonstrated how , if at all , twic will improve maritime security . congress should halt dhsÂ’s efforts to promulgate a final regulation until the successful completion of a security assessment of the effectiveness of using twic . in addition , gao revised the report based on the march 22 , 2013 , issuance of the twic card reader notice of proposed rulemaking .
