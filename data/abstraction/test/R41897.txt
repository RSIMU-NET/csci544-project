an issue for congress and state and local governments is whether the pay and benefits of public workers are comparable to those of workers in the private sector . in addition , among the ways to reduce budget deficits , policy makers are considering the pay and benefits of public sector employees . the number of people employed in both the private and public sectors has increased steadily as the u.s. economy has grown . however , after increasing to 19.2 % of total employment in 1975 , the percentage of all jobs that are in the public sector fell to 15.7 % in 1999. in 2013 , public sector jobs accounted for 16.0 % of total employment . the recession that officially began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 affected employment in both the private and public sectors . from 2007 to 2010 , the number of jobs in the private sector fell by an estimated 7.9 million , while the number of jobs in the public sector increased by almost 272,000. conversely , from 2010 to 2013 , private sector employment grew by approximately 6.7 million jobs , while public sector employment fell by about 626,000 jobs . reflecting the effects of the 2007-2009 recession on the budgets of state and local governments , from 2010 to 2013 , public sector employment as a share of total employment fell from 17.3 % to 16.0 % . among all full - time and part - time workers ages 16 and over , the number of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement has fallen in both the private and public sectors . the decline has been greater in the private sector . in 2009 , for the first time , a majority of workers who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement were employed in the public sector ( 8.7 million workers in the public sector , compared to 8.2 million private sector workers ) . by 2013 , the situation had reversed ; a slight majority of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement were employed in the private sector ( 8.1 million private sector workers , compared to 7.9 million public sector workers ) . in the federal government , except for the postal service and some smaller agencies , employees do not bargain over wages . among workers ages 18 to 64 who work full - time , differences in characteristics that may affect the relative pay and benefits of private and public sector workers include the following : age . reflecting the aging of the u.s. labor force , workers in both the private and public sectors have become older . nevertheless , employees in the public sector are older than private sector workers . in 2013 , 51.7 % of public sector workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 42.4 % of full - time private sector workers . federal workers are older than employees of state and local governments . in 2013 , 56.7 % of federal workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 49.7 % of state employees and 52.1 % of employees of local governments . workers who have more years of work experience generally earn more than workers with less experience . gender . reflecting the increased participation of women in the labor force , the share of jobs held by women has increased in both the private and public sectors . in 2013 , women held almost three - fifths ( 57.7 % ) of full - time jobs in state and local governments . by contrast , women held approximately two - fifths of full - time jobs in the federal government and in the private sector ( 42.2 % and 41.7 % , respectively ) . education . on average , public sector employees have more years of education than private sector workers . in 2013 , 53.6 % of workers in the public sector had a bachelor 's , advanced , or professional degree , compared to 34.9 % of private sector workers . generally , workers with more years of education earn more than workers with less years of education . occupation . a larger share of public sector than private sector workers are employed in `` management , professional , and related occupations . . in 2013 , 56.2 % of public sector workers and 37.8 % of private sector workers were employed in these occupations . in part , more public sector workers were employed in these occupations because 25.7 % of all public sector workers were employed in `` education , training , and library '' occupations , compared to 2.3 % of all private sector workers . workers in management and professional occupations generally earn more than workers in other occupations . however , comparisons of the compensation of private and public sector workers that use broad occupational categories may miss differences between detailed occupations . many detailed occupations are concentrated in either the private or public sectors . nevertheless , many detailed occupations may require similar skills . union coverage . although the number of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the private sector than in the public sector , the percentage of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the public sector than in the private sector . metropolitan area . private sector workers are more likely than federal workers to live in major metropolitan areas ( i.e . , areas with 5 million or more people ) .
