as the debate on reducing greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) has progressed , increasing concern has been raised about how a u.s. reduction program would interact with those of other countries . in a global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do not — i.e . , differentiated global carbon policies — the potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis - à - vis countries without comparable policies . the risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies , in the absence of similar policies among competing nations , have been central to debates on whether the united states should enact greenhouse gas legislation . specifically , concerns have been raised that if the united states adopts a carbon control policy , industries that must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passed - through by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share ( and jobs ) to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies . in addition , this potential shift in production could result in some of the u.s. carbon reductions being counteracted by increased production in less regulated countries ( commonly known as `` carbon leakage '' ) . there are three basic approaches , which are not mutually exclusive , to assist greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries : ( 1 ) directly supporting domestic industries ; ( 2 ) penalizing foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) developing alternative sectoral approaches . importantly , these are presumably transitional actions , pending some international agreement that `` levels the playing field . . each approach has its own focus . support for domestic industries , embodied in most legislative proposals , is focused on preserving the industry 's current competitive position and jobs and may , depending on the details , help transition that industry to the future . it does not directly promote an international agreement . trade measures levied against foreign competitors , another approach being proposed , may provide a stick for international negotiation , but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries from `` unfair '' competition — producers in countries not imposing comparable carbon control policies . finally , the sectoral approach represents a range of options focused on integrating developing countries ' industrial base into a mutually acceptable international framework that provides a level playing field for all participants . whether any of these approaches would have any appreciable effect on carbon leakage is unclear . the design of an assistance program — the goals , eligible participants , implementation and enforcement — would be difficult to define in a manner that satisfies all parties . there is every incentive for any industry facing a cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished , thereby justifying special consideration by the government . the government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers , sometimes without access to important , but proprietary , data .
