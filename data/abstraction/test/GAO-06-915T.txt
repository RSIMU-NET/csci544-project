the health of our nation 's air transportation system is critical to our citizens and economy . however , the current approach to managing air transportation is becoming increasingly inefficient and operationally obsolete . in 2003 , congress created the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) to plan for and coordinate , with federal and nonfederal stakeholders , a transformation from the current air traffic control ( atc ) system to the `` next generation air transportation system '' ( ngats ) . housed within the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , jpdo has seven partner agencies that make up jpdo 's senior policy committee : the departments of transportation , commerce , defense , and homeland security ; faa ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and the white house office of science and technology policy . this testimony , which provides preliminary results from gao 's ongoing work on jpdo , provides information on the status of jpdo 's efforts to plan for ngats , the key challenges facing jpdo as it moves forward with its planning efforts , and the key challenges facing faa as it implements the transformation while continuing its current operations . the statement is based on gao 's analysis of jpdo documents , interviews , and the views of a panel of experts , as well as on past gao work . jpdo has developed a framework for planning and coordination with its federal partner agencies and nonfederal stakeholders that is consistent with the requirements of its authorizing legislation -- vision 100- - and with several practices that our previous work has shown can facilitate federal interagency collaboration and the development of an enterprise architecture ( i.e . , system blueprint ) . jpdo 's framework includes an integrated plan that provides a vision for ngats , an organizational structure and processes for leveraging the resources and expertise of federal and nonfederal stakeholders , and an enterprise architecture that defines the specific requirements for ngats . as jpdo moves forward , it will face leadership , leveraging , and commitment challenges . currently , jpdo lacks a permanent director and a permanent chairperson of its senior policy committee to provide the leadership needed to overcome barriers to interagency coordination . in addition , despite early successes , jpdo may have difficulty continuing to leverage its partner agencies ' resources and expertise for ngats because these agencies have missions and priorities in addition to ngats and jpdo does not yet have signed , long - term agreements with the partner agencies on their respective roles and responsibilities . finally , jpdo faces the challenge of convincing nonfederal stakeholders that the government is fully committed to implementing ngats , given that , in some instances , it has discontinued work on new technologies for the national airspace system . faa faces challenges in institutionalizing recent improvements in its management and acquisition processes , as well as in obtaining the expertise and resources necessary to implement ngats . first , institutionalizing faa 's process improvements is critical to successfully implementing ngats . second , faa may lack the expertise needed to manage the ngats effort . gao has identified two potential approaches for faa to supplement its capabilities that faa is considering . third , achieving cost savings is critical to funding the implementation of ngats .
