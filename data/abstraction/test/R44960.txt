arbitration is a method of legal dispute resolution in which a neutral , private third party , rather than a judge or jury , renders a decision on a particular matter . under a growing number of consumer and employment agreements , companies have come to require arbitration to resolve disputes . while arbitration is often viewed as an expeditious and economical alternative to litigation , consumer advocates and others contend that mandatory arbitration agreements create one - sided arrangements that deny consumers and employees advantages afforded by a judicial proceeding . the federal arbitration act ( faa ) was enacted in 1925 to ensure the validity and enforcement of arbitration agreements in any `` maritime transaction or ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce [ . ] . the u.s. supreme court ( court ) has recognized the faa as evidencing `` a national policy favoring arbitration . . the application of the faa , however , particularly in light of various state law requirements and the use of different types of arbitration agreements , has raised numerous legal questions and been the subject of several cases before the court . the question of whether the faa preempts a state law or judicial rule is a subject of frequent litigation . in these cases , the court has routinely held that the faa supersedes state requirements that restrain the enforceability of mandatory arbitration agreements . this report examines the faa and reviews the court 's decisions involving the statute 's preemption of state law requirements . the report also explores the court 's decisions involving mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit a consumer or employee from maintaining a class or collective action . in its october 2017 term , the court will consider three consolidated cases that challenge such agreements on the grounds that they violate the right to engage in `` other concerted activities '' under the national labor relations act ( nlra ) . finally , concern over a perceived lack of `` meaningful choice '' to decide whether to submit a claim to arbitration has prompted regulatory activity , as well as legislation that would amend the faa to render certain types of pre - dispute arbitration agreements unenforceable . the report discusses some recent examples of federal regulatory action that aim to restrict the use of mandatory arbitration in the consumer arena , and reviews bills like the arbitration fairness act of 2017 ( h.r . 1374 / s . 537 ) , which would prohibit the enforcement of an arbitration agreement that requires arbitration for an employment , consumer , antitrust , or civil rights dispute if the agreement was executed prior to the dispute 's occurrence .
