enacted in 2014 , wioa aims , in part , to increase coordination among federal workforce development programs , which are administered primarily by dol and education . gao was asked to review selected states ' approaches for addressing certain wioa provisions in their state workforce plans . gao examined 1 ) approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies , and 2 ) related planning challenges these states have encountered and how they have addressed them . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance . gao also conducted case studies in five states ( california , colorado , kentucky , ohio , and pennsylvania ) . gao selected these states based on input from national associations about their level of experience with career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies , and gao 's review of relevant reports . in these states , gao interviewed state workforce board officials and agency officials who were involved in developing the state plan . the information gao obtained provides in - depth examples but is not generalizable to all states . gao also reviewed state plans and other relevant documentation . in addition , gao interviewed dol and education officials . officials in five selected states reported using three main approaches to develop plans for implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies under the workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) . gao selected states that had various levels of experience with these strategies . specifically , as a condition of receiving funding , federal agencies require state plans under wioa to include career pathways strategies , which align education , job training , and support services to help job seekers obtain employment . these plans must also include sector partnership strategies , which help employers in an industry address shared goals and hiring needs . in addition , states are required to establish regions , which may be made up of multiple local workforce areas . according to the department of labor ( dol ) , these regions are intended in part to align workforce activities with regional economies . to address these requirements , officials in each of the five states reported : building on prior experience to enhance career pathways , sector partnerships , or both strategies . for example , pennsylvania 's state plan proposes building on over 10 years of experience with sector partnerships by increasing technical assistance for them and exploring the development of a certification program for these partnerships . increasing the involvement of stakeholders , which uncovered ways to enhance services in most selected states . for example , ohio officials said they involved the state agency that oversees employment services for individuals with disabilities and advocates for these individuals in planning efforts for the first time , which led them to provide training on disability awareness for staff at all local workforce centers . using multiple sources of labor market information , which helped better align career pathways strategies with employer needs in some selected states . for example , colorado officials said they asked employers to review projected worker shortages in the medical industry over the next 10 years , and employers said they would need more workers over a shorter period of time . officials used this information to focus their career pathways strategies on preparing individuals to eventually fill the jobs that were projected to have worker shortages . officials in four of the states gao selected reported facing challenges establishing regions due to local areas ' concerns , which they addressed by revising regional boundaries or increasing the number of regions and by providing incentives for regional collaboration or innovation . in three states , officials said they revised their regions in response to local concerns . for example , california officials said they redrew regional boundaries after a local area requested that it be assigned to a different region based on commuting patterns , among other factors . in addition , to encourage regional collaboration or innovation , officials in four states reported providing financial incentives . for example , a kentucky official said the state is using a private grant to fund regional efforts to develop career pathways and sector partnership strategies . additionally , dol and department of education ( education ) officials told us that they plan to support states with related technical assistance . gao is not making recommendations in this report . dol and education provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
