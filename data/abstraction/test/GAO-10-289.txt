pakistan 's federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) has been a recognized safe haven for al qaeda leadership and a base for the taliban to launch cross - border attacks into afghanistan . the united states , in an effort to assist pakistan in addressing this threat , pledged $ 750 million between 2007 and 2011 to support development activities in the fata region . this report focuses on the extent u.s. development objectives align with u.s. national security goals and pakistan 's objectives , u.s. efforts to track the pledge , u.s. efforts to measure program performance in the fata , and efforts to monitor assistance in the fata . gao reviewed u.s. and pakistani documents and interviewed u.s. and pakistani officials in washington , d.c. , and pakistan . gao has prepared this report under the comptroller general 's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative . u.s. national security goals call for development assistance to aid the pakistani government in addressing terrorist threats emanating from the fata . gao found that u.s. development objectives in the fata are generally aligned with u.s. national security goals and pakistan 's fata development plans . in september 2007 , usaid and pakistan signed an agreement regarding development activities in the fata including the creation of joint strategic implementation plans for the seven fata geographic areas . we found , however , that the u.s. and pakistan have not yet completed such plans . the u.s. government has implemented two efforts to track its $ 750 million pledge in accordance with good management practices . state is tallying allocations of u.s. programs in pakistan 's western frontier region ( which includes the fata ) , and the usaid controller in islamabad has undertaken an effort to track most , but not all , u.s. development - related obligations and expenditures in the fata . as of the end of fiscal year 2009 , the u.s. government has reportedly allocated over $ 728 million toward the pledge . usaid and state collect reports on the performance of their fata - specific programs . however , key elements , such as identification of evaluation efforts and a timeline for reviewing implementing partner reports required by usaid 's regulations are missing in its performance management plan for the fata . also , state did not collect all the required project performance documentation . long - term development programs for which performance could be measured against annual targets generally did not achieve targets . although hampered by security challenges that prevent direct monitoring called for in its guidance , usaid has taken steps to apply a set of indirect monitoring procedures . this includes collecting information from implementing partners and locally employed staff , and the use of a geographic information system . while usaid officials told gao they use these methods , gao found that usaid did not always document the use of these monitoring procedures . gao also found that state has several monitoring procedures , but had not fully documented their use of these procedures .
