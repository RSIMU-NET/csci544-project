pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the department of defense 's ( dod ) base closure accounts and its budget request for base closure activities , focusing on opportunities for offsetting the budget request for fiscal year ( fy ) 1999 , including the validity of two proposed military construction ( milcon ) projects included in that request . gao noted that : dod and the military services have reduced the previous high unobligated balances in the 1990 base closure account ; however , there are opportunities to offset the 1999 budget request ; gao 's analysis of the 1990 account and the fy 1999 base realignment and closure ( brac ) budget request raises questions about the need for $ 131.1 million included in the request ; and specifically : from the 1990 base closure account , $ 35.7 million in proceeds generated by brac activities that has not been reported to congress ; $ 12.5 million previously allocated but not needed for brac 1991 milcon projects ; $ 7.8 million allocated but not needed for brac 1991 operation and maintenance activities ; and $ 8.5 million previously allocated but not needed for brac 1991 environmental projects ; from the fy 1998 brac appropriations , $ 26 million previously withheld but ultimately was not needed for other higher priority programs ; and from 1999 brac budget request , $ 40.6 million requested for two separate milcon projects may no longer be needed because the requirements for one project have not been determined and the other has already been funded .
