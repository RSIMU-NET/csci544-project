pursuant to the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) , a health insurance exchange has been established in each state and the district of columbia ( dc ) . exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can `` shop '' for health insurance coverage . the aca instructed each state to establish its own state - based exchange ( sbe ) . if a state elected not to create an exchange or if the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) determined a state was not prepared to operate an exchange , the law directed hhs to establish a federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) in the state . fourteen states and dc established sbes in 2014 , while the remaining 36 states have ffes . in some states that have ffes , the states carry out certain functions of the exchange ; in other states , the exchange is wholly operated and administered by hhs . the aca provided an indefinite appropriation for hhs grants to states to support the planning and establishment of exchanges . for each fiscal year , the hhs secretary is to determine the total amount that will be made available to each state for exchange grants . no grant may be awarded after january 1 , 2015. there are three different types of exchange grants . first , planning grants were awarded to 49 states and dc . these grants of about $ 1 million each were intended to provide resources to states to help them plan their health insurance exchanges . second , there have been multiple rounds of exchange establishment grants . there are two levels of exchange establishment grants : level one establishment grants are awarded to states that have made some progress using their planning funds , and level two establishment grants are designed to provide funding to states that are farther along in the establishment of an exchange . finally , hhs awarded seven early innovator grants to states ( including one award to a consortium of new england states ) to support the design and implementation of the information technology systems needed to operate the exchanges . to date , hhs has awarded a total of more than $ 4.8 billion to states and dc in planning , establishment , and early innovator grants . under the aca , each exchange is expected to be self - sustaining beginning january 1 , 2015. the law authorizes exchanges to generate funding to sustain their operations , including by assessing fees on participating health insurance issuers . to raise funds for each of the ffes , beginning in 2014 , hhs is assessing a monthly fee on each health insurance issuer that offers plans through an ffe . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) is incurring significant administrative costs to support ffe operations . according to cms , a total of $ 456 million was used to support exchange operations over the period fy2010-fy2012 . cms spent $ 1,545 million on exchange operations in fy2013 and an estimated $ 1,390 million in fy2014 . the agency has relied on a mix of annual discretionary appropriations and funding from other sources for these expenditures . those sources include expired discretionary funds from the nonrecurring expenses fund , mandatory funding from the health insurance reform implementation fund and the prevention and public health fund , and ffe user fees . cms has budgeted $ 1.8 billion for exchange operations in fy2015 . most of that funding is projected to come from ffe user fees .
