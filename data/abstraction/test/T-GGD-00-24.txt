pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the challenges that face the national archives and records administration ( nara ) and federal agencies in their efforts to manage the rapidly increasing volume of electronic records . gao noted that : nara and federal agencies are confronted with many electronic records management ( erm ) challenges , particularly technological issues ; nara must be able to receive electronic records from agencies , store them , and retrieve them when needed ; agencies must be able to create electronic records , store them , properly dispose of them when appropriate , and send valuable electronic records to nara for archival storage ; nara officials told gao that nara needs to expand its capacity to accept the increasing volume of electronic records from agencies ; in addition to increasing volume , nara must address some definitional problems , such as what constitutes an electronic record ; in addition , because agencies follow no uniform hardware or software standards , nara must be capable of accepting various formats from agencies and maintaining a continued capability of reading those records ; nara is not alone in facing erm challenges , the agencies also must meet federal records act responsibilities ; agencies must incorporate nara 's guidance into their own recordkeeping systems ; agencies ' reactions to erm challenges are varied ; on the basis of gao 's discussions with nara and some agency officials , gao learned that some agencies are waiting for more specific guidance from nara while others are moving forward by looking for ways to better manage their electronic records ; even though nara is aware of what some agencies are doing , it does not have governmentwide data on records management capabilities and programs of federal agencies ; nara had planned to do a baseline survey to collect such data on all agencies by the end of fiscal year 2000 ; the archivist decided , however , to temporarily postpone doing this baseline survey because he accorded higher priority to such activities as reengineering nara 's business processes ; gao recommended that nara do the baseline survey as part of its reengineering process ; the archivist stated that the baseline data would not be relevant to its reengineering efforts and therefore nara would not collect it at this time ; even though nara lacks governmentwide data on how agencies are implementing erm , nara has already begun revising its guidance to agencies ; gao 's review of the erm activities in four states and three foreign governments showed that approaches to erm differ ; and these entities often did things differently from each other and nara .
