the number of children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian is raising a host of policy questions . while much of the congressional interest initially focused directly on immigration policy , the implications for other areas , including education , are now arising as well . under federal law , states and leas are required to provide all children with equal access to a public elementary and secondary education , regardless of their immigration status . upon arrival in the united states , unaccompanied alien children generally are served initially through programs operated by the department of health and human services ' ( hhs 's ) office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) . while in these programs , children are provided with basic education services and activities and are not enrolled in local school systems . however , once an unaccompanied alien child is released to an appropriate sponsor ( e.g . , parent , other family member , or other adult ) , the child has the right to enroll in a local school , just like any other child living in that area , even while awaiting immigration proceedings . while several federal education programs administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) provide funds that may be used by schools , local educational agencies ( leas ) , and states to serve unaccompanied alien children , this report focuses on three ed programs that may be particularly helpful in providing support for these children : ( 1 ) title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , ( 2 ) english language acquisition grants ( title iii - a ) authorized by the esea , and ( 3 ) part b grants to states authorized by the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) . in addition to current federal education programs that may be useful in assisting local education systems in meeting the needs of recent immigrant students , there are other federal education programs previously administered by ed that are no longer funded that either focused on immigrant students ( emergency immigrant education act ) or have been used in the past to assist schools and leas experiencing an unexpected influx of students in elementary and secondary school ( temporary emergency impact aid for displaced students ) . in addition to these ed programs , orr administers the refugee school impact aid program administered by orr , which funds activities aimed at the effective integration and education of refugee children . one of the principal challenges of providing federal funds to leas and schools that are absorbing newly arriving unaccompanied children is the lack of local area data . the best available data from orr are county - level totals that do not indicate the age of the child . a discussion of these data and their limitations is included at the end of this report .
