preferential trade agreements ( ptas ) comprise a variety of arrangements that favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences . ptas , particularly free trade agreements ( ftas ) , have proliferated in recent years . in the post - war period , the european union ( eu ) , which is a pta itself , has developed the largest network of ptas in the world . the main findings of this report are as follows . historically , europe 's ptas have differed among its partners in terms of provisions and commitments and they have been characterized by relatively modest ambition in terms of market - opening . in comparison , the u.s. approach has been more standardized in terms of its provisions and more focused on achieving reciprocal market access . these differences in approaches , however , have significantly narrowed since the eu adopted its more commercially oriented global europe strategy in 2006. eu ptas cover nearly twice as much trade ( exports ) in percentage terms ( 70 % versus 40 % ) and seven times as much in value terms ( $ 3.4 trillion versus $ 0.52 trillion ) than u.s. ptas . these numbers can be used to support the argument that u.s. firms may face more discrimination and possibly reduced sales than eu firms . at the same time , the data may overstate the degree of discrimination because the amount of trade covered by ptas is not the same as the amount of trade conducted on a preferential ( duty - free ) basis . concerns about trade discrimination have been a factor in u.s. and eu efforts to negotiate and implement separate but similar ptas with five trading partners ( israel , mexico , morocco , chile , and jordan ) . based on market share data analyzed , neither side appears to have gained a competitive advantage from having negotiated a pta . this , however , does not mean that individual firms and workers have not benefitted or that exports have not risen at faster rates after the pta became effective . in the past , europe 's pta program has not been a major factor affecting u.s. fta policy , which currently is in flux . however , europe 's recently completed fta with south korea raises the concern that u.s. exports will be disadvantaged due to the duty - free price advantage european - based producers will gain in the korean market . the united states has also negotiated an fta with korea , which awaits approval in korea parliament ( congress approved the agreement in 2011 ) . ongoing negotiations between the eu and canada over a comprehensive fta could also affect the u.s. fta debate . if a robust agreement is reached , the eu and the united states would then both have ftas with canada and mexico , making the absence of a fta between the united states and eu all the more glaring after years of discussion . it is not clear where europe 's pta policy is headed . there are only a few remaining major developed countries that fall outside the eu 's network of ptas , including the united states , china , japan , russia and australia . while pta negotiations with these countries could yield large economic benefits and provide a big impact ( for good or ill ) on the world trading system , some of these countries would likely demand liberalization of european agriculture and services , areas where there is widespread opposition in europe .
