an adequate level of dissolved oxygen is necessary to support most forms of aquatic life . while very low levels of dissolved oxygen ( hypoxia ) can be natural , especially in deep ocean basins and fjords , hypoxia in coastal waters is mostly the result of human activities that have modified landscapes or increased nutrients entering these waters . hypoxic areas are more widespread during the summer , when algal blooms stimulated by spring runoff decompose to diminish oxygen . such hypoxic areas may drive out or kill animal life , and usually dissipate by winter . in many places where hypoxia has occurred previously , it is now more severe and longer lasting ; in others where hypoxia did not exist historically , it now does , and these areas are becoming more prevalent . the largest hypoxic area affecting the united states is in the northern gulf of mexico near the mouth of the mississippi river , but there are others as well . most u.s. coastal estuaries and many developed nearshore areas suffer from varying degrees of hypoxia , causing various environmental damages . research has been conducted to better identify the human activities that affect the intensity and duration of , as well as the area affected by , hypoxic events , and to begin formulating control strategies . near the end of the 105th congress , the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act of 1998 was signed into law as title vi of p.l . 105-383. provisions of this act authorize appropriations through noaa for research , monitoring , education , and management activities to prevent , reduce , and control hypoxia . under this legislation , an integrated gulf of mexico hypoxia assessment was completed in the late 1990s . in 2004 , title i of p.l . 108-456 , the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia amendments act of 2004 , expanded this authority and reauthorized appropriations through fy2008 . legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize and amend the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act . as knowledge and understanding have increased concerning the possible impacts of hypoxia , congressional interest in monitoring and addressing the problem has grown . the issue of hypoxia is seen as a search for ( 1 ) increased scientific knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon , as well as ( 2 ) cost - effective actions that might diminish the size of hypoxic areas by changing practices that promote their growth and development . this report presents an overview of the causes of hypoxia , the u.s. areas of most concern , federal legislation , and relevant federal research programs . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
