the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) , signed into law on february 9 , 2018 , created a joint select committee of the house and senate . the joint select committee on budget and appropriations process reform was to be made up of 16 members from the house and senate â€” 4 chosen by each of the chambers ' party leaders . the act charged the joint select committee with formulating recommendations and legislative language to `` significantly reform the budget and appropriations process . . the law directed the committee to make a report no later than november 30 , 2018 , to be submitted , along with legislative language , to the president , the speaker of the house , and the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate . the act included procedures intended to allow the senate to reach a timely vote on the question of whether or not to consider any legislation embodying the recommendations of the joint select committee . under the terms of the act , the senate would be able to vote on a motion to proceed to consider any reported joint committee bill before the conclusion of the 115th congress ( 2017-2018 ) . consideration of the motion to proceed ( and all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith ) was to be limited to 10 hours , equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders ( or their designees ) with support of at least three - fifths of the senate ( 60 votes if there is no more than one vacancy ) necessary to approve the motion . the act did not specify any procedures governing consideration of the bill once the senate had agreed to take it up . there were also no provisions in the act concerning the consideration of the recommendations of the joint select committee in the house nor any provisions concerning resolving any differences between the house and senate . such actions would have occurred under the regular procedures of each chamber . during its lifespan , the joint select committee held five days of hearings , taking testimony from 12 outside witnesses and 27 members , including then - speaker of the house paul ryan and then - house minority leader nancy pelosi . formal and informal discussions among committee members resulted in draft legislation to be considered in a markup that concluded on november 29 , 2018. the chief recommendation in the draft provided for the budget resolution to be adopted for a two - year cycle rather than the current annual cycle . by unanimous consent , the committee members applied a voting rule for the adoption of amendments consistent with the rule required by the act for final adoption of any recommendations requiring separate majorities of the appointees from each party . the final vote on reporting the bill as amended was not agreed to by a roll - call vote of one aye and seven noes of the members appointed by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader and seven ayes and zero noes of the members appointed by the house minority leader and the senate minority leader .
