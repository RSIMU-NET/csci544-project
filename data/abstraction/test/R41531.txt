the april 20 , 2010 , explosion of the deepwater horizon offshore drilling rig led to the largest oil spill in u.s. waters . federal government officials estimated that the deepwater well ultimately released ( over 84 days ) over 200 million gallons ( or 4.9 million barrels ) of crude oil . although decreasing amounts of oil were observed on the ocean surface following the well 's containment on july 15 , 2010 , oil spill response officials and researchers have found oil in other places . a pressing question that has been raised by many stakeholders is where did the oil go ? . on august 4 , 2010 , the federal government released an estimate of the oil spill budget for the deepwater horizon incident . on november 23 , 2010 , the federal government released a peer - reviewed `` technical document '' that further explained how the estimates were derived , and in some cases , modified the initial estimates . the oil budget estimates divide the released oil into seven categories , accounting for the following percentages of the total oil released . these categories generally fall into three groups : 1. human intervention : direct recovery from the well ( 17 % ) , in situ burning ( 5 % ) , skimmed ( 3 % ) , chemically dispersed ( 16 % ) . 2. natural processes : naturally dispersed ( 13 % ) , evaporated or dissolved ( 24 % ) . 3. other ( 22 % ) : refers to the oil remaining after subtracting the above estimates from the total estimated release ; possible fates include remaining in the water column , settling to the sea floor , mixing with sediment , ingested by microbes , or collected during shore cleanup activities . direct observation and measurement of the fate of the vast majority of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil presents a considerable challenge . in some cases , the estimates used to calculate these percentages contain considerable uncertainty . even assuming that approximately half of the oil has been removed from the gulf ecosystem through direct recovery , burning , skimming , or evaporation , the fate of the remaining ( `` other '' ) oil is unknown . it is debatable whether the fate of the remaining oil will ever be established conclusively , because multiple challenges hinder this objective : the complexity of the gulf system , resources required to collect data , and varied interpretations over the results and observations . moreover , as time progresses , determining the fate of the oil will likely become more difficult . regardless , the question of oil fate will likely be answered through an incremental process . researchers are continuing to study various components of the gulf , specifically damages to natural resources . some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil 's fate . because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil 's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders . the perception of the spill 's fate may be influenced by multiple factors , including oil spill assessments , the group that prepared the assessment , and the manner in which the assessment is presented . if policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment , attention to the oil spill 's consequences and associated impacts may wane . on the other hand , a perception that a substantial volume of oil remains and poses a threat to the environment could result in continuing pressure on gulf industries and livelihoods .
