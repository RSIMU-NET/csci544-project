at a time when u.s. military forces and their equipment are in high demand , effective management of the department of defense 's ( dod ) inventory is critical to ensure that the warfighter has the right items at the right time . the air force is the largest contributor to dod 's total on - hand inventory on the basis of inventory value . under the statutory authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , gao determined the extent to which the air force 's on - order and on - hand inventory reflect the amount of inventory needed to support required inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , and the air force had shortages in its inventory needed to support required levels during this period . to address these objectives gao analyzed air force secondary inventory data ( spare parts such as engines and guided missiles ) from fiscal years 2002 through 2005. more than half of the air force 's secondary inventory ( spare parts ) , worth an average of $ 31.4 billion , was not needed to support required on - hand and on - order inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , although increased demand due to ongoing military operations contributed to slight reductions in the percentage of inventory on hand and the number of years of supply it represents . dod regulations provide guidance for developing materiel requirements based on customer expectations while minimizing inventories . however , the value of air force on - order inventory not needed to support required inventory levels increased by about 7.8 percent , representing an average of 52 percent ( $ 1.3 billion ) of its on - order inventory . the air force has continued to purchase unneeded on - order inventory because its policies do not provide incentives to reduce the amount of inventory on order that is not needed to support requirements . when the air force buys these items it may obligate funds unnecessarily , which could lead to not having sufficient obligation authority to purchase needed items and could negatively impact readiness . in addition , although the percentage of the air force on - hand inventory was reduced by 2.7 percent due to increases in demand , about 65 percent ( $ 18.7 billion ) of this inventory was not needed to support required inventory levels . gao calculated that it costs the air force from $ 15 million to $ 30 million annually to store its unneeded items . of the air force 's inventory items not needed to support required inventory levels , 79 percent had no recurring demands ( such as engines and airframe components ) , resulting in a potentially infinite supply of those items . the air force has continued to retain this unneeded inventory with no recurring demands , in part , because the air force has not performed a comprehensive assessment to revalidate the need to continue to retain these items . for the remaining 21 percent of items that had recurring demands , increasing demands resulted in a reduction in the number of years of supply that this inventory represents , with the largest quantity and value of items having between 2 to 10 years of supply . inventory not needed to support required inventory levels can be attributed to many long - standing problems , such as decreasing demands , retaining items used to support aging weapon systems that have diminishing sources of supply or are being phased out of service , and not terminating contracts for on - order items . air force officials acknowledged that decreases in demand have resulted in having more inventory than is needed ; however , the air force has not evaluated why it continues to experience decreases in demand or taken actions to mitigate the effect of these changes . without taking actions to reduce its unneeded inventory , the air force will continue its past practices of purchasing and retaining items it does not need and then spending additional resources to handle and store these items . although more than half of its secondary inventory was not needed to support required levels , the air force still had shortages of certain items . from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , the percentage and value of the air force 's inventory shortages remained the same at about 8 percent and $ 1.2 billion .
