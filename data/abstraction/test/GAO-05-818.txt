since its creation , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has operated passenger aircraft services . these operations have been questioned in several prior audit reports . gao was asked to perform a series of audits of nasa 's controls to prevent fraud , waste , and abuse of taxpayer dollars . in this audit , gao assessed the relative cost of nasa passenger aircraft services in comparison with commercial costs , whether nasa aircraft services were retained and operated in accordance with governmentwide guidance , and the effectiveness of nasa 's oversight and management of this program . nasa - owned and - chartered passenger aircraft services provide a perquisite to employees , but cost taxpayers an estimated five times more than flying on commercial airlines . while the majority of nasa air travel is on commercial airlines , nasa employees took at least 1,188 flights using nasa passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. use of nasa passenger aircraft services can save time , provide more flexibility to meet senior executives ' schedules , and provide other less tangible and quantifiable benefits . however , gao 's analysis of available reported data related to nasa passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed nasa reported costs were nearly $ 25 million compared with estimated commercial airline coach transportation costs of about $ 5 million . further , this relative cost comparison , based on available nasa reported costs , did not take into account all applicable types of costs associated with its passenger aircraft services , including , for example , depreciation associated with the estimated $ 14 million nasa paid in 2001 to acquire several aircraft used for passenger transportation . consequently , nasa 's passenger air transportation services are much more costly than indicated by available data . further , nasa is currently considering additional expenditures of about $ 77 million to upgrade and expand its existing passenger fleet . nasa 's ownership of aircraft used to provide passenger transportation conflicts with federal policy allowing agencies to own aircraft only as needed to meet specified mission requirements , such as prisoner transportation and aeronautical research . gao 's analysis of nasa passenger aircraft flights for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed that an estimated 86 percent -- about seven out of every eight flights -- were taken to support routine business operations specifically prohibited by federal policy regarding aircraft ownership , including routine site visits , meetings , speeches , and conferences . further , agencywide oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services was not effective . nasa 's ability to make informed decisions on continued ownership of its passenger aircraft fleet and on flight - by - flight justifications was impaired by the lack of reliable agencywide data on aircraft costs and other weak management oversight practices .
