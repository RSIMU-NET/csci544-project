pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the denver international airport 's ( dia ) financial condition , focusing on dia : cash reserves and estimated cash flows ; and ability to meet its financial obligations . gao found that : predicting the future financial performance of dia is difficult , since it has been operating for less than 1 year ; the difficulties in projecting dia financial performance relate to the volatility of the airline industry , unexpected construction delays and costs , and the city of denver 's ability to repay airport investors ; the securities and exchange commission is formally investigating the adequacy of the city 's disclosure of information in bond documents with respect to delays in opening the airport ; there is no evidence that dia will be unable to meet its financial obligations , since dia has generated positive cash flows in its first 6 months of operation despite operating at well below capacity ; dia debt service costs are expected to remain stable over the next 30 years , while operating and maintenance costs are expected to rise with inflation ; and as of september 1995 , dia had an operating cash balance of $ 57 million and held $ 420 million in reserve funds , of which $ 260 million could be used in the event of a financial crisis .
