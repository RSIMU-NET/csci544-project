gao reviewed selected data collection and reporting requirements of the 1990 clean air act amendments , focusing on whether : the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) planned state emissions reporting requirements exceed its program needs ; and states use the epa aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) to monitor emissions data . gao found that : epa draft regulation would have required states to submit emissions data that exceeded its minimum air pollution program needs and to develop complicated pollutant databases that they could not afford ; epa has since suspended the regulation and is considering alternative reporting options ; despite epa intentions , 9 of the 10 heavy emission states use their own independently developed systems to track air pollution emissions ; and the state tracking systems are more efficient and easier to use than airs .
