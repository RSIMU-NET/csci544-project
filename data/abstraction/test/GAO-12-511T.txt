ssa administers two of the largest disability programs , with annual benefit payments that have grown fivefold over the last 20 yearsfrom $ 35 billion in 1990 to over $ 164 billion in 2010and the agency receives millions of new applications annually . gao has designated federal disability programs as a high - risk area , in part because eligibility criteria have not been updated to reflect medical and technological advances and labor market changes . given the size and cost of its disability programs , ssa needs updated criteria to appropriately determine who qualifies for benefits . in this statement , gao discusses initial observations from its ongoing review and assessment of ssas efforts to update its medical criteria and develop a new occupational information system . to do this , gao reviewed prior gao and ssa inspector general reports ; relevant federal laws and regulations ; program documentation including policies , procedures , strategic goals , and supporting project plans ; and cost estimates . gao also interviewed ssa officials , project stakeholders , experts , and representatives from other agencies that administer disability programs . this work is ongoing and gao has no recommendations at this time . gao plans to issue its final report later in 2012. the social security administration ( ssa ) has made several changes to improve the process it uses for updating its medical criteria , but continues to face challenges ensuring timely updates . ssas medical criteria for adults are in the form of listings of medical conditions and impairments organized under 14 body systems , which ssa periodically updates . to help ensure timely , periodic updates of a body systems listings , ssa is moving away from comprehensively revising a body systems listings toward a more targeted approach , wherein ssa selects for revision those impairment listings most in need of change . to date , ssa has completed comprehensive revisions of listings for 8 of the 14 body systems and now is in the process of reviewing them to determine whether and which targeted revisions are appropriate . in 2010 , the ssa commissioner set a 5-year cycle time for updating listings for each body system , replacing the agencys prior practice of setting expiration dates for listings that ranged from 3 to 8 years and then frequently extending them . to further increase the timeliness and accuracy of decisions , ssa has sought recommendations from the institute of medicine and has acted on some of them , such as creating a standing committee to provide advice on updating the listings . however , ssa continues to face challenges keeping its listings up to date . for example , ssa is still working on completing comprehensive revisions of listings for six body systems that have been ongoing for 19 to 33 years . ssa staff told us that a lack of staff and expertise , along with the complexity and unpredictability of the regulatory process , have made it challenging to maintain its schedule of periodic updates for all listings . ssa has embarked on an ambitious plan to produce by 2016 an occupational inventory database to support its disability benefit decisions , but it is too soon to determine if ssa will meet key time frames . ssa currently relies on an occupational information source developed by the department of labor that was updated for the last time in 1991 and is viewed by many as outdated . in 2008 , ssa initiated a project to develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) , which ssa expects will provide up - to - date information on the physical and mental demands of work , and in sufficient detail to support its disability benefit decisions . to guide the creation of its ois , ssa established an advisory panel , collaborated with outside experts and other agencies , and in july 2011 issued a research and development plan detailing all relevant activities and goals between 2010 and 2016. as of february 2012 , ssa had completed many initial research efforts , including investigating other types of occupational information systems and identifying job analysis methods . despite preliminary progress , it is too early to determine if ssa will meet its target implementation date . ssa officials told us that due to staffing shortages it did not meet all initial goals on time and may need to adjust its time frames for future activities . while gao is still evaluating ssas schedule and cost estimates against best practices , we have preliminarily identified some potential gaps in ssas approach , such as not reflecting the costs to both implement and maintain a new ois .
