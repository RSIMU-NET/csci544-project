in accordance with united states law , the u.s. government places conditions on the use of defense articles and defense services transferred by it to foreign recipients . violation of these conditions can lead to the suspension of deliveries or termination of the contracts for such defense items , among other things . on occasion , the president has indicated that such violations by foreign countries `` may '' have occurred , raising the prospect that termination of deliveries to or imposition of other penalties on such nations might take place . section 3 ( a ) of the arms export control act ( aeca ) sets the general standards for countries or international organizations to be eligible to receive united states defense articles and defense services provided under this act . it also sets express conditions on the uses to which these defense items may be put . section 4 of the arms export control act states that u.s. defense articles and defense services shall be sold to friendly countries `` solely '' for use in `` internal security , '' for use in `` legitimate self - defense , '' to enable the recipient to participate in `` regional or collective arrangements or measures consistent with the charter of the united nations , '' to enable the recipient to participate in `` collective measures requested by the united nations for the purpose of maintaining or restoring international peace and security , '' and to enable the foreign military forces `` in less developed countries to construct public works and to engage in other activities helpful to the economic and social development of such friendly countries . . section 3 ( c ) ( 2 ) of the arms export control act requires the president to report promptly to the congress upon the receipt of information that a `` substantial violation '' described in section 3 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the aeca `` may have occurred . . this presidential report need not reach any conclusion regarding the possible violation or provide any particular data other than that necessary to illustrate that the president has received information indicating a specific country may have engaged in a `` substantial violation '' of an applicable agreement with the united states that governs the sale of u.s. defense articles or services . should the president determine and report in writing to congress or if congress determines through enactment of a joint resolution pursuant to section 3 ( c ) ( 3 ) ( a ) of the arms export control act that a `` substantial violation '' by a foreign country of an applicable agreement governing an arms sale has occurred , then that country becomes ineligible for further u.s. military sales under the aeca . this action would terminate provision of credits , loan guarantees , cash sales , and deliveries pursuant to previous sales . since the major revision of u.s. arms export law in 1976 , neither the president nor the congress have actually determined that a violation did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act . the united states government has other options under the arms export control act to prevent transfer of defense articles and services for which valid contracts exist short of finding a foreign country in violation of an applicable agreement with the united states . these options include suspension of deliveries of defense items already ordered and refusal to allow new arms orders . the united states has utilized at least one such option against argentina , israel , indonesia , and turkey .
