the affordable care act ( aca ) authorized many new discretionary grant programs and provided each one with an authorization of appropriations — typically through fy2014 or fy2015 — to carry them out . the aca also reauthorized funding for numerous existing programs with expired authorizations of appropriations , most of which were still receiving annual funding . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated that fully funding the discretionary grant programs authorized ( or reauthorized ) by the aca , based on the amounts specified in the authorizations of appropriations , would result in appropriations of almost $ 100 billion over the period fy2012-fy2021 . however , the total amount of discretionary funding provided to date falls well below cbo 's estimate for two reasons . first , few of the new grant programs authorized by the aca have received any discretionary appropriations . second , programs that were reauthorized by the aca generally have received discretionary appropriations at levels well below the amounts authorized in the law . the aca included provisions intended to strengthen the health care safety net and improve access to care . for example , it permanently reauthorized the federal health center program and the national health service corps ( nhsc ) . the nhsc provides scholarships and student loan repayments to individuals who agree to a period of service as a primary care provider in a federally designated health professional shortage area . in addition , the aca addressed concerns about the current size , specialty mix , and geographic distribution of the health care workforce . it reauthorized and expanded existing health workforce education and training programs under titles vii and viii of the public health service act ( phsa ) . title vii supports the education and training of physicians , dentists , physician assistants , and public health workers through grants , scholarships , and loan repayment . the aca created several new programs to increase training experiences in primary care , in rural areas , and in community - based settings , and provided training opportunities to increase the supply of pediatric subspecialists and geriatricians . it also expanded the nursing workforce development programs authorized under phsa title viii . as part of a comprehensive framework for federal community - based public health activities , including a national strategy and a national education and outreach campaign , the aca authorized several new grant programs with a focus on preventable or modifiable risk factors for disease ( e.g . , sedentary lifestyle , tobacco use ) . the new law also leveraged a number of mechanisms to improve health care quality , including new requirements for quality measure development , collection , analysis , and public reporting ; programs to develop and disseminate innovative strategies for improving the quality of health care delivery ; and support for care coordination programs such as medical homes and the co - location of primary health care and mental health services . additionally , the aca authorized funding for programs to prevent elder abuse , neglect , and exploitation ; grants to expand trauma care services and improve regional coordination of emergency services ; and demonstration projects to implement alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving medical malpractice claims , among other provisions . the two agencies primarily responsible for implementing the aca 's expansion of insurance coverage and its revenue provisions — the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and the internal revenue service ( irs ) — have requested an increase in their annual appropriations in each of the past five years ( i.e . , fy2013-fy2017 ) to help cover these costs . but congress has not provided the agencies with any additional discretionary funding for aca implementation . cms , in particular , has relied on funding from a variety of other sources to support these activities .
