the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , a component within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for overseeing the medicare and medicaid programs -- the nation 's largest health insurance programs -- which benefit about one in every four americans . cms relies on a contractor - owned and operated network to facilitate communication and data transmission among cms business related entities . effective information security controls are essential to protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of this sensitive information . at congress 's request , gao assessed the effectiveness of information security controls over the communication network used by cms by conducting a technical assessment of the information security controls that are currently in place . although cms had many key information security controls in place -- which had been designed to safeguard the communication network -- some were missing , and existing ones had not always been effectively implemented . significant weaknesses in electronic access and other system controls threatened the confidentiality and availability of sensitive cms financial and medical information when it was transmitted across the network . cms did not always ensure that its contractor effectively implemented electronic access controls designed to prevent , limit , and detect unauthorized access to sensitive computing resources and devices used to support the communication network . gao discovered numerous vulnerabilities in several areas : user identification and authentication , user authorization , system boundary protection , cryptography , and auditing and monitoring of security - related events . there were also weaknesses in controls that had been designed to ensure that secure configurations would be implemented on network devices and that incompatible duties would be sufficiently segregated . a key reason for these weaknesses is that cms did not always ensure that its security policies and standards were implemented effectively . as a result , sensitive , personally identifiable medical data traversing the network is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure and these weaknesses could lead to disruptions in cms services .
