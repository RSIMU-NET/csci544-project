foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies can pose a significant challenge for the u.s. government because of the need to balance the benefits of foreign investment with national security concerns . the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies that may harm national security . to better understand how other countries deal with similar challenges , gao was asked to identify how other countries address the issues that exon - florio is intended to address . specifically , this report describes selected countries ' laws and policies enacted to regulate foreign investment to protect their national security interests and implementation of those laws and policies . this report updates a 1996 gao report that describes how four major foreign investors in the united states -- france , germany , japan , and the united kingdom -- monitored foreign investment in their own countries to protect national security interests . it also examines foreign investment in six additional countries : canada , china , india , the netherlands , russia , and the united arab emirates ( uae ) . gao reviewed selected laws and regulations and interviewed foreign government officials and others concerning their implementation and any planned changes to their foreign investment laws , regulations , and policies . as is the case in the united states , the countries we reviewed have enacted laws and instituted policies regulating foreign investment , often to address national security concerns . however , each of the 10 countries has its own concept of national security that influences which particular investments may be restricted . as a result of the differing concepts , restrictions range from requiring approval of investments in a narrowly defined defense sector to broad restrictions on the basis of economic security and cultural policy . in addition , some countries have recently made changes to their laws and policies to more explicitly identify national security as an area of concern , in some cases as the result of controversial investments . several countries have also introduced lists of strategic sectors in which foreign investment requires government review and approval . while there are many unique characteristics of the systems employed by the 10 countries to regulate foreign investment , in many ways the systems are similar to each other , and to the u.s. process under exon - florio . eight countries use a formal review process -- usually conducted by a government economic body with input from government security bodies -- to review a transaction . generally , national security is a primary factor or one of several factors considered in evaluating transactions . while the concepts of national security vary from country to country , all countries share concerns about a core set of issues . these include , for example , the defense industrial base , and more recently , investment in the energy sector and investment by state - owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds . most countries have established time frames for the review and can place conditions on transactions prior to approval . for example , a country may place national citizenship requirements on company board members . however , unlike the voluntary notification under exon - florio , most countries ' reviews are mandatory if the investment reaches certain dollar thresholds or if the buyer will obtain a controlling or blocking share in the acquired company . further , unlike the united states , five countries allow decisions to be appealed through administrative means or in court . two countries do not have a formal review process . the netherlands restricts entry into certain sectors such as public utilities , and the uae restricts the extent of ownership allowed in all sectors without a review . in addition to the formal mechanisms , there are unofficial factors that may influence investment in each of the 10 countries . for example , in some countries an informal government preapproval for sensitive transactions may be needed . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the treasury emphasized the united states ' commitment to an open investment policy .
