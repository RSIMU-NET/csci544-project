the department of defense ( dod ) is pursuing a new initiative involving a core competency approach for making sourcing decisions -- that is , sourcing decisions based on whether the function is core to the agency 's warfighting mission . in determining how to best perform non - core functions , dod 's position is that its components should look beyond just the use of public - private competitions under office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a - 76 in making sourcing decisions , and consider other alternatives such as partnering or employee stock ownership . gao was asked to assess the department 's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and the current status of dod 's a - 76 program . progress in assessing core functions has been varied and limited across major defense components , affected somewhat by ambiguous definitions of the term `` core function . . in some instances additional guidance was obtained , but definitions of core remain somewhat broad and subjective , and will likely remain so in the future . army and air force have led within dod in assessing core functions , but the army has done the most , and found , contrary to its expectations , that distinguishing between core and non - core functions does not , by itself , prescribe a sourcing decision . other factors must also be considered such as risk and operational considerations . the range of alternatives to a - 76 likely to be pursued under the core competency - based approach is not yet clear , but dod has made some progress toward identifying and / or using some alternatives through pilot projects and other efforts by the services as they have focused on the core initiative . however , the use of alternatives could be limited without special legislative authorities and / or repeal of various existing prohibitions , and some could be tempered by the department 's efforts to meet the a - 76 competitive sourcing goals set by omb . dod reported that as of june 1 , 2003 , it has met omb 's short - term goal to use the a - 76 process to study 15 percent of the positions identified in dod 's commercial activities inventory by the end of fiscal year 2003. however , meeting the longer - term goal to study at least 50 percent ( 226,000 ) of its nearly 453,000 commercial activity positions through fiscal year 2008 will present a challenge . this is nearly double the number of positions that dod has previously studied during a comparable time period , and providing sufficient resources ( financial and technical ) to complete the studies may prove challenging . also , the defense components , particularly the air force , plan to transfer certain military personnel into warfighting functions and replace them with government civilian and / or contractor personnel . this will require the components to reprioritize their funding for operation and maintenance accounts , because it is from those accounts the services must fund replacement civilian or contractor personnel .
