the presidential policy directive on united states cyber incident coordination states that significant cyber incidents are occurring with increasing frequency impacting public and private infrastructure in the united states . section 1648 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2016 included a provision that dod develop a comprehensive plan for cybercom to support civil authorities in responding to cyberattacks by foreign powers against the united states . section 1648 also included a provision that gao review dod 's plan . this review assesses the extent to which dod 's section 1648 report addressed the statutorily required submission elements . to conduct this work , gao assessed dod 's section 1648 report against the elements outlined in the statute . gao also discussed the section 1648 report with dod policy , joint chiefs of staff , combatant commands , and military service officials . the department of defense ( dod ) did not develop a comprehensive plan for u.s. cyber command ( cybercom ) ; instead , the department submitted a report consisting of a collection of documents that fully addressed two of the six statutorily required elements ; partially addressed three elements ; and did not address the sixth element on dod training activities . legend : â—‹ did not address : submission does not include required element . gao also found that , in addition to not addressing the training element in the report , dod had not ensured that staff are trained as required by the presidential policy directive on united states cyber incident coordination or dod 's significant cyber incident coordination procedures , which were included dod 's section 1648 report . taking action to improve these areas should help dod sustain progress it has already made . with the president 's decision to elevate cybercom to a unified combatant command , such actions will also help as dod continues to plan to support civil authorities in response to a cyber incident and where cybercom has a significant role . gao has previously recommended that dod take actions on elements of the section 1648 report that were partially addressed . gao is making two new recommendations that dod update cyber incident coordination training and maintain a list of officials trained in the national incident management system . dod concurred with maintaining a list of trained officials and partially concurred on updating cyber training . gao continues to believe the updating recommendation is warranted .
