about 13 percent of our nations electricity is produced by pressurized water reactors that rely on lithium - 7 , an isotope of lithium produced and exported solely by china and russia , for their safe operation . lithium - 7 is added to the water that cools the reactor core to prevent the cooling water from becoming acidic . without the lithium - 7 , the cooling waters acidity would increase the rate of corrosion of pipes and other infrastructurepossibly causing them to fail . utilities that operate the pressurized water reactors have experienced little difficulty obtaining lithium - 7 , but they may not be aware of all the risks of relying on two producers . gao was asked to review the supply and domestic demand for lithium - 7 and how risks are being managed . this report examines what is known about the supply and demand of lithium - 7 , what federal agencies are responsible for managing supply risks , and alternative options to mitigate a potential shortage . gao reviewed documents and interviewed officials from doe , nnsa , and nrc , in addition to industry representatives . this report is an unclassified version of a classified report also issued in september 2013. little is known about lithium - 7 production in china and russia and whether their supplies can meet future domestic demand . according to industry representatives , china and russia produce enough lithium - 7 to meet demand from u.s. pressurized water reactors , a type of commercial nuclear power reactor that requires lithium - 7 for safe operation . however , china 's continued supply may be reduced by its own growing demand , according to an expert that is familiar with china 's plans . specifically , china is building several pressurized water reactors and developing a new type of reactor that will require 1,000s of kilograms of lithium - 7 to operate , rather than the 300 kilograms needed annually for all 65 u.s. pressurized water reactors . relying on two producers of lithium - 7 leaves u.s. pressurized water reactors vulnerable to lithium - 7 supply disruptions . no federal entity has taken stewardship responsibility for assessing and managing risks to the lithium - 7 supply , but doe is taking some steps . risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks , communication of risks to stakeholders , and then taking steps to manage the risks , according to federal standards for internal control . officials at doe , the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , and the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) told gao they view lithium - 7 as a commercial commodity for which industry is responsible . industry representatives told gao that they had no concerns about the lithium - 7 supply , as they have experienced no problems in obtaining it . but gao learned that industry representatives may not be familiar with all the supply risks . notwithstanding , doe plans to set aside 200 kilograms of lithium - 7 and is funding research on lithium - 7 production methods . doe also studied lithium - 7 supply and demand and concluded that no further action is needed . however , gao found several shortcomings in its study , including that doe underestimated the amount of lithium - 7 used domestically . industry estimates show that about 300 kilograms of lithium - 7 are used annually in the united states , whereas doe estimated that 200 kilograms are used annually . this and other shortcomings make it unclear if doe 's conclusion is correct that no additional action is needed . based on information from agency officials and industry representatives , gao identified three options to mitigate a potential lithium - 7 shortage : building a domestic reserve is a low - cost option that could help in the short - term ; building a domestic production capability is a longer - term solution that could eliminate lithium - 7 imports , but take about 5 years and cost $ 10-12 million , according to nnsa ; and reducing pressurized water reactors ' reliance on lithium - 7 is another longer - term solution , but may require years of research and changes in how reactors are operated . gao recommends that the secretary of energy ensure a stable future supply of lithium - 7 by directing the isotope program to take on a stewardship role for lithium - 7 by taking steps , including fully assessing risks and accurately determining domestic demand . doe concurred with the recommendation .
