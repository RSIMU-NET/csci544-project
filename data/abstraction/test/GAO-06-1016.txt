in recent years , congress has expressed concerns about the federal land management agencies ' ability to provide quality recreational opportunities and reduce visitor confusion over the variety of user fees . in december 2004 , congress passed the federal lands recreation enhancement act ( rea ) to standardize recreation fee collection and use at federal lands and waters . gao was asked to determine what the agencies have done to coordinate implementation of rea , what agencies have done to implement rea , the extent to which agencies have controls and accounting procedures for collected fees , how projects and activities are selected to receive funding from fees , and the extent of unobligated fund balances . to answer these objectives , gao reviewed agency guidance , analyzed fee data , interviewed officials , visited 26 fee - collecting units , and administered a nationwide survey to 900 fee - collecting units . the departments of the interior ( doi ) and agriculture ( usda ) established four working groups to facilitate interagency cooperation and coordination of rea implementation . each working group has made progress , but some issues remain unresolved . for example , the interagency pass working group has yet to determine the price to charge for the new pass , which is to be implemented in january 2007. to implement rea , agencies reviewed their fee programs and made modifications to the fee programs at some of their units . for example , several of usda 's forest service units dropped 437 sites from their fee program , such as picnic areas , because they did not meet rea criteria . however , not all units are in compliance with rea . many agency officials said that while the agencies have issued some interim guidance , rea was difficult to interpret and suggested the need for more specific and detailed guidance on the fee program . in addition , doi 's bureau of reclamation has not yet determined whether to implement rea . reclamation is assessing how rea applies to its operations . some agencies lack adequate controls and accounting procedures for collected recreation fees and lack effective guidance for establishing such controls . on the basis of visits , some units did not have an effective means of verifying whether all collected fees are accounted for . in addition , many units have not implemented a system of routine audits to help ensure that fees are collected and used as authorized and that collected funds are safeguarded . the various agencies participating under rea have different processes for selecting projects to be funded with recreation fee revenues . at doi 's bureau of land management and fish and wildlife service and usda 's forest service , most proposed projects are approved at the local unit level , usually within a few weeks . at doi 's national park service , fee projects are reviewed and approved at the unit , regional , and headquarters or department level before projects are funded . according to national park service officials , under this process , it can sometimes take a year or more to obtain approval for a requested fee project , which delays project implementation and contributes to unobligated fee revenue balances . agencies have $ 300 million in unobligated fee revenue balances . unit officials cited several reasons for the unobligated balances , such as the need to save for large projects . many unit officials also said that recreation fee revenues are essential to providing services at their recreation areas that would not otherwise be funded .
