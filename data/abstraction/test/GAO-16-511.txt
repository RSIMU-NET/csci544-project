the federal government is expected to spend more than $ 90 billion on it in fiscal year 2017. this includes a variety of software applications supporting agencies ' enterprise needs . since 2013 , omb has advocated the use of application rationalization . this is a process by which an agency streamlines its portfolio of software applications with the goal of improving efficiency , reducing complexity and redundancy , and lowering the cost of ownership . gao 's objectives were to determine whether agencies have established complete application inventories and to what extent selected agencies have developed and implemented processes for rationalizing their portfolio of applications . to do this , gao assessed the inventories of the 24 cfo act agencies against four key practices and selected six agencies — the departments of defense , homeland security , the interior , labor , and nasa and nsf — due to their it spending , among other factors , to determine whether they had processes addressing applications . most of the 24 chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 agencies in the review fully met at least three of the four practices gao identified to determine if agencies had complete software application inventories . to be considered complete , an inventory should include business and enterprise information technology ( it ) systems as defined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) ; include these systems from all organizational components ; specify application name , description , owner , and function supported ; and be regularly updated . of the 24 agencies , 4 ( the departments of defense , homeland security , and justice , and the general services administration ) fully met all four practices , 9 fully met three practices , 6 fully met two practices , 2 fully met one practice , and 3 did not fully meet any practice ( see figure ) . a january 2016 omb requirement to complete an it asset inventory by the end of may 2016 contributed to most of the agencies fully meeting the first three practices . agencies that did not fully address these practices stated , among other things , their focus on major and high risk investments as a reason for not having complete inventories . however , not accounting for all applications may result in missed opportunities to identify savings and efficiencies . it is also inconsistent with omb guidance regarding implementation of it acquisition reform law , referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act , which requires that chief information officers at covered agencies have increased visibility into all it resources . not accounting for all applications also presents a security risk since agencies can only secure assets if they are aware of them . each of the six selected agencies relied on their investment management processes and , in some cases , supplemental processes to rationalize their applications to varying degrees . however , five of the six agencies acknowledged that their processes did not always allow for collecting or reviewing the information needed to effectively rationalize all their applications . the sixth agency , the national science foundation ( nsf ) , stated its processes allow it to effectively rationalize its applications , but agency documentation supporting this assertion was incomplete . only one agency — the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — had plans to address shortcomings . taking action to address identified weaknesses with agencies ' existing processes for rationalizing applications would assist with identifying additional opportunities to reduce duplication and achieve savings . gao is recommending that 20 agencies improve their inventories and five of the selected agencies take actions to improve their processes to rationalize their applications more completely . the department of defense disagreed with both recommendations made to it . after reviewing additional evidence , gao removed the recommendation associated with improving the inventory but maintained the other . the other agencies agreed to or had no comments on the draft report .
