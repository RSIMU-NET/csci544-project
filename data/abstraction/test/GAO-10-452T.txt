the u.s. census bureau ( bureau ) is tasked with conducting an accurate count of people living in dwellings known as group quarters as part of the 2010 census . group quarters consist of college dormitories , prisons , nursing homes , and other facilities typically owned or managed by an entity providing housing , services , or both for the residents . during the 2000 census , for a variety of reasons , group quarters were sometimes counted more than once , missed , or included in the wrong location . as requested , this testimony will focus on the extent to which the bureau has strengthened its procedures for counting group quarters compared to the 2000 census , and particular challenges and opportunities for an accurate group quarters count in brooklyn . the testimony is based on previously issued and ongoing gao work in new york and elsewhere . the bureau developed and tested new procedures to address the difficulties it had in identifying and counting group quarters during the 2000 census . for example , the bureau moved from manual to gps - generated map spots , which should reduce the chance of human error and of group quarters populations being counted in the wrong jurisdiction ; moved from a telephone interview to a field verification approach , which should increase accuracy ; and combined the conventional housing unit and group quarters address lists into a single address list , which should reduce the chance of double counting . moreover , the bureau implemented a three - pronged approach to locate and count group quarters . the approach consisted of group quarters validation , where temporary census workers visited each group quarter and interviewed its manager or administrator to determine whether the dwelling was a group quarters or some other type of residence . if the dwelling was in fact a group quarters , it was then determined what category it fit under , and its correct geographic location was confirmed . this was followed by the group quarters advance visit , which is currently under way . census workers are to verify the location of the group quarters ; identify contact officials ; and schedule the date , time and other information to help conduct the actual enumeration . the actual count of group quarters residents is conducted during the third phase of the approach , group quarter enumeration from the end of march to mid - may . the effort includes an operation known as service - based enumeration , during which people commonly referred to as homeless are counted . additional procedures to ensure a complete count of group quarters include a series of quality assurance procedures , such as supervisory review of workers ' assignments . brooklyn presents challenges as well as opportunities . for example , a planning database the bureau developed to help it target its resources placed brooklyn on a list of top 50 u.s. counties with the highest number of people living in hard - to - count areas , based on data from the 2000 census . factors that contribute to the hard - to - count designation include poverty levels , high levels of non - english speakers , complex household arrangements , as well as a high percentage of rental and vacant units , multi - unit buildings , and crowded housing . in light of these demographic and housing challenges , a successful group quarters count will , at a minimum , depend on how well the bureau executes the following activities : complete remaining group quarters activities on schedule , implement the group quarters quality assurance procedures as planned , and closely monitor key performance metrics to ensure that the group quarters count proceeds on track and quickly address any glitches . it will also be important for the bureau to ensure that census workers have knowledge of neighborhood culture and living arrangements , and possess the language skills to reach out to residents with limited english proficiency .
