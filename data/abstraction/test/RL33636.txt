recent increases in energy prices and a steady escalation in global energy demand — expected to rise by nearly 60 % over the next 20 years — have led u.s. policy - makers to engage in a wide ranging debate over how best to address the country 's future energy requirements . similarly , energy security has become a policy priority for the european union ( eu ) and its 27 member states . the eu imports about 50 % of its energy needs . barring significant changes , the european commission expects this figure to rise to 65 % by 2030. about half of the eu 's natural gas imports and 30 % of its imported oil come from russia . europe 's growing dependence on russian energy , and long - term energy agreements between russian firms and some european governments have fueled speculation that moscow is using the `` energy weapon '' to try to influence european foreign and economic policy . the eu has traditionally exerted little if any influence over individual member state energy policy . however , in march 2007 , in the face of increasing concern about europe 's reliance on russian energy , and growing public pressure to address global climate change , eu member states agreed to forge an `` energy policy for europe . . they have agreed on a set of eu - wide targets — some legally binding — to increase the use of renewable energy , and reduce carbon emissions . however , member states continue to pursue divergent external energy policies , particularly toward russia , and some european countries remain reluctant to cede national control over energy markets . the united states and europe have steadily broadened the transatlantic energy dialogue to include joint promotion of collective energy security , energy efficiency and alternative energy sources . at the april 2007 u.s. - eu summit , leaders on both sides of the atlantic agreed to advance cooperation to develop alternative and renewable energy technologies . however , u.s. officials have expressed concern at some european member states ' unwillingness to exert more pressure on russia to comply with eu market principles . on the other hand , european leaders appear increasingly frustrated with u.s. reluctance to pursue binding multilateral regulatory frameworks to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency . members of congress have expressed an interest in efforts to increase european energy security , particularly vis - a - vis russia . in the first session of the 110th congress , committees held hearings that touched on the issue of european energy dependence on russia , and on european efforts to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use . the second session of the 110th congress may also hold hearings and pursue legislation on various aspects of eu energy policy . this report examines some of europe 's critical energy security challenges and eu efforts to coordinate a common european energy strategy . it also includes an overview of broader transatlantic energy security cooperation and will be updated as needed . for additional information , see crs report rl34261 , russian energy policy toward neighboring countries , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report rs22409 , nato and energy security , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
