as congress considers the role and design of appropriate budget enforcement mechanisms in changing the government 's fiscal path , this testimony outlines some elements that could facilitate debate and contribute to efforts to place the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path . budgeting is the process by which we as a nation resolve the large number of often conflicting objectives that citizens seek to achieve through government action . the budget determines the fiscal policy stance of the government -- that is , the relationship between spending and revenues . and it is through the budget process that congress and the president reach agreement about the areas in which the federal government will be involved and in what way . because these decisions are so important , we expect a great deal from our budget and budget process . we want the budget to be clear and understandable . we want the process to be simple -- or at least not too complex . but at the same time we want a process that presents congress and the american people with a framework to understand the significant choices and the information necessary to make the best - informed decisions about federal tax and spending policy . this is not easy . since our first simulations in 1992 , we have continued to report on the nature and drivers of the long - term imbalance and on mechanisms to help address the challenge . focusing on the long term does not mean ignoring the near term . while concerns about the strength of the economy may argue for phasing in policy changes over time , the longer action to change the government 's long - term fiscal path is delayed , the greater the risk that the eventual changes will be more disruptive and more destabilizing . starting on the path to sustainability now offers many advantages . our increased awareness of the dangers presented by the long - term fiscal outlook leads to a focus on enforcement provisions within the budget process that can facilitate the debate and contribute to efforts to put the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path . the budget process is the framework within which enforcement mechanisms exist . no process can force choices congress and the president are unwilling to make . having an agreed - upon goal justifies and frames the choices that must be made . a budget process can facilitate or hamper substantive decisions , but it can not replace them . while no process can substitute for making the difficult choices , it can help structure the debate . the budget structure can make clear information necessary for important decisions or the structure can make some information harder to find . the process can highlight trade - offs and set rules for action . in our past work , we have identified four broad principles or criteria for a budget process that can help congress consider the design and structure of future budget enforcement mechanisms . a process should 1. provide information about the long - term effect of decisions , both macro -- linking fiscal policy to the long - term economic outlook -- and micro -- providing recognition of the long - term spending implications of government commitments , 2. provide information and be structured to focus on important trade - offs such as the trade - off between investment and consumption spending , 3. provide information necessary to make informed trade - offs between the different policy tools of government ( such as tax provisions , grants , and credit programs ) , and 4. be enforceable , provide for control and accountability , and be transparent , using clear , consistent definitions . first , selecting the appropriate time horizon in which the budgetary impact of policy decisions should be measured is not just an abstract question for analysts . if the time horizon is too short , congress may have insufficient information about the potential cost of a program . in addition , too short a time horizon may create incentives to artificially shift costs into the future rather than find a sustainable solution . second , the structure and rules can determine the nature of the trade - offs surfaced during the budget process . consumption may be favored over investment because the initial cost of an infrastructure project looks high in comparison to support for consumption . distinguishing between support for current consumption and investing in economic growth in the budget would help eliminate a perceived bias against investments requiring large up - front spending . the third principle focuses on the method through which the federal government provides support for any federal goal or objective . the budget and budget process should provide the information necessary to permit looking across federal agencies and policy tools -- which means across committee jurisdictions -- to make an informed choice . lastly , the budget process should be enforceable , provide for control and accountability , and be transparent .
