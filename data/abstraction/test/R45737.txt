in 1994 , congress passed and president clinton signed the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 ( p.l . 103-322 ) , which , among other things , made prisoners ineligible for pell grants . however , concerns about the financial and social costs of the growing prison population combined with concerns about the recidivism rate of released prisoners have led some policymakers to reconsider whether prisoners should be allowed to use pell grants to help cover the cost of postsecondary coursework . pell grants are intended to assist in making the benefits of postsecondary education available to eligible students who demonstrate financial need . under department of education ( ed ) regulations , any student who is `` serving a criminal sentence in a federal or state penitentiary , prison , jail , reformatory , work farm , or other similar correctional institution '' is not eligible to receive a pell grant . however , in 2015 ed used its authority under the higher education act ( hea ) to create the second chance pell experiment to determine if access to pell grants would increase the enrollment of incarcerated individuals in high - quality postsecondary correctional education programs . under the experiment , participating institutions of higher education , in partnership with federal and / or state correctional institutions , award pell grants to students who are otherwise pell - eligible except for being incarcerated in a federal or state institution . the experiment is expected to conclude in 2020. there are several issues policymakers might consider if congress chooses to take up legislation to reinstate prisoners ' eligibility for pell grants , including the following : the pell grant program is a need based program that provides funds to all that qualify . thus , restoring pell grant eligibility to all federal and state prisoners will increase pell grant program costs . should tax dollars be used to educate convicted offenders before they are released from prison ? . there are some prisoners who have been sentenced to death , whose sentences exceed their life expectancy , or who might be civilly committed indefinitely under sexually dangerous persons statutes after they have served their prison sentences . should these prisoners be eligible to receive pell grants ? . educational attainment is lower among incarcerated adults than non - incarcerated adults and even prisoners with high school diplomas or general education development ( ged ) certificates might need additional assistance to help them prepare for the rigors of postsecondary education . is there a need for additional investment in remedial education or adult basic education for prisoners to help them prepare for postsecondary education classes ? . under current law and regulation , to be eligible for a pell grant males who are subject to registration with the selective service system ( sss ) must register or prove they were either not required by sss to register or failed to register for an ed - qualifying reason . there is a higher incidence of not registering among men who have been incarcerated during some or all of the period between ages 18 to 25. should this requirement be retained for incarcerated men , or should the process for proving exceptions be modified to facilitate pell grant eligibility for incarcerated men ? . there is a lack of rigorous evaluations that have isolated the effects postsecondary education has on recidivism , and little research on the best way to deliver postsecondary education in prisons . should congress take steps to promote data collection on the availability of , and participation in , postsecondary education to advance research on the effects of postsecondary education on recidivism ? . there can be barriers to providing educational programming in a correctional environment ( e.g . , lack of classroom space and trained instructors , limitations on internet access ) regardless of pell grant receipt . are there steps congress could take to mitigate these barriers ? . a criminal history can be a barrier to securing employment in a variety of fields , either because some convicted offenders are prohibited from working in certain jobs due to a provision in law or regulation , or because employers are wary of hiring someone with a criminal history . is there interest in undertaking any efforts to reduce the collateral consequences of a criminal history on post - release employment to allow the incarcerated student to fully realize the benefits of postsecondary education ? .
