on march 3 , 2014 , the environmental protection agency finalized new ( `` tier 3 '' ) emission standards for light duty ( and some larger ) motor vehicles . light duty vehicles include cars , suvs , vans , and most pickup trucks . phase - in of the standards will begin with model year 2017. by the time tier 3 is fully implemented in model year 2025 , the standards for light duty vehicles will require reductions of about 80 % in tailpipe emissions of non - methane organic gases and nitrogen oxides ( both of which contribute to the formation of ground - level ozone ) and of about 70 % in tailpipe emissions of particulates . ozone and particulates are the most widespread air pollutants in the united states . both contribute to respiratory illness and premature mortality . epa estimates that implementation of the standards will reduce premature mortality by 770 to 2,000 persons annually , as well as providing reductions in hospital admissions , lost work days , school absences , and restricted activity days for persons with respiratory illness . assigning monetary values to these benefits , epa estimates the annual benefits at between $ 6.7 billion and $ 19 billion in 2030. like the current `` tier 2 '' standards , which were promulgated in 2000 and phased in between model years 2004 and 2009 , the tier 3 standards treat vehicles and fuels as a system : reductions in vehicle emissions are easier to achieve if the fuel used contains less sulfur . the tier 3 standards will require that gasoline contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm ) sulfur on an annual average basis beginning january 1 , 2017 , down from 30 ppm under the tier 2 program . the fuel standards will match limits already attained in california and in much of the world , including the european union , japan , and korea , and proposed for adoption in china . further , the rule extends the required useful life of emission control equipment from 120,000 miles to 150,000 miles , and sets standards for heavier duty gasoline - powered vehicles . the standards will also require about a 50 % reduction in evaporative emissions ( some of which also contribute to ozone formation and / or cause health problems directly ) . epa estimates the cost of the rules at $ 1.1 billion annually in 2017 to $ 1.5 billion annually in 2030. the agency estimates that the rule will add $ 33 to $ 88 to the cost of a new vehicle , and less than one cent to the price of a gallon of gasoline . the effect on gasoline prices has been the most controversial issue : the american petroleum institute contends that the tighter sulfur controls will impose almost $ 10 billion in refinery capital expenditures and increase gasoline manufacturing costs by 6 to 9 cents per gallon . but , in addition to epa , at least two studies by third - party consultants conclude that the costs will be far less than api 's estimate . to address refining industry concerns , the final rule will allow a three - year delay in compliance for small refiners . it also includes averaging , banking , and trading programs that will give the refining industry some flexibility in meeting the standards . the auto industry is generally supportive of the rule â€” five auto companies , five trade groups , and the united auto workers union have issued statements of support , and a gm executive joined the epa administrator as she announced the standards . the standards facilitate the adoption of new technologies necessary to meet greenhouse gas standards already promulgated by epa . in addition , california and 12 other states have already adopted tailpipe standards similar to tier 3. proponents contend that the harmonization of national standards eliminates the threat of a patchwork of state requirements and decreases compliance costs by preserving a unified national market . many in congress have expressed concern about the potential impacts of the rule . as a result , congress can be expected to continue oversight as the rule is implemented .
