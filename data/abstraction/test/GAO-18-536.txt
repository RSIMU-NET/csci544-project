since 2005 , the federal government has enacted various statutes aimed at accelerating the environmental review process for highway and transit projects . in addition , the clean water act and the endangered species act may require three federal agencies — the corps , fws , and nmfs — to issue permits or perform consultations before a project can proceed . gao is required by statute to assess the extent to which statutory provisions have accelerated and improved environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . this report examines , among other things : 1 ) the impact of streamlining provisions on consulting and permitting time frames , and additional actions used by federal resource agencies to streamline their reviews . gao analyzed permitting and consulting data from the 3 federal agencies and interviewed officials from the 3 agencies , 16 agency field offices , and 7 state dots for their perspectives on the effect of streamlining provisions and other efforts . gao selected these offices to include a range of locations and those with a greater number of permits and consultations , among other factors . federally funded highway and transit projects must be analyzed for their potential environmental effects , as required by the national environmental policy act , and may be subject to other environmental protection laws , including the clean water act and the endangered species act . these laws may require the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to issue permit decisions and the u.s. fish and wildlife service ( fws ) and the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to conduct consultations before a project can proceed . these three agencies are referred to as “ resource agencies ” for this report . the three most recent transportation reauthorization acts include provisions that are intended to streamline various aspects of the environmental review process ; 18 of these provisions could potentially affect time frames for the environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . while officials gao interviewed at resource agencies and state departments of transportation ( state dot ) noted that some actions called for by the 18 statutory provisions have helped streamline the consultation and permitting processes for highway and transit projects , gao found that a lack of reliable agency data regarding permitting and consulting time frames hinders a quantitative analysis of the provisions ' impact . officials said , for example , that a provision that allows federal liaison positions at resource agencies to focus solely on processing applications for state dot projects has helped avoid delays in permit and consultation reviews . however , none of the three resource agencies could provide enough reliable data to analyze changes in the durations of consultations and permit reviews over time for any of the provisions . further , gao identified limitations , such as negative or missing values , and inconsistent data entry practices for fws and nmfs data . fws and nmfs have limited controls , such as electronic safeguards and other data - entry procedures , to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their data on the duration of consultations . left unaddressed , these data quality issues may impair the agencies ' ability to accurately determine whether they are meeting their 135-day statutory and regulatory deadlines to complete consultations and provide biological opinions , and could affect their ability to provide accurate data on time frames for efforts of the office of management and budget to track agencies ' performance in conducting environmental reviews . while fws and nmfs officials stated that the agencies plan to improve their tracking systems , the agencies do not have documented plans or time frames for the improvements and it is unclear whether the efforts will include internal controls to improve data reliability . some federal resource agency and state dot officials gao interviewed identified additional actions that have been used to streamline the consultation and permitting processes to avoid delays in agency reviews . for example , 16 of the 23 resource agency and state dot officials said that field office staff provided training to state dot staff about the information field offices required for permit or consultation applications . resource agency and state dot officials also identified electronic systems with environmental data and for submitting documents as streamlining actions that have been helpful . gao is making two recommendations , one to fws and one to nmfs , to develop plans and time frames for improving their tracking systems and to develop internal controls to improve data reliability . the departments of commerce and interior concurred with our recommendations .
