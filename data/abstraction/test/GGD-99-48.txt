pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) program to audit income tax returns through correspondence , focusing on : the number , results , and duration of correspondence audits as well as the characteristics of the audited returns ; and processes and requirements that irs has had for years to govern correspondence audits . gao noted that : several weaknesses were found in irs ' correspondence audit processes ; these weaknesses , individually or in combination , can erode the integrity of the correspondence audit processes , which are designed to help ensure that taxpayers pay the correct tax amounts and are treated properly ; during fiscal years 1992-1997 , the annual number and results of correspondence audits conducted by irs varied considerably ; the number ranged annually from just over 200,000 to about 1.1 million audits ; the rate at which irs auditors closed audits without recommending additional taxes ranged from 13 percent to 46 percent ; when they did recommend additional taxes , the average amounts ranged from $ 1,300 to $ 2,800 ; the rate at which taxpayers did not respond to these recommended additional taxes after being requested to do so by irs ranged from 29 percent to 63 percent ; these variations resulted , in part , from an increase in the number of correspondence audits of returns claiming an earned income credit ( eic ) ; for the traditional correspondence audits closed in fiscal year 1996 , the time between the filing of a return and the start of the correspondence audit averaged 10 months ; it then took 11 more months before irs assessed any taxes that were recommended during the audits ; as for the characteristics of these 1996 returns , an estimated 75 percent had reported adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 15,000 ; in part , this percentage reflects the correspondence audit 's focus on simple tax issues and eic ; irs had weaknesses in implementing the correspondence audit requirements for four processes ; not all of the traditional correspondence audits closed in 1996 were manually reviewed ( or classified ) to identify all issues for audit , as required by irs ; support for recommended audit findings was not adequately documented in the audit workpaper files , as required , for about one - third of the audits ; the taxpayer documentation that was required to justify eic claims varied from service center to service center ; gao found weaknesses in the reviews that irs did on a sample of closed audits to measure their quality ; and in addition to the weaknesses in implementing the requirements , irs allowed service centers to exclude certain types of audits that did not have all required documentation from being measured against the audit standard on workpaper documentation .
