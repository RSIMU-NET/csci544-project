one of the goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes to the position they occupied before the crime was committed by providing compensation . various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting , ordering , and collecting restitution for crime victims , including doj and the judiciary . the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 includes a provision for gao to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. this report addresses , among other things : the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by doj and ordered by courts ; the amount of restitution debt doj collected and the amount that remains outstanding ; and , the extent to which doj has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution . gao analyzed laws , policies and procedures as well as ussc data on restitution orders and doj data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. gao also selected a non - generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with usao officials and federal probation officers . officials from selected u.s. attorney 's offices ( usao ) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls , such as the use of templates and forms , throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate . gao 's analysis of u.s. sentencing commission ( ussc ) data — an agency within the judiciary — showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. specifically , 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158 , or 15 percent , of those offenders . collectively , courts ordered these offenders to pay $ 33.9 billion in restitution . most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug - related offenses . in interviews , usao officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution . gao found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve ussc data . gao 's analysis of department of justice ( doj ) data showed that usaos collected $ 2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , see figure below . however , at the end of fiscal year 2016 , $ 110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding , and usaos identified $ 100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders ' inability to pay . doj identified improving debt collection — including restitution — as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 strategic plan . while doj is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution , it has not established performance measures or goals . performance measures and goals would allow doj to gauge usaos ' success in collecting restitution and , by extension , the department 's success in achieving a major management initiative . gao is making three recommendations . gao is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete . gao is making two recommendations to doj , including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution . the judiciary and doj concurred with the recommendations .
