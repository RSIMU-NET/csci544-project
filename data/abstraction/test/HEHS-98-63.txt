pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on : the changes that have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing ; the changes that have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who work and the number of hours they work ; how undergraduate borrowing and work patterns differ by type of school , year in school , dependency status , family income , and race / ethnicity ; and information concerning the amounts of education debt parents incur . gao based its review in large part on an analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study . gao noted that : over the past several years , students have turned increasingly to borrowing to cope with rising education costs ; at the undergraduate level , the percentage of postsecondary students who had borrowed by the time they completed their programs ( received a bachelor 's degree , associate degree , or award or certificate ) increased from 41 percent in 1992-93 to 52 percent in 1995-96 ; the average amount of debt per student increased from about $ 7,800 to about $ 9,700 in constant 1995-96 dollars ; for graduating seniors ( recipients of bachelor 's degrees ) and who had borrowed , the average rose from about $ 10,100 to about $ 13,300 ; the portion of these graduates with $ 20,000 or more of student debt grew from 9 percent to 19 percent during the period ; students attending 4-year public institutions showed the largest increase in the number of borrowers ; sixty percent of seniors graduating from these schools in 1995-96 borrowed at some point in their program , up from 42 percent in 1992-93 and about even with the percentage of borrowers at private 4-year schools ; students at 2-year public institutions borrowed least often and in lesser amounts ; at the graduate and professional levels , the percentage of borrowers and the level of debt generally increased ; higher borrowing levels were especially pronounced at professional schools , where average debt among borrowers completing their programs climbed from about $ 45,000 in 1992-93 to nearly $ 60,000 in 1995-96 ; more full - time undergraduates worked while attending school in 1995-96 than in 1992-93 ; more than two - thirds of full - time undergraduate students held jobs during 1995-96 , working an average of 23 hours a week while enrolled ; at graduate and professional schools , the percentage of full - time students who worked changed little over the same period ; about two - thirds of master 's and doctoral students worked , usually in part - time jobs directly related to their field of study ; at professional schools , less than half worked while enrolled ; some variations in borrowing and work patterns can also be seen on the basis of the cost of attendance , dependency status , family income , and gender ; however , most characteristics are not very strong predictors of how much undergraduates were likely to borrow or work ; little information is available about amounts of debt parents accumulate in order to pay for their children 's postsecondary education ; and in general , household debt for education remains a small share of household debt .
