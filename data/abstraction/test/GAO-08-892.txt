in 2007 , the department of state ( state ) reported that some foreign diplomats may be abusing the household workers they brought to the united states on a - 3 or g - 5 visas . gao was asked to determine the number of a - 3 or g - 5 visa holders who have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , review the u.s. government 's process for investigating these allegations , and assess how state ensures that its policies for issuing a - 3 and g - 5 visas are implemented correctly and consistently . gao analyzed documents , interviewed officials , and conducted fieldwork at four consular posts that issue large numbers of a - 3 or g - 5 visas . gao identified 42 household workers with a - 3 or g - 5 visas who alleged that they were abused by foreign diplomats with immunity from 2000 through 2008 , but the total number is likely higher . the total number of alleged incidents since 2000 is likely higher for four reasons : household workers ' fear of contacting law enforcement , nongovernmental organizations ' protection of victim confidentiality , limited information on some cases handled by the u.s. government , and federal agencies ' challenges identifying cases . for example , state has several offices that receive allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats , but no single office maintains information on all allegations . the u.s. government 's process for investigating alleged abuse of household workers by foreign diplomats is complicated by three factors . first , immunity can pose constraints for law enforcement in collecting evidence . second , the status of foreign diplomats can heighten their workers ' sense of vulnerability , causing the workers to fear cooperating with investigators . third , the length of time it takes to obtain a legal opinion from state on the permissibility of using certain investigative techniques can hamper investigations . according to state , although some techniques are clearly prohibited by international law ( such as searching certain diplomats ' residences ) , the permissibility of others under international law is less clear . in advising on the use of investigative techniques , state considers legal and policy issues , such as reciprocity -- assessing how u.s. diplomats abroad might be affected by actions taken toward a foreign diplomat on u.s. soil . state may ask justice to provide information to help determine the permissibility of certain techniques , but the process of obtaining this information can be difficult and time consuming for justice . although both state and justice have discussed creating a process to avoid delays , no formal actions have , thus far , been taken to establish one . weaknesses exist in state 's process for ensuring correct and consistent implementation of policies and procedures for issuing a - 3 and g - 5 visas . gao 's review of employment contracts submitted at four consular posts by a - 3 and g - 5 visa applicants showed that they often did not include state 's required components , such as a guarantee of the minimum or prevailing wage . gao also found that officers at the four posts were unclear about or unfamiliar with certain aspects of state 's guidance . few of the officers were aware that they should inform a - 3 and g - 5 visa applicants of their rights under u.s. law during their interview . some officers at the four posts also were uncertain about the reasons for refusing a - 3 or g - 5 visas . state is considering adding provisions to its guidance that would more clearly stipulate reasons for refusing these visas , such as if an a - 3 or g - 5 applicant seeks to work for a foreign diplomat who is linked to a pattern of employee disappearance , abuse allegations , or other irregularities . however , state has not reached internal agreement on these provisions and has set no timetable for doing so . state headquarters officials said they rely on individual posts to monitor implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa policies and procedures and do not routinely assess posts ' complianc .
