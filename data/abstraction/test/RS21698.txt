congress has expressed a great deal of interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) to surveil the united states ' international land border . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) utilizes advanced technology to augment its usbp agents ' ability to patrol the border , including a fleet of six uavs . this report examines the strengths and limitations of deploying uavs along the borders and related issues for congress . uavs come with several costs and benefits . one potential benefit of uavs is that they could fill a gap in current border surveillance by improving coverage along remote sections of the u.s. borders . moreover , the range of uavs is a significant asset when compared to border agents on patrol or stationary surveillance equipment . yet , despite potential benefits of using uavs for homeland security , various problems encountered in the past may hinder uav implementation on the border . there are concerns regarding the high accident rates of uavs , which have historically been multiple times higher than that of manned aircraft . inclement weather conditions can also impinge on a uav 's surveillance capability . also , according to the cbp inspector general , the costs of operating a uav are more than double the costs of operating a manned aircraft . recent attention has focused on the expanding area of operations for cbp - operated uavs . on june 23 , 2010 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) granted a certificate of authorization requested by cbp , clearing the uav flights along the texas border and gulf region . other requests have reportedly been delayed due to safety concerns , some of which stem from previous incidents . despite safety concerns , some policymakers continue to call for the increased domestic use of uavs . the supplemental appropriations bill of fy2010 ( h.r . 4899 ) would include $ 32 million for the acquisition of two additional uavs by cbp . this report will be updated as events warrant .
