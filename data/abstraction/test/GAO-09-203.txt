in carrying out its mission to ensure that securities markets are fair , orderly , and efficiently maintained , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) relies extensively on computerized systems . effective information security controls are essential to ensure that sec 's financial and sensitive information is protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , disclosure , or destruction . as part of its audit of sec 's financial statements , gao assessed the status of sec 's actions to correct previously reported information security weaknesses and the effectiveness of sec 's controls for ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of its information systems and information . to do this , gao examined security policies and artifacts , interviewed pertinent officials , and conducted tests and observations of controls in operation . sec has made important progress toward correcting previously reported information security control weaknesses . specifically , it has corrected or mitigated 18 of 34 weaknesses previously reported as unresolved at the time of our prior audit . for example , sec has adequately validated electronic certificates from connections to its network , physically secured the perimeter of its operations center and put in place a process to monitor unusual and suspicious activities , and removed network system accounts and data center access rights from separating employees . in addition , the commission has made progress in improving its information security program . to illustrate , it has developed , documented , and implemented a policy on remedial action plans to ensure that deficiencies are mitigated in an effective and timely manner , and provided individuals with training for incident handling . nevertheless , sec has not completed actions to correct 16 previously reported weaknesses . for example , it did not adequately document access privileges granted to users of a key financial application , and did not always implement patches on vulnerable workstations and enterprise database servers . in addition to the 16 previously reported weakness that remain uncorrected , gao identified 23 new weaknesses in controls intended to restrict access to data and systems , as well as weaknesses in other information security controls , that continue to jeopardize the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of sec 's financial and sensitive information and information systems . the commission has not fully implemented effective controls to prevent , limit , or detect unauthorized access to computing resources . for example , it did not always consistently enforce strong controls for identifying and authenticating users , sufficiently restrict user access to systems encrypt network services , audit and monitor security - relevant events for its databases , and physically protect its computer resources . sec also did not consistently ensure appropriate segregation of incompatible duties or adequately manage the configuration of its financial information systems . a key reason for these weaknesses is that the commission has not yet fully implemented its information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating as intended . specifically , sec has not effectively or fully implemented key program activities . for example , it has not filled the vacancy for a senior agency information security officer , fully reported or assessed risks , sufficiently tested and evaluated the effectiveness of its information system controls , and certified and accredited a key intermediary subsystem . although progress has been made , significant and preventable information security control deficiencies create continuing risks of the misuse of federal assets , unauthorized modification or destruction of financial information , inappropriate disclosure of other sensitive information , and disruption of critical operations .
