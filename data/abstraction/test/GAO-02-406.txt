because of internal control weaknesses , the department of education 's student financial assistance programs are at high risk for fraud or erroneous payments . gao discovered fraud in the grant and loan areas and pervasive control breakdowns and improper payments in other areas . controls over grant and loan disbursements lacked a key edit check or follow - up process that would identify schools improperly disbursing pell grants . significant internal control weaknesses over education 's third party drafts also increased the department 's vulnerability . gao found that individual education employees could control the entire payment process for third party drafts . education employees also circumvented a key computerized control designed to prevent duplicate payments . education eliminated third party drafts in may 2001. inconsistent and inadequate authorization and review processes for purchase cards , combined with a lack of monitoring , meant that improper purchases were unlikely to be detected . inadequate control over these expenditures , combined with the inherent risk of fraud and abuse associated with purchase cards , led to fraudulent , improper , and questionable purchases totaling $ 686,000 . poor internal controls over computers acquired with purchase cards and third party drafts led to 241 missing personal computers and other equipment valued at $ 261,500 . although education changed policies and procedures over disbursements to improve internal controls and program integrity , many of these changes have not been effectively implemented .
