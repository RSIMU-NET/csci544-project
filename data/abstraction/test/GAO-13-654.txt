states foreign service promotion process follows an up - or - out principle , under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified time leads to mandatory retirement for personnel in certain occupational categories . states oig and the foreign service grievance board identified procedural concerns relating to the process in 2010. gao was asked to review the foreign service promotion process . this report examines states process for ranking and promoting foreign service personnel , procedural changes state has made to its foreign service promotion process in response to identified concerns , and the extent to which updated procedures were consistently followed in 2011 and 2012 and whether any notable concerns about the promotion process remain . gao reviewed laws and procedures ; analyzed selection , performance standards , and reconstituted board files as well as grievance case files for the 2011 and 2012 promotion cycles ; interviewed state officials ; and contacted 2011 and 2012 board members to offer them an opportunity to comment on the process . the department of state 's ( state ) foreign service promotion process includes convening several types of boards to evaluate candidates for promotion and identify other candidates for possible separation from the service . state has a separate process to address related grievances . selection boards review all candidates and sort them into one of three categories : promotable , mid - ranked , and low - ranked . the selection boards produce rank - ordered lists of those candidates recommended for promotion , and a `` cut line '' is subsequently determined based on the number of available promotion slots . before announcing promotions , state vets all recommended candidates to determine whether there are outstanding issues , such as a pending investigation , that can lead to their removal from the promotion list . subsequently , state convenes performance standards boards to assess low - ranked candidates for possible separation from the service . there are several mechanisms to address grievances relating to the promotion process . for example , state may initiate reconstituted boards to reassess candidates if a board failed to follow the procedures or if the underlying performance information contained omissions or inaccuracies . employees not satisfied with grievance outcomes can file an appeal with the foreign service grievance board . in response to concerns identified by the office of inspector general ( oig ) and foreign service grievance board in 2010 , state has taken a number of actions to strengthen its foreign service promotion process internal controls . for example , in response to concerns about improper introduction of information about candidates , state instituted a requirement that board members sign an oath to adhere to the promotion criteria and protect the confidentiality of board materials . state also revised its procedures governing recusal requests , thereby broadening the provisions under which a candidate can request an individual board member 's recusal from reviewing their file . in addition , state updated its reconstituted board procedures , outlining a set of required documents , such as signed board member score sheets , to be included in each board 's official record . in addition to actions taken in response to others ' identified concerns , state initiated other practices to strengthen promotion process safeguards , such as including selection board and reconstituted board member recusal memos in the final board report . gao found that foreign service selection boards , performance standards boards , and reconstituted boards complied with many of state 's updated procedures in the 2011 and 2012 foreign service promotion cycles , but some board reports had documentation gaps for certain internal controls . for example , all 41 selection board reports we reviewed included a signed memo certifying final results . however , only 29 of 41 selection boards had signed oaths from all board members , and 45 of 122 required oaths were missing from 2012 selection board reports . in addition , some board reports lacked documentation of some recusal requests . the absence of a fully documented system of controls increases the risk that intentional or unintentional failures to implement safeguards , by board members or state human resources staff , may go undetected and uncorrected . such a failure to implement safeguards , in turn , increases the risk that the integrity of promotion results could be intentionally or inadvertently compromised . gao recommends that state take actions to ensure full implementation of promotion process internal controls . state concurred with gao 's recommendation .
