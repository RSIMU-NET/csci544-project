the catastrophic devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in late august 2005 , and to a lesser degree , hurricanes wilma and rita , led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of families . following the storm , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) took primary responsibility for meeting the emergency housing needs of displaced families . the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the nation 's housing agency , also played a role . hud modified its existing grant programs — primarily through waivers — to make them more flexible for communities wishing to serve displaced families . the department also took steps to aid displaced families that had been homeless or receiving hud assistance prior to the storm by developing a new voucher program , and by issuing guidance to lenders offering protections for homeowners with fha - insured mortgages . finally , congress has used hud programs , particularly the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program , as a conduit for providing relief and recovery funds to devastated communities . this report details hud 's efforts to provide assistance to affected families and communities immediately after the storm and in the initial rebuilding stages . it will not track hud 's role in the longer - term rebuilding of the devastated areas .
