dod invests roughly $ 70 billion annually in weapon system research , development , test , and evaluation , including prototyping activities . prototyping can help reduce risk in weapon system acquisition programs by improving understanding of technologies , requirements , and proposed solutions . it can also contribute to innovation by demonstrating the value of new technologies or systems . house conference report 114-102 accompanying a bill for the fiscal year 2016 national defense authorization act included a provision for gao to review how dod 's research and development funds are used and whether this approach effectively supports activities such as prototyping . this report assesses how dod has used prototyping prior to system development on major defense acquisition programs , and what steps dod has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities outside of major defense acquisition programs . gao examined prototyping activities for 22 mdaps that planned to enter system development between december 2009 and february 2016 and 7 prototyping - focused initiatives with the stated purpose of promoting innovation . the department of defense ( dod ) has used prototyping on its major defense acquisition programs ( mdap ) primarily to reduce technical risk , investigate integration challenges , validate designs , mature technologies , and refine performance requirements . of the 22 programs gao reviewed , 17 used prototyping before starting system development . for many of those programs , prototyping provided information that helped introduce realism into their business cases by providing information on technology maturity , the feasibility of the design concepts , potential costs , and the achievability of planned performance requirements . dod has developed new initiatives that are outside of major defense acquisition programs to increase prototyping and further innovation . however , these initiatives face barriers , such as limited funding , a risk averse culture , and competing priorities . literature on private sector innovation identifies key enablers for these types of efforts , such as developing an innovation strategy , aligning investments with innovation goals , and protecting funding for riskier projects . dod has taken steps that are consistent with a few , but not all , of these enablers . for example , dod does not have a department - wide strategy that communicates strategic goals and priorities and delineates roles and responsibilities to guide the prototyping initiatives . this could lead to unproductive or poorly coordinated investments later . dod 's initiatives also face competition for funding , particularly with acquisition programs . one strategy to address funding issues called “ strategic buckets ” involves allocating resources to different types of projects based on an organization 's strategy ( see figure ) . dod has not set strategic funding targets for its initiatives . failing to do so could prevent them from gaining traction and puts their long - term success at risk . gao is making four recommendations , including that dod develop a department - wide innovation strategy that includes prototyping and adopt a more strategic approach for funding prototyping efforts across dod . dod concurred with the recommendations and is currently working on this strategy .
