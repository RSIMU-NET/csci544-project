congress and the executive branch have historically identified the asia pacific economic cooperation forum ( apec ) as potentially important in the promotion of liberalized international trade and investment in asia , and possibly the rest of the world . apec 's commitment to the goal of trade and investment liberalization is embodied in its bogor goals , in which apec members pledged to free and open trade and investment in the asia - pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies . the 2009 apec leaders ' and ministerial meetings focused on balanced growth , resisting protectionism , fostering trade and investment liberalization , accelerating regional economic integration , and enhancing human security . in the leaders ' declaration , apec presented a new `` growth paradigm '' based on balanced , sustainable , and inclusive growth . in the ministerial meeting , one of the main topics was efforts to be taken at , behind , and across borders to promote regional economic integration . the next two years may be a critical period for apec and its achievement of the bogor goals . the 2010 meetings are to be held in yokohama , japan — the target year for apec 's industrialized members to achieve the bogor goals . the united states will host the 2011 meetings . the obama administration has chosen honolulu as the host city for the 2011 leaders ' meeting , but has not given a clear indication of apec 's role in u.s. trade policy . several alternative avenues for the promotion of trade integration in asia have emerged , challenging the past u.s. focus on apec . the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) is promoting the creation of various forms of an all - asian free trade association that could exclude the united states . in november 2009 , the obama administration announced it would to enter into negotiations with the trans - pacific strategic economic partnership agreement ( tpp ) , a free trade agreement between brunei darussalam , chile , new zealand , and singapore . critics of apec have referred to the association as a `` talk shop , '' that has produced few results . however , studies conducted by apec reveal a substantial drop in members ' average tariff rates , the elimination of a number of non - tariff trade barriers , and a major reduction in the transaction costs associated with international trade — all of which is likely attributable at least in part to apec initiatives . historical trade data is consistent with the premise that apec has been successful in promoting greater trade within its member economies and with the rest of the world . both the exports and imports of apec members have grown faster than global trade since the creation of apec . however , apec 's greater trade growth may be attributable to other factors than the liberalization of trade and investment policies among its members . the 111th congress may reexamine u.s. policy towards apec . it has already increased apec - related funding in fy2009 , in part to provide for the preparations for the 2011 apec meetings to be held in the united states . in addition , there are other actions congress may choose to take with respect to apec , depending on its determination of apec 's role in relation to trade promotion initiatives in asia . congressional attitudes and actions may also be influenced by the obama administration 's trade policies in asia — and the role apec plays in those policies . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
