social security has significantly reduced elderly poverty . the elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35 % in 1959 to an all - time low of 9 % in 2006 , in large part because of social security . if social security benefits did not exist , an estimated 44 % of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior . the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , also provides benefits to the poorest elderly , many of whom do not qualify for social security benefits . however , despite these programs , about 3.4 million elderly individuals remained in poverty in 2006. the social security system faces a long - term financing problem . the social security trustees project cash - flow deficits beginning in 2017 and trust fund insolvency in 2041. many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the future . benefit reductions could affect the low - income elderly , many of whom rely on social security benefits for almost all of their income . such potential benefit reductions could lead to higher rates of poverty among the elderly compared to those projected under the current benefit formula . because the low - income elderly are especially vulnerable to benefit reductions , many recent social security reform proposals have included minimum benefits or other provisions that would mitigate the effect of benefit cuts on the elderly poor . this report analyzes the projected effects of four possible approaches to mitigating the effects of social security benefit reductions on elderly poverty in 2042 , the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency . the options are compared to a payable baseline , which assumes current - law benefits would need to be cut across the board to balance social security 's annual income and spending at the point of insolvency . the four options examined are ( 1 ) a poverty - line social security minimum benefit ; ( 2 ) a sliding - scale social security minimum benefit ; ( 3 ) a poverty - line ssi benefit ; and ( 4 ) a poverty - line ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility . major findings include the following : each of the four options would reduce elderly poverty compared to the payable baseline â€” ranging from a negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for the option to create a sliding - scale social security minimum benefit to a reduction of three percentage points for the poverty - line ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility . the elderly poverty rate under all of the options would be higher than under the current law scheduled baseline , which assumes the current benefit formula can be maintained with no reductions . the ssi options examined would target the additional spending more efficiently toward the poor elderly than would the social security options . the social security options examined would reduce the incomes of some elderly because of interaction effects ; the ssi options would not create such interactions .
