because marine mammals , such as whales and dolphins , often inhabit waters where commercial fishing occurs , they can become entangled in fishing gear , which may injure or kill them -- this is referred to as `` incidental take . . the 1994 amendments to the marine mammal protection act ( mmpa ) require the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to establish take reduction teams for certain marine mammals to develop measures to reduce their incidental takes . gao was asked to determine the extent to which nmfs can accurately identify the marine mammal stocks -- generally a population of animals of the same species located in a common area -- that meet the mmpa 's requirements for establishing such teams , has established teams for those stocks that meet the requirements , has met the mmpa 's deadlines for the teams subject to them , and evaluates the effectiveness of take reduction regulations . gao reviewed the mmpa , and nmfs data on marine mammals , and take reduction team documents and obtained the views of nmfs officials , scientists , and take reduction team members . significant limitations in available data make it difficult for nmfs to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams . for most stocks , nmfs relies on incomplete , outdated , or imprecise data on stocks ' population size or mortality to calculate the extent of incidental take . as a result , the agency may overlook some marine mammal stocks that meet the mmpa 's requirements for establishing teams or inappropriately identify others as meeting them . nmfs officials told gao they are aware of the data limitations but lack funding to implement their plans to improve the data . on the basis of nmfs 's available information , gao identified 30 marine mammal stocks that have met the mmpa 's requirements for establishing a take reduction team , and nmfs has established six teams that cover 16 of them . for the other 14 stocks , the agency has not complied with the mmpa 's requirements . for example , false killer whales , found off the hawaiian islands , have met the statutory requirements since 2004 , but nmfs has not established a team for them because , according to nmfs officials , the agency lacks sufficient funds . nmfs officials told gao that the agency has not established teams for the other stocks that meet the mmpa 's requirements for reasons such as the following : data on these stocks are outdated or incomplete , and the agency lacks funds to obtain better information and causes other than fishery - related incidental take , such as sonar used by the u.s. navy , may contribute to their injury or death , therefore changes to fishing practices would not solve the problem . for the five take reduction teams subject to the mmpa 's deadlines , the agency has had limited success in meeting the deadlines for establishing teams , developing draft take reduction plans , and publishing proposed and final plans and regulations to implement them . for example , nmfs established three of the five teams -- the atlantic large whale , pelagic longline , and bottlenose dolphin -- from 3 months to over 5 years past the deadline . nmfs officials attributed the delays in establishing one of the teams to a lack of information about stock population size and mortality , which teams need to consider before developing draft take reduction plans . nmfs does not have a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of take reduction plans and implementing regulations that have been implemented . nmfs has taken some steps to define goals , monitor compliance , and assess whether the goals have been met , but shortcomings in its approach and limitations in its performance data weaken its ability to assess the success of its take reduction regulations . for example , without adequate information about compliance , if incidental takes continue once the regulations have been implemented , it will be difficult to determine whether the regulations were ineffective or whether the fisheries were not complying with them .
