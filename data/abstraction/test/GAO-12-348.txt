as of january 3 , 2012 , the united states recognized 566 indian tribes . federal recognition confers specific legal status on tribes and imposes certain responsibilities on the federal government , such as an obligation to provide certain benefits to tribes and their members . some tribes are not federally recognized but have qualified for and received federal funding . some of these non - federally recognized tribes are state recognized and may be located on state reservations . gao was asked to address the key means by which non - federally recognized tribes have been eligible for federal funding and the amount of federal funding awarded to non - federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. gao also identified some eligibility and federal financial reporting issues related to non - federally recognized tribes . gao compiled a list of about 400 non - federally recognized tribes and reviewed information from federal agencies , usaspending.gov , states , and other sources to identify tribes federal funding and eligibility . of the approximately 400 non - federally recognized tribes that gao identified , 26 received funding from 24 federal programs during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. most of the 26 non - federally recognized tribes were eligible to receive this funding either because of their status as nonprofit organizations or state - recognized tribes . similarly , most of the 24 federal programs that awarded funding to non - federally recognized tribes during the 4-year period were authorized to fund nonprofit organizations or state - recognized tribes . in addition , some of these programs were authorized to fund other entities , such as tribal communities or community development financial institutions . for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , 24 federal programs awarded more than $ 100 million to the 26 non - federally recognized tribes . most of the funding was awarded to a few non - federally recognized tribes by a small number of programs . specifically , 95 percent of the funding was awarded to 9 non - federally recognized tribes , and most of that funding was awarded to the lumbee tribe of north carolina . similarly , 95 percent of the funding was awarded by seven programs in four agencies , and most of that funding was awarded by one department of housing and urban development program . during the course of its review , gao identified some instances where federal agencies had provided funding to non - federally recognized tribes for which grant eligibility is disputed and one instance where an agency was in the process of better enforcing federal financial reporting requirements with one tribe . specifically : the department of education awarded american indian vocational rehabilitation services program funding to the united houma nation , the lumbee tribe of north carolina , and a consortium consisting of the choctaw - apache tribe of ebarb and the four winds cherokee . each of these four tribes is state recognized , but it appears that none of them has a reservation as required by the statute establishing the program . gao has substantial questions about whether educations interpretation of the term reservation is broader than the statutory definition supports . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) awarded funding to the nanticoke lenni - lenape indians of new jersey and the powhatan renape nationtwo non - federally recognized tribes in new jerseyunder programs authorized to fund state - recognized tribes . the state of new jersey , however , does not consider these entities to be state recognized . hhs has initiated action to enforce federal financial reporting requirements for the accohannock indian tribe . the accohannock indian tribe has not filed its required financial report for 2009 that was due no later than september 30 , 2010. in 2009 , the accohannock indian tribe reported spending over $ 1 million in federal funds from three different federal programs administered by the department . the department sent letters of inquiry about the delinquent financial report on march 8 , 2011 , and more recently , after gao inquired about the issue , on february 7 , 2012. gao recommends that education and hhs take specific actions to ensure that they are not making grants to ineligible tribes and to enforce federal financial reporting requirements . hhs agreed . education stated its commitment to review its practices , but disagreed with gaos finding on the statutory eligibility for the american indian vocational rehabilitation services program , which is discussed more fully in the report .
