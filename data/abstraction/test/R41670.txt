the title i - a program of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act ( nclb ; p.l . 107-110 ) , is the largest source of federal funding for elementary and secondary education . states that receive title i - a funding must comply with certain requirements related to measuring student achievement by using state - level standards and assessments . the standards and assessment requirements adopted in the nclb have resulted in vast growth in and demand for new types of assessment products . estimates of annual expenditures on nclb - required assessments range from $ 500 million to $ 900 million . the nclb authorized a new grant assessment program to help states pay the additional costs of meeting the expanded assessment requirements . the purpose of this report is to provide an understanding of the factors that influence the overall cost of student assessment and a description of state expenditures on assessment systems . this report describes factors that influence the cost of student assessment systems , including assessment development , scoring , and the effect of certain policy choices and implementation practices . it also reports and examines the results of existing research on state assessment expenditures , which highlight the variability among states in assessment expenditures . next , the report presents the results of an analysis of how state assessment expenditures differ across states of varying populations . results suggest that state assessment expenditures are dependent , in part , on a state 's population ; however , there are other factors that contribute to the overall cost of state assessment systems ( e.g . , design choices regarding assessment development and scoring ) . this report examines assessment issues that congress may address during the reauthorization of the esea . as congress considers reauthorization , it is likely that the standards and assessment provisions will be reviewed and debated . state assessments are currently the primary policy tool used to measure whether schools , leas , and states are meeting certain academic targets . as such , the effectiveness of federal policy is dependent upon a valid state assessment system . designing an assessment system requires states to consider certain tradeoffs in order to meet the federal assessment requirements while meeting state requirements and containing costs . decisions made in the design of a state assessment system have direct implications for the validity of the federal accountability system and direct consequences for schools . this report examines assessment practices that may be cost - effective and could be promoted by federal policy , including the following : the use of various scoring practices — such as distributed scoring , teacher scoring , and artificial intelligence — that may have the potential to lower the cost of state assessment systems while maintaining quality . the use of state consortia that promote information sharing and other collaborative practices across states that may reduce assessment costs by realizing economies of scale . the use of technology , which may increase the efficiency of assessment administration . as technology becomes less expensive , online delivery of state assessments may lower administration and scoring costs .
