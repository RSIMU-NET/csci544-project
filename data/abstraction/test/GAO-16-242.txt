part of dol 's mission is to promote the retirement security of america 's workers , a goal that has become increasingly challenging . one tool for assessing the adequacy of retirement income is the replacement rate . however , recommendations for the replacement rate that a household should target vary widely , in part because of the diverse underlying assumptions used to develop the rates . gao was asked to review what consumption in retirement looks like and how target replacement rates are developed . gao examined whether and how spending patterns vary by age , key factors used to develop target replacement rates , and the usefulness of information on such rates provided by dol . gao analyzed data from the bls 's 2013 consumer expenditure survey , the most recent available ; analyzed 59 articles and reports that discussed how to develop , calculate , or evaluate replacement rates ; collected non - generalizable information from 14 retirement services firms and financial planners recommended by researchers and actuaries who have studied replacement rates ; and reviewed dol materials and interviewed officials . household spending patterns varied by age , with mid - career households ( those aged 45-49 ) spending more than older households . for example , according to 2013 survey data from the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , mid - career households spent an estimated average of around $ 58,500 , while young retiree households ( those aged 65-69 ) spent about 20 percent less . while the share of spending was consistent for some categories , other categories had larger variations across age groups . for example , housing expenses comprised the largest share of spending regardless of age , while older households spent more out of pocket on health care than mid - career households . spending was less variable across age for low - income households compared to other households . for example , there was not a significant difference in average spending between mid - career and young retiree households in the lowest income quartile , compared to an approximately $ 20,000 difference for the highest income quartile . these variations in spending patterns have implications for the resources households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement . researchers and financial industry professionals develop target replacement rates — the percentage of income to aim for in retirement — based on certain key factors , including spending , household characteristics , and pre - retirement earnings . gao 's analysis of the literature found that calculating an appropriate replacement rate can be complex . for example , there is debate over whether households that have raised children should target a lower replacement rate than households that have not . in addition , a worker 's pre - retirement earnings could be defined as earnings at the end of the worker 's career or as average earnings over the course of the career . despite these complicated considerations , target replacement rates cited in the articles and reports gao reviewed typically range between 70 and 85 percent . some financial industry professionals told gao that they develop customized targets that take into account workers ' assets and expected spending , while others questioned the usefulness of replacement rates . the information and tools on replacement rates that the department of labor ( dol ) provides may be too limited to help workers understand how to use such rates for retirement planning . dol 's employee benefits security administration 's ( ebsa ) website provides information and tools to help american workers better plan for retirement , including a tool to help workers calculate their retirement income needs as a percentage of preretirement income . while ebsa 's materials note that a target replacement rate can vary based on individual circumstances , they do not include specific examples of demographic groups that research indicates can result in higher or lower income replacement needs , or how much a replacement rate might need to be adjusted for those groups or for other individual circumstances . without additional information , workers may not understand how to adjust target replacement rates when planning for retirement . further , ebsa 's worksheet and online tool for calculating how much to save use a default replacement rate with no opportunity for a user to adjust the rate based on individual circumstances . without the ability to adjust the replacement rates used in planning tools , workers may over - or under - estimate how much they need to save for retirement . gao recommends that dol provide additional examples and guidance on using a replacement rate for estimating retirement savings needs in its planning tools , and modify the planning tools so the rate can be adjusted . dol generally agreed with our recommendations and plans to add information and provide options for adjusting replacement rates in its planning tools by june 2017 .
