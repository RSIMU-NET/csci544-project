congress gathers much of the information necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary from the executive branch . while executive branch officials comply with most congressional requests for information , there are times when the executive branch chooses to resist disclosure . when congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information by the executive branch , or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is inappropriate or unavailing , a subpoena — either for testimony or documents — may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands . the recipient of a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena has a legal obligation to comply , absent a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification . but the subpoena is only as effective as the means by which it may be enforced . without a process by which congress can coerce compliance or deter non - compliance , the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information . congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat non - compliance with subpoenas . the two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government . first , the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena . once the contempt citation is received , any prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch . second , congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply . this process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands . but these mechanisms do not always ensure congressional access to requested information . recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate — particularly in the instance that enforcement is necessary to respond to a current or former executive branch official who has refused to comply with a subpoena . there would appear to be several ways in which congress could alter its approach to enforcing committee subpoenas issued to executive branch officials . these alternatives include the enactment of laws that would expedite judicial consideration of subpoena - enforcement lawsuits filed by either house of congress ; the establishment of an independent office charged with enforcing the criminal contempt of congress statute ; or the creation of an automatic consequence , such as a withholding of appropriated funds , triggered by the approval of a contempt citation . in addition , either the house or senate could consider acting on internal rules of procedure to revive the long - dormant inherent contempt power as a way to enforce subpoenas issued to executive branch officials . yet , because of the institutional prerogatives that are often implicated in inter - branch oversight disputes , some of these proposals may raise constitutional concerns .
