during the 108th congress , the house of representatives and the senate finance committee approved two different versions of a bill that would have reauthorized and revised the temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant . this legislation , h.r . 4 , alsoincluded many changes to the child support enforcement ( cse ) program . h.r . 4 waspassed by the house in february 2003. the senate finance committee reported a substitute versionof the bill in september 2003 ( s.rept . 108-162 ) . on march 29-april 1 , 2004 , the senate debatedh.r . 4 ; disagreement arose regarding amendments to the bill , and republicans failed topass a motion to limit debate . h.r . 4 was not passed by the senate . although not identical , both versions of h.r . 4 were similar in focus , direction , and content with respect to the cse provisions . both versions of h.r . 4 includedprovisions that sought to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase theeconomic independence of former welfare families and provide a stable source of income for allsingle - parent families with a noncustodial parent . both versions of the bill provided incentives ( inthe form of federal cost sharing ) to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf offamilies to the families themselves , thereby reducing the amount that state and federal governmentsretain ( often referred to as a family - first policy ) . under both bills , families currently receiving tanfbenefits as well as former tanf recipients would have potentially received a larger share of childsupport that was collected on their behalf . the approach used by the bills differed significantly , however , with regard to how states would help tanf families receive more child support . under the house - passed bill , states would havebeen given federal cost sharing incentives to encourage states to increase ( or establish ) the amountof child support payments they pass through to tanf families ( and disregard in determining tanfbenefits ) . the senate finance committee version of the bill provided federal cost - sharing for theentire amount that the state disregards and passes through to families . moreover , the house - passedbill provided a more limited amount of federal cost sharing for state pass - through and disregardpolicies than the senate finance committee bill . both versions of the bill would have revised some cse enforcement tools and added others ; increased funding for the federal parent locator service ( fpls ) ; increased funding for federaltechnical assistance to the states ; required states to review child support orders of tanf familiesevery three years ; and required that a report be submitted to congress on undistributed child supportcollections . the house - passed bill included a provision that would have established a $ 25 annualuser fee for individuals who had never been on tanf but received cse services and who receivedat least $ 500 in any given year . the senate finance committee - approved bill included provisionsthat would have increased funding for the cse access and visitation program ; and required statesto adopt a later version of the uniform interstate family support act ( uifsa ) so as to facilitate thecollection of child support payments in interstate cases . this report will not be updated .
