under the u.s. constitution , the house of representatives has the power to formally charge a federal officer with wrongdoing , a process known as impeachment . the house impeaches an individual when a majority agrees to a house resolution containing explanations of the charges . the explanations in the resolution are referred to as `` articles of impeachment . . after the house agrees to impeach an officer , the role of the senate is to conduct a trial to determine whether the charged individual should be removed from office . removal requires a two - thirds vote in the senate . the house impeachment process generally proceeds in three phases : ( 1 ) initiation of the impeachment process ; ( 2 ) judiciary committee investigation , hearings , and markup of articles of impeachment ; and ( 3 ) full house consideration of the articles of impeachment . impeachment proceedings are usually initiated in the house when a member submits a resolution through the hopper ( in the same way that all house resolutions are submitted ) . a resolution calling for the impeachment of an officer will be referred to the judiciary committee ; a resolution simply authorizing an investigation of an officer will be referred to the rules committee . in either case , the committee could then report a privileged resolution authorizing the investigation . in the past , house committees , under their general investigatory authority , have sometimes sought information and researched charges against officers prior to the adoption of a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation . impeachment proceedings could also be initiated by a member on the floor . a member can offer an impeachment resolution as a `` question of the privileges of the house . . the house , when it considers a resolution called up this way , might immediately vote to refer it to the judiciary committee , leaving the resolution in the same status as if it had been submitted through the hopper . alternatively , the house might vote to table the impeachment resolution . the house could also vote directly on the resolution , but in modern practice , it has not chosen to approve articles of impeachment called up in this fashion . instead , the house has relied on the judiciary committee to first conduct an investigation , hold hearings , and report recommendations to the full house . committee consideration is therefore typically the second stage of the impeachment process . in recent decades , it has been more common than not that the judiciary committee used information provided from another outside investigation . the committee might create a task force or a subcommittee to review this material and collect any other information through subpoenas , depositions , and public hearings . impeachment investigations are governed by the standing rules of the house that govern all committee investigations , the terms of the resolution authorizing the investigation , and perhaps additional rules adopted by the committee specifically for the inquiry . if the committee determines that impeachment is warranted , it will mark up articles of impeachment using the same procedures followed for the markup of other legislation . if the judiciary committee reports a resolution impeaching a federal officer , that resolution qualifies for privileged consideration on the house floor ; its consideration is the third stage of the impeachment process . the resolution can be called up at the direction of the committee and considered immediately under the hour rule in the house . if called up this way , amendments could be precluded if a majority voted to order the previous question . a motion to recommit , with or without instructions , is in order but is not subject to debate . alternatively , the house might alter these procedures by unanimous consent to , for example , set a longer time for debate or to allow brief debate on a motion to recommit . a resolution reported from the rules committee could also be used to structure floor debate . if the house approves the impeachment resolution , it will appoint managers to present and argue its case against the federal officer in front of the senate .
