initiated in 2008 , secure communities is an ice program designed to identify potentially removable aliens , particularly those with criminal convictions , in state and local law enforcement custody . fingerprints checked against a federal bureau of investigation criminal database are checked against dhss immigration database to help determine whether an arrested individual is removable . gao was asked to review secure communities operations . this report addresses enforcement trends under secure communities , ices adherence to best practices in acquiring secure communitiesrelated technology , and ice safeguards to help protect against potential civil rights abuses under secure communities . gao analyzed ice data on removals from october 2008 through march 2012 , and arrest charges from october 2010 through march 2012 ; reviewed program guidance , policies , and reports ; and interviewed ices law enforcement support center and agency officials , local law enforcement and community groups in four locations selected for geographic diversity , among other factors . these perspectives are not generalizable , but provided insights into secure communities operations . data from the department of homeland securitys ( dhs ) immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) indicate that the percentage of its removals attributable to secure communities increased from about 4 percent in fiscal year 2009 to about 20 percent in fiscal year 2011. of about 183,000 aliens removed under the program from october 2008 through march 2012 , about 74 percent had a criminal conviction . ice did not have state or local arrest charges for about 56 percent of alien secure communities removals from october 2010 ( when ice began collecting arrest charges ) through march 2012 , so we were unable to determine the most frequent arrest charges under the program . for the 44 percent of aliens removed on whom ice collected arrest charge data , traffic offenses , including driving under the influence of alcohol , were the most frequent arrest charges . ice is taking steps to improve the collection of arrest charge data , but it is too early to assess the effectiveness of its efforts . ice has not consistently followed best practices in acquiring technology to help determine the immigration status of aliens identified by secure communities . ice awarded contracts to modernize its technology without fully defining requirements or developing an integrated master scheduletwo best practices for managing capital programs . as a result , ice encountered delays , cost increases , and products that did not meet ices needs . for example , ice spent $ 14.3 million for one contract to develop services that ice found to be unusable . establishing well - defined requirements and developing an integrated schedule for completing technology modernization could better position ice to prevent delays and cost increases . further , ice plans to develop a workforce plan after the systems are deployed . developing a workforce plan prior to full system deployment , consistent with internal controls , could better position ice to effectively use staff when it deploys the modernized technology . dhss office of civil rights and ice identified four safeguards to help protect aliens civil rights under secure communities , including providing detainees with a revised detainer form with telephone numbers to call when they feel their civil rights have been violated . officials are also developing briefing materials on how to protect aliens civil rights , statistically analyzing arrest and other information to identify potential civil rights abuses , and using an existing dhs complaint process for addressing secure communities concerns . gao recommends that ice develop well - defined requirements and an integrated master schedule that accounts for all activities for its technology contracts , and a plan for workforce changes in preparation for full technology deployment . dhs concurred with the recommendations .
