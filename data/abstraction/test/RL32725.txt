industrial hemp is an agricultural commodity that is cultivated for use in the production of a wide range of products , including foods and beverages , cosmetics and personal care products , nutritional supplements , fabrics and textiles , yarns and spun fibers , paper , construction and insulation materials , and other manufactured goods . hemp can be grown as a fiber , seed , or other dual - purpose crop . however , hemp is also from the same species of plant , cannabis sativa , as marijuana . as a result , production in the united states is restricted due to hemp 's association with marijuana , and the u.s. market is largely dependent on imports , both as finished hemp - containing products and as ingredients for use in further processing ( mostly from canada and china ) . current industry estimates report u.s. hemp sales at nearly $ 700 million annually . in the early 1990s there was a sustained resurgence of interest to allow for commercial hemp cultivation in the united states . several states conducted economic or market studies and initiated or enacted legislation to expand state - level resources and production . congress made significant changes to federal policies regarding hemp in the 2014 farm bill ( agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-79 , §7606 ) . the 2014 farm bill provided that certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture may grow hemp under an agricultural pilot program . the bill further established a statutory definition for industrial hemp as `` the plant cannabis sativa l. and any part of such plant , whether growing or not , with a delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis . . delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the dominant psychotrophic ingredient in cannabis sativa . in subsequent omnibus appropriations , congress has blocked the u.s. drug enforcement administration ( dea ) and federal law enforcement authorities from interfering with state agencies , hemp growers , and agricultural research . appropriators have also blocked the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) from prohibiting the transportation , processing , sale , or use of industrial hemp that is grown or cultivated in accordance with the 2014 farm bill provision . despite these efforts , industrial hemp continues to be subject to u.s. drug laws , and growing industrial hemp is restricted . under current u.s. drug policy , all cannabis varieties — including industrial hemp — are considered schedule i controlled substances under the controlled substances act ( csa , 21 u.s.c . §§801 et seq . ) . although hemp production is generally allowed following requirements under the 2014 farm bill , some aspects of production remain subject to dea oversight , including the importation of viable seeds , which still requires dea registration according to the controlled substances import and export act ( 21 u.s.c . §§951-971 ) . other guidance from dea , usda , and the food and drug administration provides additional clarification regarding federal authorities ' position on hemp and its future policies regarding its cultivation and marketing . this guidance supports dea 's contention that the commercial sale or interstate transfer of industrial hemp continues to be restricted . congress has continued to introduce legislation to further advance industrial hemp and address these types of concerns in the next farm bill . introduced legislation as part of the industrial hemp farming act — first introduced in the 109th congress and greatly expanded over the past few years — seeks to further facilitate hemp production in the united states but would also amend the csa to specify that the term marijuana does not include industrial hemp . an expanded version of this bill was introduced in the 115th congress in both the house and senate ( h.r . 5485 ; s. 2667 ) . many of the provisions in these bills are included in the senate - passed 2018 farm bill ( h.r . 2 ) that is now being debated in congress . similar provisions are not part of the house version of the 2018 farm bill ( h.r . 2 ) . myriad other bills introduced in both the house and the senate would further amend the csa and other federal laws to address industrial hemp .
