gao discussed u.s. efforts to control heroin trafficking from southeast asia to the united states . gao noted that : u.s. efforts have achieved some positive results in thailand and hong kong , but not in burma ; the united states has supported united nations ( un ) drug control projects in burma , but these efforts have met with limited success because the projects ' scope has been small , planning has been inadequate , and burma has not provided sufficient support ; the united states suspended direct counternarcotics assistance to burma because of human rights violations ; much of burma 's heroin - producing region is not under government control because of insurgencies headed by drug traffickers ; law enforcement efforts against heroin traffickers are impeded by the traffickers ' ability to shift transportation routes to countries with inadequate law enforcement capabilities ; and u.s. heroin control efforts are also impeded by a lack of cooperation with china on counternarcotics activities .
