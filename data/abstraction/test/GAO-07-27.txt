in 2006 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) spent about 38 percent of its $ 10.8 billion budget on processing returns and providing taxpayer assistance . gao was asked to assess irs 's 2006 filing season performance processing paper and electronically filed tax returns and providing telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance relative to 2006 goals and prior years ' performance ; identify potential cost savings or other improvements ; and report on the status of irs 's taxpayer assistance blueprint ( tab ) . to address these issues , gao collected relevant information from irs and other sources , reviewed performance measures and past filing season assessments , and interviewed officials . irs improved most filing season services in 2006 , continuing improvements since 2001. irs also generated efficiencies from increased electronic filing and benefits for taxpayers through systems modernization . irs 's processing of individual tax returns and refunds improved by most measures , but the growth rate of electronic filing continued to slow in part because of changes to the free file program , which reduced the number of taxpayers eligible to use it and the elimination of a program that allowed taxpayers to file via the telephone . access to irs 's telephone assistors was comparable to last year . the accuracy of responses to telephone inquiries was 90 percent or over in 2006. use of irs 's web site increased substantially and irs reconfigured the site to improve service . continuing past trends , fewer taxpayers used irs walk - in sites and more used less - costly volunteer sites . also , irs completed phase i of the tab , which identified strategic themes for improving taxpayer service ; tab phase ii is expected to be completed by early 2007. with the slowing growth rate in electronic filing , irs is missing an opportunity to generate additional savings . federal and state mandates for electronic filing have demonstrated success in increasing electronic filing ; however , irs currently lacks the authority to mandate electronic filing for certain income tax returns such as individual returns filed by paid tax preparers . using irs estimates , savings from such a mandate could be on the order of $ 60 million per year . irs has another opportunity to generate savings because of excess space at its call sites . however , irs lacks a strategy for eliminating that space by consolidating call sites . to replace its aging legacy computer system , irs continues to implement a modernized system for processing tax returns and refunds . however , irs does not report information on the chief benefit realized to date , faster refund issuance . such information could be useful for the congress when making decisions about funding the completion of the individual tax return processing part of the system , estimated by irs to require at least another $ 500 million .
