pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed federal workforce downsizing , focusing on the projected costs and savings from federal workforce buyouts and reductions - in - force ( rif ) over a 5-year period . gao found that : employee buyouts could produce over $ 60,000 more in net savings over 5 years than rif for each vacated position because buyouts can be used at higher grade levels that generate more savings in salaries and benefits when downsized ; if federal agencies separate retirement - eligible employees who do not displace lower - grade employees , rif could produce about $ 29,000 more in net savings over 5 years than buyouts ; displacing employees in the same competitive areas but lower - tenure groups or with less service within the same tenure groups reduces rif savings because those savings represent the salaries and benefits of lower - grade employees ; savings from buyouts or rif could be reduced if the vacated positions are refilled or privatized ; federal agencies may need more buyouts than rif to achieve their downsizing targets because normal attrition slows prior to buyouts ; buyouts avoid or reduce the non - economic adverse effects of rif , such as reduced diversity , decreased productivity , and lower morale ; and buyouts may help federal agencies improve diversity , since buyouts typically affect older white males .
