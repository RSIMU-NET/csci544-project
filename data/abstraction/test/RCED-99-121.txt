pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative , focusing on : how much and for what purposes federal funding was provided for the restoration of the south florida ecosystem from fiscal year ( fy ) 1993 through fy 1999 ; and how well the restoration effort is being coordinated and managed . gao noted that : on the basis of the data gao obtained from the 5 primary federal departments and agencies participating in the initiative , gao estimates that over $ 1.2 billion in federal funds was provided from fy 1993 through fy 1999 ; the key restoration activities undertaken by the federal agencies were : land acquisition ; the management of federally - owned facilities or natural resources , and a national marine sanctuary ; infrastructure projects ; and science - related activities ; over 75 percent of the federal expenditures during this 6-year period have been made by agencies within the department of the interior and by the u.s. army corps of engineers ; the federal funding provided to date represents only a down payment ; while no official cost projection for the total restoration effort has been made , a major component , the implementation of the central and southern florida project comprehensive review study , referred to as the restudy , is estimated to cost an additional $ 7.8 billion ; the restudy is designed to substantially increase the amount of water that is delivered to natural areas while enhancing agricultural and urban water supplies ; according to the south florida ecosystem restoration task force 's executive director , at least $ 2 billion beyond the $ 7.8 billion will be needed to complete the restoration effort ; this money will be used to acquire additional lands , construct other infrastructure projects , and eradicate exotic plant species ; the task force is responsible for coordinating the participating entities ' implementation of the initiative ; however , a strategic plan that clearly lays out how the initiative will be accomplished and includes quantifiable goals and performance measures has not yet been developed ; the task force is a coordinating body , not a decisionmaking body , and thus is limited in its ability to manage and make decisions for the overall restoration effort ; as gao 's review of two projects integral to the restoration effort indicates , even with coordination , the federal and state agencies involved are unable to agree on components of these projects ; their inability to agree has contributed to delays and cost overruns ; and given the scope and complexity of the initiative and the difficulties that have already been encountered , additional delays and cost overruns are likely to occur , and the participants ' ability to accomplish the initiative 's overall goals is at risk .
