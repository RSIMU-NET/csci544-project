weapons in the u.s. nuclear stockpile are aging . nnsa and dod undertake leps to refurbish or replace nuclear weapons ' aging components . in 2010 , they began an lep to consolidate four versions of a legacy nuclear weapon , the b61 bomb , into a bomb called the b61-12 ( see fig . ) . nnsa and dod have stated they must complete this lep by 2024 to uphold u.s. commitments to the north atlantic treaty organization . as of september 2015 , nnsa and dod estimated that the b61-12 lep would cost about $ 8.9 billion . senate report 113-44 included a provision for gao to periodically assess the status of the b61-12 lep . this report assesses nnsa 's management approach for the b61-12 lep and the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep . gao reviewed project plans , schedules , management plans , and other documents and program data , and visited the two nnsa national laboratories — sandia and los alamos — that serve as the design agencies for the lep . the b61-12 life extension program 's ( lep ) managers have developed a management approach that officials from the department of energy 's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) and the department of defense ( dod ) regard as improved over the management approach used for past leps , which experienced schedule delays and cost overruns . among other things , the b61-12 lep is the first lep to use earned value management , a tool that measures the planned versus actual value of work accomplished in a given period , which may help nnsa ensure that work progresses on budget and on schedule . it is also the first lep to integrate the schedules and cost estimates for activities at all participating nnsa sites . nnsa used this new approach to inform its first program execution guide for defense programs , issued in august 2014 , which applies to all nnsa defense programs . nnsa 's new management approach notwithstanding , the b61-12 lep faces ongoing management challenges in some areas , including staff shortfalls and an earned value management system that has yet to be tested . the new management approach may help the lep address these potential challenges , but it is too soon to determine whether this will be the case . to manage risks in the b61-12 lep , nnsa and the air force use a risk management database and integrated schedules to categorize risks and incorporate risk management steps in the schedules . according to nnsa and air force officials , some risks have already been managed in this manner . for example , nnsa estimates that making a needed material procurement in advance prevented a potential delay of more than a year and a potential cost increase of more than $ 2 million . remaining risks include the risk that components may fail in certain flight environments and risks related to testing of certain nonnuclear components . nnsa is also working to ensure future compatibility with the f - 35 aircraft . nnsa and air force officials said they will not know for several years whether steps planned to manage these risks are adequate . a constrained development and production schedule — which doe 's and dod 's nuclear weapons council characterized as having “ little , if any , margin left ” — complicates efforts to manage risks . factors constraining the schedule include the aging of components in current versions of the b61 , delays in starting the b61-12 lep because of a lengthy design study , the effects of sequestration , and the need to complete the b61-12 lep so that nnsa can begin other planned leps . gao will continue to monitor these issues as it assesses the lep in later stages . gao is making no new recommendations but discusses the status of prior gao recommendations in this report . in commenting on a draft of this report , doe generally agreed with gao 's findings and provided technical comments that were incorporated , as appropriate . dod provided technical comments that were also incorporated , as appropriate .
