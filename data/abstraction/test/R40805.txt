president obama requested a total of $ 123.1 billion for the agencies included in h.r . 3288 , the transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriations ( thud ) bill for fy2010 . this request represented an increase of approximately $ 14.1 billion ( 12.9 % ) over the $ 109.1 billion provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act ( division i of p.l . 111-8 ) . the enacted legislation provided $ 122.1 billion , less than 1 % ( $ 977 million ) below the president 's request and 12 % ( $ 13.4 billion ) more than the comparable fy2009 funding ( not including the fy2009 emergency funding ) . the single largest new item in the budget request was $ 5 billion for a new independent federal agency — a national infrastructure bank — that would provide federal funding for , and promote investment from other sources in , infrastructure projects of national or regional significance . neither the house nor the senate funded this request ; the conference report encourages the administration to pursue the creation of such a program through the regular authorization process . the fy2010 request for dot totaled $ 72.4 billion , $ 5.2 billion ( 7.7 % ) more than the total of $ 67.2 billion in funding provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act ( the house and senate both reported the request as $ 77.4 billion , as they considered the $ 5 billion request for an infrastructure bank as part of the dot request ) . the actual requested increase is somewhat less , as the reported funding level for fy2009 was reduced by a $ 3.5 billion rescission of contract authority which did not actually reduce the level of funding provided . the house - passed bill provides a total of $ 75.8 billion in funding for dot , $ 3.4 billion ( 8 % ) more than the requested level . the senate - passed bill provided $ 75.8 billion . the enacted legislation provided $ 75.7 billion , $ 3.3 billion ( 5 % ) more than the original dot request . the fy2010 request for hud totaled $ 45.5 billion , $ 4.0 billion ( 7.7 % ) more than the comparable amount of new funding provided in the regular annual appropriation for fy2009 . the house - passed bill provided $ 47.1 billion , the senate - passed bill provided $ 45.8 , and the enacted legislation provided $ 46.1 billion,1 % more than the requested amount . throughout this report , the amounts being considered for fy2010 are compared to the amounts provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act . however , dot and hud also received significant amounts of supplemental funding in fy2009 through the economic stimulus act ( the american recovery and reinvestment act , p.l . 111-5 / h.r . 1 ) , which congress passed in february of 2009. that act provided $ 48.1 billion in emergency supplemental funding for dot and $ 13.7 billion for hud , a total of $ 61.8 billion in additional funding . that represented an increase of 52 % to the total new funding provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act . not every office and program in the thud bill received funding from that supplement , and not all of that additional funding was expended in fy2009 .
