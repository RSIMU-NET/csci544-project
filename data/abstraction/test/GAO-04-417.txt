flood maps identify areas at greatest risk of flooding and provide the foundation for the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) managed by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . the maps are used by communities to establish minimum building standards designed to reduce the impact of flooding , fema to set insurance rates , and lenders to identify property owners who are required to purchase flood insurance . nearly 70 percent of all flood maps are more than 10 years old , according to fema . in an effort to update its flood maps , fema is implementing a $ 1 billion , 5-year map modernization program . gao was asked to review the progress of fema 's map modernization program . through its map modernization program , fema intends to use advanced technologies to produce more accurate and accessible digital flood maps available on the internet . these maps are expected to improve community efforts to reduce the impact of floods , increase property owners ' use of flood insurance , and improve community , state and federal efforts to reduce the risks of other natural and man - made hazards . in developing digital flood maps , fema plans to incorporate data that are of a level of specificity and accuracy commensurate with communities ' relative flood risk . according to fema , there is a direct relationship between the types , quantity , and detail of the data and analysis used to develop maps and the costs of obtaining and analyzing those data . although fema ranked the nation 's 3,146 counties from highest to lowest risk , it has not yet established data standards that describe the appropriate level of detail , accuracy , and analysis required to develop digital maps based on risk level . without such standards , fema can not ensure that it uses the same level of data collection and analysis for all communities in the same risk category . such standards can also help fema to target its map modernization resources more efficiently by matching the level of data collection and analysis with the level of flood risk . fema has developed partnerships with states and local entities that have begun mapping activities and has a strategy on how to best work with these entities . however , the overall effectiveness of fema 's future partnering efforts is uncertain because fema has not yet developed a clear strategy for partnering with communities with less resources and little or no experience in flood mapping . by developing such a strategy , fema will be better able to identify and use the most effective approaches to engage all of its partners in map modernization .
