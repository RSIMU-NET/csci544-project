in response to a congressional request , gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) processes for handling undeliverable mail , focusing on the : amount of and reasons for undeliverable mail ; and impact of undeliverable mail on taxpayers and irs . gao found that : irs estimates that it had about 6.5 million pieces of undeliverable mail in 1986 and about 15 million pieces in 1992 ; undeliverable mail is principally caused by taxpayers failing to leave forwarding addresses , the u.s. postal service not delivering or forwarding mail , and irs incorrectly recording taxpayers ' addresses in its files ; taxpayer interest and penalties can substantially increase because of undeliverable mail , which eventually can lead to irs attachment of taxpayers ' liquid assets ; irs loses millions of dollars in revenue annually and incurs increased operating costs because of undeliverable mail ; the irs collection division plans to start processing undeliverable mail after the first occurrence and send only two instead of four service center notices to decrease collection costs ; irs has implemented only a few recommendations to decrease its undeliverable mail because it expects its tax systems modernization initiative to resolve its undeliverable mail problem ; senior irs management recently requested responsible irs offices to develop action plans to decrease the amount of undeliverable mail in a recent internal irs report ; irs needs to increase taxpayers ' awareness of the need to provide address changes to minimize the volume of undeliverable mail ; and more efficient processing of undeliverable mail could result if irs consolidates mail processing functions into one centralized unit .
