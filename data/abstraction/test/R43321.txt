patent infringement is the unauthorized making , using , offering for sale , selling , and importing of a patented invention . the patent provides the patent holder with the right to protect against such infringement by suing for relief in the appropriate federal court . litigation of a patent infringement claim begins with the filing of a complaint in federal court . form 18 in the appendix of the federal rules of civil procedure provides a model for a patent infringement complaint . this form requires four statements asserting jurisdiction , patent ownership , patent infringement by the defendant , and demand for relief . commentators , legal practitioners , and patent holders disagree as to whether form 18 requires a sufficient level of detail in the patent infringement complaint to meet the standards outlined in the federal rules of civil procedure and by the u.s. supreme court . despite two recent supreme court rulings concerning the appropriate pleading standard , the level of particularity regarding information in the patent complaint , specifically form 18 , is a frequent issue before the courts . patent infringement litigation has increased over the last decade . commentators have linked the current patent pleading requirements and the minimal level of information required to patent assertion entities ( pae ) , colloquially known as `` patent trolls . . according to `` patent troll '' critics , the minimal information required in a patent infringement complaint encourages paes to initiate frivolous lawsuits that otherwise would not survive the initial pleading stage under a more stringent standard . congress has recently proposed several bills offering patent reform in this area . the recently introduced innovation act , h.r . 3309 , and the patent abuse reduction act , s. 1013 , both offer changes to the patent pleading system . these bills would provide for , among other things , heightened initial pleading requirements demanding more specific information in the complaint than required by form 18 alone . sponsors of the bills intend these more rigorous pleading requirements to deter `` patent trolls '' from filing what they deem as frivolous lawsuits . however , some commentators believe that the heightened pleading requirements would render patent enforcement impractical . additionally , some members of the judicial branch have commented that these proposed changes trigger constitutional issues by potentially violating the separation of powers doctrine .
