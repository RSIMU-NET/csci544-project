the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill contains funding for more than 30 agencies and entities . they include most of the department of the interior ( doi ) as well as agencies within other departments , such as the forest service within the department of agriculture and the indian health service within the department of health and human services . the bill also provides funding for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , arts and cultural agencies , and other organizations and entities . issues for congress included determining the amount , terms , and conditions of funding for agencies and programs . for fy2019 , the enacted appropriation for interior , environment , and related agencies was $ 35.61 billion . this total was composed of $ 13.02 billion for doi agencies in title i , $ 8.06 billion for epa in title ii , $ 13.74 billion for the 23 `` related agencies '' in title iii , and $ 791.0 million in title iv for certain epa activities . the fy2019 appropriation was $ 300.0 million ( 0.8 % ) more than the fy2018 regular appropriation of $ 35.31 billion ( in p.l . 115-141 ) , but $ 975.4 million ( 2.7 % ) less than the fy2018 total appropriation of $ 36.59 billion , including $ 1.28 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief ( in p.l . 115-72 and p.l . 115-123 ) . the fy2019 appropriation was $ 7.28 billion ( 25.7 % ) more than the president 's request ( $ 28.34 billion ) , $ 305.5 million ( 0.9 % ) more than the house - passed level ( $ 35.31 billion ) , and $ 301.0 million ( 0.8 % ) less than the senate - passed amount ( $ 35.91 billion ) . because the fy2019 appropriation was not enacted until february 15 , 2019 , agencies received continuing appropriations for certain periods before that date . specifically , from october 1 , 2018 , through december 21 , 2018 , and again from january 25 , 2019 , through february 15 , 2019 , appropriations were provided under a continuing resolution ( cr ) at the fy2018 level ( in division g of p.l . 115-141 ) . due to a lapse in funds after december 21 , 2018 , until january 25 , 2019 , a partial government shutdown went into effect . agencies in the interior bill generally operated under `` contingency '' plans that summarize activities that would cease and activities that would continue during a lapse in appropriations . in earlier action , president trump 's request of $ 28.34 billion for fy2019 for interior , environment , and related agencies included $ 10.59 billion for doi agencies , $ 6.19 billion for epa , and $ 11.56 billion for related agencies . the versions of h.r . 6147 ( 115th congress ) passed by the house on july 19 , 2018 , and by the senate on august 1 , 2018 , contained higher fy2019 appropriations overall , and for each title of the bill , than requested . the president 's request also contained a legislative proposal for a $ 1.52 billion cap adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law for certain wildland fire suppression activities . this cap adjustment was not approved by the chambers or enacted for fy2019 . however , congress enacted a similar proposal ( in p.l . 115-141 ) , under which the adjustment becomes available in fy2020 . the president , house , and senate each proposed less funding for fy2019 relative to the fy2018 total of $ 36.59 billion ( including emergency supplemental appropriations ) , proposing 22.5 % , 3.5 % , and 1.8 % less , respectively . in contrast , relative to the regular fy2018 appropriation of $ 35.31 billion , the president would have reduced funding ( 19.8 % ) , the house would have provided nearly level appropriations ( < 0.1 % decrease ) , and the senate would have increased funding ( 1.7 % ) for fy2019 . for individual agencies and programs in the bill , there are many differences among the funding levels enacted for fy2019 and those supported by the president , house , and senate for fy2019 and enacted for fy2018 . this report highlights funding for selected agencies and programs that have been among the many of interest to congress , stakeholders , and the public .
