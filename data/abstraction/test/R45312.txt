electricity generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the united states . the u.s. electric power grid comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems that bring power to end - use customers . the u.s. electric grid has operated historically with a high level of reliability ; however , the various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural , operational , or manmade events . the bulk power system faces new and evolving cybersecurity threats . cyber threats can come from direct attacks aimed at electric grid or other critical infrastructure that could impact the operations or security of the grid . arguably , the greatest cyber threats to the grid have been intrusions focused on manipulating industrial control system ( ics ) networks . cyber intrusions on the electric grid have resulted in malware on ics networks with the capability of causing damage or taking over certain aspects of system control or functionality . recent concerns have extended to internet of things ( iot ) devices connected to networks . iot devices have been increasingly targeted by botnet malware ( whereby the hacker takes over the operation of a large number of infected devices ) to launch denial - of - service or other cyber attacks . if such iot cyber attacks were able to access electric utility ics networks , they could potentially impair these systems or cause electric power networks to operate based on manipulated conditions or false information . congress gave the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk power system under the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ; epact05 ) . ferc can approve or remand back reliability standards proposed by the electric reliability organization ( ero ) , which bulk - power system owners and operators must follow to help ensure the reliable operation of the grid . the north american electric reliability corporation serves currently as the ero , and proposes mandatory and enforceable reliability standards for critical infrastructure protection ( which include physical and cybersecurity ) . there have been increasing reports about foreign hackers targeting the u.s. electric power system and other critical infrastructure . while these intrusions have not been reported as having resulted in significant disruptions , concerns have increased over the potential of the intrusions for potentially damaging cyber attacks . in 2017 , the president issued executive order ( eo ) 13800 on `` strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure '' because the risks of cyber threats to critical infrastructure are perceived as a national security imperative . eo 13800 called for an assessment of a prolonged electric power outage resulting from a cyber attack , and an evaluation of the `` readiness and gaps in the united states ' ability to manage and mitigate consequences of a cyber incident against the electricity subsector . . the cyber supply chain and public - private cybersecurity information sharing were listed among a number of major cybersecurity concerns . electricity is a subsector of the energy critical infrastructure ( ci ) sector . given that the grid relies on several of the other ci sectors ( for example , water and fuel transportation ) , the question of whether these other sectors should also have similar mandatory standards focused on support of the electric power sector may be an issue for congress to consider . the electric power system in the united states is evolving , but not consistently across sectors and regions of the country . while some may say such inconsistencies may add a level of complexity that may make a nationwide cyber event more unlikely , the consistent development of a modern electric power system would likely add to the prospects of u.s. economic health and competitiveness . policy options designed to ensure that the developing electric power system is as secure as possible , will likely be a major consideration for congress .
