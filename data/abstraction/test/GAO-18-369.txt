the sfsp , a federal nutrition assistance program , is intended to provide food to children in low - income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation . in the last decade , federal expenditures for sfsp have increased as the program has expanded , according to usda data . gao was asked to review the sfsp . this report examines what is known about sfsp participation , other programs that help feed low - income children over the summer , and challenges , if any , in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which usda provides assistance to address these challenges . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; analyzed usda 's sfsp data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 ; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the sfsp in 50 states and the district of columbia ; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites , selected based on census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations ; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states ; and interviewed usda , state and national organization officials , and sfsp providers , including sponsors and site operators . nationwide , the total number of meals served to children in low - income areas through the summer food service program ( sfsp ) increased from 113 to 149 million ( about 32 percent ) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) directs states to use the number of meals served , along with other data , to estimate the number of children participating in the sfsp . however , participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year . in 2017 , usda took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates , noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning . however , gao determined that the method usda directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation , hindering usda 's ability to use them for these purposes . other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low - income children over the summer to some extent , according to states gao surveyed and sfsp providers and others gao interviewed . for example , in july 2016 , usda data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals . some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith - based organizations and foodbanks , though gao 's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited . states and sfsp providers reported challenges with meal sites , participation , and program administration ; usda has taken steps to address these areas . specifically , in gao 's survey , a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites , as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity . national , state , and local officials have taken steps to address these issues , such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation . in addition , 17 states in gao 's survey and providers in the states gao visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations . to address this safety issue , usda has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on - site . however , usda has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility . further , some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist , hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery . gao is making four recommendations , including that usda improve estimates of children 's participation in sfsp and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery . usda generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
