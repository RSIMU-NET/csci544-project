the trio programs are the primary federal programs providing support services to disadvantaged students to promote achievement in postsecondary education . the higher education amendments of 1968 ( p.l . 90-575 ) consolidated a `` trio '' of programs under one overall program . this report provides a description of the trio programs , authorized in title iv - a - 2-1 of the hea . in fy2017 , the trio programs were funded at $ 950 million , and they served more than 800,000 secondary , postsecondary , and adult students . the trio programs have been designed to encourage and prepare qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for success throughout the educational pipeline from secondary school to undergraduate and graduate education . while the trio programs primarily serve low - income , first - generation college students , they also serve students with disabilities , veterans , homeless youth , foster youth , and individuals underrepresented in graduate education . the trio programs are also designed to award prior grantees that implement successful projects and propose high - quality projects with subsequent grants before awarding applicants without prior trio experience . there are now six trio programs , each serving a different demographic . the trio upward bound ( ub ) program serves secondary school students , providing relatively intensive preparation services and encouragement to help students pursue education beyond secondary school . the trio talent search ( ts ) program provides less intensive services than ub in support of the completion of high school and enrollment in postsecondary education , and it encourages primarily students and out - of - school youth . the trio educational opportunity centers ( eoc ) program primarily serves adults . the trio student support services ( sss ) program aims to motivate undergraduate students to complete their undergraduate education . the ronald e. mcnair postbaccalaureate achievement ( mcnair ) program prepares undergraduate students for graduate school . finally , the trio staff development ( training ) program trains trio project staff to be more effective . several key trio program provisions were amended by the higher education opportunity act ( heoa ; p.l . 110-315 ) in 2008. two key heoa amendments address issues pertaining to the application review process : scoring and second reviews ( appeals ) . the first amendment defined outcome criteria that require the secretary and each grantee to agree upon objectives / targets for the criteria . the extent to which grantees meet or exceed these objectives determines the number of prior experience ( pe ) points the grantee may earn as part of its application in the next grant competition . earning more pe points increases the likelihood of funding . the second amendment established an application review process by which those unsuccessful applicants that can identify a specific technical , administrative , or scoring error may have their applications reviewed a second time ( appealed ) . the fy2012 trio ub competition was the first to use the revised application review process .
