espcs finance energy - saving capital improvements , such as lighting retrofits for federal facilities , without the government incurring the full cost up front . partnerships tap the capital and expertise of the private sector to develop real property . this report describes what specific attributes of espcs and partnerships contributed to budget scoring decisions , the costs of financing through espcs compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and how espcs and partnerships are monitored . using case studies , gao reviewed gsa and navy espcs and doe and va partnerships . energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnership arrangements we examined were authorized by congress and did not require reporting of the full , long - term costs up front in the budget . espcs are financed over time through annual cost savings from energy conservation measures ( ecm ) and only their initial - year costs must be recognized up front . omb policy determined how agencies obligated espcs in their budgets . with partnerships , agencies sometimes used short - term leases to acquire assets constructed for the government 's long - term use and benefit . as a result , budgetary decisions may favor alternatively financed assets . however , spreading costs over time enabled agencies to acquire capital that might not have been obtainable if full , up - front appropriations were required . a number of factors may cause third - party financing to be more expensive than timely , full , and up - front appropriations . for example , a higher rate of interest is incurred by using espcs and partnerships than if the same capital is acquired through timely , full , and up - front appropriations . for our six espc case studies , the government 's costs of acquiring assets increased 8 to 56 percent by using espcs rather than timely , full , and up - front appropriations . however , officials noted that there are opportunity costs , such as foregone energy and maintenance savings , associated with delayed appropriations , but there are insufficient data to measure this effect . for espc and partnership case studies , agency officials said they did not specifically consider or request full up - front appropriations because they did not believe funds would be available in a timely manner and because alternative mechanisms were authorized . an evaluation of funding alternatives on a present value basis could have helped agencies determine the most appropriate way of funding capital projects . implementation and monitoring of espcs is a relatively uniform process . since partnerships take a variety of forms , their implementation and monitoring is more complex . although third - party financing can make it easier for agencies to manage within a given amount of budget authority , it also increases the need for effective implementation and monitoring by agencies to ensure the government 's interests are protected .
