pursuant to a congressional request , gao assessed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) performance during the 1997 tax filing season , focusing on : the ability of taxpayers seeking answers to questions to reach irs via the telephone ; the number of returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method ; irs ' efforts to deal with returns that have missing or incorrect social security numbers ( ssn ) ; the use of banks , known as lockboxes , to process certain tax payments ; and performance of the imaging system irs uses to process certain tax returns . gao noted that : the irs met or exceeded most of its 1997 filing season related performance goals ; of particular note is the substantial improvement in two important areas where gao has criticized irs ' performance in past filing seasons -- telephone accessibility and the use of alternative filing methods ; according to irs data , telephone accessibility increased from 20 percent during the 1996 filing season to 51 percent during the 1997 filing season ; the number of tax returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method increased by 25 percent over the last year , with the number of returns filed by telephone ( telefile ) showing the most significant increase -- 65 percent ; although the revised tax package apparently contributed to an increase in the use of telefile , it also apparently contributed to a decrease in the performance of the service center recognition / image processing system ( scrips ) -- a document imaging and optical character recognition system that irs implemented in 1994 to process forms 1040ez and certain other tax documents ; another major change during the 1997 filing season involved the procedures irs used to process returns that were filed with missing or incorrect ssns ; in 1997 , as authorized by the welfare reform act of 1996 , irs began treating missing or incorrect ssns as math errors rather than as issues that , in the past , had to be resolved through a lengthy notice process ; as of september 1 , 1997 , according to irs , it had protected about $ 1.46 billion in revenue through the disallowance of claimed credits or dependent exemptions in 1997 , more than doubling the amount disallowed using the procedures irs followed in 1996 ; one issue that gao discussed in a previous report that continues to be of concern is the cost - effectiveness of irs ' use of lockboxes to process 1040 tax payments ; additional information gao obtained this year heightened its concern by calling into question a key assumption irs and the department of the treasury 's financial management service ( fms ) have used to calculate the interest cost savings associated with this use of lockboxes ; and although fms had planned a study to further assess interest cost savings , those plans have been deferred , and there is no assurance when such a study will be done .
