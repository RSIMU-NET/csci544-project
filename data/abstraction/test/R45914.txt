the k - 12 teacher workforce is relatively largeâeach year , about 4 million teachers are employed in u.s. elementary and secondary schools . turnover in these schools is high relative to earlier periodsâabout 1 in 10 teachers left his or her job in 2018. this figure follows federal statistical trends that show a sizable growth in teacher attrition since the 1980s . teacher shortages and high turnover raise a number of recruitment and retention issues that may be of interest to policymakers . one of the more difficult issues involves a debate between observers who are concerned about an overall teacher shortage , and others who see it largely as a distributional problem where some schools have a relative surplus of teachers while other schools struggle with a persistent , unmet demand for qualified teachers . those in the former camp focus on policies that aim to improve the recruitment and retention in the teaching profession in general , while those in the latter camp focus on policies that target education funding to fill positions for certain hard - to - staff schools and / or subject areas . current federal policy addresses recruitment and retention . the higher education act ( hea ) authorizes grant support to institutions that prepare k - 12 teachers as well as financial aid to students interested in the teaching profession . title ii of the hea authorizes grants for improving teacher education programs , strengthening teacher recruitment efforts , and providing training for prospective teachers . title iv of the hea authorizes teacher education assistance for college and higher education ( teach ) grants to encourage students to prepare for a career in teaching and student loan forgiveness for teachers that remain in the classroom over a number of years . the hea was last comprehensively amended in 2008 by the higher education opportunity act ( heoa , p.l . 110-315 ) . congressional consideration of potentially reauthorizing the hea is ongoing , including the introduction of numerous bills to amend the portions of current law that address teacher recruitment and retention . issues that may arise as the reauthorization process unfolds include modifying the title ii grant partnership structure , targeting support to specific teacher shortage areas or non - instructional staff , expanding teacher preparation program accountability , reforming administration of the teach grant program , and expanding or consolidating teacher loan forgiveness programs .
