persons suspected of criminal or terrorist activity may be transferred from one state ( i.e . , country ) to another for arrest , detention , and / or interrogation . commonly , this is done through extradition , by which one state surrenders a person within its jurisdiction to a requesting state via a formal legal process , typically established by treaty . far less often , such transfers are effectuated through a process known as `` extraordinary rendition '' or `` irregular rendition . . these terms have often been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another . in this report , `` rendition '' refers to extraordinary or irregular renditions unless otherwise specified . although the particularities regarding the usage of extraordinary renditions and the legal authority behind such renditions are not publicly available , various u.s. officials have acknowledged the practice 's existence . during the bush administration , there was controversy over the use of renditions by the united states , particularly with regard to the alleged transfer of suspected terrorists to countries known to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture , purportedly with the knowledge or acquiescence of the united states . in january 2009 , president obama issued an executive order creating a special task force to review u.s. transfer policies , including the practice of rendition , to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements . in august , the task force issued recommendations to ensure that u.s. transfer practices comply with applicable standards and do not result in the transfer of persons to face torture . these recommendations include strengthening procedures used to obtain assurances from a country that a person will not face torture if transferred there , and the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the treatment of transferred persons . this report discusses relevant international and domestic law restricting the transfer of persons to foreign states for the purpose of torture . the u.n. convention against torture and other cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment ( cat ) , and its domestic implementing legislation ( the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 ) impose the primary legal restrictions on the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture . both cat and u.s. implementing legislation generally prohibit the rendition of persons to countries in most cases where they would more likely than not be tortured , though there are arguably limited exceptions to this prohibition . historically , the state department has taken the position that cat 's provisions concerning the transfer of persons do not apply extraterritorially , though as a matter of policy the united states does not transfer persons in its custody to countries where they would face torture ( u.s. regulations and statutes implementing cat , however , arguably limit the extraterritorial transfer of individuals nonetheless ) . under u.s. regulations implementing cat , a person may be transferred to a country that provides credible assurances that the rendered person will not be tortured . neither cat nor its implementing legislation prohibits the rendition of persons to countries where they would be subject to harsh treatment not rising to the level of torture . besides cat , additional obligations may be imposed upon u.s. rendition practice via the geneva conventions , the war crimes act ( as amended by the military commissions act ( p.l . 109-366 ) , the international covenant on civil and political rights ( iccpr ) , and the universal declaration on human rights . legislation was introduced in the 110th congress to limit or bar u.s. participation in renditions . it is possible that similar legislation will be proposed in the 111th congress .
