the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) for five years . congress has inconclusively debatedlong - term tanf authorizations since 2002 , instead adopting short - term extensions . the latestextension ( p.l . 109-19 ) funds the program through december 31 , 2005. thus far in the 109thcongress , the senate finance committee has reported s. 667 ( s.rept . 109-51 ) . a billintroduced by house republican leaders , h.r . 240 , has received approval from thehouse ways and means committee 's subcommittee on human resources . s. 667 and h.r . 240 are very similar in terms of how they wouldcontinue funding under the tanf program . both bills extend basic tanf funding at current levels ( $ 16.6 billion for the 50 states , the district of columbia , and the territories ) through fy2010 andextend supplemental grants provided to 17 states through fy2009 . both bills provide new , categorical grants for marriage promotion activities totaling $ 200 million per year financed througha reduction in current tanf bonuses to states . the major difference in the tanf fundingprovisions of the two bills is how they provide extra contingency ( recession - related ) funding to thestates . h.r . 240 essentially extends the current law fund that provides matchinggrants to states experiencing high and increased unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads . s. 667 eliminates the requirement that states expend additional money to accesscontingency funds , and instead bases extra funding on the cost of increased caseloads for states thatmeet revised unemployment or food stamp caseload criteria . the two bills would substantially revise the tanf work participation standards that statesmust meet . under current law , 50 % of tanf families with an adult or minor household head mustparticipate , though the 50 % rate is reduced by caseload reductions that have occurred since welfarereform . both s. 667 and h.r . 240 would raise this standard to 70 % , though under both bills the standard could be reduced through credits ( though the credits differbetween the two bills ) . both also eliminate a separate 90 % participation rate requirement fortwo - parent families . both bills would raise the minimum hours required of family members in orderto be considered full participants , though h.r . 240 would raise them by morethan would s. 667. the bills also differ in the activities countable toward theparticipation standards : h.r . 240 narrows the list of activities countable , requiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work , community service , or work experienceprograms except for a short ( usually three - month ) period when states may themselves define whatcounts as `` activities . . s. 667 keeps all activities under current law as countable , andallows states to count a wider range of activities for three months ( more under some circumstances ) . both bills contain non - tanf provisions relating to child support enforcement , responsible '' fatherhood '' programs , and transitional medical assistance ( not addressed herein ) . this report willbe updated as s. 667 and h.r . 240 move through the legislative process .
