since the events of september 11 , 2001 , the security of the nation 's drinking water and wastewater infrastructure has received increased attention from congress and the executive branch . wastewater facilities in the united states provide essential services to residential , commercial , and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters . these facilities , however , may possess certain characteristics that terrorists could exploit either to impair the wastewater treatment process or to damage surrounding communities and infrastructure . gao was asked to obtain experts ' views on the key security - related vulnerabilities affecting the nation 's wastewater systems , the activities the federal government should support to improve wastewater security , and the criteria that should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated to improve security , and the best methods to distribute these funds . gao conducted a systematic , web - based survey of 50 nationally recognized experts to seek consensus on these key wastewater security issues . epa expressed general agreement with the report , citing its value as the agency works with its partners to better secure the nation 's critical wastewater infrastructure . experts identified the collection system 's network of sewer lines as the most vulnerable asset of a wastewater utility . experts stated that the sewers could be used either as a means to covertly gain access to surrounding buildings or as a conduit to inject hazardous substances that could impair a wastewater treatment plant 's capabilities . among the other vulnerabilities most frequently cited were the storage and transportation of chemicals used in the wastewater treatment process and the automated systems that control many vital operations . in addition , experts described a number of vulnerabilities not specific to particular assets but which may also affect the security of wastewater facilities . these vulnerabilities include a general lack of security awareness among wastewater facility staff and administrators , interdependencies among various wastewater facility components leading to the possibility that the disruption of a single component could take down the entire system , and interdependencies between wastewater facilities and other critical infrastructures . experts identified several key activities as most deserving of federal funds to improve wastewater facilities ' security . among those most frequently cited was the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous alternatives . this activity was rated as warranting highest priority for federal funding by 29 of 50 experts . other security - enhancing activities most often rated as warranting highest priority included improving local , state , and regional collaboration ( 23 of 50 experts ) and supporting facilities ' efforts to comprehensively assess their vulnerabilities ( 20 of 50 experts ) . when asked how federal wastewater security funds should be allocated among potential recipients , the vast majority of experts suggested that wastewater utilities serving critical infrastructure ( e.g . , public health institutions , government , commercial and industrial centers ) should be given highest priority ( 39 of 50 ) . other recipients warranting highest priority included utilities using large quantities of gaseous chemicals ( 26 of 50 ) and utilities serving areas with large populations ( 24 of 50 ) . experts identified direct federal grants as the most effective method to distribute the funds , noting particular circumstances in which a matching contribution should be sought from recipients . specifically , a matching requirement was often recommended to fund activities that benefit individual utilities . grants with no matching requirements were often recommended for activities that should be implemented more quickly and would benefit multiple utilities . the other funding mechanisms experts mentioned most frequently included the federal clean water state revolving fund , loans or loan guarantees , trust funds , and tax incentives .
