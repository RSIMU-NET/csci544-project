significant management challenges exist for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) as it continues to integrate its varied management processes , policies , and systems in areas such as financial management and information technology . these activities are primarily led by the under secretary for management ( usm ) , department management chiefs , and management chiefs in dhs 's seven components . this testimony summarizes a new gao report ( gao - 10-131 ) that examined the extent to which dhs has developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that includes the characteristics recommended in gao 's earlier 2005 report , how dhs is implementing management integration , and the extent to which the usm is holding the department and component management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships . gao reviewed dhs plans and interviewed dhs management officials . dhs has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration as required by the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 and with the characteristics gao recommended in a 2005 report . although dhs stated at that time that it was developing an integration strategy it has not yet done so , in part because it has focused on building operations capacity within functional management areas . in the absence of a comprehensive management integration strategy , dhs officials stated that documents such as strategic plans and management directives address aspects of a management integration strategy and can help the department to manage its integration efforts . however , they do not generally include all of the strategy characteristics gao identified , such as identifying the critical links that must occur among management initiatives . in addition , dhs has increased the number of performance measures for the management directorate , but has not yet established measures for assessing management integration across the department . without these measures , dhs can not assess its progress in implementing and achieving management integration . in the absence of a comprehensive strategy , dhs 's management directorate has implemented management integration through certain initiatives and mechanisms to communicate and consolidate management policies , processes , and systems . for example , dhs is in the process of consolidating its financial management , acquisition , and asset management systems . the directorate has also instituted a system of management councils and governance boards to communicate information and manage specific activities related to management initiatives . the usm and department and component management chiefs are held accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships at three levels -- between the secretary and the usm , the usm and department chiefs , and the department and component chiefs -- in which , among other things , the secretary of homeland security , usm , and department chiefs are required to provide input into performance plans and evaluations . performance management practices for management integration between dhs 's department and component management chiefs are not consistently in place . department chiefs are not consistently providing the guidance and input required by department management directives and in accordance with performance management leading practices . without ensuring that the management chiefs provide input into component chiefs ' performance plans and evaluations as required , the directorate can not be sure that component chiefs are fully implementing management integration .
