federal policymakers have long been interested in the potential of carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) as a mitigation strategy for lowering global emissions of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . congress has appropriated more than $ 7 billion since fy2008 to ccs activities at the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) . the obama administration has promulgated rules on co2 emissions from fossil fuel - burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit co2 emissions . congress remains divided over those executive branch decisions . doe , however , has continued to embrace ccs as part of the administration 's strategy to reduce co2 emissions from power plants . several bills introduced in the 114th congress address ccs directly or indirectly ( e.g . , s. 601 , s. 1283 , h.r . 3392 , and others ) . the american recovery and reinvestment act ( recovery act ; p.l . 111-5 ) provided $ 3.4 billion for ccs projects and activities at doe . the large infusion of funding was intended to help develop technologies that would allow for commercial - scale demonstration of ccs in both new and retrofitted power plants and industrial facilities by 2020. nine individual projects garnered approximately $ 2.65 billion of the $ 3.4 billion â€” about 78 % . each of the nine projects was awarded more than $ 100 million , and these projects illustrate that doe prioritized large - scale demonstration projects with recovery act funding . the lion 's share of funding went to doe 's flagship ccs project futuregen , which was awarded nearly $ 1 billion from the recovery act . authority to spend recovery act funds expired on september 30 , 2015. of $ 3.4 billion allocated for ccs activities , approximately $ 1.4 billion went unspent as of the spending deadline . the largest portion of the unspent funds , $ 795 million , was intended for futuregen , which doe suspended in february 2015. futuregen faced various impediments that led to its cancellation , including delays in receiving required injection well permits from the environmental protection agency , court challenges to its plan to sell electricity , and a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy group . several other large ccs demonstration projects also were canceled , suspended , or failed to spend all of their recovery act funding before the 2015 deadline . some stakeholders argue that doe 's ccs programs have been inadequately funded , providing less incentive than they should for deploying ccs . one study concluded that even the financial boost from the recovery act was insufficient . to be sure , large - scale ccs projects are complex endeavors , requiring substantial capital investment and multiyear planning and construction schedules . however , the conclusion that more federal funding by itself would be sufficient to support development and commercialization of ccs technology may be overly simplistic . doe acknowledges that many of the recovery act - funded projects were technologically difficult and challenging , but it does not consider the relinquishment of unspent funds to signify project failure . doe notes that due to its spending on ccs and its partnerships with industry , the costs of capturing co2 have dropped significantly and its projects have stored more than 10 million metric tons of co2 . the u.s. environmental protection agency 's ( epa 's ) final rule for reducing co2 emissions from new fossil fuel power plants , part of the administration 's clean power plan , found plants incorporating partial ccs to be the best system of emission reduction ( bser ) . epa asserts that ccs is technically feasible . technical feasibility , however , is just one factor of many that determine whether a project successfully reaches its goal of producing electricity and capturing co2 at commercial scale . epa states that implementing partial ccs in the rule is likely to boost future research and development in ccs technologies and to make ccs implementation more efficacious and cost - effective . that may be the case ; however , other issues also affect ccs implementation . these issues , as well as the outcomes from promulgation of epa 's final rule , will likely continue to shape the outlook for ccs commercialization and deployment .
