as the nation 's largest cash assistance program for the poor , the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program ssi provided $ 33 billion in benefits to 6.8 million aged , blind , and disabled persons last year . in 2001 , the outstanding ssi debt and newly detected overpayments totaled $ 4.7 billion . to deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients financial eligibility for benefits , enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads , and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities . however , because a number of initiatives are still in the planning or early implementation stages , it is too soon to assess their ultimate impact on ssi payment accuracy . in addition to improving its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities , ssa has made recovery of overpaid benefits a high priority .
