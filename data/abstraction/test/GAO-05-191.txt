an institute at the national institutes of health ( nih ) and an office in the environmental protection agency ( epa ) entered into collaborative arrangements with the american chemistry council ( acc ) to support research on the health effects of chemical exposures . nih accepted a gift from acc to help fund the research . epa and acc funded their proposals separately . the arrangements raised concerns about the potential for acc to influence research that could affect the chemical industry . gao determined the agencies ' legal authorities to enter into the arrangements ; the extent to which the agencies evaluated and managed potential conflicts of interest resulting from these arrangements ; the extent to which the nih institute complied with nih 's gift acceptance policy ; and the extent to which nih , epa , and other agencies have similar arrangements . nih 's national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) used the authorities granted to nih 's institutes and centers under sections of the public health service act to enter into its arrangement with acc . similarly , epa 's office of research and development ( ord ) relied on authorities granted to epa under sections of the clean air act , the clean water act , and the solid waste disposal act to enter into its research arrangement . nothing in these statutes appears to prohibit either agency from entering into research arrangements with nonprofit organizations such as acc . niehs and ord did not formally evaluate the potential for conflicts of interest with acc before they entered into the arrangements , but both agencies took steps to manage the potential as the arrangements were implemented . nih and epa had no specific policies requiring officials to evaluate or manage potential conflicts of interest when they entered into the acc arrangements , nor do they currently have such policies . although no formal evaluation occurred , agency officials managed the arrangements through their existing research management processes . both agencies believe these actions helped mitigate the potential for undue influence by acc and adequately protected the integrity of the scientific research conducted under the arrangements . because the agencies ' research management processes were not designed to address conflict of interest issues they are not a substitute for a formal evaluation of such conflicts . without policies requiring a formal evaluation and management of conflicts , there is no assurance that similar arrangements will be appropriately evaluated and managed for such conflicts in the future . niehs officials complied with portions of nih 's gift acceptance policy that guide the acknowledgement and administration of gifts . however , the policy 's guidance on evaluating and managing potential conflicts is extremely broad , and it lacks clarity and consistency . as a result , the policy gives officials wide discretion in this area . in addition , the policy does not require the agency to document the basis for its decisions . consequently , the policy does not provide sufficient assurance that potential conflicts of interest between nih and donor organizations will be appropriately considered . while some institutes and centers at nih had arrangements somewhat similar to the acc arrangements , gao did not find any similar arrangements at other program offices at epa or at the food and drug administration and the federal aviation administration -- two other agencies with significant research budgets . none of the nine research arrangements gao found at nih institutes and centers involve organizations that represent industry in the same direct manner that acc represents the chemical industry .
