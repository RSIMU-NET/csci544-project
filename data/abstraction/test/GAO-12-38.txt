in response to the recession of 2007 , congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) . recovery act funds provided states with fiscal relief and helped to maintain state medicaid programs through a temporary increase to the federal share of medicaid funding - the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) - from october 2008 through december 2010. in march 2011 , gao reported that states ' ability to fund medicaid was hampered due to increased medicaid enrollment and declines in states ' revenues that typically occur during a national downturn . the recovery act mandated that gao provide recommendations for modifying the increased fmap formula to make it more responsive to state medicaid program needs during future economic downturns . in this report , gao presents a prototype formula for a temporary increased fmap and evaluates its effects on the allocation of assistance to states . to evaluate the three components of the prototype formula -- starting assistance , targeting assistance , and ending assistance -- gao uses the 2007 recession . gao 's prototype formula offers a timely and targeted option for providing states temporary medicaid assistance during a national economic downturn . once a threshold number of states -- 26 in gao 's prototype formula -- show a sustained decrease in their employment - to - population ( epop ) ratio , temporary increases to states ' fmaps would be triggered automatically . the epop ratio compares the number of employed persons in a state to the working age population aged 16 and older . this assistance would end when fewer than the threshold number of states shows a decline in their epop ratio . because the prototype formula relies on labor market data as an automatic trigger rather than legislative action , assistance would have begun earlier and extended longer than the assistance provided by the recovery act . the prototype formula would have triggered assistance to begin in january 2008 and end in september 2011 , compared with the recovery act which provided an increased fmap from october 2008 through june 2011. once the increased fmap is triggered , targeted state assistance would be calculated based on two components : increases in unemployment , as a proxy for changes in medicaid enrollment ; and reductions in total wages and salaries , as a proxy for changes in states ' revenues . gao 's prototype formula provides a baseline of funding for state medicaid needs during an economic downturn by offering automatic , timely , and targeted assistance to states . such assistance would facilitate state budget planning , provide states with greater fiscal stability , and better align federal assistance with the magnitude of the economic downturn 's effects on individual states . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) agreed with the analysis and goals of the report and emphasized the importance of aligning changes to the fmap formula with individual state circumstances . hhs noted the complexity of the prototype formula and offered several considerations to guide policy choices regarding appropriate thresholds for timing and targeting of increased fmap funds . to ensure that federal funding efficiently and effectively responds to the countercyclical nature of the medicaid program , congress could consider enacting an increased fmap formula that targets variable state medicaid needs and provides automatic , timely , and temporary assistance in response to national economic downturns .
