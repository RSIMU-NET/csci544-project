of the 26 areas on gao 's high - risk list of federal programs or activities that are at risk for waste , fraud , abuse , or mismanagement , 8 are department of defense ( dod ) programs or operations and another 6 are governmentwide high - risk areas that also apply to dod . these high - risk areas relate to most of dod 's major business operations . dod 's failure to effectively resolve these high - risk areas has resulted in billions of dollars of waste each year , ineffective performance , and inadequate accountability . at a time when dod is competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment , it is critically important that dod get the most from every defense dollar . dod has taken several positive steps and devoted substantial resources toward establishing key management structures and processes to successfully transform its business operations and address its high - risk areas , but overall progress by area varies widely and huge challenges remain . this testimony addresses dod 's efforts to develop a comprehensive , integrated , enterprisewide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach and comply with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability . the testimony also addresses two sections included in recent legislation and other dod high - risk areas . in the past year , dod has made progress in transforming its business operations , but continues to lack a comprehensive , enterprisewide approach to its overall business transformation effort . within dod , business transformation is broad , encompassing people , planning , management , structures , technology , and processes in many key business areas . while dod 's planning and management continues to evolve , it has yet to develop a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide plan that covers all key business functions , and contains results - oriented goals , measures and expectations that link organizational , unit , and individual performance goals , while also being clearly linked to dod 's overall investment plans . because of the complexity and long - term nature of business transformation , dod also continues to need a chief management official ( cmo ) with significant authority , experience , and tenure to provide sustained leadership and integrate dod 's overall business transformation effort . without formally designating responsibility and accountability for results , reconciling competing priorities in investments will be difficult and could impede dod 's progress in its transformation efforts . dod is taking steps to comply with legislative requirements aimed at improving its business systems modernization and financial management ; however , much remains to be accomplished . in particular , dod recently issued updates to both the business enterprise architecture and the transition plan , which are still not sufficiently complete to effectively and efficiently guide and constrain business system investments across the department . most notably , the architecture is not adequately linked to dod component architectures , and the plan does not include business system information for all major dod components . to address these shortfalls , dod issued a strategy for `` federating '' or extending its architecture to the defense components . but much remains to be accomplished before a well - defined federated architecture is in place , given that gao recently reported that select components ' architecture programs are not mature . however , dod components continue to invest billions of dollars in thousands of new and existing business system programs . the risks associated with investing in systems ahead of having a well - defined architecture and transition plan are profound and must be managed carefully , as must the wide assortment of other risks that gao 's work has shown to exist on specific dod business system investments . while not a guarantee , gao 's work and research has shown that establishing effective system modernization management controls , such as an architecture - centric approach to investment decision making , can increase the chances of delivering cost - effective business capabilities on time and within budget . further , with regard to legislation pertaining to financial management improvement , dod issued and updated its financial improvement and audit readiness plan in fiscal year 2006 to provide components with a construct for resolving problems affecting the accuracy and timeliness of financial information and an improved audit strategy for obtaining financial statement audit opinions .
