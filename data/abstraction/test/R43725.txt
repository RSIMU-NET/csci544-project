congress has enacted a series of legislative provisions since 2006 to enable certain iraqi and afghan nationals to become u.s. lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) . these provisions make certain iraqis and afghans who worked as translators or interpreters , or who were employed by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government in iraq or afghanistan , eligible for special immigrant visas ( sivs ) . special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment - based admissions under the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) . while the special immigrant category is unique , it does bear some similarities to other admission categories that are authorized by other sections of the ina , including refugees and amerasian children . to apply under the siv programs for iraqis or afghans , a prospective special immigrant must submit a petition to the department of homeland security ; be otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa ; and be otherwise admissible to the united states . an iraqi or afghan siv applicant whose petition is approved and who is abroad is required to have an in - person visa interview at a u.s. embassy or consulate abroad to determine visa eligibility . upon admission to the united states , siv recipients are granted lpr status . iraqi and afghan special immigrants are eligible for the same resettlement assistance and federal public benefits as refugees . there are three siv programs for iraqi and afghan nationals . one is a permanent program for certain iraqis and afghans who have worked directly with u.s. armed forces , or under chief of mission authority , as translators or interpreters . this program is currently capped at 50 principal aliens ( excluding spouses and children ) per year . the other two siv programs for iraqis and afghans are temporary . one program is for certain iraqis who were employed in iraq by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government during a specified period . it was capped at 5,000 principal aliens annually for fy2008 through fy2012 and included a provision to carry forward any unused numbers from one fiscal year to the next . it expired at the end of fy2013 , but was subsequently revived . current statutory authority provides for the issuance of no more than 2,500 visas to principal applicants after january 1 , 2014. applications are no longer being accepted for this program because the application deadline has passed . there is a similar siv program for certain afghans who were employed in afghanistan by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government or by the international security assistance force during a specified period . the program was capped at 1,500 principal aliens annually for fy2009 through fy2013 , with a provision to carry forward any unused numbers from one fiscal year to the next . current statutory authority provides for the issuance of no more than 18,500 visas to principal applicants after december 19 , 2014. the application period for this program remains open . through the end of fy2018 , more than 79,000 individuals were granted special immigrant status under the three siv programs for iraqi and afghan nationals . principal applicants accounted for about 26,000 of the total , and dependent spouses and children accounted for the remaining 53,000. the iraqi and afghan siv programs have faced challenges with respect to application processing , security screening , and visa availability . the structure of the siv programs themselves , with statutory timeframes and numerical limitations , introduces additional complication .
