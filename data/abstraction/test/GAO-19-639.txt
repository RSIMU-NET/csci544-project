u.s airspace system is one of the safest in the world , but incidents and near misses at and around u.s. terminal areas still occur . faa oversees the safety of runways and taxiways and works with industry partners — including airlines , airports , pilots , and others — to improve safety in these areas . despite faa 's continued efforts , the number of reported terminal area incidents has increased over time . gao was asked to review various issues related to runway safety and to update its prior work on airport terminal areas . this report examines : the extent to which faa uses data to analyze terminal area incidents and efforts faa and others have implemented to improve terminal area safety , and how faa assesses their effectiveness . gao analyzed faa data ; interviewed officials from 10 airports selected based on high runway incident rates in the past 3 years , among other factors ; and interviewed federal and industry officials . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) uses data to analyze some types of incidents in airport “ terminal areas ” — runways , taxiways , and ramps . for example , faa uses data to analyze runway “ incursions ” — the incorrect presence of an aircraft , vehicle , or person on the runway . according to faa data , the rate of reported runway incursions nearly doubled from fiscal years 2011 through 2018 , with most of this increase due to a rise in reports of less severe incursions , or those without immediate safety consequences . however , gao found that faa has not identified or removed all duplicates from its data on runway “ excursions ” — when an aircraft veers off or overruns a runway — which limits faa 's ability to accurately analyze these incidents . additionally , faa does not use data to analyze incidents that occur in ramp areas — the parts of terminal areas where aircraft are prepared for departure and arrival — where injuries to workers and damage to aircraft can occur . without a process to leverage accurate excursion and ramp incident data , faa may not be able to assess the risk these incidents pose to passengers , airport staff , and others . faa , airports , and airlines have implemented multiple efforts to improve terminal area safety , but faa has not assessed the effectiveness of many of its efforts . for example , faa has funded multiple technologies to improve runway safety , such as airport surface detection equipment , model x ( asde - x ) — a ground surveillance system that enables air traffic controllers to track landing and departing aircraft and alerts controllers of potential collisions . however , faa has not assessed the effectiveness of asde - x . similarly , faa has not assessed the effectiveness of its runway safety program , whereby faa staff , along with local airport stakeholders , provide data and support to local air traffic managers to help identify and manage terminal area safety incidents . faa has taken steps to evaluate some of its terminal - area safety efforts , such as tracking the number of runway excursions safely stopped by a lightweight , crushable concrete designed to stop or greatly slow an aircraft that overruns the runway . however , without assessing how all of faa 's efforts contribute to its goal of improving runway and taxiway safety , faa can not determine the extent to which it is targeting its limited resources to the most effective strategies . gao is making five recommendations including that faa identify and remove duplicate excursion data , develop processes to analyze ramp area incidents , and establish a plan to assess the effectiveness of its terminal area safety efforts . faa concurred with the recommendations .
