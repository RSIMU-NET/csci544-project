pursuant to congressional requests , gao reviewed , in conjunction with the department of defense 's ( dod ) inspector general ( ig ) , dod efforts to reduce problem disbursements and its implementation of a statutory requirement to match each disbursement exceeding $ 5 million to the appropriate obligation before the disbursement is made . gao found that : dod reduced its problem disbursements from $ 37.8 billion to $ 23.1 billion as of september 1995 ; dod disbursement problems persist due to long - standing system weaknesses and dod failure to comply with basic accounting procedures for validating , reconciling , and reporting transactions ; dod has automated the prevalidation process for the defense finance and accounting service 's ( dfas ) columbus center contract payment system and eight other primary contract accounting systems to handle their large volume of transactions ; there are deficiencies in the automated programs for prevalidating army and air force disbursements ; dod has lowered the prevalidation threshold to $ 1 million for all disbursement centers except dfas - columbus ; this limited implementation hampers dod ability to resolve its disbursement problems , since dfas - columbus is responsible for about 40 percent of dod contractor and vendor payments ; from july 1995 through january 1996 , dfas - columbus prevalidated only about one - third of the total dollar amount of its disbursements ; and to resolve disbursement problems , dod needs to prevalidate as many transactions as practical , further lower the prevalidation threshold , and follow basic accounting procedures until it has corrected serious weaknesses in its accounting and contracting systems .
