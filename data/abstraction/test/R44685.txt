the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in a particular position in congress — or congressional staff tenure — is a source of recurring interest to members , staff , and the public . a congressional office , for example , may seek this information to assess its human resources capabilities , or for guidance in how frequently staffing changes might be expected for various positions . congressional staff may seek this type of information to evaluate and approach their own individual career trajectories . this report presents a number of statistical measures regarding the length of time senate committee staff stay in particular job positions . it is designed to facilitate the consideration of tenure from a number of perspectives . this report provides tenure data for a selection of 15 staff position titles that are typically used in senate committee offices , and information on how to use those data for different purposes . the positions include chief clerk , chief counsel , communications director , counsel , deputy staff director , legislative assistant , minority staff director , press secretary , professional staff member , senior counsel , senior professional staff member , staff assistant , staff director , subcommittee staff director , and systems administrator . senate committee staff tenure data were calculated as of march 31 , for each year between 2006 and 2016 , for all staff in each position . an overview table provides staff tenure for selected positions for 2016 , including summary statistics and information on whether the time staff stayed in a position increased , was unchanged , or decreased between 2006 and 2016. other tables provide detailed tenure data and visualizations for each position title . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position , appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in four position titles in senate committees . the median tenure was unchanged for seven positions , and decreased for four positions . these findings may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . pay may be one of many factors that affect an individual 's decision to remain in or leave a particular job . senate committee staff holding positions that are generally lower - paid typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in generally higher - paying positions . lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level roles ; if so , tenure for senate committee employees in these roles appears to follow national trends for other entry - level jobs , which individuals hold for a relatively short period of time . those in more senior positions , where a particular level of congressional or other professional experience is often required , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . generalizations about staff tenure are limited in some ways , because each senate committee serves as its own hiring authority . variations from office to office , which might include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which data provided here might match tenure in another office . direct comparisons of congressional employment to the general labor market may have similar limitations . change in committee leadership , for example , may cause staff tenure periods to end abruptly and unexpectedly . this report is one of a number of crs products on congressional staff . others include crs report r43946 , senate staff levels in member , committee , leadership , and other offices , 1977-2016 , by [ author name scrubbed ] , [ author name scrubbed ] , and [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report r44325 , staff pay levels for selected positions in senate committees , fy2001-fy2014 , coordinated by [ author name scrubbed ] .
