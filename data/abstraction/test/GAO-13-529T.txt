stem education programs help to enhance the nation 's global competitiveness . many federal agencies have been involved in administering these programs . concerns have been raised about the overall effectiveness and efficiency of stem education programs . this testimony discusses the number of federal agencies and programs that provided funding for stem education programs in fiscal year 2010 ; the extent to which stem education programs overlap ; and the extent to which stem education programs measured effectiveness and were aligned to a governmentwide strategy . this testimony is based on several previously published gao reports and includes updates on actions taken in response to these reports . in fiscal year 2010 , 13 federal agencies invested over $ 3 billion in 209 programs designed to increase knowledge of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) fields and attainment of stem degrees . the number of programs within agencies ranged from 3 to 46 , with the department of health and human services , department of energy , and the national science foundation administering more than half of the 209 programs . almost a third of all programs had obligations of $ 1 million or less , while some had obligations of over $ 100 million . beyond programs specifically focused on stem education , agencies funded other broad efforts that contributed to enhancing stem education . eighty - three percent of the programs gao identified overlapped to some degree with at least 1 other program in that they offered similar services to similar target groups in similar stem fields to achieve similar objectives . many programs have a broad scope -- serving multiple target groups with multiple services . however , even when programs overlap , the services they provide and the populations they serve may differ in meaningful ways and would therefore not necessarily be duplicative . nonetheless , the programs are similar enough that they need to be well coordinated and guided by a robust strategic plan . agencies ' limited use of performance measures and evaluations may hamper their ability to assess the effectiveness of their individual programs as well as the overall stem education effort . specifically , program officials varied in their ability to provide reliable output measures -- for example , the number of students , teachers , or institutions directly served by their program . further , most agencies did not use outcomes measures in a way that is clearly reflected in their performance planning documents . in addition , a majority of programs did not conduct comprehensive evaluations since our prior review in 2005 and the time of our survey in 2011 to assess effectiveness , and the evaluations gao reviewed did not always align with program objectives . finally , gao found that completed stem education evaluation results had not always been disseminated in a fashion that facilitated knowledge sharing between both practitioners and researchers . in naming stem education as a crosscutting goal , the administration is taking the first step towards better governmentwide coordinated planning ; however , it will be important to finalize a governmentwide strategic plan so agencies can better align their performance plans and reports to new governmentwide goals . gao previously recommended that the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) should direct the national science and technology council ( nstc ) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy , develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination , identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination , and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs . since gao 's report , ostp released a progress report that identified some programs for elimination , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) named stem education one of its interim cross - cutting priority goals . gao previously recommended that the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) should direct the national science and technology council ( nstc ) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy , develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination , identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination , and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs . since gaoÂ’s report , ostp released a progress report that identified some programs for elimination , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) named stem education one of its interim cross - cutting priority goals .
