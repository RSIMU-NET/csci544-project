in fiscal year 2014 , medicare processed 1.2 billion ffs claims submitted by providers on behalf of beneficiaries . when medicare denies or reduces payment for a claim or a portion of a claim , providers , beneficiaries , and others may appeal these decisions through medicare 's appeals process . in recent years there have been increases in the number of filed and backlogged appeals ( i.e . , pending appeals that remain undecided after statutory time frames ) . gao was asked to examine levels 1 through 4 of medicare 's appeals process . this report examines trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , data hhs uses to monitor the appeals process , and hhs efforts to reduce the number of appeals filed and backlogged . gao analyzed data from the three data systems used to monitor appeals , reviewed relevant hhs agency documentation and policies , federal internal control standards , and interviewed hhs agency officials and others . the appeals process for medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) claims consists of four administrative levels of review within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and a fifth level in which appeals are reviewed by federal courts . appeals are generally reviewed by each level sequentially , as appellants may appeal a decision to the next level depending on the prior outcome . under the administrative process , separate appeals bodies review appeals and issue decisions under time limits established by law , which can vary by level . from fiscal years 2010 and 2014 , the total number of filed appeals at levels 1 through 4 of medicare 's ffs appeals process increased significantly but varied by level . level 3 experienced the largest rate of increase in appeals — from 41,733 to 432,534 appeals ( 936 percent ) — during this period . a significant portion of the increase was driven by appeals of hospital and other inpatient stays , which increased from 12,938 to 275,791 appeals ( over 2,000 percent ) at level 3. hhs attributed the growth in appeals to its increased program integrity efforts and a greater propensity of providers to appeal claims , among other things . gao also found that the number of appeal decisions issued after statutory time frames generally increased during this time , with the largest increase in and largest proportion of late decisions occurring at appeal levels 3 and 4. for example , in fiscal year 2014 , 96 percent of level 3 decisions were issued after the general 90-day statutory time frame for level 3. the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and two other components within hhs that are part of the medicare appeals process use data collected in three appeal data systems — such as the date when the appeal was filed , the type of service or claim appealed , and the length of time taken to issue appeal decisions — to monitor the medicare appeals process . however , these systems do not collect other data that hhs agencies could use to monitor important appeal trends , such as information related to the reasons for level 3 decisions and the actual amount of medicare reimbursement at issue . gao also found variation in how appeals bodies record decisions across the three systems , including the use of different categories to track the type of medicare service at issue in the appeal . absent more complete and consistent appeals data , hhs 's ability to monitor emerging trends in appeals is limited and is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that require agencies to run and control agency operations using relevant , reliable , and timely information . hhs agencies have taken several actions aimed at reducing the total number of medicare appeals filed and the current appeals backlog . for example , in 2014 , cms agreed to pay a portion of the payable amount for certain denied hospital claims on the condition that pending appeals associated with those claims were withdrawn and rights to future appeals of them waived . however , despite this and other actions taken by hhs agencies , the medicare appeals backlog continues to grow at a rate that outpaces the adjudication process and will likely persist . further , hhs efforts do not address inefficiencies regarding the way appeals of certain repetitious claims — such as claims for monthly oxygen equipment rentals — are adjudicated , which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards . under the current process , if the initial claim is reversed in favor of the appellant , the decision generally can not be applied to the other related claims . as a result , more appeals must go through the appeals process . gao recommends that hhs take four actions , including improving the completeness and consistency of the data used by hhs to monitor appeals and implementing a more efficient method of handling appeals associated with repetitious claims . hhs generally agreed with four of gao 's recommendations , and disagreed with a fifth recommendation , citing potential unintended consequences . gao agrees and has dropped that recommendation .
