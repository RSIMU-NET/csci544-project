gao has previously found that dhs 's components had acquisition programs that did not meet requirements and that those requirements were , in some cases , poorly defined . poorly defined requirements increase the risk that acquisitions will not meet the needs of users in the field — for example , border patrol agents or emergency responders . gao was asked to examine dhs components ' practices for developing requirements . this report addresses the policies , organizations , and workforce that selected dhs components use to develop requirements for their acquisition programs . gao selected seven dhs components with significant acquisition programs and a non - generalizable sample of programs — based on cost , component , and acquisition phase — as case studies . gao analyzed policies and program documentation ; and interviewed dhs and component officials , as well as end users of dhs programs . gao compared components ' practices to industry best practices and federal internal control standards . gao has identified several best practices to ensure that operational requirements for acquisitions are well - defined and found some department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) components met them while others did not . these practices include a formal policy for developing requirements , an independent requirements organization , and an understanding of workforce needs and training . the table below shows gao 's assessment of seven of dhs 's components against these practices . establishing a formal policy to guide the process is critical to developing well - defined requirements . however , only the coast guard has an approved policy for requirements development among the seven components reviewed . without well - defined requirements , components are at risk of acquiring capabilities that will not meet mission needs . dhs officials told gao that components have generally prioritized obtaining funding and starting programs over developing requirements . three components have a requirements development organization , separating requirements from acquisition in addressing capability gaps . officials from components without such organizations told gao that they have fewer major acquisitions and rely on dhs to assist in requirements development . dhs policy and best practices , however , maintain the importance of this separation regardless of the number of major acquisitions to guard against possible bias by acquisition officials toward a specific materiel solution . two components have assessed requirements development workforce needs , but both need to be updated ; and one component has provided requirements development training and certification . other component officials told gao that they lack the resources necessary to take these steps . best practices indicate that without an appropriately sized and trained workforce , components remain at risk of acquiring capabilities that fail to meet end user needs . gao is making 25 recommendations , including to individual components to establish policies and independent organizations for requirements development , assess workforce needs , and establish training and certifications . dhs concurred with all the recommendations .
