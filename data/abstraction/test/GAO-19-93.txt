following hurricane katrina , congress required fema to establish advance contracts for goods and services to enable the government to quickly and effectively mobilize resources in the aftermath of a disaster , like those that affected the united states in 2017. gao was asked to review the federal government 's response to the three 2017 hurricanes and california wildfires . this report assesses , among other things , fema and usace 's use of advance contracts , fema 's planning and reporting of selected advance contracts , and challenges , if any , with fema 's use of these contracts . gao analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation through may 31 , 2018 ; selected a non - generalizable sample of 14 fema and usace advance contracts that were competed and obligated over $ 50 million , or non - competed and obligated over $ 10 million , in response to the 2017 disasters ; and interviewed fema and usace officials . in response to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , as well as the 2017 california wildfires , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) relied heavily on advance contracts . as of may 31 , 2018 , fema and usace obligated about $ 4.5 billion for various goods and services through these contracts , see figure below . gao found limitations in fema 's use of some advance contracts that provided critical goods and services to survivors , including an outdated strategy and unclear guidance on how contracting officers should use advance contracts during a disaster , and challenges performing acquisition planning . fema also did not always provide complete information in its reports to congressional committees . specifically , gao found 29 advance contract actions that were not included in recent reports due to shortcomings in fema 's reporting methodology , limiting visibility into its disaster contract spending . fema identified challenges with advance contracts in 2017 , including federal coordination with states and localities on their use . fema is required to coordinate with states and localities and encourage them to establish their own advance contracts with vendors . however , gao found inconsistencies in that coordination and the information fema uses to coordinate with states and localities on advance contracts . without consistent information and coordination with fema , states and localities may not have the tools needed to establish their own advance contracts for critical goods and services and quickly respond to future disasters . gao is making nine recommendations to fema , including that it update its strategy and guidance to clarify the use of advance contracts , improve the timeliness of its acquisition planning activities , revise its methodology for reporting disaster contracting actions to congressional committees , and provide more consistent guidance and information to contracting officers to coordinate with and encourage states and localities to establish advance contracts . fema concurred with our recommendations .
