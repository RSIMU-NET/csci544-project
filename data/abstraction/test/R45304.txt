the state of the nation 's water infrastructure and the challenges many communities face in addressing infrastructure needs continue to receive congressional attention . in 1996 , congress authorized the drinking water state revolving fund ( dwsrf ) program under the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) to help public water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and to meet the act 's health protection objectives . under this program , states receive annual capitalization grants from the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to provide financial assistance ( primarily subsidized loans ) to water systems for drinking water projects and related activities . through fy2018 , congress has appropriated a total of $ 20.41 billion for the program . from fy1997 through fy2017 , states provided $ 35.38 billion in dwsrf assistance to water systems for 14,090 projects . epa 's latest survey of capital improvement needs indicates that public water systems need to invest $ 472.6 billion on infrastructure improvements over 20 years to ensure the provision of safe drinking water . epa reports that , while all of the projects identified in the survey would promote sdwa health protection objectives , $ 57.6 billion ( 12 % ) of reported needs are attributable to sdwa compliance . an american water works association study estimates that restoring aging infrastructure and expanding water systems to keep up with population growth would require a nationwide investment of at least $ 1 trillion through 2035. program issues include ( 1 ) the gap between estimated needs and funding ; ( 2 ) the growing cost of complying with sdwa standards ; ( 3 ) the ability of small or disadvantaged communities to afford dwsrf or other financing ; and ( 4 ) the broader need for cities to maintain , upgrade , and expand infrastructure unrelated to sdwa compliance . several overarching policy questions are under debate , including the appropriate federal role in providing financial assistance for local water infrastructure projects and potential funding mechanisms that could supplement or replace a program reliant on annual appropriations . enacted in 2014 , the water infrastructure finance and innovation act ( wifia ; p.l . 113-121 , title v ) authorized a five - year pilot loan guarantee program to promote increased development of , and private investment in , primarily large water infrastructure projects . congress noted that wifia was intended to complement , not replace , the dwsrf program and the similar clean water act state revolving fund ( cwsrf ) program for wastewater infrastructure . for fy2017 , congress provided $ 30.0 million for wifia ( $ 25 million for epa to provide loan guarantees for water infrastructure projects and $ 5 million for administrative costs ) . the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act ( wiin act ; p.l . 114-322 ) made several revisions to the dwsrf program and authorized $ 100 million in dwsrf appropriations to michigan to assist the city of flint in repairing its water system . in p.l . 114-254 , congress appropriated the dwsrf funding authorized in the wiin act . the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l . 115-31 ) , included $ 863.23 million in dwsrf program . for fy2018 , the president requested $ 863 million for the dwsrf program and $ 20 million for wifia . the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) , included $ 1.16 billion for the dwsrf program and $ 63 million for wifia . numerous bills in the 115th congress would expand dwsrf eligibilities , increase funding authority , and authorize new programs to assist water systems and improve infrastructure . two such bills have been reported : ( 1 ) the drinking water system improvement act of 2017 ( h.r . 3387 ) , a sdwa reauthorization bill with provisions intended to improve water systems , sdwa compliance , infrastructure resilience , consumer confidence , and source water protection , among others ; and ( 2 ) america 's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( s. 2800 ) , an omnibus water resources development act ( wrda ) and infrastructure bill that includes sdwa , the clean water act ( cwa ) and wifia srf provisions . on september 13 , 2018 , the house passed ( amended and renamed ) s. 3021 , america 's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( awia ) , which includes elements of s. 2800 and h.r . 8 , the house - passed wrda 2018 bill . title ii of awai closely parallels h.r . 3387 and includes other drinking water - related provisions . title iv contains wifia srf , cwsrf , and other cwa amendments .
