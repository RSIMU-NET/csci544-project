in 1987 , congress enacted what is commonly known as the farm program payments integrity act ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 , p.l . 100-203 , §§1301-1307 ) , which requires that an individual or legal entity be `` actively engaged in farming '' ( aef ) to be eligible for federal commodity revenue support programs . aef requirements apply equally to u.s. citizens , resident aliens , and foreign entities . designing a transparent and comprehensive aef definition has proven difficult and has evolved over the years . the current set of laws and rules governing farm program eligibility — for both family and nonfamily members on farm operations — remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups as well as certain members of congress . in particular , critics contend that current u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) eligibility criteria — especially for providing active personal management — remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments , thus facilitating the creation of new farm operation members simply to expand an operation 's farm payment receipts . three major categories of legal entities are subject to aef requirement for program payment eligibility : an individual , a partnership , and a corporation . an individual must meet three specific aef criteria . first , independently and separately from other individuals with an interest in the farm business , the person makes a significant contribution to the operation of : ( a ) capital , equipment , or land ; and ( b ) active personal labor and / or active personal management . second , the person 's share of profits or losses is commensurate with his / her contribution to the farming operation . third , the person shares in the risk of loss from the farming operation . an individual that meets the aef criteria is eligible for farm program payments but subject to annual payment limits . if a married person meets the aef requirements , any spouse will also be considered to have met the aef requirements , thus effectively doubling the individual payment limit . also , every family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm 's operating results is deemed to meet the aef requirements and is eligible for a separate payment limit . another exception to aef requirements is made for landowners provided they receive income based on the farm 's operating results . a general partnership is an association of multiple persons whereby each member is treated separately and individually for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits . a partnership 's potential payment limit is equal to the limit for a single person times the number of persons or legal entities that comprise the operation 's ownership and meet the aef requirements . thus , adding a new member can potentially provide an additional payment limit . a corporation is an association of joint owners that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits , provided that the entity meets the aef and other eligibility criteria . adding a new member generally does not affect a corporation 's payment limit but only increases the number of members that can share a single payment limit . in accordance with a provision in the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ; §1604 ) , usda added more specificity to the role that a nonfamily member of a partnership or joint venture must play to qualify for farm program benefits . however , considerable issues remain that may be of interest to congress . long - standing concerns remain that some farm operations are organized to overcome program payment limits and maximize the amount of their farm program payments . in particular , some advocacy groups suggest that usda 's new rule did not go far enough in tightening aef criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily farm operations .
