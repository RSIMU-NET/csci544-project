the use of it is crucial to helping va effectively serve the nation 's veterans , and each year , the department spends over $ 4 billion on it . however , over many years , va has had difficulty managing its information systems , raising questions about the effectiveness of its operations and its ability to deliver intended outcomes needed to help advance the department 's mission . gao has previously reported on a number of the department 's it initiatives . this statement summarizes results from key gao reports related to increasing electronic health record interoperability between va and dod ; system challenges that have contributed to gao 's designation of va health care as a high - risk area ; and va 's development of its system for processing disability benefits , data center consolidation , and legacy systems . gao noted in july 2016 that the department of veterans affairs ( va ) had moved forward with an effort to modernize its health information system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — but that the department is uncertain of its long - term plan for addressing its electronic health record system needs beyond fiscal year 2018. beyond modernizing vista , gao reported in august 2015 that va and the department of defense ( dod ) had not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their efforts to increase electronic health record interoperability ( i.e . , the electronic exchange and use of health records ) between the two departments . moreover , va has begun to modernize vista separate from dod 's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system , even though both departments have many health care business needs in common . in 2014 , gao noted that the departments ' decision to abandon the development of a single system in favor of modernizing their two separate systems was not justified and was identified as an example of duplication among government activities . the departments have not yet provided a comparison of the estimated costs and schedules of their current and previous approaches as gao recommended . in february 2015 , gao designated va health care as a high - risk area , with it challenges being one contributing factor . specifically , gao noted that the outpatient appointment scheduling system , which is currently about 30 years old , is time - consuming to use and error prone . however , the project to modernize that system failed after va spent an estimated $ 127 million over 9 years . va has begun a new initiative to build or purchase another scheduling system . gao reported in september 2015 , that va had made progress implementing the veterans benefits management system ( vbms ) for processing disability benefits . however , the department had not developed a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing vbms . va also had not established goals for system response time , and had not minimized incidences of high and medium severity system defects for future vbms releases . further , the department had not assessed user satisfaction , or established user satisfaction goals . in addition , va 's consolidation and closure of data centers has lagged behind other agencies , as gao reported in march 2016. for example , va 's closure of 20 out of a total of 356 data centers gave the department a 6 percent closure rate through fiscal year 2015 that ranked 19th of the 24 agencies in gao 's study . also , va 's reported $ 19.1 million in cost savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015 was only about 0.7 percent of the total of about $ 2.8 billion that all 24 agencies reported saving . in addition , the department had not met any of the data center optimization areas established by the office of management and budget . va was identified in a may 2016 gao report as using antiquated and expensive to maintain , legacy it systems . at that time , the 53-year - old personnel and accounting integrated data ( paid ) system was slated to be replaced in 2017. further , va has plans to retire the 51-year - old benefits delivery network , which tracks veterans ' claims for benefits , eligibility , and death dates in 2018. gao has made numerous recommendations to va to improve the modernization of its it systems . for example , gao has recommended that va develop goals and metrics for determining the extent to which its modernized electronic health record system is achieving interoperability with dod 's ; address challenges associated with modernizing its scheduling system ; address shortcomings with vbms planning and implementation ; take actions to improve progress in data center optimization ; and modernize or replace obsolete legacy it systems . va agreed with these recommendations and said it has begun taking actions to implement them .
