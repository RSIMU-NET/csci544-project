crime data collected through the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) , the national incident - based reporting system ( nibrs ) , and the national crime victimization survey ( ncvs ) are used by congress to inform policy decisions and allocate federal criminal justice funding to states . as such , it is important to understand how each program collects and reports crime data , and the limitations associated with the data . this report reviews ( 1 ) the history of the ucr , the nibrs , and the ncvs ; ( 2 ) the methods each program uses to collect crime data ; and ( 3 ) the limitations of the data collected by each program . the report then compares the similarities and differences of ucr and ncvs data . it concludes by reviewing issues related to the nibrs and the ncvs . the ucr represents the first effort to create a national , standardized measure of the incidence of crime . it was conceived as a way to measure the effectiveness of local law enforcement and to provide law enforcement with data that could be used to help fight crime . ucr data are now used extensively by researchers , government officials , and the media for research , policy , and planning purposes . the ucr also provides some of the most commonly cited crime statistics in the united states . the ucr reports offense and arrest data for 8 different part i offenses and arrest data for 21 different part ii offenses . the nibrs was developed by the federal bureau of investigation to respond to the law enforcement community 's belief that the ucr needed to be updated to provide more in - depth data to meet the needs of law enforcement into the 21st century . the nibrs collects data , including data on offense ( s ) , offender ( s ) , victim ( s ) , arrestee ( s ) , and any property involved in an offense , for 46 different group a offenses and 11 different group b offenses . despite the more detailed crime data that the nibrs can provide , nationwide implementation of the program has been slow , for a variety of reasons , including cost considerations . the ncvs is the primary source of information on the characteristics of criminal victimization , and on the number and types of crime not reported to law enforcement . the ncvs has four major objectives : ( 1 ) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime , ( 2 ) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to police , ( 3 ) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes , and ( 4 ) to permit comparisons over time and population type ( e.g . , urban , suburban , and rural ) . the ncvs asks respondents whether they have been the victim of rape and sexual assault , robbery , simple and aggravated assault , purse snatching / pickpocketing , burglary , theft , or motor vehicle theft . in addition to collecting data on the number of victimizations , the ncvs gathers data on the details of each incident of victimization . this report will be updated as warranted .
