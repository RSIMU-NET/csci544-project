congress has long taken a leadership role in establishing and sustaining offices of inspector general ( oigs ) , which now exist in more than 60 federal departments and agencies . this effort began with congress 's initiation of the first contemporary statutory inspectors general ( igs ) in 1976 ; it has continued with passage of the broadly encompassing 1978 inspector general ( ig ) act and 1988 amendments as well as with additions and modifications in the meantime . in the 110 th congress , two bills designed to increase the igs ' independence and accountability or otherwise modify specific provisions have been introducedâ h.r . 928 and s. 1723 . these bills are similar , and their major provisions include a fixed term of office for igs ; removal for cause only ; apprisal of the intention to remove or transfer an ig given to congress 15 or 30 days in advance ; notification of the annual ig budget request to congress and the office of management and budget ( omb ) when the ig submits it to agency administration ; establishment of a council of inspectors general on integrity and efficiency , replacing the two current councils operating under executive order ; and creation of an integrity committee composed of council members to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by an inspector general or officials in the office . the house oversight and government reform committee reported h.r . 928 with some changes on september 27 , 2007. the bush administration has taken exception to several provisions in h.r . 928 âremoval for cause , transmittal of budget requests to congress , and an independent ig councilâand , on october 1 , 2007 , threatened a veto of the legislation . the house passed h.r . 928 , with amendments , by a vote of 404-11 on october 3 , 2007. this report , which will be updated as developments dictate , covers the main provisions of the proposals .
