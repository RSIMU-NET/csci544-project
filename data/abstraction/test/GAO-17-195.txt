gao has previously reported that federal facilities are vulnerable to threats from foreign sources that may target their information systems and affect the physical security of the occupants . gao was asked to examine gsa 's lease of high - security space from foreign owners . this report addresses what is known about foreign ownership of high - security space leased by gsa , potential risks posed by such foreign ownership , and policies and procedures regarding gsa 's leasing of space from foreign - owned entities . gao reviewed gsa 's leasing documents ; identified and checked ownership information regarding high - security leased space to the extent possible using data , as of march 2016 , from a firm that specializes in analyzing the commercial real estate market ; interviewed gsa and federal foreign investment officials , tenant agencies that were occupying space owned by foreign entities , and five real estate companies that lease space to gsa or provide related services ; and visited three foreign - owned high - security leased facilities selected to represent a variety of owners and tenants . gao reviewed available information on the ownership of general services administration ( gsa ) leased space that requires higher levels of security protection based on factors such as mission criticality and facility size ( high - security space ) as of march 2016 and found that gsa is leasing high - security space from foreign owners in 20 buildings . the 26 tenant agencies occupy about 3.3 million square feet at an annual cost of about $ 97 million and use the space , in some cases , for classified operations and to store law enforcement evidence and sensitive data . the foreign - owned leased space included six federal bureau of investigation field offices and three drug enforcement administration field offices . gao determined that the high - security space is owned by companies based in countries such as canada , china , israel , japan , and south korea . gao was unable to identify ownership information for about one - third of gsa 's 1,406 high - security leases as of march 2016 because ownership information was not readily available for all buildings . federal officials who assess foreign investments in the united states and some tenant agencies occupying high - security leased space told gao that leasing space in foreign - owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access . however , 9 of the 14 tenant agencies gao contacted were unaware that the space they occupy is in a building that we identified as foreign owned . the other five agencies that knew about occupying foreign - owned space had taken actions to mitigate the risk or were not concerned . another risk is possibly entering into leases with hidden beneficial owners â€” the persons who ultimately own and control a building . according to the treasury department 's financial crimes enforcement network , the risks of contracting with hidden beneficial owners include money laundering . gsa is not required to collect beneficial ownership information and therefore does not know the beneficial owners of the buildings it leases . federal agencies are required to assess and address the risks to their high - security facilities but gsa does not inform tenants when leasing space from foreign owners . when leasing space , gsa is required , among other things , to determine whether the prospective lessor is a responsible party , but foreign ownership is not one of the factors that it must consider . as a result , tenants may be unaware that they are occupying foreign - owned space and not know whether they need to address any security risks associated with such foreign ownership . gao recommends that gsa determine whether the beneficial owner of high - security leased space is a foreign entity and , if so , share that information with the tenant agencies for any needed security mitigation . gsa agreed with the recommendation .
