the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) , first in china , and then globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the u.s. economy depends on manufacturing and supply chains based in china . this report aims to assess current developments and identify immediate and longer range china trade issues for congress . an area of particular concern to congress is u.s. shortages in medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity . because of china 's role as a global supplier of ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients , reduced export from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states . exacerbating the situation , in early february 2020 , the chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in chinaâdirecting all production for domestic useâand directed the bureaucracy and chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market . now apparently past the peak of its covid - 19 outbreak , the chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery , with designated countries selected , according to political calculations . congress has enacted legislation to better understand and address u.s. medical supply chain dependencies , including p.l . 116-136 , the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act , that includes several provisions to expand drug shortage reporting requirements ; require certain drug manufacturers to draw up risk management plans ; require the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) to maintain a public list of medical devices that are determined to be in shortage ; and direct the national academies of science , engineering , and medicine to conduct a study of pharmaceutical supply chain security . other potential considerations for congress include whether and how to incentivize additional production of health supplies , diversify production , address other supply chain dependencies ( e.g . , microelectronics ) , fill information and data gaps , and promote u.s. leadership on global health and trade issues . the crisis that has emerged for the u.s. economy is defined , in large part , by a collapse of critical supply , as well as a sharp downturn in demand , first in china and now in the united states and globally . as china 's manufacturing sector recovers , while the united states and other major global markets are grappling with covid - 19 , some fear china could overwhelm overseas markets , as it ramps up export - led growth to compensate for the sharp downturn of exports in the first quarter of 2020 , secure hard currency , and boost economic growth . china may also seek to make gains in strategic sectorsâsuch as telecommunications , microelectronics , and semiconductorsâin which the government undertook extraordinary measures to sustain research and development and manufacturing during the covid - 19 outbreak in china .
