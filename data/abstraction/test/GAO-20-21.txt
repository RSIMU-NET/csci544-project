in may 2018 , gao reported that the trust fund , which pays benefits to certain coal miners , faced financial challenges . the trust fund has borrowed from the u.s. treasury 's general fund almost every year since 1979 to make needed expenditures . gao 's june 2019 testimony included preliminary observations that coal operator bankruptcies were further straining trust fund finances because , in some cases , benefit responsibility was transferred to the trust fund . this report examines how coal mine operator bankruptcies have affected the trust fund , and how dol managed coal mine operator insurance to limit financial risk to the trust fund . gao identified coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016 using bloomberg data . gao selected these years , in part , because bankruptcies were more likely to be resolved so that their effects on the trust fund could be assessed . gao analyzed information on commercially - insured and self - insured coal operators , and examined workers ' compensation insurance practices in four of the nation 's top five coal producing states . gao also interviewed dol officials , coal mine operators , and insurance company representatives , among others . coal mine operator bankruptcies have led to the transfer of about $ 865 million in estimated benefit responsibility to the federal government 's black lung disability trust fund ( trust fund ) , according to dol estimates . the trust fund pays benefits when no responsible operator is identified , or when the liable operator does not pay . gao previously testified in june 2019 that it had identified three bankrupt , self - insured operators for which benefit responsibility was transferred to the trust fund . since that time , dol 's estimate of the transferred benefit responsibility has grown â€” from a prior range of $ 313 million to $ 325 million to the more recent $ 865 million estimate provided to gao in january 2020. according to dol , this escalation was due , in part , to recent increases in black lung benefit award rates and higher medical treatment costs , and to an underestimate of patriot coal 's future benefit claims . dol 's limited oversight of coal mine operator insurance has exposed the trust fund to financial risk , though recent changes , if implemented effectively , can help address these risks . in overseeing self - insurance in the past , dol did not estimate future benefit liability when setting the amount of collateral required to self - insure ; regularly review operators to assess whether the required amount of collateral should change ; or always take action to protect the trust fund by revoking an operator 's ability to self - insure as appropriate . in july 2019 , dol began implementing a new self - insurance process that could help address past deficiencies in estimating collateral and regularly reviewing self - insured operators . however , dol 's new process still lacks procedures for its planned annual renewal of self - insured operators and for resolving coal operator appeals should operators dispute dol collateral requirements . this could hinder dol from revoking an operator 's ability to self - insure should they not comply with dol requirements . further , for those operators that do not self - insure , dol does not monitor them to ensure they maintain adequate and continuous commercial coverage as appropriate . as a result , the trust fund may in some instances assume responsibility for paying benefits that otherwise would have been paid by an insurer . gao is making three recommendations to dol to establish procedures for self - insurance renewals and coal operator appeals , and to develop a process to monitor whether commercially - insured operators maintain adequate and continuous coverage . dol agreed with our recommendations .
