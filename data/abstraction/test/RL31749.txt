this report provides an overview of global foreign direct investment in the people 's republic of china , examines its effects on the chinese economy , surveys u.s. fdi in china , and includes adiscussion of policy implications for the united states . china , by far , is the largest recipient of fdiamong emerging economies with an inflow of $ 52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign - affiliatedfirms operating in china representing paid - in foreign investment of $ 448.0 billion . these firmsaccount for about half of china 's exports and imports . nearly 1,500 u.s. companies from 41 stateshave direct investments of $ 10 to $ 34 billion in china . for the u.s. congress , foreign direct investment in china entails both oversight and regulatory issues . some questions with respect to this investment are : ( 1 ) the extent to which fdi iscontributing to china 's economic growth and technology development , ( 2 ) the extent to which u.s.fdi in china is contributing to the u.s. trade deficit , ( 3 ) whether fdi inflows into china come atthe expense of flows into other countries , ( 4 ) how fdi is affecting security concerns , and ( 5 ) whetherfdi affects the export of sensitive technology to china . foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to china 's economic growth , and most of china 's modern technology , particularly in electronics , has been imported . with respect to trade , there is little doubt that the large surplus in china 's trade has been generated largely by the surge inits exports of foreign brand - name manufactures often made in foreign - affiliated factories . as muchas 80 to 90 % of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there . interms of the u.s. trade deficit with china , american companies there do export some of their outputback to the american market , but most is sold in china . china has been attracting some fdi flowsthat otherwise could have gone to other developing countries . in essence , china 's gain may be theirloss . in terms of security , the $ 20 to $ 34 billion in u.s. fdi in china combined with $ 68 billion from taiwan , and some $ 300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creatinggroups with a strong interest in stability both within china and between china and the united states , taiwan , and other potential adversaries . foreign direct investment in china affects securityprimarily through three avenues : its contribution to economic power , economic interests , and technology transfers . the more china grows , the more funds it is able to provide to its military andattain big - power status in the world . with respect to economic interests , foreign companies in chinacan serve both as hostages for beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interestsin maintaining stability with both beijing and their home governments . with respect to sensitivetechnologies , in the u.s. case , it does not appear that prohibited u.s. technologies have beentransferred through foreign affiliated companies , although the technologies in the electronics andaviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses . such transfersare controlled by export control regimes . the highly publicized cases of satellite technology beingallegedly illegally transferred to china involved direct transfers from u.s. corporations to chinesecompanies . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
