as of april 14 , 2003 , most health care providers ( including doctors and hospitals ) and health plans are required to comply with the new privacy rule mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( `` hipaa '' ) , and must comply with national standards to protect individually identifiable health information . the hipaa privacy rule creates a federal floor of privacy protections for individually identifiable health information ; establishes a set of basic consumer protections ; institutes a series of regulatory permissions for uses and disclosures of protected health information ; permits any person to file an administrative complaint for violations ; and authorizes the imposition of civil or criminal penalties . in hearings prior to the effective date of the rule , there was widespread concern over aspects of the rule , including the extent to which it preempted state laws . on april 17 , 2003 , hhs published an interim final rule establishing the rules of procedure for investigations and the imposition of civil money penalties concerning violations . this interim final rule will be effective may 19 , 2003 through september 16 , 2003. hhs plans to issue a complete enforcement rule with both procedural and substantive provisions after notice - and - comment rulemaking . this report will be updated .
