foreign nationals may apply for entry into the united states under dozens of different visa categories , depending on circumstances . states bureaus of consular affairs and diplomatic security share responsibility for the prevention of visa fraud , which is a serious problem that threatens the integrity of the process . some documents through illegal means , such as using counterfeit identity documents or making false claims to an adjudicating officer . visa fraud may facilitate illegal activities in the united states , including crimes of violence , human trafficking , and terrorism . this report examines countries and visa categories that are subject to the most fraud ; state 's use of technologies and resources to combat fraud ; and training requirements of state officials responsible for fraud prevention . gao examined state 's reports and data on fraud trends and statistics , examined resources and technologies to counter fraud , and observed visa operations and fraud prevention efforts overseas and domestically . certain countries and visa categories are subject to higher levels of fraud . in fiscal year 2010 , almost 60 percent of confirmed fraud cases ( 9,200 out of 16,000 ) involved applicants from brazil , china , dominican republic , india , and mexico . department of state ( state ) officials told gao that fraud most commonly involves applicants for temporary visits to the united states who submit false documentation to overcome the presumption that they intend to illegally immigrate . fraud is also perpetrated for immigrant visas and nonimmigrant visa categories such as temporary worker visas and student visas . in response to state efforts to combat visa fraud , unscrupulous visa applicants adapt their strategies , and as a result , fraud trends evolve over time . state has a variety of technological tools and resources to assist consular officers in combating fraud , but does not have a policy for their systematic use . for example , state recently implemented fraud prevention technologies such as a fraud case management system that establishes connections among multiple visa applications , calling attention to potentially fraudulent activity . overseas posts have fraud prevention units that consist of a fraud prevention manager ( fpm ) and locally employed staff who analyze individual fraud cases . in 2011 , the ratio of fraud prevention unit staff to fraud cases varied widely across overseas posts , causing disproportionate workloads . the kentucky consular center ( kcc ) is a domestic resource available to posts that verifies information on certain visa applications . however , kcc services are only provided on an ad - hoc basis , and state does not have a policy for posts to systematically utilize its resources . for example , an fpm at a high fraud post told gao that the post would like to utilize kcc anti - fraud services for screening certain visa categories , but did not know how to request kcc assistance . although state offers anti - fraud training courses at the foreign service institute and online , it does not require fpms to take them and does not track fpms enrollment . consular officers receive limited fraud training as part of the initial consular course , and fpms are not required to take advanced fraud training in new technologies . in addition , gao found that 81 percent of fpm positions were filled by entry - level officers and 84 percent of fpm positions were designated as either part - time or rotational . between october 2009 and july 2012 , entry - level officers made up about 21 percent of the total students who registered for a course on detecting fraudulent documents , and state could not guarantee that fpms were among them . four out of the five fpms with whom gao spoke had not been trained in state 's new fraud case management system . gao recommends that state formulate a policy to systematically utilize anti - fraud resources available at kcc , based on post workload and fraud trends , as determined by the department and establish requirements for fpm training in advanced anti - fraud technologies , taking advantage of distance learning technologies , and establishing methods to track the extent to which requirements are met . state concurred with these recommendations .
