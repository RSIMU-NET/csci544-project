venezuela remains in a deep political crisis under the authoritarian rule of president nicolás maduro of the united socialist party of venezuela ( psuv ) . maduro , narrowly elected in 2013 after the death of hugo chávez ( 1999-2013 ) , is unpopular . nevertheless , he has used the courts , security forces , and electoral council to repress the opposition . on january 10 , 2019 , maduro began a second term after winning reelection on may 20 , 2018 , in an unfair contest deemed illegitimate by the opposition - controlled national assembly and most of the international community . the united states , the european union , the group of seven , and most western hemisphere countries do not recognize the legitimacy of his mandate . they view the national assembly as venezuela 's only democratic institution . maduro 's inauguration capped his efforts to consolidate power . in 2017 , protesters called for maduro to release political prisoners and respect the opposition - led national assembly . security forces quashed protests , with more than 130 killed and thousands injured . maduro then orchestrated the controversial july 2017 election of a national constituent assembly ; this assembly has usurped most legislative functions . during 2018 , maduro 's government arrested dissident military officers and others suspected of plotting against him . efforts to silence dissent may increase , as the national assembly ( under its new president , juan guaidó ) , the united states , and the international community push for a transition to a new government . venezuela also is experiencing a serious economic crisis , and rapid contraction of the economy , hyperinflation , and severe shortages of food and medicine have created a humanitarian crisis . president maduro has blamed u.s. sanctions for these problems , while conditioning receipt of food assistance on support for his government and increasing military control over the economy . he maintains that venezuela will seek to restructure its debts , although that appears unlikely . the government and state oil company petróleos de venezuela , s. a .
