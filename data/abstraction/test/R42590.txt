since fy2007 , the u.s. postal service ( usps ) has lost more than $ 25 billion . were it not for congressional action to reduce and defer statutorily required retiree health benefits , the usps would have lost an additional $ 9.5 billion . as the usps 's finances have deteriorated , its ability to absorb operating losses has been diminished . the usps 's current debt is $ 13 billion , $ 2 billion below its maximum statutory borrowing authority . the agency owes $ 11.1 billion in payments to the retiree health benefits fund by september 20 , 2012 , and it currently has less than $ 1 billion in cash . these deficits are particularly problematic since congress designed the postal service to be self - supporting in 1970 and enacted significant postal reforms in 2006. to help stem its losses , the usps has taken a number of steps . foremost , the postal service has downsized its workforce through attrition . since fy2006 , the number of career postal workers has shrunk 21.9 % , to about 544,000 from 696,138. however , the usps has said it is unable to return to solvency through its own actions , and it has asked congress to enact major reforms . numerous postal reform bills have been introduced in the 112th congress ; house and senate appropriators and president barack h. obama also have advanced postal proposals . among postal authorizing legislation , h.r . 2309 and s. 1789 have progressed the furthest toward enactment . the senate passed s. 1789 , the 21st century postal service act , on april 27 , 2012. the house committee on oversight and government reform reported h.r . 2309 , the postal reform act of 2011 , on january 17 , 2012 , and the house rules committee reported h.r . 2309 on march 29 , 2012. both bills include major reforms , such as reductions in service , expansion of the usps 's authority to provide products and services , and alterations to the postal employees pension and healthcare plans . at present , the usps appears to be suffering from both a short - term liquidity crisis ( i.e . , dwindling cash and borrowing authority ) and a long - term structural deficit ( i.e . , stagnating revenues and rising overhead costs ) . to address both of these financial challenges , the usps would have to ( 1 ) improve its liquidity immediately ; ( 2 ) fortify its long - term revenues ; and ( 3 ) control the growth of its long - term costs , all while ( 4 ) continuing to provide universal postal service to the public . both h.r . 2309 and s. 1789 contain provisions to make progress toward achieving each of these goals , albeit in different ways and to different degrees . h.r . 2309 would aim to reduce the usps 's costs through reducing the number of delivery and postal facilities and enacting a variety of usps compensation reforms . s. 1789 would largely preserve present - day postal services and enact a number of incremental cost - cutting policies , such as reducing the usps workers ' compensation outlays . this report will be updated after any further legislative action .
