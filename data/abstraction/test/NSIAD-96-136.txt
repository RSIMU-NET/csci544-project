gao reviewed the theater high altitude area defense ( thaad ) user operational evaluation system ( uoes ) program , focusing on whether planned testing would reasonably demonstrate the capabilities of uoes as an interim system before funds are committed to interceptor production . gao found that : the army purchased 20 interceptors for demonstration and validation flight tests , of which only 14 will be used in these tests ; the army plans to commit funds for uoes production based on the results of the first 7 of the 14 scheduled flight tests ; transporting uoes interceptors from the united states to a theater of operations will require significant airlift resources that may not be available unless uoes is afforded a high priority ; the cost estimate for the 40 uoes interceptors has increased from $ 80 million to $ 165 million , and thaad project officials expect that estimate to rise to $ 220 million ; and delivery of the 40 uoes interceptors will be delayed due to increased delivery lead times and reduced fiscal year ( fy ) 1997 funding .
