in his fy2010 budget request , president obama sought $ 147.620 billion for r & d , a $ 555 million ( 0.4 % ) increase from the estimated fy2009 r & d funding level of $ 147.065 billion ( not including fy2009 r & d funding provided under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 ) . according to the obama administration , preliminary allocations of r & d funding provided under p.l . 111-5 brought total fy2009 r & d funding to $ 165.400 billion . unless otherwise noted in this report , comparisons of fy2009 and fy2010 r & d funding do not incorporate funding provided under p.l . 111-5. to the extent possible , the agency discussions in this report include an analysis of house and senate actions with respect to r & d funding . in some cases , however , there is insufficient information to parse agency r & d funding from other spending to determine precise agency funding levels ; estimated funding levels are provided for these agencies . congress continues to play a central role in defining the nation 's r & d priorities , especially with respect to two overarching issues : the extent to which the federal r & d investment can grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding will be prioritized and allocated . a low or negative growth rate in the overall r & d investment may require movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities . six federal agencies received 95.1 % of total federal r & d spending in the president 's fy2010 request : the department of defense ( 54.0 % ) , department of health and human services ( 21.0 % ) , national aeronautics and space administration ( 7.7 % ) , department of energy ( 7.3 % ) , national science foundation ( 3.6 % ) , and department of agriculture ( 1.5 % ) . the president 's fy2010 request included $ 30.884 billion for basic research ; $ 28.139 billion for applied research ; $ 84.054 billion for development ; and $ 4.543 billion for r & d facilities and equipment . the fy2010 request included funding for three multiagency r & d initiatives : national nanotechnology initiative , $ 1.637 billion ; networking and information technology r & d program , $ 3.927 billion ; and climate change science program , $ 2.026 billion . president obama requested increases in the r & d budgets of the three agencies that were targeted for doubling in the america competes act and by president bush as part of his american competitiveness initiative : the department of energy office of science ( up 3.5 % ) , the national science foundation ( up 8.6 % ) , and the department of commerce national institute of standards and technology 's core research and facilities ( up 1.2 % ) . congress has completed action on all twelve regular fy2010 appropriations bills the final bill , the department of defense appropriations act , 2010 , was passed by congress and signed into law on december 19 , 2009. for the past four years , federal r & d funding and execution has been affected by mechanisms used to complete the annual appropriations process â€” the year - long continuing resolution for fy2007 ( p.l . 110-5 ) and the combining of multiple regular appropriations bills into the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 for fy2008 ( p.l . 110-161 ) , the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l . 111-8 ) , and the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l . 111-117 ) . completion of appropriations after the beginning of each fiscal year may cause agencies to delay or cancel some planned r & d and equipment acquisition .
