the congressional budget act of 1974 ( titles i - ix of p.l . 93-344 , as amended ; 2 u.s.c . 601-688 ) provides for the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget each year . the congressional budget resolution represents a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years . as a concurrent resolution , it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law . instead , when adopted by congress , the budget resolution serves as an agreement between the house and senate on a congressional budget plan . as such , it provides the framework for subsequent legislative action on budget matters during each congressional session . in 32 of the 41 years under the budget act , congress adopted at least one budget resolution for the fiscal year beginning in such year . congress did not complete action on a budget resolution for nine fiscal years , most recently for fy2015 . a second budget resolution for a fiscal year was adopted in each of the first seven years , and a third budget resolution was adopted in one year ( for fy1977 ) . since 1982 , congress has considered only one budget resolution for each fiscal year . congress initially was required to cover only the upcoming fiscal year in the budget resolution , but over the years congress has expanded this time frame . currently , the budget resolution must include at least five fiscal years . the budget resolution may include budget reconciliation directives instructing one or more committees to recommend legislative changes to meet the direct spending and revenue levels included in the budget resolution . in the past 41 years , congress included budget reconciliation directives in 22 budget resolutions . such directives have resulted in 24 budget reconciliation measures and the enactment of 20 of them . ( four budget reconciliation measures have been vetoed . ) . the house has considered and adopted fewer amendments to the budget resolution than the senate . for the last three decades , the house has considered the budget resolutions under special rules that generally have made in order only amendments in the nature of a substitute . since 1983 , the house typically has considered between three and seven such amendments to the budget resolution each year , rejecting all but two of these . in contrast , during the period between 1975 and 2015 , the senate considered an average of almost 54 amendments per budget resolution , agreeing to an average of about 31 of these . the budget act sets april 15 as a target date for completing action on the annual budget resolution . ( prior to 1986 , the date was may 15 . ) . during the past 41 years , when congress has completed action on a budget resolution , congress adopted the budget resolution by the target date only six times , most recently in 2003 with the fy2004 budget resolution . budget resolutions have been adopted an average of almost 36 days after the target date . this report will be updated as warranted .
