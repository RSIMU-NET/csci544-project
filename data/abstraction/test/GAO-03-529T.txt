nationwide , underground storage tanks ( ust ) containing petroleum and other hazardous substances are leaking , thereby contaminating the soil and water , and posing health risks . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , which implements the ust program with the states , required tank owners to install leak detection and prevention equipment by the end of 1993 and 1998 respectively . the congress asked gao to determine to what extent tanks comply with the requirements , epa and the states are inspecting tanks and enforcing requirements , upgraded tanks still leak , and epa and states are cleaning up these leaks . in response , gao conducted a survey of all states in 2000 and issued a report on its findings in may 2001. this testimony is based on that report , as well as updated information on program performance since that time . gao estimated in its may 2001 report that 89 percent of the 693,107 tanks subject to ust rules had the leak prevention and detection equipment installed , but that more than 200,000 tanks were not being operated and maintained properly , increasing the chance of leaks . states responding to our survey also reported that because of such problems , even tanks with the new equipment continued to leak . epa and the states attributed these problems primarily to poorly trained staff . while epa is working with states to identify additional training options , in december 2002 , epa reported that at least 19 to 26 percent of tanks still have problems . epa and states do not know how many upgraded tanks still leak because they do not physically inspect all tanks . epa recommends that tanks be inspected once every 3 years , but more than half of the states do not do this . in addition , more than half of the states lack the authority to prohibit fuel deliveries to problem tanks -- one of the most effective ways to enforce compliance . states said they did not have the funds , staff , or authority to inspect more tanks or more strongly enforce compliance . as of september 2002 , epa and states still had to ensure completion of cleanups for about 99,427 leaks , and initiation of cleanups at about another 43,278. states also face potentially large , but unknown , future workloads in addressing leaks from abandoned and unidentified tanks . some states said that their current program costs exceed available funds , so states may seek additional federal support to help address this future workload .
