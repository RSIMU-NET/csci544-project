concerns have been raised about lead in district of columbia drinking water and how those charged with ensuring the safety of this water have carried out their responsibilities . the 1991 lead and copper rule ( lcr ) requires water systems to protect drinking water from lead by , among other things , chemically treating it to reduce its corrosiveness and by monitoring tap water samples for evidence of lead corrosion . if enough samples show corrosion , water systems officials are required to notify and educate the public on lead health risks and undertake additional efforts . the washington aqueduct , owned and operated by the u.s. army corps of engineers , treats and sells water to the district of columbia water and sewer authority ( wasa ) , which delivers water to d.c. residents . epa 's philadelphia office is charged with overseeing these agencies . gao is examining the current structure and level of coordination among key government entities that implement the safe drinking water act 's regulations for lead in the district of columbia , how other drinking water systems conducted public notification and outreach , the availability of data necessary to determine which adult and child populations are at greatest risk of exposure to elevated lead levels , and what information wasa is gathering to help track their health , and the state of research on the health effects of lead exposure . the testimony discusses preliminary results of gao 's work . gao will report in full at a later date . this statement discusses gao 's preliminary observations and highlights areas of further examination . one of the key relationships in the effort to ensure the safety of the district 's drinking water is the one between wasa , the deliverer of water , and epa 's philadelphia office , which oversees wasa 's compliance with drinking water regulations . recent public statements and corrective actions by these parties clearly indicate that coordination and communication between them could have been better in the years preceding the current lead controversy . gao 's future work will examine ( to the extent appropriate ) the interrelationships among other key agencies ( such as the aqueduct and the d.c. department of health ) ; how other water systems in similar situations interacted with federal , state , and local agencies ; and what the experiences of these other jurisdictions may suggest concerning how improved coordination can better protect drinking water in the district of columbia . other water systems facing elevated lead levels used public notification and education practices that may offer lessons for conducting outreach to water customers . for example , some of the practices of the two water systems we have begun to examine -- the massachusetts water resources authority and the portland ( oregon ) water bureau -- include tailoring their communications to varied audiences in their service areas , testing the effectiveness of their communication materials , and linking demographic and infrastructure data to identify populations at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . wasa faces challenges in collecting the information needed to identify district citizens at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . specifically , wasa has partial information on which of its customers have lead service lines , and is in the process of obtaining more complete information . gao 's future work will examine the efforts of other water systems to go one step further by linking data on at - risk populations ( such as pregnant mothers , infants , and small children ) with data on homes suspected of being served by lead service pipes and other plumbing fixtures that may leach lead into drinking water . nationally , much is known about the hazards of lead once in the body and how lead from paint , soil , and dust enter the body , but little research has been done to determine actual lead exposure from drinking water , and the information that does exist is dated . in our future work , we will examine the plans of epa and other organizations to fill this key information gap .
