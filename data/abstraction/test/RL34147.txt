pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has established regulations regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes . although there are federal requirements under rcra for the management of hazardous waste , some states have opted to implement more stringent requirements — particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households and small businesses ( entities that are essentially exempt from rcra 's hazardous waste management requirements ) . one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regulate more strictly is electronic waste , commonly referred to as `` e - waste . . e - waste generally refers to obsolete , broken , or irreparable electronic equipment like televisions , computers and computer monitors , laptops , printers , cell phones , copiers , fax machines , stereos , or video gaming systems . cathode ray tubes ( crts ) in televisions and computer monitors have presented a particular concern to states , primarily due to the potentially significant amounts of lead they contain and the large numbers in which they are generated . state concerns specific to the landfill disposal or incineration of e - waste are largely due to its increasing volume and often bulky nature ; hazardous constituents , such as lead and mercury , it may contain ; its high cost of recycling ; and the inability of interested stakeholders , such as electronics retailers and manufacturers , to reach consensus on how to voluntarily implement a national e - waste management system . states have responded to this concern by enacting their own e - waste management laws . requirements of those laws range from a ban only on the landfill disposal or incineration of designated e - wastes to the implementation of a full e - waste collection , transportation , and recycling system . to date , 14 states have enacted some form of e - waste management law ( as many as 20 states proposed e - waste laws in 2006 and 2007 ) . although the goal of each law is similar — to avoid landfill disposal and incineration of certain types of e - waste — approaches taken to achieve that goal differ significantly . however , most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common , such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law ; how a collection and recycling program will be financed ; collection and recycling criteria that must be met to minimize the impact to human health and the environment ; and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be sold in the state . as more states propose e - waste legislation , potentially regulated stakeholders ( particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers ) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states . this concern has led to an increased call for federal legislation regarding e - waste management . to help policy makers better understand the impact of state e - waste legislation , this report discusses issues that have led to state action , common elements in state - waste laws and proposals , and an overview of each enacted state law .
