several bills were introduced in previous sessions of congress that would have addressed the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies . these legislative initiatives would have prevented the grant of exclusive intellectual property rights by the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) on methods that individuals and enterprises might use in order to minimize their tax obligations . this issue may arise before the 112th congress . many commentators trace the rise of tax strategy patents to the 1998 opinion of the federal circuit in state street bank v. signature financial group , which rejected a per se rule that business methods could not be patented . in recent years , the uspto has issued a number of patents that pertain to tax strategies . several of these patents have been subject to enforcement litigation in federal court . the 2010 decision of the supreme court in bilski v. kappos continues to allow for the possibility of business method patents , and potentially tax strategy patents as well . the impact of tax strategy patents upon social welfare has been subject to a spirited debate . some observers are opposed to tax strategy patents . these commentators believe that patent protection is unnecessary with respect to tax avoidance techniques due to a high level of current innovation . others believe that patent - based incentives to develop tax avoidance strategies are not socially desirable . they assert that patents may limit the ability of individuals to utilize provisions of the tax code intended for all taxpayers , interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations . others have expressed concerns that tax strategy patents may potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and individual taxpayers alike . other experts believe that these concerns are overstated , and also make the affirmative case that tax strategy patents may provide positive social benefits . they explain that patents on `` business methods '' have been obtained and enforced for many years . they also observe that the grant of a patent does not imply government approval of the practice of the patented invention , and that professionals in many spheres of endeavor have long had to account for the patent system during their decision - making process . they also believe that the availability of tax strategy patents may promote innovation in a field of endeavor that is demonstrably valuable . further , such patents might promote public disclosure of tax strategies to tax professionals , taxpayers , and responsible government officials alike . three bills that were introduced , but not enacted , in the 111th congress — h.r . 1265 , h.r . 2584 , and s. 506 — would have prohibited the issuance of patents on tax strategies . other legislative responses , including oversight of the uspto , promotion of cooperation between the uspto and the irs , and the encouragement of private sector contributions to the patent examination process , are also possible .
