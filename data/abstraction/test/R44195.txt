authoring and introducing legislation is fundamental to the task of representing voters as a u.s. senator . part of what makes the american political process unique is that it affords all senators an ability to propose their own ideas for chamber consideration . by comparison , most other democratic governments around the world rely on an executive official , often called a premier , chancellor , or prime minister , to originate and submit policy proposals for discussion and enactment by the legislature . legislators serving in other countries generally lack the power to initiate legislative proposals of their own . in the american political system , ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources . any number of individuals , groups , or entities may participate in drafting bills and resolutions , but only senators may formally introduce legislation in the senate , and they may do so for any reason . when a senator has determined that a bill or resolution is ready for introduction , it can be delivered to the bill clerk 's desk on the chamber floor when the senate is in session . the sponsor must sign the measure and attach the names of any original cosponsors on a separate form . cosponsors do not sign the bill . there is no senate rule that introduced bills and resolutions must be prepared by the senate office of the legislative counsel , but the office plays an important role by providing senators and staff , at their request , with drafts of legislation . use of the office by senators and staff is nearly universal . once introduced , the senate parliamentarian , acting on behalf of the presiding officer , refers legislation to committee based primarily on how its contents align with the subject matter jurisdictions of committees established in senate rule xxv . multiple referral is rare in the senate due to senate rule xvii , which states that a measure is referred to the committee with `` jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates in such proposed legislation . . this report is intended to assist senators and staff in preparing legislation for introduction . its contents address essential elements of the process , including bill drafting , the mechanics of introduction , and the roles played by key senate offices involved in the drafting , submission , and referral of legislation . statistics on introduced bills and resolutions are presented in the final section to illustrate patterns of introduction in recent congresses .
