india is the world 's second - most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people and is the birthplace of four major world religions : hinduism , buddhism , sikhism , and jainism . it is also home to about 180 million muslims â€” only indonesia and pakistan have more . a small christian minority includes about 30 million people . an officially secular nation with thousands of ethnic groups and 22 official languages , independent india has a long tradition of religious tolerance ( with periodic and sometimes serious lapses ) . religious freedom is explicitly protected under its constitution . hindus account for a vast majority ( nearly four - fifths ) of the country 's populace . hindu nationalism has been a rising political force in recent decades , by many accounts eroding india 's secular nature and leading to new assaults on the country 's religious freedoms . the 2014 national election victory of the bharatiya janata party ( indian peoples ' party or bjp ) brought newly acute attention to the issue of religious freedom in india . tracing its origins to a political party created in 1951 in collaboration with the hindu nationalist rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ( national volunteer organization or rss ) , the bjp has since gone on to win control of numerous state governments , including in uttar pradesh , the country 's most populous state with more than 200 million residents , one - fifth of them muslim . the bjp 's leader , prime minister narendra modi , is a self - avowed hindu nationalist and lifelong rss member with a controversial past : in 2002 , during his 13-year tenure as chief minister of the gujarat state , large - scale anti - muslim rioting there left more than 1,000 people dead , and modi faced accusations of complicity and / or inaction ( he was later formally exculpated ) . in 2005 , modi was denied a u.s. visa under a rarely - used law barring entry for foreign government officials found to be complicit in severe violations of religious freedom , and he had no official contacts with the u.s. government until 2013. many in the u.s. congress were critical of modi 's role in the 2002 violence , and some continue to call attention to signs that religious freedom abuses are increasing under his and his party 's rule , as documented by the u.s. state department and independent human rights groups . this report provides an overview of religious freedom issues in india , beginning with a brief review of u.s. - india relations and india 's human rights setting broadly , then discussing the country 's religious demographics , religious freedom protections , and conceptions of hindu nationalism and its key institutional proponents in indian society . it then moves to specific areas of religiously - motivated repression and violence , including state - level anti - conversion laws , cow protection vigilantism , and perceived assaults on freedoms of expression and operations by nongovernmental organizations that are seen as harmful to india 's secular traditions and the u.s - promoted goal of interfaith tolerance .
