north koreans have been crossing the border into china , many in search of refuge , since the height of north korea 's famine in the 1990s . the state department estimates that 30,000-50,000 north korean refugees currently live in china ( some non - governmental organizations estimate the number is closer to 300,000 ) and believes those who are repatriated may face punishment ranging from a few months of `` labor correction '' to execution . a number of reports also document the difficult conditions faced by north koreans who remain in china . the plight of the north koreans focuses attention not only on those seeking refuge and their refugee status , but also points to the factors driving their decision to leave , primarily food shortages , deteriorating humanitarian conditions , and human rights violations . north korea is generally characterized as one of the world 's worst violators of human rights and religious freedom , an issue that some members of congress and interest groups say should assume greater importance in the formation of u.s. priorities towards north korea . congressional concern about human rights in north korea and conditions faced by north korean refugees led to the passage of the north korean human rights act ( nkhra ) in 2004. north korean refugees in china and human rights issues are frequently raised simultaneously , particularly in a congressional context . although the situation for north koreans seeking to leave their country and for those who remain inside its borders pose different questions and may call for separate responses , both focus on the nature of the regime in pyongyang . critics of the north korean government have raised both issues together to put pressure on the regime , particularly when nuclear weapons program negotiations stalled . some advocates do not want to link refugee and human rights issues , claiming that the former calls for a quieter , cooperative approach , while the latter requires a more outspoken response to the north korean government 's practices . although some policy experts insist that the united states has a moral imperative to stand up for the oppressed , others say that this creates obstacles in the nuclear disarmament negotiations . in 2007 , the bush administration entered into bilateral talks with north korea and linked the prospect of diplomatic relations and pyongyang 's re - entry into the international community with only the nuclear issue , leaving out human rights and refugee concerns . nevertheless , north korean human rights and refugee issues remain significant concerns and also have broader regional importance . china and south korea want to avoid a massive outflow of refugees , which they believe could trigger the instability or collapse of north korea . north korean refugees seeking resettlement often transit through other asian countries , raising diplomatic , refugee , and security concerns for those governments . south korea , as the final destination of the vast majority of north koreans , struggles to accommodate new arrivals and does not want to damage its relations with north korea . this report will be updated as events warrant .
