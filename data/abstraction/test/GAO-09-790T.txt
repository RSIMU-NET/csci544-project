the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) financial condition has worsened this year , with the recession and changing mail use causing declines in mail volume and revenues despite postal rate increases . gao testified in may to this subcommittee that usps expects these declines to lead to a record net loss and an unprecedented cash shortfall even if ambitious cost cutting is achieved . gao reported that maintaining usps 's financial viability as the provider of affordable , high - quality universal postal service will require actions in a number of areas , such as rightsizing its retail and mail processing networks by consolidating operations and closing unnecessary facilities and reducing the cost and size of its workforce , which generates about 80 percent of its costs . today gao is releasing its report on usps efforts to improve the efficiency of delivery . delivery accounts for nearly half of usps salary and benefit costs . this testimony updates usps 's financial condition and outlook and explains gao 's decision to place usps 's financial condition on the high - risk list and discusses the need for usps to restructure its mail processing , retail , and delivery networks and its efforts to improve their efficiency . it is based on gao 's past and ongoing work and updated usps information . usps 's financial condition and outlook continue to deteriorate with a worsening outlook for mail volume and revenue . usps now projects mail volume to decline by about 28 billion pieces to about 175 billion pieces in fiscal year 2009 , a decline of 13.7 percent . as a result , usps projects a net loss of about $ 7 billion even with record savings of about $ 6 billion ; an increase in outstanding debt by the annual $ 3 billion limit ; and , despite this borrowing , an unprecedented $ 1 billion cash shortfall . thus , usps recently reported to congress that , due to the need to maintain sufficient cash to cover costs , it will not fully make its mandated payment of $ 5.4 billion for future retiree health benefits due by september 30 , 2009 , even if it receives $ 2 billion in relief under pending house legislation . gao added usps 's financial condition to the high - risk list this week . gao reported usps urgently needs to restructure to address its current and long - term financial viability . accordingly , gao calls for usps to develop and implement a broad restructuring plan -- with input from the postal regulatory commission and other stakeholders , and approval by congress and the administration -- that includes key milestones and time frames for actions , addresses key issues , and identifies what steps congress and other stakeholders may need to take . usps needs to optimize its retail , mail processing , and delivery networks to eliminate growing excess capacity and maintenance backlogs , reduce costs , and improve efficiency . usps has a window of opportunity to reduce the cost and size of its workforce through attrition and the large number of upcoming retirements to minimize the need for layoffs . although usps has begun efforts to realign and consolidate some mail processing , retail , and delivery operations , much more is urgently needed . gao recognizes that usps would face formidable resistance to restructuring with many facility closures and consolidations because of concerns that these actions would affect service , employees , and communities . usps management will need to provide leadership and work with stakeholders to overcome resistance for its actions to be successfully implemented . usps must use an open , transparent , fair , and consistent process ; engage with its unions , management associations , the mailing industry , and political leaders ; and demonstrate results . in turn , these stakeholders and congress need to recognize that major restructuring is urgently needed for usps to be financially viable . to its credit , usps recently began a national initiative to consolidate some of its 3,200 postal retail stations and branches in urban and suburban areas . usps has begun efforts to consolidate some mail processing operations but has closed only 1 of 400 major mail processing facilities . usps is realigning city carrier routes to remove excess capacity and improve efficiency , which is expected to save nearly $ 1 billion annually ; has begun to install automated equipment to reduce costly manual sorting of flat - sized mail ; and is studying how it could shift to 5-day delivery and the potential savings .
