a former trading and military outpost of the british empire , the tiny republic of singapore has transformed itself into a modern asian nation and a major player in the global economy , though it still substantially restricts political freedoms in the name of maintaining social stability and economic growth . singapore 's heavy dependence on international trade makes regional stability and the free flow of goods and services essential to its existence . as a result , the island nation is a firm supporter of the u.s. security role in asia , but it also maintains close relations with china . the obama administration 's strategy of rebalancing u.s. foreign policy priorities to the asia pacific enhances singapore 's role as a key u.s. partner in the region . a formal strategic partnership agreement between the united states and singapore outlines access to military facilities , cooperation in counterterrorism and counter - proliferation , joint military exercises , policy dialogues , and shared defense technology . singapore also supports u.s. international trade policy . singapore and the united states are among the 12 countries on both sides of the pacific involved in the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) , which is the centerpiece of the obama administration 's economic rebalance to asia . in 2015 , singapore was the 17th - largest u.s. trading partner with $ 47 billion in total two - way goods trade , and the country remains a substantial destination for u.s. foreign direct investment . the u.s. - singapore free trade agreement ( fta ) went into effect in january 2004 , and since then trade has burgeoned between the two countries . singapore 's people 's action party ( pap ) has won every general election since the end of the colonial era in 1959 , aided by a fragmented opposition , singapore 's economic success , and electoral procedures that strongly favor the ruling party . some point to changes in the political and social environment that may herald more political pluralism , including generational changes and an increasingly international outlook among singaporeans . however , the pap maintains a dominant political position . in september 2015 , it won nearly 70 % of the popular vote in nationwide parliamentary elections that left it with 83 of the 89 seats in parliament . in march 2015 , lee kuan yew , who was singapore 's prime minister from 1959 to 1990 , passed away . he was — and still is — considered the founder of modern singapore , and he is credited with transforming singapore from an english colony into one of the world 's wealthiest and least corrupt countries . his son , lee hsien loong , is singapore 's current prime minister .
