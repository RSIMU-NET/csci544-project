the caribbean island - nation of jamaica has had a relatively stable parliamentary political system stemming from its history of british colonial rule . current prime minister bruce golding of the jamaica labour party was elected in september 2007 when his party defeated the long - ruling people 's national party led by then - prime minister portia simpson . in late may 2010 , however , jamaica 's stability was challenged after prime minister golding agreed to extradite to the united states an at - large alleged drug kingpin and gang leader , christopher coke . the jamaican government deployed police and soldiers seeking to execute a warrant for coke , but his armed supporters erected barricades and roadblocks to battle the security forces . in the ensuing violence , 76 people were killed , including two policemen and a soldier . human rights organizations have called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation into the killings , especially since jamaica 's police forces have been criticized for many years for extrajudicial killings and the indiscriminate use of force . coke was ultimately captured and extradited to new york in late june 2010 to face drug and weapons trafficking charges . high rates of crime and violence have plagued jamaica for many years . in the 1970s and 1980s there was a high level of politically motivated violence when political parties became allied with armed gangs to deliver votes at election time . jamaica 's gangs initially were involved in the trafficking of marijuana in the 1970s ( jamaica is the caribbean 's largest producer and exporter of marijuana ) , but in the mid - 1980s became involved in cocaine trafficking , with jamaica used as a transit country , as well as weapons trafficking . since the 1990s , much of the violent crime in the country has been associated with this drug trafficking and related intra - gang and internal gang feuds . jamaica 's challenges include bringing down the high levels of gang violence , reforming the police and justice system to prevent extrajudicial killings by police and impunity , and breaking the linkages between the political parties and armed gangs . jamaica 's services - based economy has averaged only modest growth rates over the past two decades , and has been in recession since 2008 because of the global economic crisis , which hurt the tourism sector and reduced the price and demand for jamaican bauxite / alumina exports . a difficult economic challenge for the government is dealing with a large external debt burden , which has limited the government 's ability to respond to the effects of the global economic crisis . in february 2010 , the international monetary fund approved a $ 1.27 billion stand - by arrangement to help the country deal with the consequences of the global economic downturn and support the government 's fiscal , debt , and financial sector reforms . u.s. relations with jamaica are close , and are characterized by significant economic and cultural linkages and cooperation on a range of bilateral and transnational issues , including cooperation on anti - drug trafficking efforts . congress has regularly supported a variety of foreign assistance programs for jamaica , and the country will likely receive funding under the administration 's new caribbean basin security initiative . there had been increasing tension in u.s. - jamaican relations in recent months because of the golding government 's reluctance to extradite christopher coke to the united states , but in the aftermath of the jamaican government 's extradition , u.s. officials commended the golding government for its efforts . for additional information , see crs report rl33951 , u.s. trade policy and the caribbean : from trade preferences to free trade agreements , and crs report r41215 , latin america and the caribbean : illicit drug trafficking and u.s. counterdrug programs .
