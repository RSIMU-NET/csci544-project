the capitol visitor center ( cvc ) , which opened to the public on december 2 , 2008 , was designed to enhance the security , educational experience , and comfort of those visiting the u.s. capitol . the decision to build a subterranean facility beneath the east front plaza , largely invisible from an exterior perspective , was made so the structure would not compete with , or detract from , the appearance and historical architectural integrity of the capitol . the project 's designers sought to integrate the new structure with the landscape of the east capitol grounds and ultimately recreate the park - like setting intended by landscape architect frederick law olmsted sr. in his historic 1874 design for the site . estimates for the cost of the center were as high as $ 621 million , although the fy2011 appropriations act subsequently included a $ 14.6 million rescission . the project was financed with appropriated funds and $ 65 million from private donations and revenue generated by the sale of commemorative coins . in march 1999 , the architect of the capitol was authorized $ 2.8 million to coordinate a team of architects , engineers , and consultants to review and revalidate a 1995 study of the site selection and project design . in order to simplify the approval process for the design and construction phases , congress transferred authority for these functions to the united states capitol preservation commission in september 1999. three months later , a revised conceptual design for the center was approved by the commission . a design and engineering obligation plan was approved by the house and senate legislative appropriations subcommittees in november 1999 and january 2000 , respectively . on january 31 , 2000 , design development work began , and in mid - october 2000 , the united states capitol preservation commission approved the final design plan for the center . subsequently , a construction management firm was hired to oversee the project ; an $ 8 million contract was awarded to relocate utility lines ; a $ 99.9 million contract was awarded for sequence 1 ( foundation / structural work ) ; and a $ 144.2 million contract was awarded for sequence 2 ( electrical , mechanical , plumbing , and finishing work ) . additionally , a firm also was retained to oversee the development of the cvc exhibition gallery ; a tree maintenance contractor was hired to help assure the protection of trees on the east capitol grounds ; historic preservation workers temporarily removed historic olmsted landscape features from the grounds for their protection ; and temporary visitor screening facilities and media sites were constructed . throughout the entire construction of the nearly 580,000 square foot underground facility , the project was monitored by congressional committees , which held numerous oversight and appropriations request hearings . for information on the use of the capitol visitor center space for official events , see crs report rl34619 , use of the capitol rotunda , capitol grounds , and emancipation hall : concurrent resolutions , 101st to 112th congress , by matthew eric glassman and [ author name scrubbed ] .
