more than 5.5 billion pounds of explosives are used each year in the united states by private sector companies and government entities . the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) has authority to regulate explosives and to license privately owned explosives storage facilities . after the july 2004 theft of several hundred pounds of explosives from a state and local government storage facility , concerns arose about vulnerability to theft . gao analyzed the extent of explosives thefts from state and local government facilities , atf 's authority to regulate and oversee state and local government explosives storage facilities , the information atf collects about state and local government storage facilities , and security oversight measures in place at selected state and local government storage facilities . judging from available atf data , there have been few thefts of explosives from state and local government storage facilities . from january 2002 to february 2005 , atf received only 9 reports of thefts or missing explosives from state and local facilities , compared with a total of 205 explosives thefts reported nationwide during this same period . during the course of our audit , we found evidence of 5 thefts from state and local government facilities , 1 of which did not appear in atf 's national database on thefts and missing explosives . thus , the actual number of thefts occurring at state and local storage facilities could be higher than that identified by atf data . atf has no authority to oversee or inspect all state and local government explosives storage facilities . state and local government agencies are not required to obtain a license from atf to use and store explosives , and only licensees -- such as private sector explosives storage facilities -- are subject to mandatory oversight . as a result , atf has no means to ensure that state and local government facilities are in compliance with federal regulations . while atf does not collect nationwide information about state and local government explosives storage facilities , information about some of these facilities is collected -- for example , when facility operators voluntarily request an atf inspection . since january 2002 , atf has conducted 77 voluntary inspections at state and local storage facilities and found no systemic violations . by comparison , all licensed private sector facilities must submit a variety of information about their facility -- including location and security measures in place -- to atf during the licensing process . atf also collects information about these facilities during mandatory inspections . at the 18 state and local government storage facilities we visited , a variety of security measures were in place , including locked gates , fencing , patrols , and in some cases , electronic surveillance . all the facilities ' officials told gao that they conducted routine inventories . but most were not required to be licensed or inspected by state or local regulatory agencies . we identified several instances of possible noncompliance with federal regulations , related primarily to storage safety issues rather than security .
