communities are increasingly deploying iot devices generally with a goal of improving livability , management , service delivery , or competitiveness . gao was asked to examine federal support for iot and the use of iot in communities . this report describes : the kinds of efforts that selected federal agencies have undertaken to support iot in communities and how selected communities are using federal funds to deploy iot projects . gao reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 11 federal agencies identified as having a key role in supporting iot in communities , including agencies that support research or community iot efforts or that have direct authority over iot issues . gao interviewed a non - generalizeable sample of representatives from multiple stakeholder groups in four communities , selected to include a range of community sizes and locations and communities with projects that used federal support . gao also reviewed relevant literature since 2013 and discussed federal efforts and community challenges with 11 stakeholders from academia and the private sector , selected to reflect a range of perspectives on iot issues . gao requested comments on a draft of this product from 11 federal agencies . five agencies provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . six agencies did not provide comments . the internet of things ( iot ) generally refers to the technologies and devices that allow for the network connection and interaction of a wide array of devices , or “ things. ” federal agencies that gao reviewed are undertaking two kinds of efforts that support iot in communities : broad federal research and oversight of iot - related technologies and issues : for example , 8 of the 11 agencies gao reviewed are involved in broad research efforts , often on communication systems — both wired and wireless network systems . in addition , nine agencies have oversight efforts that include providing iot - related guidance , often on data security and privacy . more direct efforts to support communities , including funding community iot projects ( see figure ) and fostering collaboration among the agencies and communities : for example , dot recently awarded $ 40 million in federal funds to a community for a suite of “ smart ” projects related to improving surface transportation performance , and epa awarded $ 40,000 each to two communities to develop strategies for deploying air quality sensors and managing the data collected from them . to foster such collaboration , in july 2016 , the white house formed an interagency task force that has developed a draft smart cities and communities federal strategic plan . a final plan will be released in summer of 2017 , according to federal officials . all four of the communities that gao reviewed are using federal funds in combination with other resources , both financial and non - financial , to plan and deploy iot projects . for example , one community used the $ 40 million dot award to leverage , from community partners , more than $ 100 million in additional direct and in - kind contributions , such as research or equipment contributions . communities discussed four main challenges to deploying iot , including community sectors ( e.g . , transportation , energy , and public safety ) that are siloed and proprietary systems that are not interoperable with one another .
