a longstanding challenge for federal agencies has been developing credible and effective performance management systems that can serve as a strategic tool to drive internal change and achieve results . in 2011 , various federal agencies , labor unions , and other organizations developed the goals - engagement - accountability - results ( gear ) framework to help improve performance management . gao was asked to evaluate gear . this report analyzes how the gear framework addresses key practices for effective performance management and identifies opportunities to improve gear implementation government - wide ; describes the status of gear implementation at pilot agencies and lessons learned to date ; and assesses the extent to which each pilot agency 's gear implementation plan includes selected best practices for project planning . the report is based on gao 's analysis of gear documents , agency project plans , and interviews with agency officials . gao found that the gear framework generally addresses previously identified key practices for effective performance management , such as aligning individual performance expectations with organizational goals , but refinements could improve future government - wide implementation . five federal agencies are piloting gear -- the departments of energy ( doe ) , homeland security / coast guard ( dhs / coast guard ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , veterans affairs / national cemetery administration ( va / nca ) , and the office of personnel management ( opm ) -- with the intention to expand gear government - wide . the chief human capital officers council ( chco council ) is developing a toolkit based , among other things , on the experience of the pilot agencies . the toolkit is intended to help additional agencies implement the gear framework ; chco council representatives expect the toolkit to be complete by the end of september 2013. however , beyond the toolkit , neither the chco council nor opm have identified next steps to implement gear government - wide , such as identifying roles and responsibilities . further , neither opm nor the chco council has plans to regularly update the gear framework or toolkit to include additional lessons learned , or to make such information available more broadly to key stakeholders , such as human resource professionals who may be responsible for future implementation . without taking these steps , agencies that have already begun implementing gear risk losing their momentum ; in addition , it may be challenging to implement gear government - wide . the five pilot agencies adopted various approaches to implementing gear - doe , hud , and opm implemented gear agency - wide , while coast guard and nca adopted gear in single units - based on agency needs , available resources , and gao 's lessons learned to date . for example , early stakeholder involvement , including engagement between those representing labor and management , resulted in greater transparency and fewer obstacles . in addition , administering employee surveys to identify the greatest needs before implementing gear helped establish a baseline to better track results . each of the pilot agencies developed a gear project plan that outlined specific actions . doe 's gear plan was the most thoroughly documented . the other four agency plans did not include all project planning best practices . without these elements , agencies may be limited in their ability to determine what needs to be done , when it should be done , who should do it , and how to measure progress towards achieving objectives . as gear is adopted government - wide , gao recommends that the director of opm , in collaboration with the chco council , define roles and responsibilities for opm , the chco council , and individual agencies , in such areas as updating the toolkit ( as needed ) and disseminating information on gear more broadly . gao also recommends that opm , coast guard , hud , and nca update their gear project plans to be consistent with best practices for project planning . opm , dhs , hud , and va agreed with the recommendations .
