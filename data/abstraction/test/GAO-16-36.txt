recruiters are often referred to as the “ face ” of the arng . in the past , there have been allegations of recruiter misconduct and misuse of financial incentives , making it important for recruiters to ensure procedures are followed when working with applicants and that incentives to join the arng are awarded properly and effectively . house report 113-446 included a provision for gao to review the arng 's recruiting practices . this report evaluates the extent to which arng has provided oversight of its recruiting process ; arng met its goals for recruiting , completion of initial military training , and initial term of service ; and osd , department of the army , and arng have conducted oversight of arng 's enlistment financial incentives programs . for this work , gao reviewed dod and arng recruiting policy and procedures and interviewed cognizant officials . gao analyzed data on recruiting from fy2010 through fy2014 , training from fy2011 through fy2014 , and initial term of service for fy2015 . gao visited four states representing a range of size and locations . the army national guard ( arng ) has taken steps to increase oversight of its recruiting process primarily conducted by recruiters dispersed at the state - level but has not established a permanent program to monitor state - level recruiting activities . in june 2014 , the arng created a recruiting standards branch that has started to conduct inspections of state offices . the recruiting standards branch completed inspections in 16 states from october 2014 through july 2015 and found that 2 states did not achieve full compliance in their inspections . however , this is not a permanent program , and arng officials stated that they are using positions to staff it intended for use in other areas . the arng is seeking approval for permanent staff by early 2017 to continue its oversight . continued monitoring of state - level recruiting activities , such as through a permanent recruiting standards branch , will be important to arng 's oversight functions . the arng had mixed results in meeting its overall recruiting goals and nearly met its goals for initial military training ; however , the arng does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service or military obligation . the arng met its recruiting goals in 2 of the 5 years from fiscal years ( fy ) 2010 through 2014. while the arng nearly met its goals for training completion from fy 2011 through 2014 , gao found that the arng does not have complete , consistent , and valid data on why soldiers do not complete training and when they separate during training . without consistent , complete , and valid data , decision makers do not have information to determine why a higher number of soldiers are not completing training . the arng also does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service . gao 's analysis shows that about 40 percent of enlisted soldiers who joined the arng from fy 2001 through 2007 did not complete their initial term of service . without tracking completion of initial term of service , arng officials can not assess whether their programs are effective in meeting personnel requirements and do not have visibility to ensure the arng is maximizing its investment in its soldiers . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , department of the army ( army ) , and arng have not fully conducted their oversight responsibilities of arng enlistment financial - incentives programs . osd has not enforced a requirement that arng report incentives obligated through the arng incentives programs . further , although army and national guard regulations require evaluations of the effectiveness of the arng financial incentives programs , the army and arng have not evaluated and documented the effectiveness of the programs . without evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of arng incentives programs , officials may not know whether changes are needed for effective use of incentives or they may determine that certain financial incentives are not needed . moreover , the arng has not ensured that recruiters have an understanding of available financial incentives . financial incentives are a tool available to recruiters and agency policy states that incentives are available to assist in meeting and sustaining readiness requirements and to assist in filling critical shortages . arng has not provided recruiters with training on using financial incentives . with additional training , recruiters could better understand when and how to offer financial incentives to fill critical positions . gao recommends , among other things , that arng take actions to collect consistent , complete , and valid data on soldiers who do not complete training and initial term of service , and evaluate and document its incentives programs . dod concurred with gao 's recommendations but stated that it did not concur with the report due to gao 's depiction of waivers . gao disagrees with dod 's characterization as discussed in the report .
