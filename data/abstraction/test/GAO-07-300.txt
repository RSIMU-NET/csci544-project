the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) continues to respond to hurricanes katrina and rita . gao 's previous work identified suspected fraud , waste , and abuse resulting from control weaknesses associated with fema 's individuals and households program ( ihp ) and the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) purchase card program . congress asked gao to follow up on this previous work to determine whether potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments continued to be made . gao testified on the results of our audit and investigative efforts on december 6 , 2006. this report summarizes the results of our follow - up work . in our december 6 , 2006 , testimony , gao stated that fema made tens of millions of dollars of potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments associated with both hurricanes katrina and rita . these payments include $ 17 million in rental assistance paid to individuals to whom fema had already provided free housing through trailers or apartments . in one case , fema provided free housing to 10 individuals in apartments in plano , texas , while at the same time it sent these individuals $ 46,000 to cover out - of - pocket housing expenses . in addition , several of these individuals certified to fema that they needed rental assistance . fema made nearly $ 20 million in duplicate payments to thousands of individuals who claimed damages to the same property from both hurricanes katrina and rita . fema also made millions in potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments to nonqualified aliens who were not eligible for ihp . for example , fema paid at least $ 3 million to more than 500 ineligible foreign students at four universities in the affected areas . this amount likely understates the total payments to ineligible foreign students because it does not cover all colleges and universities in the area . fema also provided potentially improper and / or fraudulent ihp assistance to other ineligible non - u.s. residents , despite having documentation indicating their ineligibility . finally , fema 's difficulties in identifying and collecting improper payments further emphasized the importance of implementing an effective fraud , waste , and abuse prevention system . for example , gao previously estimated improper and potentially fraudulent payments related to the ihp application process to be $ 1 billion through february 2006. as of november 2006 , fema identified about $ 290 million in overpayments and collected about $ 7 million . finally , gao 's work on dhs purchase cards showed continuing problems with property accountability , including items gao investigated that could not be located 1 year after they were purchased .
