dhs plays a key role in federal cybersecurity . fisma authorized dhs , in consultation with the office of management and budget , to develop and oversee the implementation of compulsory directives — referred to as binding operational directives — covering executive branch civilian agencies . these directives require agencies to safeguard federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat , vulnerability , or risk . since 2015 , dhs has issued eight directives that instructed agencies to , among other things , mitigate critical vulnerabilities discovered by dhs through its scanning of agencies ' internet - accessible systems ; address urgent vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices identified by dhs ; and better secure the government 's highest value and most critical information and system assets . gao was requested to evaluate dhs 's binding operational directives . this report addresses dhs 's process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives and the effectiveness of the directives , including agencies ' implementation of the directive requirements . gao selected for review the five directives that were in effect as of december 2018 , and randomly selected for further in - depth review a sample of 12 agencies from the executive branch civilian agencies to which the directives apply . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a five - step process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives , as authorized by the federal information security modernization act of 2014 ( fisma ) . the process includes dhs coordinating with stakeholders early in the directives ' development process and validating agencies ' actions on the directives . however , in implementing the process , dhs did not coordinate with stakeholders early in the process and did not consistently validate agencies ' self - reported actions . in addition to being a required step in the directives process , fisma requires dhs to coordinate with the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) to ensure that the directives do not conflict with existing nist guidance for federal agencies . however , nist officials told gao that dhs often did not reach out to nist on directives until 1 to 2 weeks before the directives were to be issued , and then did not always incorporate the nist technical comments . more recently , dhs and nist have started regular coordination meetings to discuss directive - related issues earlier in the process . regarding validation of agency actions , dhs has done so for selected directives , but not for others . dhs is not well - positioned to validate all directives because it lacks a risk - based approach as well as a strategy to check selected agency - reported actions to validate their completion . directives ' implementation often has been effective in strengthening federal cybersecurity . for example , a 2015 directive on critical vulnerability mitigation required agencies to address critical vulnerabilities discovered by dhs cyber scans of agencies ' internet - accessible systems within 30 days . this was a new requirement for federal agencies . while agencies did not always meet the 30-day requirement , their mitigations were validated by dhs and reached 87 percent compliance by 2017 ( see fig . 1 ) . dhs officials attributed the recent decline in percentage completion to a 35-day partial government shutdown in late 2018 / early 2019. nevertheless , for the 4-year period shown in the figure below , agencies mitigated within 30 days about 2,500 of the 3,600 vulnerabilities identified . agencies also made reported improvements in securing or replacing vulnerable network infrastructure devices . specifically , a 2016 directive on the threat to network infrastructure devices addressed , among other things , several urgent vulnerabilities in the targeting of firewalls across federal networks and provided technical mitigation solutions . as shown in figure 2 , in response to the directive , agencies reported progress in mitigating risks to more than 11,000 devices as of october 2018. in addition , gao reviewed dhs policies and processes related to the directives and assessed them against fisma and office of management and budget requirements ; administered a data collection instrument to selected federal agencies ; compared the agencies ' responses and supporting documentation to the requirements outlined in the five directives ; and collected and analyzed dhs 's government - wide scanning data on government - wide implementation of the directives . gao also interviewed dhs and selected agency officials . gao is making four recommendations to dhs : determine when in the directive development process — for example , during early development and at directive approval — coordination with relevant stakeholders , including nist , should occur ; develop a strategy for when and how to independently validate selected agencies ' self - reported actions on meeting directive requirements , where feasible , using a risk - based approach ; ensure that the directive performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified in high value asset assessments aligns with the process dhs has established ; and develop a schedule and plan for completing the high value asset program reassessment and addressing the outstanding issues on completing the required assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance to agencies and third parties . dhs concurred with gao 's recommendations and outlined steps and associated timelines that it planned to take to address the recommendations . another key dhs directive is securing high value assets , an initiative to protect the government 's most critical information and system assets . according to this directive , dhs is to lead in - depth assessments of federal agencies ' most essential identified high value assets . however , an important performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified by these assessments does not account for agencies submitting remediation plans in cases where weaknesses can not be fully addressed within 30 days . further , dhs only completed about half of the required assessments for the most recent 2 years ( 61 of 142 for fiscal year 2018 , and 73 of 142 required assessments for fiscal year 2019 ( see fig . 3 ) ) . in addition , dhs does not plan to finalize guidance to agencies and third parties , such as contractors or agency independent assessors , for conducting reviews of additional high value assets that are considered significant , but are not included in dhs 's current review , until the end of fiscal year 2020. given these shortcomings , dhs is now reassessing key aspects of the program . however , it does not have a schedule or plan for completing this reassessment , or to address outstanding issues on completing required assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance to agencies and third parties .
