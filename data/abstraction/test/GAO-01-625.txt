despite efforts by the international community to reduce the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus , aids is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world and the primary cause of death in sub - saharan africa . the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids ( unaids ) , funded in part by the united states , is one important international effort against the disease . unaids was established by the united nations ( u.n. ) in 1996 to provide coordinated u.n. action and to lead and promote an expanded global response to the worldwide epidemic . this report assesses unaids ' progress , especially at the country level , toward increasing the coordination and commitment of the u.n. and global community ; assesses unaids ' progress in providing technical assistance and information and in developing a monitoring and evaluation plan to measure results ; and identifies factors that may have affected unaids ' progress . gao found that unaids has made progress in increasing u.n. coordination and enhancing the global response to the worldwide hiv / aids epidemic , but its country - level efforts need to be strengthened . unaids has provided financial and technical support to about 50 hiv / aids technical networks worldwide , but has not been as successful in tracking the funding and actions host governments and others have taken to address the aids problem . unaids has also been unable to follow its intended model of u.n. reform , whereby a single secretariat together with several u.n. agencies would marshal the u.n. and global community 's resources to address the aids epidemic .
