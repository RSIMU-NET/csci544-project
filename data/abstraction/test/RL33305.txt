in april 1980 , the federal government enacted the crude oil windfall profit tax on the u.s.oil industry . the main purpose of the tax was to recoup for the federal government much of therevenue that would have otherwise gone to the oil industry as a result of the decontrol of oil prices . supporters of the tax viewed this revenue as an unearned and unanticipated windfall caused by highoil prices , which were determined by the opec ( organization of petroleum exporting countries ) cartel . despite its name , the windfall profit tax ( wpt ) was actually an excise tax , not a profits tax , imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price . while mostdomestically produced oil was subject to the tax ( about 2 / 3 in 1985 ) , the remaining 1 / 3 that wastax - exempt was significant ( 1.3 billion barrels in 1985 , or 360,000 barrels per day ) . the $ 80 billionin gross revenues generated by the wpt between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the $ 393billion projected . due to the deductibility of the wpt against the income tax , cumulative net wptrevenues were about $ 38 billion , significantly less than the $ 175 billion projected . this reportpresents estimates of the amount of foregone oil production from 1980-1986 due to the wpt underthree alternative supply price responses , reflecting three different assumptions about the priceelasticity of the domestic oil supply function , a critical factor ( statistic ) in estimating lost oil outputand increased import dependence . from 1980 to 1988 , the wpt may have reduced domestic oilproduction anywhere from 1.2 % to 8.0 % ( 320 to 1,269 million barrels ) . dependence on importedoil grew from between 3 % and 13 % . the tax was repealed in 1988 because ( 1 ) it was anadministrative burden to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , ( 2 ) it was a compliance burden to theoil industry , ( 3 ) due to low oil prices , the tax was generating little or no revenues in 1987 and 1988 , and ( 4 ) it made the united states more dependent on foreign oil . the depressed state of the u.s. oilindustry after 1986 also contributed to the repeal decision . reinstating the windfall profit tax would reduce recent oil industry windfalls due to highcrude and petroleum prices but could have several adverse economic effects . if imposed as an excisetax , the wpt would increase marginal production costs and be expected to reduce domestic oilproduction and increase the level of oil imports , which today is at nearly 60 % of demand . crudeprices would not tend to increase . some have proposed an excise tax on both domestically producedand imported oil as a way of mitigating the negative effects on petroleum import dependence . sucha broad - based wpt would tend to reduce import dependence , but it would lead to higher crude oilprices and likely to oil industry profits , potentially undermining its original goals . because the purecorporate profits tax is relatively neutral in the short run -- few , if any , price and output effects occurbecause marginal production costs are unchanged in the short run -- a possible option would be acorporate income surtax on the upstream operations of crude oil producers . such a tax that wouldrecoup any recent windfalls with less adverse economic effects ; imports would not increase becausedomestic production would remain unchanged . in the long run , such a tax is a tax on capital ; itreduces the rate of return , thus reducing the supply of capital to the oil industry .
