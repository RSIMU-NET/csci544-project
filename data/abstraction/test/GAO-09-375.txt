federal law restricts noncitizens ' access to public benefits , including temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , medicaid , the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , and supplemental security income ( ssi ) . further , when noncitizens who legally reside in this country through sponsorship of a family member apply for these benefits , they are subject to sponsor deeming , which requires benefit agencies to combine noncitizens ' incomes with those of their sponsors to determine eligibility . sponsors are also financially liable for benefits paid to the noncitizen , and benefit agencies must seek repayment for these costs . gao was asked to analyze what is known about the size of the noncitizen population potentially affected by the sponsor deeming requirements for tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi ; to what extent have agencies implemented sponsor deeming ; to what extent have agencies implemented sponsor repayment . to address these , gao analyzed federal data , surveyed states , and interviewed federal , state , and local officials . the number of sponsored noncitizens potentially affected by sponsor deeming is unknown ; however , federal restrictions on their eligibility for tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , as well as other factors , likely limit the number affected . the most recent data available suggest that 11 percent ( 473,000 ) of sponsored noncitizens applied for tanf , medicaid , or snap during the course of 2007 , and less than 1 percent ( 29,000 ) applied for ssi . in addition to federal restrictions , benefit agency officials reported that applicants ' reluctance or inability to obtain sponsor income information further reduces instances of deeming . nationwide , most benefit administering agencies have established sponsor deeming policies for tanf , snap , and ssi . however , agencies in 20 states have not done so for medicaid , due in part to the lack of federal guidance for medicaid on this requirement . yet , even among administering agencies that have established policies , many expressed the desire for more federal guidance on various aspects of deeming . for example , over 60 percent of state officials reported that additional clarification on applying an exception to deeming when noncitizen applicants are indigent would be useful . local officials also reported difficulties accessing information from the department of homeland security needed to determine whether an applicant is sponsored -- an essential part of the deeming process . few agencies have taken steps to implement sponsor repayment of tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , due in part to inconsistent federal guidance . while law requires that agencies administratively pursue repayment , federal regulations and guidance suggest it is optional . in total , only two states have pursued sponsor repayment . benefit agency officials reported that several factors discourage pursuit of repayment . specifically , they reported that the process involves high relative costs since noncitizens who receive benefits after deeming only qualify because both they and their sponsors have very low incomes . officials also reported that local staff who pursue repayment for these benefits sometimes have competing priorities .
