the legal services corporation ( lsc ) is a private , nonprofit , federally funded corporation that helps provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( i.e . , non - criminal ) matters . the primary responsibility of the lsc is to manage and oversee the congressionally appropriated federal funds that it distributes in the form of grants to local legal services providers , which in turn give legal assistance to low - income clients . the lsc appropriation for fy2009 is $ 390 million . since its inception , the legal services program has been controversial . congress , through the lsc act and various annual appropriation laws , has imposed many restrictions on activities of lsc - funded legal services programs . the obama administration and certain congressional proposals would eliminate some of these restrictions . under current law , lsc - funded legal services programs may not : ( 1 ) engage in partisan litigation related to redistricting ; ( 2 ) attempt to influence regulatory , legislative , or adjudicative action at the federal , state , or local level ; ( 3 ) attempt to influence oversight proceedings of the lsc ; ( 4 ) engage in litigation related to abortion ; ( 5 ) engage in litigation related to school desegregation ; ( 6 ) engage in litigation related to draft registration or desertion from the military ; ( 7 ) initiate or participate in any class action suit ; ( 8 ) represent certain categories of aliens , except that both lsc and non - lsc funds may be used to represent aliens who have been victims of domestic violence or child abuse ; ( 9 ) conduct advocacy training on a public policy issue or encourage political activities , strikes , or demonstrations ; ( 10 ) represent clients in eviction proceedings if the eviction was based on drug - related activities ; ( 11 ) represent federal , state , or local prisoners ; ( 12 ) participate in efforts to reform a federal or state welfare system ; ( 13 ) solicit clients ; or ( 14 ) engage in activities related to assisted suicide , euthanasia , or mercy killing . the obama administration 's fy2010 budget proposed that funding for the lsc be increased to $ 435 million for fy2010 ( which would exceed the previous all - time high level of $ 400 million ) , and that lsc restrictions on class action suits and attorneys ' fees be eliminated . h.r . 2847 , the fy2010 appropriations bill from the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce , justice , science and related agencies ( cjs ) , as passed by the house ( on june 18 , 2009 ) would have increased funding for the lsc to $ 440 million for fy2010 and would have kept the current restrictions on lsc activities , except for the one relating to attorneys ' fees . h.r . 2847 , as passed by the senate ( on november 5 , 2009 ) , would have increased funding for the lsc to $ 400 million for fy2010 and would have , in effect , allowed non - federal funds that are received by lsc - funded legal services programs to be used to pay for activities that are prohibited by the lsc , except for litigation involving abortion or prisoners . by contrast , the proposed civil access to justice act of 2009 , s. 718 , introduced by senator harkin ( et al . ) . on march 26 , 2009 ( and the house companion bill h.r . 3764 , introduced by representative robert `` bobby '' scott ( et al . ) . on october 8 , 2009 ) , would increase lsc funding to $ 750 million per year and remove most of the restrictions on activities performed by legal services programs that receive lsc funds . p.l . 111-117 , the consolidated appropriations for 2010 ( enacted december 16 , 2009 ) , included a provision that appropriates $ 420 million for the lsc for fy2010 . p.l . 111-117 also continues existing limitations on the use of lsc funds ( and non - lsc funds ) except for the restriction on the ability of lsc - funded programs to claim and collect attorneys ' fees . this report provides background information on the lsc , presents some of the arguments for and against the imposition of the current restrictions on lsc funds , and provides information on when the restrictions were enacted . this report will be updated as warranted .
