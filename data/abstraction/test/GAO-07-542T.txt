the foundation laid by the chief financial officers act of 1990 and other management reform legislation provided a much needed statutory basis to improve the accountability of government programs and operations . such reforms were intended to produce reliable , timely , and useful financial information to help manage day - to - day operations and exercise oversight and promote fiscal stewardship . this testimony , based on gao 's prior work , addresses the progress made and challenges remaining to improve federal financial management practices , and the serious challenges posed by the government 's deteriorating long - range fiscal condition and the comptroller general 's views on a possible way forward . since the enactment of key financial management reforms , the federal government has made substantial progress in improving financial management activities and practices . federal financial systems requirements have been developed , and internal control has been strengthened . nonetheless , the federal government still has a long way to go to address the six principal challenges to fully realizing strong federal financial management : transforming financial management and business practices at dod , improving agency financial and performance reporting , modernizing financial management systems , addressing key remaining internal control weaknesses , building a financial management workforce for the future , and strengthening consolidated financial reporting . from a broad financial management perspective , the federal government 's financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many understand . we are currently experiencing strong economic growth and yet running large on - budget ( operating ) deficits that are largely unrelated to the global war on terrorism . the federal government faces large and growing structural deficits in future years due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care costs . if it is assumed that recent tax reductions are made permanent and discretionary spending keeps pace with the growth of our economy , gao 's long - term simulations suggest that by 2040 , federal revenues may be adequate to pay little more than interest on debt held by the public and some social security benefits . neither slowing the discretionary spending growth nor allowing certain tax provisions to expire -- nor both together -- would eliminate the imbalance .
