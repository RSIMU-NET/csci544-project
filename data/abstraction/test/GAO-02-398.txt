in light of its continuing financial deterioration and its stated goal of eliminating federal operating assistance by december 2002 , amtrak undertook several steps to improve its financial condition , including changing in its routes and services . amtrak has been unsuccessful in implementing its network growth strategy to shift its route and service plans for new routes and expanded services on the freight tracks over which it operates . two years after announcing the new strategy , amtrak has only implemented three routes , one of which was later canceled . amtrak still plans to implement the remaining three routes , although later than planned . increased mail and express revenues were the cornerstone of the new strategy . however , amtrak overestimated the mail and express revenue expected . according to amtrak , this overestimation occurred because it had no empirical basis for its revenue estimates and express shippers were reluctant to enter into contracts for service that did not yet exist . six of the planned route actions were canceled because amtrak overestimated the revenues associated with them . amtrak was unable to reach agreement with freight railroads because they were concerned about amtrak 's plans to operate additional trains in already congested areas , amtrak 's plans to carry express merchandise that might compete with their own business , and compensation that amtrak would pay for use of their tracks .
