for decades , congress has enacted laws authorizing generic promotion programs for anumber of farm products to increase overall demand and consumption of the agricultural product . these generic promotion programs , commonly known as `` check - off '' programs , are funded throughthe payment of mandatory assessments imposed on the amount of product that a covered party sells , produces , or imports . some producers have opposed the use of generic advertisements and havebrought first amendment challenges in court . generally , these parties claim that they should notbe required to pay for advertisements ( i.e . , speech ) with which they disagree . the supreme court has ruled on the constitutionality of check - off programs three times inthe last eight years , the most recent of which occurred in may 2005. the court 's first two attemptsat addressing first amendment challenges to check - off programs resulted in contrasting outcomesand some confusion for lower courts . in johanns v. livestock marketing association , the supremecourt 's third and most recent decision concerning a check - off program ( beef ) , the court ruled thatthe generic advertising under the program was the government 's own speech , and was therefore notsusceptible to the first amendment challenge before it . the supreme court 's decision was basedon grounds that had not been previously addressed by the court in the earlier check - off cases andmay have far - reaching effects . for example , three circuit court rulings that invalidated othercheck - off programs have already been vacated by the court for reconsideration in light of johanns . this report begins with a brief introduction to check - off programs and then describes manyof the first amendment principles that have been discussed in check - off cases . next is an analysisof the first two challenges that reached the supreme court , as well as a brief discussion ofsubsequent lower court decisions . this report concludes with a discussion of johanns v. livestockmarketing association and its possible implications for check - off programs . this report will beupdated as warranted .
