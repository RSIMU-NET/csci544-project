va is responsible for providing benefits and services to veterans , including health care , disability compensation , and various types of financial assistance . in fiscal year 2019 , va received a total budget of $ 201.1 billion and a discretionary budget of $ 86.6 billion — the largest in va 's history — to carry out its mission . gao , along with the va inspector general and other entities , continues to identify significant deficiencies in va 's governance structures and operations — all of which can affect the care provided to our nation 's veterans . this testimony focuses on the status of va 's efforts to address gao 's high - risk designations and open gao recommendations in the following areas : va health care , acquisition management , and disability claims workloads and benefit eligibility criteria , among other areas . it is primarily based on gao 's march 2019 high - risk update and a body of work that spans more than a decade . the department of veterans affairs ( va ) has longstanding management challenges . as a result , gao added several va programs to its high - risk list . this list focuses attention on government operations that are most vulnerable to fraud , waste , abuse , or mismanagement , or in need of transformation . these include managing risks and improving va health care , va acquisition management , and improving and modernizing va disability programs , including managing claims and updating eligibility criteria . va health care was designated high risk in 2015 due to concerns about va 's ability to ensure the cost - effective and efficient use of resources to improve the timeliness , quality , and safety of health care for veterans . gao identified five areas of concern : ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes ; inadequate oversight and accountability ; information technology challenges ; inadequate training for va staff ; and unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . va 's efforts to address each of these areas have been impeded by leadership instability . however , since his july 2018 confirmation , secretary wilkie has demonstrated his commitment to address the department 's high - risk designations . his actions to date have allowed the department to maintain its leadership commitment rating of partially met in gao 's 2019 high - risk update . va also partially met the action plan criteria . as of march 2019 , it did not meet the other three criteria for removal from the high - risk list ( agency capacity , monitoring , and demonstrated progress ) . this is , in part , because gao continues to have audit findings that illustrate that the five areas of concern have not been fully addressed . for example : in a series of reports from 2012 through 2018 , gao found va 's wait time data unreliable for primary and specialty care as well as for care in the community . gao also found that va did not measure the full wait times that veterans experience in obtaining care across these settings . in november 2017 , gao reported that va medical center officials did not always conduct or document timely required reviews of providers when allegations of wrongdoing were made against them . in april 2019 , gao found that va 's governance plan for modernizing its electronic health record system was not fully defined , potentially jeopardizing its fourth attempt at modernization . in april 2019 , gao reported that va 's appraisal process for assessing medical center director performance relies heavily on a system with long - identified deficiencies that remain unaddressed , thus diminishing va 's ability to hold officials accountable . in its 2019 high - risk report , gao added va acquisition management as a high - risk area in light of the department 's numerous contracting challenges and the significant federal investment in serving veterans . to date , gao has identified challenges in the following areas : outdated acquisition regulations and policies ; lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy ; inadequate acquisition training ; contracting officer workload challenges ; lack of reliable data systems ; limited contract oversight and incomplete contract documentation ; and leadership instability . for example , as of may 2019 , va does not have updated acquisition regulations and officials expect to have a full update by 2021 ; a process which has been in place since 2011. gao designated improving and modernizing federal disability programs , including va 's program , as high risk in 2003. gao identified two areas of concern related to va : managing disability claims workload and updating disability benefit eligibility criteria . as a result of these concerns , veterans may not have their disability claims and appeals processed in a timely manner . gao reported in march 2018 that va is making a major effort to reform its appeals process by onboarding new staff and implementing new technology . however , its appeals planning process does not provide reasonable assurance that it will have the capacity to successfully implement the new process and manage risks . va agreed with gao 's recommendation to better assess risks associated with appeals reform . va leadership has committed to addressing gao 's high - risk concerns and has launched several transformational efforts . for example , va is currently implementing the veterans health administration plan for modernization , a framework that aims to modernize the department , as well as the va mission act of 2018. this act requires va to consolidate programs that allow veterans to receive care outside va. if successful , these efforts could be transformative for va. however , such success will only be achieved through sustained leadership attention and detailed action plans that include metrics and milestones to monitor and demonstrate va 's progress . sustained congressional oversight will also be essential . since 2000 , gao has made more than 1,200 recommendations to reduce va 's high - risk challenges , and va has implemented approximately 70 percent . gao will continue to monitor va 's progress in implementing the remaining open recommendations .
