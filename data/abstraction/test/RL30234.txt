the pacific salmon treaty ( pst ) of 1985 requires the united states and canada to develop periodic bilateral agreements to implement the pst 's conservation and harvest - sharing principles . beginning in 1993 , long - standing disputes prevented such an agreement from being concluded . on june 30 , 1999 , after many years of heated diplomatic struggles , u.s. and canadian officials reached a new comprehensive agreement . the 1999 agreement ( 1 ) established abundance - based fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst ; ( 2 ) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation , improve fishery management , and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts ; and ( 3 ) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation , improve the scientific basis for salmon management , and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission ( psc ) . annex iv to the 1999 agreement outlines , in detail , the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the six species of anadromous pacific salmon and trout . before it expired at the end of 2008 , the terms of annex iv were renegotiated . the 1999 conservation and harvest - sharing agreement was of interest to congress for several reasons . most notably , a congressional appropriation of $ 140 million was required to establish the agreement 's two regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds . provisions of the 1999 agreement were implemented thorough additional authorizing language and amendment of the pacific salmon treaty act ( 16 u.s.c . §§3631 , et seq . ) . the 1999 agreement under the pst regime has been implemented in accordance with existing u.s. laws pertaining to salmon conservation ( e.g . , magnuson - stevens fishery conservation and management act ; endangered species act ) . in addition , the agreement 's implementation determines the quantity of fish available for commercial , recreational , and subsistence fisheries as well as indian treaty allocations . many complex issues continue to challenge the psc and the parties ; several of these were addressed in the 2008 renegotiation of the annex iv fisheries regimes . some of the issues associated with the renegotiation included the fishery regime for chinook salmon found in chapter 3 of annex iv . the problems arising from the status ( e.g . , u.s. endangered and threatened species listing ) of certain runs of chinook salmon in washington , oregon , idaho , and perhaps british columbia posed particular challenges for the negotiators . additional concerns arose from canada over increasing bycatch of chinook salmon by the u.s. pollock fishery in the bering sea , as many of these fish are bound for the yukon river , including canadian tributaries . this report provides historical background about the pst , discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime , summarizes the 1999 accord , and analyzes issues considered during the renegotiation of annex iv . the 111th congress may conduct oversight of the renegotiated agreement and its implications for u.s. salmon management .
