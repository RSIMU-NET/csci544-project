catastrophic disasters , such as hurricane katrina , may result in trauma and other psychological consequences for the people who experience them . the federal government provides states with funding and other support to help them prepare for and respond to disasters . because of congressional interest in these issues , gao examined federal agencies ' actions to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters and states ' experiences obtaining and using grants from the crisis counseling assistance and training program ( ccp ) to respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters . ccp is a program of the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . gao reviewed documents and interviewed program officials from federal agencies and conducted additional work in six states with experience responding to catastrophic disasters : florida , louisiana , mississippi , new york , texas , and washington . federal agencies have awarded grants and conducted other activities to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic and other disasters . for example , in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) provided grants to mental health and substance abuse agencies in 35 states for disaster planning . in 2007 , samhsa completed an assessment of mental health and substance abuse disaster plans developed by states that received a preparedness grant . samhsa found that , for the 34 states with plans available for review , these plans generally showed improvement over those that had been submitted by states as part of their application for its preparedness grant . the agency also identified several ways in which the plans could be improved . for example , about half the plans did not indicate specific planning and response actions that substance abuse agencies should take . similarly , gao 's review of the plans available from six states found varying attention among the plans to covering substance abuse issues . samhsa officials said the agency is exploring methods of determining states ' individual technical assistance needs . other federal agencies -- the centers for disease control and prevention , the health resources and services administration , and dhs -- have provided broader preparedness funding that states may use for mental health or substance abuse preparedness , but these agencies ' data - reporting requirements do not produce information on the extent to which states used funds for this purpose . states in gao 's review experienced difficulties in applying for ccp funding and implementing their programs following catastrophic disasters . ccp , a key federal postdisaster response grant program to help states deliver crisis counseling services , is administered by fema in collaboration with samhsa . state officials said they had difficulty collecting information needed for their ccp applications and experienced lengthy application reviews . fema and samhsa officials said they have taken steps to improve the application submission and review process . state officials also said they experienced problems implementing their ccps . for example , they said that fema 's policy of not reimbursing states and their ccp service providers for indirect costs , such as certain administrative expenses , led to problems recruiting and retaining service providers . other fema postdisaster response grant programs allow reimbursement for indirect costs . a fema official said the agency had been considering since 2006 whether to allow indirect cost reimbursement under ccp but did not know when a decision would be made . states also cited difficulties assisting people who needed more intensive crisis counseling services than those traditionally provided through state ccps . fema and samhsa officials said they plan to consider options for adding other types of crisis counseling services to ccp , based in part on states ' experiences with ccp pilot programs offering expanded crisis counseling services . the officials did not know when they would complete their review and reach a decision .
