dhs 's human resources information technology environment includes fragmented systems , duplicative and paper - based processes , and little uniformity of data management practices , which according to dhs , are compromising the department 's ability to effectively carry out its mission . dhs initiated hrit in 2003 to consolidate , integrate , and modernize dhs 's human resources information technology infrastructure . in 2011 , dhs redefined hrit 's scope and implementation time frames . this statement summarizes gao 's report that is being released at today 's hearing ( gao - 16-253 ) on , among other objectives , the progress dhs has made in implementing the hrit investment and how effectively it managed the investment . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has made very little progress in implementing its human resources information technology ( hrit ) investment over the last several years . this investment includes 15 improvement areas ; as of november 2015 , dhs had fully implemented only 1. hrit 's limited progress was due in part to the lack of involvement of its executive steering committee â€” the investment 's core oversight and advisory body . specifically , this committee was minimally involved with hrit , such as meeting only once during a nearly 2-year period when major problems were occurring , including schedule delays and the lack of a life - cycle cost estimate . as a result , key governance activities , such as approval of hrit 's operational plan , were not completed . officials acknowledge that hrit should be re - evaluated . they have met to discuss it ; however , specific actions and time frames have not yet been determined . until dhs takes key actions to manage this neglected investment , it is unknown when its human capital management weaknesses will be addressed . in its report that is being released today , gao made 14 recommendations to dhs to , among other things , address hrit 's poor progress and ineffective management . for example , gao recommended that the hrit executive steering committee be consistently involved in overseeing and advising the investment , and that dhs establish time frames for re - evaluating hrit and develop a complete life - cycle cost estimate for the investment . dhs concurred with the 14 recommendations and provided estimated completion dates for implementing each of them .
