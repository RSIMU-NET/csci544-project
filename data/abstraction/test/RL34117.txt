beginning in the late 1970s , congress gave railroads flexibility to set rates and to enter into confidential contracts with their customers . over the last decade , large railroads have consolidated and , particularly in recent years , have achieved higher profitability . these changes have left some bulk shippers , particularly those that claim to be `` captive '' to a single railroad , frustrated with what they perceive as poor rail service and exorbitant rates . `` captive shippers '' claim that the railroad serving them acts like a monopoly â€” charging excessively high rates and providing less service than they require . such complaints have led congress to consider whether the present , largely deregulated , regime should be revised to accommodate the interests of `` captive shippers . . a major point of contention is whether current railroad industry practices should be changed to guarantee such shippers more railroad routing options . legislation , supported by captive shippers and opposed by the railroads and other shippers , failed to reach the floor of either the house or senate in the last congress , and has been reintroduced in the 112th congress ( s. 49 and s. 158 ) . in the wake of renewed congressional interest , the surface transportation board ( stb or board ) , successor agency of the interstate commerce commission ( icc ) , is reviewing its policies with respect to railroad access and competition issues . it announced a hearing on `` bottleneck rates '' and `` competitive access '' matters . changes in these policies might benefit some shippers of bulk products , such as coal and grain , but could be disadvantageous to shippers of other products , such as maritime containers and domestic truck trailers , that want railroads to maintain high levels of investment in order to provide fast , reliable service for high - value shipments . the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the division of revenue between railroads and their customers . higher fuel prices , congestion on certain segments of the interstate highway system , and rising domestic and international trade volumes are driving shippers to demand more rail capacity . freight revenues are a significant means of financing rail capacity because the railroads receive negligible public financing . if it acts in this area , congress would face consideration of how a legislated or regulatory solution to the `` captive shipper '' problem would affect the development of a more robust and efficient railroad system .
