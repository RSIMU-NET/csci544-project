under the copyright act , internet radio broadcasters , or `` webcasters , '' that stream copyrighted music to their listeners are obliged to pay royalty fees to the sound recording copyright owners at statutory rates established by the copyright royalty board ( crb ) . however , some webcasters may also have the option of paying different royalty fees that are privately negotiated with soundexchange , the entity that collects performance royalties on behalf of sound recording copyright owners and recording artists . on march 9 , 2007 , the crb announced statutory royalty rates for certain digital transmissions of sound recordings by webcasters for the royalty period january 1 , 2006 , through december 31 , 2010. several webcasters appealed the crb 's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . the appellants argued that the rates were unreasonably high and that the absence of a cap on minimum fees paid per licensee was arbitrary and capricious . on july 10 , 2009 , the federal court of appeals issued a decision that upheld nearly all aspects of the crb 's determination of rates . two recent laws , the webcaster settlement act of 2008 ( wsa of 2008 ; p.l . 110-435 ) and the webcaster settlement act of 2009 ( wsa of 2009 ; p.l . 111-36 ) , facilitated the ability of webcasters to enter into voluntary agreements with soundexchange that provide alternative royalty rates that substitute for the statutory rates established under the crb 's decision . these agreements generally permit a webcaster to pay lower rates and may cover a longer royalty period . pursuant to the wsa of 2008 and 2009 , voluntarily negotiated royalty agreements were reached between soundexchange and the following entities : the corporation for public broadcasting ( for the online streaming of public radio stations ) ; the national association of broadcasters ( for online simulcasts by fm and am radio stations ) ; a group of `` small '' webcasters ; certain `` pureplay '' commercial webcasters ( those that derive nearly all of their revenue from the streaming of sound recordings ) such as pandora , live365.com , and accuradio ; noncommercial educational webcasters ( college - affiliated internet radio stations ) ; noncommercial religious broadcasters ( that stream their am / fm programming over the internet ) ; and sirius xm ( concerning internet streaming of sirius programming as opposed to its satellite - transmitted programming ) . although the above settlements cover the same royalty period as the crb 's determination ( from 2006 through 2010 ) , some rate agreements extend beyond that period , until the end of 2015. thus , webcasters that are parties to extended agreements need not participate in the crb proceedings to determine statutory royalty rates for the period 2011 to 2015 , which were initiated in january 2009. any webcaster that chooses not to opt - in to a settlement agreement with soundexchange must instead comply with the applicable statutory rates and terms established by the crb for the period 2006-2010 , and will be subject to any new rates that the crb determines for 2011-2015. this report surveys the legislative history of this issue , the crb 's rate decision , and the congressional and public response .
