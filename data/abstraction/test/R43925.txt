consumer financial card fraud due to data breaches of card information is an ongoing problem in the united states . the majority of breaches are carried out against point - of - sale ( pos ) systems , and are facilitated by what many consider to be the weak link in the u.s. retail sales payment process : the continued use of magnetic stripe cards ( also referred to as stripe - and - signature cards ) . these cards are still what most u.s. consumers think of when referring to financial cards . in much of the rest of the world , cards that provide a much higher level of security for conducting sales transactions have been used for many years : emv cards , named for the coalition of card brands europay , mastercard , and visa ( the emv coalition or emvco ) that developed the specifications for the system in the 1990s . emv cards store card information on an embedded microchip and are more commonly called chip cards . with these cards , instead of swiping and signing to make a payment , the cardholder inserts the card into the pos machine , then either enters a personal identification number ( pin ) or signs to verify the transaction . on october 1 , 2015 , the liability for fraudulent transactions involving magnetic stripe cards shifted to the entity — card issuer ( e.g . , bank , credit union ) or merchant — that had not yet made the transition . the transition makes u.s. - issued cards compatible with pos systems and automated teller machines in much of the rest of the world . on october 1 , 2016 , a new liability shift will occur : automated teller machines ( atm ) that accept mastercard branded cards must be emv operational . atms that accept visa - branded cards have an additional year to be operational . the 114th congress may examine the transition and its effectiveness to determine whether any legislative action is needed , especially if major breaches continue to occur despite the transition .
