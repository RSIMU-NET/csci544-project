after the events of september 11 , 2001 , concerns were raised over the security of u.s. ports and waterways . in response to the concerns over port security , congress passed the maritime transportation security act in november 2002. the act created a broad range of programs to improve the security conditions at the ports and along american waterways , such as identifying and tracking vessels , assessing security preparedness , and limiting access to sensitive areas . a number of executive agencies were delegated responsibilities to implement these programs and other provisions of the act . the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation asked gao to conduct a review of the status of the agencies ' efforts to implement the security requirements of the act . this testimony reflects gao 's preliminary findings ; much of gao 's work in the area is still under way . agencies responsible for implementing the security provisions of the maritime transportation security act have made progress in meeting their requirements . thus far , gao has obtained information about 43 of 46 specific action areas , and efforts are under way in 42 of them . for example , the coast guard , the department of homeland security agency with lead responsibility for most of the assignments , has published six interim rules covering responsibilities ranging from security of port facilities to vessel identification systems . two other agencies within the new department -- the transportation security administration and the bureau of customs and border protection -- have actions under way in such areas as establishing an identification system for millions of port workers and setting information requirements for cargo . the maritime administration , a department of transportation agency , has already completed or is well into implementing such responsibilities as developing training for security personnel . while much has been accomplished , gao 's review found five areas of concern . three relate primarily to security issues : only a limited number of ports covered by vessel identification system ; questions about the scope and quality of port security assessments ; and concerns related to approving security plans for foreign vessels . two relate primarily to organizational and operational matters : potential duplication of maritime intelligence efforts ; and inconsistency with port security grant program requirements .
