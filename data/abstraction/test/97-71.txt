no provision in the u.s. constitution expressly establishes a procedure for public access to executive branch records or meetings . congress , however , has legislated various public access laws . among these laws are two records access statutes , the freedom of information act ( foia ; 5 u.s.c . ยง552 ) , and the privacy act ( 5 u.s.c . ยง552a ) , and two meetings access statutes , the federal advisory committee act ( faca ; 5 u.s.c . app . ) , and the government in the sunshine act ( 5 u.s.c . ยง552b ) . these four laws provide the foundation for access to executive branch information in the american federal government . the records - access statutes provide the public with a variety of methods to examine how executive branch departments and agencies execute their missions . the meeting - access statutes provide the public the opportunity to participate in and inform the policy process . these four laws are also among the most used and most litigated federal access laws . while the four statutes provide the public with access to executive branch federal records and meetings , they do not apply to the legislative or judicial branches of the u.s. government . the american separation of powers model of government provides a collection of formal and informal methods that the branches can use to provide information to one another . moreover , the separation of powers anticipates conflicts over the accessibility of information . these conflicts are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive . although there is considerable interbranch cooperation in the sharing of information and records , such conflicts over access may continue on occasion . this report offers an introduction to the four access laws and provides citations to additional resources related to these statutes . this report includes statistics on the use of foia and faca and on litigation related to foia . the 114th congress may have an interest in overseeing the implementation of these laws or may consider amending the laws . in addition , this report provides some examples of the methods congress , the president , and the courts have employed to provide or require the provision of information to one another . this report is a primer on information access in the u.s. federal government and provides a list of resources related to transparency , secrecy , access , and nondisclosure .
