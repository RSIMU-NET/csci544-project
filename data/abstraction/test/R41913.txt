the united states has seen continued growth of electronic card payments ( and a simultaneous decrease in check payments ) . from 2009 through 2012 , debit card transactions have outpaced other payment forms . when a consumer uses a debit card in a transaction , the merchant pays a `` swipe '' fee , which is also known as the interchange fee . the interchange fee is paid to the card - issuing bank ( i.e . , the consumer 's bank that issued the debit card ) as compensation for facilitating the transaction . section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010 ( or title x of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act , p.l . 111-203 ) , also known as the durbin amendment , authorizes the federal reserve board to prescribe regulations to ensure that the amount of any interchange transaction fee received by a debit card issuer is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer . the federal reserve may consider the authorization , clearance , and settlement costs of each transaction when it sets the interchange fee . the durbin amendment allows the interchange fee to be adjusted for costs incurred by debit card issuers to prevent fraud . debit card issuers with less than $ 10 billion in assets are exempt by statute from the regulation , which means that smaller financial institutions may receive a larger interchange fee than larger issuers . the legislation also prohibits network providers ( e.g . , visa and mastercard ) and debit card issuers from imposing restrictions that would override a merchant 's choice of the network provider through which to route transactions . on june 29 , 2011 , the federal reserve issued a final rule implementing the durbin amendment by regulation ii , which includes a cap of 21 cents plus 0.05 % of the transaction ( and an additional 1 cent to account for fraud protection costs ) on the interchange fee for large issuers . the rule went into effect on october 1 , 2011. merchants expected to benefit from the durbin amendment by having to pay a lower swipe fee . large debit card issuers expected to lose revenue under the regulated cap . many small debit card issuers that were exempt from the rule had also opposed the durbin amendment given concerns about the feasibility of a sustainable two - tiered interchange pricing system . since implementation of the rule , merchants have seen a limited and unequal impact on the amount they pay in swipe fees . likewise , the impact of regulation ii has been uneven for covered institutions . institutions not covered by the regulation ii have reportedly observed minimal change in revenues generated by debit transactions . h.r . 10 , the financial choice act of 2017 , would repeal the durbin amendment . specifically , section 735 of the financial choice act would repeal section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010. on may 4 , 2017 , h.r . 10 was ordered to be reported by the house financial services committee .
