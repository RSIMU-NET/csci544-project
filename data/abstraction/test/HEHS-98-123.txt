pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided additional information on the social security administration 's ( ssa ) implementation of the new eligibility standard . gao noted that : ssa has made considerable progress in implementing the welfare reform changes in eligibility for supplemental security income ( ssi ) children ; it has taken important steps to safeguard fairness by identifying children whose benefits may have been terminated inappropriately and establishing remedial action to rereview their cases ; however , because ssa 's medical listings reflect multiple levels of severity , ssa also needs to expedite updating and modifying its medical listings to ensure that all children are assessed against a uniform severity standard ; the need to revise the listings is a long - standing problem that gao reported 3 years ago ; moreover , ssa needs to take concerted action to follow through on its plan for monitoring and continually improving the quality of decisions regarding children ; and consistent with its legislative mandate , gao will continue to focus its work on ssa 's efforts to provide reasonable assurance that it can administer the program consistently and improve the accuracy of childhood disability decisions .
