pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on personnel management in the district of columbia ( d.c. ) courts , focusing on : staffing and workload levels for the courts from 1989 through 1998 ; how the courts evaluate the sufficiency of the levels of nonjudicial staff who work on processing and disposition of cases ; and a comparison of the d.c. courts ' staffing methodology to other available methodologies . gao noted that : overall staffing levels in the d.c. courts increased between 1989 and 1990 , declined slightly with some fluctuations through 1997 , and then decreased below the 1989 level in 1998 ; cases available for disposition increased slightly during this time in the d.c. superior court , the largest part of the courts , while its backlog increased substantially ; the cases available for disposition , and the backlog , of the far smaller d.c. court of appeals increased steadily over this period ; in both courts , the mix of different types of cases has changed over this period ; district of columbia court officials said that they consider caseload data , along with other data , in judging whether staffing levels are appropriate ; according to court officials , staffing decisions are made on a year - by - year basis and are made individually for each division of the superior court and court of appeals ; the courts ' methodology does not provide a comprehensive review of what staffing levels should be because it does not consider the amount of staff time and resources that are needed for case processing ; caseload trends alone do not show whether a unit is overstaffed or understaffed because they do not account for how much time is needed to process differing types of cases or for productivity improvements ; methodologies that consider the amount of staff time and resources required to process different types of cases in determining the sufficiency of staffing levels do exist ; and the national center for state courts has devised a database system to determine staffing levels needed for a given workload , and the administrative office of the u.s. courts uses a database system to distribute resources among the federal courts .
