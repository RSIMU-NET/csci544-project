in response to the disclosure of various national security agency ( nsa ) surveillance and data collection programs , a number of legislative changes to the government 's intelligence operations authority have been suggested . under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 ( fisa ) , the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) reviews government applications to conduct surveillance and engage in data collection for foreign intelligence purposes , and the fisa court of review reviews rulings of the fisc . most fisa opinions are classified by the executive branch . some have raised concerns that this practice permits the government to rely upon `` secret law '' to justify its activities , and have proposed requiring the public release of legal opinions and orders issued by the fisc and the fisa court of review . however , others might regard these proposals as raising separation of powers questions , including the scope of the executive branch 's control over national security information . fisa opinions and orders , most of which seem to contain at least some sensitive facts pertaining to national security , involve the legal analysis of sensitive national security information . requiring the executive branch to release them implicates article ii of the constitution because it compels the president to disclose potentially sensitive documents , and could override the president 's classification decisions . after briefly reviewing the fisc 's current procedures , this report will examine the article ii implications of requiring the executive branch to disclose fisa opinions . the constitution assigns responsibility for the national defense to both congress and the president . however , the extent to which congress may regulate the president 's discretion over national security matters is a contentious issue . some argue that the president possesses a sphere of authority that exists independent of any congressional delegation of authority . while courts have not precisely determined the scope of any such power , it appears that control over access to national security information is largely shared between the legislative and executive branches , rather than belonging exclusively to one branch . for example , courts have indicated that neither one possesses absolute power over classified information . in addition , an examination of historical practice reveals that congress and the executive branch share power in this area . congress requires consistent disclosure of sensitive national security information to the relevant intelligence and defense committees . congress has also regulated control over access to national security information , passing legislation such as the classified information procedures act ( cipa ) , fisa , and the freedom of information act ( foia ) . pursuant to these statutes , courts have required the executive branch to disclose information to the public and the judiciary . in fact , no statute regulating classified information has been held by courts to improperly intrude upon the president 's power as commander in chief . nevertheless , congress 's power to compel the release of information held by the executive branch might not be absolute . the supreme court has observed that the president enjoys some power as commander in chief to control access to national security information . in addition , courts have crafted common law privileges that protect the executive branch from revealing certain military secrets . consequently , there may be a limited sphere of information that courts will protect from public disclosure .
