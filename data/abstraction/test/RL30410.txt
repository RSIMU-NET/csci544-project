almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy . many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty . justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is `` a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education , '' noting that `` [ t ] he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation ' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body . . in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . after a series of conflicting lower court rulings were issued regarding the use of race to promote a diverse student body , the supreme court agreed to review the race - conscious admissions policies used by the undergraduate and law school admissions programs at the university of michigan . in grutter v. bollinger , a 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the law school had a `` compelling '' interest in the `` educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body , '' which justified its race - based efforts to assemble a `` critical mass '' of `` underrepresented '' minority students . but in the companion decision , gratz v. bollinger , six justices decided that the university 's policy of awarding `` racial bonus points '' to minority applicants was not `` narrowly tailored '' enough to pass constitutional scrutiny . the decisions resolved , for the time being , the doctrinal muddle left in bakke 's wake . and because the court 's constitutional holdings translate to the private sector under the federal civil rights laws , nonpublic schools , colleges , and universities are likewise affected . however , the grutter and gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting . to resolve this question , the supreme court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools and to avoid racial segregation . in a consolidated 2007 ruling in parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no . 1 , the court struck down the seattle and louisville school plans at issue , holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment . more recently , the court 's decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education . in its 2013 ruling in fisher v. university of texas at austin , the court reaffirmed its holding in grutter , but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate court 's decision to uphold a race - conscious undergraduate admissions plan at the university of texas at austin . however , on remand , the appellate court upheld the university 's admissions program for a second time , a decision that appeared to prompt the court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term . meanwhile , in 2014 's schuette v. coalition to defend affirmative action , the court upheld michigan 's proposal 2 , which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education .
