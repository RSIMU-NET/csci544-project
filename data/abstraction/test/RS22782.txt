the railroad retirement board ( rrb ) , an independent federal agency , administers retirement , survivor , disability , unemployment , and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families . railroad retirement payroll taxes include two tiers — tier i and tier ii taxes . the tier i tax finances the tier i railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to social security benefits and the tier ii tax finances the tier ii benefit , tier i benefits in excess of social security benefits , and supplemental annuities . since 2002 , tier ii tax revenues in excess of obligatory rrb benefits and associated administrative costs have been invested in private stocks , bonds , and other investments . prior to the railroad retirement and survivors ' improvement act of 2001 ( rrsia ; p.l . 107-90 ) , surplus railroad retirement assets could only be invested in u.s. government securities — just as the social security trust funds must be invested . the rrsia established the national railroad retirement investment trust ( nrrit ; hereinafter , the trust ) to manage and invest part of the rrb 's assets in much the same way that the assets of private - sector and most state and local government pension plans are invested . the remainder of rrb 's assets continues to be invested solely in u.s. government securities . congress structured the trust in an effort to ensure investment independence and limit political interference . it also aimed to increase railroad retirement system funding , add enhanced benefits , potentially reduce taxes , and protect system financing in case of market downturns . the trust 's assets are invested in a diversified portfolio , both to minimize investment risk and avoid disproportionate influence over an industry or firm . the trust is a tax - exempt entity independent of the federal government , and it is not subject to the same oversight as federal agencies . however , the rrsia requires an annual management report to congress . from its inception in february 2002 to september 30 , 2017 , $ 21.3 billion has been transferred to the trust from the rrb and $ 21.1 billion has been transferred from the trust to pay railroad retirement benefits . at the end of fy2017 , the net asset value of the trust was $ 26.5 billion . the trust 's investments have generally followed the markets ' recent performance . from fy2003 to fy2017 , the trust 's annual returns averaged 8.3 % , slightly higher than expectations of the bill 's drafters , who assumed nominal annual returns of 8.0 % . as the trust 's investment portfolio diversified over time , its administrative expenses steadily increased , to 36 basis points in fy2011 , but fell to 31 basis points in fy2017 , and remain low when compared with other mutual funds . the combined fair market value of tier ii taxes and trust assets is designed to maintain four to six years ' worth of rrb benefits and administrative expenses . to maintain this balance , the railroad retirement tier ii tax rates automatically adjust as needed . this tax adjustment does not require congressional action . the railroad retirement tier ii tax rates increased in 2013 and most recently in 2015 .
