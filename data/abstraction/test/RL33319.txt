as congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include additional border and interior enforcement , a significant expansion of guest workers , and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration , some question whether the department of homeland security ( dhs ) can handle the increased immigration workload . there are concerns that the immigration responsibilities in the dhs are not functioning effectively . dhs secretary michael chertoff announced a `` second stage review '' ( 2sr ) in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items . currently , three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions : customs and border protection ( cbp ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and u.s. citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) . the immigration functions are dispersed across three agencies within dhs . the assistant secretary of ice , the commissioner of cbp , and the director of uscis all serve with the same rank directly under the dhs secretary . of these , only the director of uscis has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration . while the dhs secretary is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues , he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the attorney general and the secretary of state . some now argue the disaggregation of the government 's immigration responsibilities across several agencies has weakened immigration as a policy priority and has made it much more difficult for the executive branch to develop a comprehensive immigration reform and border security strategy . others maintain that the current organizational structure sharpens the focus on the key , yet disparate , immigration functions and is optimal from a homeland security perspective . in seven of the eight workload measures analyzed over the past decade in this report , the immigration workload has declined in recent years . only removals of aliens has surpassed levels prior to the restructuring of immigration responsibilities . while several key workload trends — notably , border apprehensions and immigration adjudications — are inching upward , the workload trends in asylum , inspections , naturalization , criminal prosecutions , and work site enforcement have declined or remained flat . thus far , independent assessments of the functioning of immigration in dhs have centered on problems rather than successes . indeed , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) has concluded that many of the management problems that existed before the restructuring of the federal immigration functions still remain . an underlying question is whether a sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhs 's efficacy in managing immigration policy . this report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated .
