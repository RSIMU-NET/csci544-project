pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed proposed legislation to redevelop abandoned , urban industrial sites , focusing on : the number of potential sites nationwide ; impediments to redeveloping sites posed by the superfund program ; and whether proposed loans to local governments are sufficient for conducting site assessments . gao found that : researchers estimate that about 150,000 acres of abandoned or underused industrial land exists nationwide ; lenders , property buyers , and property owners are reluctant to redevelop these sites because federal and state environmental laws may require expensive cleanups of latent industrial wastes before property improvements can be made ; federal law limits the liability of a party that holds ownership in a property but does not manage the property ; proposed legislation would limit the amount lenders would have to pay in the event they are liable , limit the liability of property buyers who assess a site for contamination before buying it , and provide assistance for state programs that encourage voluntary cleanup of industrial waste sites ; even if the liability of lenders and property buyers is limited , abandoned industrial sites might continue to be viewed as risky investments due to the possibility of contamination ; and proposed legislation would provide interest - free loans to localities to conduct site assessments to determine the extent of contamination .
