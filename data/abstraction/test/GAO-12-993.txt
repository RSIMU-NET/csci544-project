congress established the ctaa program in february 2009 through the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act ( tgaaa ) , passed as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act . the ctaa program was designed to supplement other trade adjustment assistance programs by providing assistance through grants to trade - impacted communities to help them become more competitive in the global economy . in 2010 , eda awarded $ 36.8 million in ctaa grants to 36 communities . the administration proposed to discontinue the program , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its eaa program . congress responded by repealing the ctaa program in 2012. tgaaa mandated that gao review the operation and effectiveness of trade adjustment assistance programs . this is one of several reports responding to that mandate . for this report , gao determined how eda made grant award decisions , what mechanisms eda established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness , and how the ctaa program compared with other eda community grant programs . gao reviewed agency documents , conducted a file review , and interviewed eda officials . the department of commerce 's economic development administration ( eda ) used its standard grant award process to announce , receive , and review applications for the community trade adjustment assistance ( ctaa ) program , with modifications related to program eligibility . to comply with legislative requirements , eda reached out to eligible communities by identifying those with workers or firms already certified as trade impacted by other trade adjustment assistance programs . eda awarded the grants in accordance with the review and selection process outlined in the ctaa federal funding opportunity -- the program 's grant application announcement . more than half of the grants were for construction projects , such as building roads and installing broadband fiber for industrial parks . although eda was able to adapt standard procedures already in place for its other grant programs , eda officials cited some ctaa - specific challenges : first , the effort required to set up the new program for ctaa grants ; second , a relatively limited time for the outreach and application process ; and third , the development of a list of eligible communities for outreach , which proved to be a complex undertaking . eda regional staff said that they monitor the grants using tools such as periodic progress and financial reports . gao 's review of a nonprobability sample of 12 of the 36 ctaa grant files found no gaps in the regional offices ' collection of required reports . many of the projects will not be completed until after 2013 , but grantees with construction projects are required to report on certain eda performance measures 3 , 6 , and 9 years after the award . thus , in 2013 , those grantees will be required to report measures relating to jobs created , jobs retained , and level of new private investment . the grantees will submit final nineyear project reports in 2019 that will help the agency determine whether the projects met their goals . gao 's review of how the ctaa program compared with other eda grant programs shows that although the ctaa grants targeted trade - impacted communities , some grantees might have been eligible for other eda grant programs . eda officials identified two other programs that target economically distressed communities -- eda 's economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) and public works programs -- that may have been able to provide assistance to ctaa communities . gao found that , through ctaa grants , eda assisted some trade - impacted communities that may not have qualified for eda 's other community grant programs due to differences in eligibility and cost - share requirements . however , eda officials provided some specific examples of ctaa grantees that may have qualified for the eaa or public works programs . although officials credited the ctaa program with providing additional funding to assist more communities , some officials suggested that funding for tradeimpacted communities could have been designated within , and similar services could have been delivered through , eda 's existing programs . gao is not making recommendations in this report . commerce concurred with gao 's findings and provided additional information on grantee performance reports and planned improvements to performance measures .
