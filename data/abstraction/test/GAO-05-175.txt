the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) was required by the drug free media campaign act of 1998 ( 21 u.s.c . 1801 et seq . ) . to conduct a national media campaign to reduce and prevent drug use among america 's youth . since 1998 , congress has appropriated over $ 1 billion for the media campaign . however , a 2003 report by the senate committee on appropriations expressed some concerns about the media campaign , including concern that a large portion of the campaign 's budget had been used for consulting services rather than the direct purchase of media time and space . the report , therefore , directed gao to review the use of consultants to support the media campaign . this report describes the services provided by consultants ( defined by gao as the prime contractors and their subcontractors ) in support of the media campaign , along with the estimated award amounts for these services . our analysis of contracts covering ondcp 's national youth anti - drug media campaign from fiscal years 2002 through 2004 revealed that four contractors provided many of the services required to execute the campaign . these four prime contractors provided an array of services that fell within three broad categories : advertising , public communications and outreach , and evaluation services to gauge the campaign 's effectiveness . the prime contractors also acquired additional specialized expertise from 102 subcontractors . some of the specific tasks performed by the contractors and their subcontractors included conducting qualitative and quantitative research for advertising creation , working with the entertainment industry to portray the negative consequences of drug use in television and movies , and conducting an evaluation intended to measure the effectiveness of the media campaign . based on our analysis of contracts covering fiscal years 2002 through 2004 , we estimated that $ 520 million was awarded to the four prime contractors , of which an estimated $ 373 million -- 72 percent -- was committed to purchasing media time and space for campaign advertisements . the remaining $ 147 million -- 28 percent -- was for the services provided by the prime contractors . contractors , in turn , awarded $ 14 million of that amount to their subcontractors .
