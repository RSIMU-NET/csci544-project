in the 2010 decennial census , the census bureau counted the total population of the united states . this included , as in previous censuses , all u.s. citizens , lawfully present aliens , and unauthorized aliens . some have suggested excluding aliens , particularly those who are in the country unlawfully , from the census count , in part so that they would not be included in the data used to apportion house seats among the states and determine voting districts within them . one question raised by this idea is whether the exclusion of aliens could be done by amending the federal census statutes , or whether such action would require an amendment to the constitution . the constitution requires a decennial census to determine the `` actual enumeration '' of the `` whole number of persons '' in the united states . the data must be used to apportion the house seats among the states , although there is no constitutional requirement it be used to determine intrastate districts . it appears the term `` whole number of persons '' is broad enough to include all individuals , regardless of citizenship status , and thus would appear to require the entire population be included in the apportionment calculation . as such , it appears a constitutional amendment would be necessary to exclude any individuals from the census count for the purpose of apportioning house seats . from time to time , congress has considered legislation that would exclude all aliens or prevent only unauthorized aliens from being included in the census for purposes of apportioning house seats among the states . such legislation would have either amended the census clause of the constitution or enacted or amended federal census statutes . although such legislation has yet to be introduced in the 112th congress , in the 111th congress , legislation was introduced that used both approaches . the fairness in representation act would have statutorily excluded aliens from the population count for apportionment purposes ( h.r . 3797 and s. 1688 ) . under the above analysis , it would not appear to be constitutionally sufficient for congress to amend the federal census statutes in such manner . meanwhile , h.j.res . 11 would take the other approach and amend the constitution so that only u.s. citizens would be counted in the apportionment calculation . other legislation in the 111th congress would not have raised the same constitutional issues since it would not appear to require the exclusion of any individuals for apportionment purposes . an amendment introduced by senator vitter to the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2010 ( s.amdt . 2644 to h.r . 2847 ) , would have cut off funding for the census unless the census form included questions regarding citizenship and immigration status . the amendment was subsequently ruled to be non - germane . on the other side of the issue , the every person counts act ( h.r . 3855 ) would have prohibited the census bureau from asking about u.s. citizenship or immigration status .
