nanotechnology — a term encompassing nanoscale science , engineering , and technology — is focused on understanding , controlling , and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers . a key issue before congress regarding nanotechnology is how best to protect human health , safety , and the environment as nanoscale materials and products are researched , developed , manufactured , used , and discarded . while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believed by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits , some research results have raised concerns about the potential adverse environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) implications of nanoscale materials . some have described nanotechnology as a two - edged sword . on the one hand , some are concerned that nanoscale particles may enter and accumulate in vital organs , such as the lungs and brains , potentially causing harm or death to humans and animals , and that the diffusion of nanoscale particles in the environment might harm ecosystems . on the other hand , some believe that nanotechnology has the potential to deliver important ehs benefits such as reducing energy consumption , pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions ; remediating environmental damage ; curing , managing , or preventing diseases ; and offering new safety - enhancing materials that are stronger , self - repairing , and able to adapt to provide protection . stakeholders generally agree that concerns about potential detrimental effects of nanoscale materials and devices — both real and perceived — must be addressed to protect and improve human health , safety , and the environment ; enable accurate and efficient risk assessment , risk management , and cost - benefit trade - offs ; foster innovation and public confidence ; and ensure that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnology may offer . congressionally - mandated reviews of the national nanotechnology initiative ( nni ) by the national research council and the president 's council of advisors on science and technology have concluded that additional research is required to make a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials .
