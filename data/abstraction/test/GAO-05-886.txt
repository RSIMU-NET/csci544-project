between 2002 and 2012 nearly 850,000 jobs will open in the construction industry ; experts predict that there will not be enough skilled workers to fill them . this has heightened concerns about program outcomes and program quality in the nation 's apprenticeship system and the u.s. department of labor 's oversight of it . gao assessed the extent to which labor monitors registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , its oversight activities in states that do their own monitoring , and the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored by employers and unions in relation to programs sponsored by employers alone . labor 's monitoring of programs it directly oversees has been limited . we found that in 2004 labor reviewed only 4 percent of programs in the 23 states where it has direct oversight . according to federal program directors in those states , limited staff constrained their ability to do more reviews . also , labor has focused in recent years on registering new programs and recruiting apprentices . although labor collects much data about the programs it oversees , it has not employed its database to generate information indicative of program performance , such as completion rates , that might allow it to be more efficient in its oversight . labor does not regularly review council - monitored states or collect data from them that would allow for a national picture of apprenticeships . labor is responsible for conducting formal reviews of the 27 states and the district of columbia that established apprenticeship councils to monitor their own apprenticeship programs ; but , according to directors in these states , the reviews have been infrequent and not necessarily useful . while labor collects only aggregate data on apprentices from these states , we identified 10 states with large numbers of apprentices that were willing and capable of providing gao data on apprentices by occupation as well as some information on completion rates , completion times , and wages . data in labor 's apprenticeship database and from council - monitored states show that completion rates and wages for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions were higher than those for programs sponsored by employers alone . we found that completion rates for apprentices in programs jointly sponsored by unions and employers were 47 percent on average compared with 30 percent in programs sponsored solely by employers . completion rates declined under both types of sponsorship for the period we examined , but labor , as part of its oversight , does not track reasons for noncompletion , making it difficult to determine what lies behind this trend .
