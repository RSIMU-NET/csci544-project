the military 's ability to carry out its mission depends on its having adequate supplies of spare parts on hand for maintenance and repairs . shortages are a key indicator that the billions of dollars being spent on these parts are not being used effectively , efficiently , and economically . despite additional funding from congress , the army still has concerns about spare parts shortages . spare parts shortages for the apache , blackhawk , and chinook helicopters have harmed operations and lowered morale among maintenance personnel . cannibalization of parts from one aircraft to another is an inefficient practice that results in double work for the maintenance personnel , masks parts shortages , and lowers morale . parts were unavailable for various reasons , including higher - than - expected demand for parts , delays in obtaining parts from contractors , and problems with overhaul and maintenance . another factor contributing to the shortage was the army 's inability to obtain parts for these aging aircraft from the original manufacturers , which sometimes had gone out of business . the army and the defense logistics agency have efforts planned or underway to improve the availability of aviation spare parts . once these initiatives are further along , gao will review them to determine whether they can be enhanced .
