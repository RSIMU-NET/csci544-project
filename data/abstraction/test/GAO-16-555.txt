human trafficking — the exploitation of a person typically through force , fraud , or coercion for such purposes as forced labor , involuntary servitude or commercial sex — is occurring in the united states . congress has passed multiple laws to help ensure punishment of traffickers and protection of victims . doj and the department of homeland security lead federal investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes . the departments of defense , labor , and state , and the equal employment opportunity commission investigate trafficking related offenses under certain circumstances , and take further action , as appropriate . doj and hhs award grants to fund victim service programs . the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 includes a provision for gao to review law enforcement efforts and grant programs to combat human trafficking and assist victims in the united states . this report discusses federal efforts to assess prevalence of human trafficking challenges agencies face in investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases , and 3 ) federal grants and steps taken to prevent duplication . gao reviewed trafficking data and agency documents , and conducted 32 interviews with federal , state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors in four jurisdictions . we selected these jurisdictions based on the number of human trafficking tips they received , receipt of human trafficking task force funding and geographic variation . these officials ' perspectives can not be generalized to all jurisdictions but they provide insights into anti - trafficking efforts . federal agencies have begun efforts to assess the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states and develop data standards and definitions to help facilitate prevalence studies . for example , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is sponsoring the human trafficking data collection project , which seeks to inform the development of an integrated data collection platform regarding human trafficking victimization , establish baseline knowledge of human trafficking and victim needs , and support effective prevention and intervention responses . hhs , in consultation with key stakeholders , has developed draft data fields and definitions for human trafficking and expects to begin piloting the data collection effort in fall 2016. further , the national institute of justice , within the department of justice ( doj ) , has awarded grants for the development and testing of methodologies that could be used to estimate the prevalence of human trafficking . federal , state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors gao interviewed reported that investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases is challenging for multiple reasons , including a lack of victim cooperation , limited availability of services for victims , and difficulty identifying human trafficking . officials told us that obtaining the victim 's cooperation is important because the victim is generally the primary witness and source of evidence ; however , obtaining and securing victims ' cooperation is difficult , as victims may be unable or unwilling to testify due to distrust of law enforcement or fear of retaliation by the trafficker . according to these officials , victim service programs , such as those that provide mental health and substance abuse services , have helped improve victim cooperation ; however , the availability of services is limited . further , officials reported that identifying and distinguishing human trafficking from other crimes such as prostitution can be challenging . federal , state , and local agencies have taken or are taking actions to address these challenges , such as increasing the availability of victim services through grants and implementing training and public awareness initiatives . gao identified 42 grant programs with awards made in 2014 and 2015 that may be used to combat human trafficking or to assist victims of human trafficking , 15 of which are intended solely for these purposes . although some overlap exists among these human trafficking grant programs , federal agencies have established processes to help prevent unnecessary duplication . for instance , in response to recommendations in a prior gao report , doj requires grant applicants to identify any federal grants they are currently operating under as well as federal grants for which they have applied . in addition , agencies that participate in the grantmaking committee of the senior policy operating group are encouraged to share grant solicitations and information on proposed grant awards , allowing other agencies to comment on proposed grant awards and determine whether they plan to award funding to the same organization .
