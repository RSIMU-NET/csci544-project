the community development financial institutions ( cdfi ) fund in the department of the treasury has awarded $ 21 billion of the $ 26 billion in new markets tax credits ( nmtc ) authorized to be awarded to community development entities ( cde ) between 2001 and 2009. cdes use the nmtc to make qualified investments in low - income communities . recent congressional interest has focused on participation by minority cdes . this testimony is based on a recent gao report ( gao - 09-536 ) . as requested , the report identified the number of minority and non - minority cdes that applied to the cdfi fund and received nmtc awards , explained the process by which the cdfi fund makes awards and summarized application scores , described challenges minority and non - minority cdes face in applying for and receiving awards and , identified efforts the cdfi fund and others have taken to assist minority cdes in applying for awards . gao analyzed cdfi fund application data and interviewed officials from minority and non - minority cdes , the cdfi fund , and industry groups . from 2005 through 2008 , minority - owned cdes were successful with about 9 percent of the nmtc applications that they submitted to the cdfi fund and received about $ 354 million of the $ 8.7 billion for which they applied , or about 4 percent . non - minority cdes were successful with about 27 percent of their applications and received $ 13.2 billion of the $ 89.7 billion for which they applied , or about 15 percent . since gao issued the report on which this statement is based , the cdfi fund made 32 nmtc awards totaling $ 1.5 billion under authority provided in the american recovery and reinvestment act . minority cdes received 3 of those awards , totaling $ 135 million . the cdfi fund relies primarily on its scoring of applications to determine which cdes receive awards . as the figure shows , minority cdes received lower scores than non - minority cdes in each of the four application sections . although a cde 's resources and experience in applying are important factors in a cde 's success rate with the nmtc program , when controlling for factors that gao could measure , minority status is associated with a lower probability of receiving an allocation . it is not clear from gao 's analysis why this relationship exists or whether any actions taken or not taken by the department of the treasury contributed to minority cdes ' lower probability of success . characteristics associated with minority status of some cdes for which data are unavailable may affect this relationship . if congress views increased participation by minority cdes as a goal for the nmtc program , options , such as providing certain preferences in the application process that may benefit minority cdes , could be considered . the cdfi fund provides assistance that is available to all cdes applying for awards , including a written debriefing to cdes that do not receive awards detailing some of the weaknesses in the applications . other stakeholders , including industry associations and consultants , hold conferences and offer services to help cdes submit competitive applications . should congress view additional assistance to minority cdes as important to increasing minority cdes ' participation in the nmtc program , it could consider requiring the cdfi fund to provide assistance to minority cdes .
