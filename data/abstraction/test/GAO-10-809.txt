the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) , estimated to cost $ 862 billion over 10 years , is intended to stimulate the economy and create jobs . the recovery act provides funds to federal agencies and states , which in turn may award contracts to private companies and other entities to carry out the purposes of the recovery act . contracts using recovery act funds are required to be awarded competitively to the maximum extent practicable . gao was asked to examine the use and oversight of noncompetitive recovery act contracts at the federal and state levels . gao determined the extent that federal contracts were awarded noncompetitively ; the reasons five selected federal agencies ( the departments of defense , energy , and health and human services ; the national aeronautics and space administration ; and the small business administration ( sba ) ) awarded noncompetitive contracts ; the oversight these agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) provide for recovery act contracts ; and the level of insight five selected states ( california , colorado , florida , new york , and texas ) have into the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts . more than two - thirds of the $ 26 billion obligated for recovery act federal contract actions through may 2010 were on contracts that were in place before the enactment of the recovery act . most of these contracts had been awarded competitively . for new federal recovery act contract actions , 89 percent of the dollars were obligated on competed actions . most of the recovery act dollars obligated noncompetitively on new contract actions went to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses under sba 's 8 program . the goal of using recovery act funds quickly on high - priority projects drove the contracting approaches of the five federal agencies , particularly their use of existing contracts . officials explained that whether an existing contract had been competed originally did not influence the decision to use a pre - existing contract because the level of competition had been established before recovery act funds were available . the selected federal agencies implemented additional review processes , internal reporting , and coordination efforts for the recovery act . some igs for these agencies focused initial recovery act oversight on areas the igs considered to be higher risk than contracts , such as grant programs . the ig reviews to date have not focused specifically on contracting , including the use of noncompetitive awards to 8 program businesses . gao 's recent reviews of the 8 program , however , have found that safeguards for ensuring that only eligible firms receive 8 contracts may not be working as intended . the five states varied on the type and amount of data routinely collected on noncompetitive recovery act contracts . gao could not determine the full extent to which such contracts are being used . the states generally rely on their pre - recovery act contracting policies and procedures , which generally require competition . the states do not routinely provide state - level oversight of contracts awarded at the local level , where a portion of recovery act contracting occurs . officials from the selected states ' audit organizations said that if they were to address recovery act contracting issues , it could be done through the annual single audit or other reviews of programs that involve recovery act funds . gao recommends that the five igs assess the need to allocate audit resources to noncompetitive 8 recovery act contracts . the igs concurred or had no comment .
