this crs report analyzes the security implications of taiwan 's presidential election of march 22 , 2008. this analysis draws in part from direct information gained through a visit to taiwan to observe the election and to discuss views with a number of interlocutors , including those advising or aligned with president chen shui - bian and president - elect ma ying - jeou . this crs report will discuss the results of taiwan 's presidential election and symbolic yet sensitive referendums on u.n. membership , outlook for taiwan 's stability and policies , implications for u.s. security interests , and options for u.s. policymakers in a window of opportunity . this report will not be updated . the united states positioned two aircraft carriers near taiwan . thus , there was u.s. relief when the referendums , as targets of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) 's condemnation , failed to be valid . kuomintang ( kmt ) candidate ma ying - jeou won with a surprising and solid margin of victory ( 17 percent ; 2.2 million votes ) , against democratic progressive party ( dpp ) candidate frank hsieh . the near - term outlook for taiwan 's future is positive for stability and in policy - making on defense . however , in the longer term , the question of taiwan 's identity and sovereignty as separate from the prc remains unsettled . moreover , the people 's liberation army ( pla ) has continued to build up its forces that threaten taiwan , raising the issue of whether the military balance already has shifted to favor the prc . the results of march 22 sapped the prc 's alarmist warnings about the election and referendums , although it might still warn about instability until the inauguration on may 20 while chen is still president . nevertheless , cross - strait tension is greatly reduced . chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition . ma is less provocative towards beijing than chen . ma gives pro - u.s. assurances . there is future uncertainty , however , as the kmt could choose to accommodate beijing , challenge beijing , or seek a bipartisan consensus on national security . in one view , there is an opportunity to turn u.s. attention from managing the cross - strait situation to more urgent priorities that require the prc 's improved cooperation , such as dealing with nuclear proliferation in north korea and iran , the crisis in darfur in sudan , repression in burma , the crackdown in tibet , etc . alternatively , a window of opportunity is presented for the first time in years to take steps to sustain u.s. interests in security and stability in the taiwan strait . considerations include whether to counter perceptions in beijing of `` co - management '' with washington and rising expectations about u.s. concessions to prc demands , notions denied by the administration . an issue for policymakers is what approach to take in a window of opportunity . u.s. policymakers have various options to : continue the existing approach ; engage with president - elect ma ( including a possible u.s. visit before his inauguration ) ; strengthen ties for taiwan 's military , political , and economic security ( including a possible consideration of its request for f - 16c / d fighters ) ; promote a new cross - strait dialogue ; and conduct a strategic review of policy toward taiwan .
