gao discussed the capability of u.s. forces to fight and survive chemical and biological warfare . gao noted that : none of the army 's crisis - response or early - deployment units have complied with requirements for stocking equipment critical for fighting under chemical or biological warfare ; the department of defense ( dod ) has established two joint service groups to prioritize chemical and biological defense research efforts , develop a modernization plan , and develop support plans ; although dod has begun to field a biological agent detection system , it has not successfully fielded other needed equipment and systems to address critical battlefield deficiencies ; ground forces are inadequately trained to conduct critical tasks related to biological and chemical warfare , and there are serious weaknesses at all levels in chemical and biological defense skills ; medical units often lack the equipment and training needed to treat casualties resulting from chemical or biological contamination ; dod has inadequate stocks of vaccines for known threat agents and not implemented the immunization policy established in 1993 ; and the primary cause of these deficiencies is a lack of emphasis along the dod command chain , with dod focusing its efforts and resources on other priorities .
