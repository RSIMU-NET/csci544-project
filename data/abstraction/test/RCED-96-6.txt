pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the formula for distributing federal highway funds , focusing on the : relevancy of the data used for the formula ; major funding objectives implicit in the formula ; and implications of alternative formula factors for achieving these objectives . gao found that : the federal highway funding formula is complex and cumbersome ; the underlying data and factors used in the formula are to a large extent irrelevant , since funding outcomes are essentially predetermined ; annual combined funding for the four largest highway programs is fixed throughout the 6-year life of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) ; some of the factors used in formula calculations are based on outdated information , are unresponsive to changing conditions , and often do not reflect the highway system 's utilization ; equity adjustments increase many states ' final funding levels ; funding for demonstration projects is not determined by formula ; istea objectives include maintaining and improving the highway infrastructure , returning highway trust funds to the states where the revenue was generated , advancing selected goals , and safeguarding the states ' historical funding shares ; and a combination of objectives based on states ' needs and resources could form the basis for a new formula , but any new formula is likely to change the states ' highway funding levels .
