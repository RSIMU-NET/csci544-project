economic conditions in china are of considerable concern to u.s. policymakers , given the potential impact of china's economy on the global and u.s. economy .
analysts point to two key factors: ( 1 ) the relative interest rates in china and the united states ; and ( 2 ) expectations of the future appreciation in the value of china's currency , the renminbi ( rmb ) .
the recent large inflow of financial capital into china , commonly referred to as "hot money," has led some economists to warn that such flows may have a destabilizing effect on china's economy .
there is no formal definition of "hot money," but the term is most commonly used in financial markets to refer to the flow of funds ( or capital ) from one country to another in order to earn a short - term profit on interest rate differences and / or anticipated exchange rate shifts .
in addition , china might reduce its purchases of u.s. treasury securities ( used to help fund the federal deficit ) , which could push up u.s. interest rates .
in 2007 , china surpassed japan to become the 3 rd largest u.s. export market , and thus a chinese slowdown could reduce its demand for u.s. goods and services .
the issues concerning the potential dangers of "hot money" flows to china reinforces the u.s. argument ( and has been acknowledged by the chinese government as a long term goal ) , that china needs to do more to implement policies to encourage domestic demand and lessen its dependence on exporting and fixed investment for its economic growth .
other economists have expressed concerns that efforts by the chinese government to control "hot money" inflows could have significant negative consequences for the u.s. and global economy in the form of slower growth , greater inflation , or both .
one common way of approximating the flow of "hot money" is to subtract a nation's trade surplus ( or deficit ) and its net flow of foreign direct investment ( fdi ) from the change in the nation's foreign reserves .
over the past few years , china has been one of the fastest growing economies , which has made it a major market for u.s. exports .
the u.s. federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate nine times over the last year from a high of 5.25% in june 2007 to its current low of 2.00% .
additionally , inflationary problems or an economic slowdown could cause chinese officials to delay economic reforms , particularly to its financial system and currency policy .
there are also indications that "hot money" flows have played a role in the recent rise and fall of china's stock and real estate markets .
for the first half of 2008 , china's foreign reserves increased by $280.6 billion .
over the same time period , china's accumulated trade surplus was $99.0 billion and its fdi inflow was $52.0 billion .
in an op - ed column in the financial times , two china experts wrote of hot money's "ensuing money creation is fueling rising inflation , systemic overinvestment , and an overextended banking system. .
