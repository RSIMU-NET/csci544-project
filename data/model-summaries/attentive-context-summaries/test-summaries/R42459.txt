it was not until the 1980s that congress took an alternative approach to agricultural conservation through enactment of the food security act of 1985 ( p.l .
the bill's more publicized provisions — the conservation reserve program ( crp ) , highly erodible land conservation ( sodbuster ) , and wetland conservation ( swampbuster ) — remain significant today .
compliance violations related to the loss of federal crop insurance premium subsidies now have separate considerations from violations related to the loss of other farm program benefits .
the latter two "conservation compliance" provisions require that in exchange for certain u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) program benefits , a producer agrees to maintain a minimum level of conservation on highly erodible land and not to convert wetlands to crop production .
f ederal policies and programs traditionally have offered voluntary incentives to producers to plan and apply resource - conserving practices on private lands .
the agricultural act of 2014 ( 2014 farm bill , p.l .
99-198 , 1985 farm bill ) .
113-79 ) added federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands .
as the 114 th congress continues to review the implementation of farm programs , issues related to conservation compliance could be debated .
since its introduction in the 1985 farm bill , conservation compliance has remained a controversial issue .
the 2014 farm bill also extended limited protection for native sod in select states .
these environmental gains appear to be leveling off , however , and raise questions about conservation compliance's ability to further conservation goals .
how compliance is calculated , where compliance provisions apply , and traditional exemptions and variances were not amended .
the 1985 farm bill created the highly erodible land conservation and wetland conservation compliance provisions , which tied various farm program benefits to conservation standards .
similar to previous farm bills , the changes to conservation compliance in the 2014 farm bill debate were controversial .
the highly erodible land conservation provision ( sodbuster ) introduced in the 1985 farm bill was not intended to "allow the federal government to impose demands on any farmer or rancher concerning what may be done with their land ; ... only that the federal government will no longer subsidize producers who choose to convert highly erodible land to cropland unless they also agree to install conservation system ( s ) . .
most producers prefer voluntary financial incentive programs such as eqip , to policies such as conservation compliance , which discourages the degradation of private lands by restricting access to other federal benefits .
as congress evaluates the implementation of the 2014 farm bill , conservation compliance might continue to generate interest .
these provisions have been amended with each subsequent farm bill , including the most recent 2014 farm bill .
similarly , the wetland conservation provision introduced in the 1985 farm bill does not authorize usda "to regulate the use of private , or non - federal land" ; rather , "the objective of this provision is to deny various federal benefits to those producers who choose to drain wetlands for the purpose of producing agricultural commodities. .
