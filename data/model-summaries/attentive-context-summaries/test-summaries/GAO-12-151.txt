in response to the crisis , congress passed the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) in 2010 , which includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial services firms and consolidate certain consumer protection responsibilities in the bureau of consumer financial protection ( cfpb ) .
the dodd - frank act requires or authorizes various federal agencies to issue hundreds of regulations to implement its reforms .
our objectives in this report were to examine ( 1 ) the regulatory analyses , including benefit - cost analyses , federal financial regulators have performed to assess the potential impact of selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; ( 2 ) how federal financial regulators consulted with each other in implementing selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the impact of the final dodd - frank act regulations .
the crisis threatened the stability of the u.s. financial system and the solvency of some large financial institutions , prompting the u.s. government to take extraordinary steps to moderate the adverse economic impacts .
as agencies have turned their attention to developing and implementing these regulations , some industry associations and others have raised concerns about the potential impact of the regulations , individually and cumulatively , on financial markets and both financial and nonfinancial institutions .
specifically , we are directed to analyze ( 1 ) the impact of regulations on the financial marketplace , including whether relevant federal agencies are applying sound benefit - cost analysis in promulgating rules ; ( 2 ) efforts to avoid duplicative or conflicting rulemakings , information requests , and examinations ; and ( 3 ) other related matters that we deem to be appropriate .

this report does not independently assess the impact of the dodd - frank act regulations because ( 1 ) most of the required regulations have not been finalized or the effective dates of finalized rules have not been reached or ( 2 ) for the final regulations that have reached their effective dates , adequate time has not elapsed to assess their impacts .
however , this executive order does not apply to independent regulatory agencies , including the banking , futures , and securities regulators ( i.e. , federal financial regulators ) .
agencies can anticipate and evaluate the consequences of their regulations through regulatory analysis .
to maximize the usefulness of the required retrospective reviews , we recommend that the federal financial regulatory agencies develop plans that determine how they will measure the impact of dodd - frank act regulations â€” for example , determining how and when to collect , analyze , and report needed data .
such planning efforts are important to help ensure that fsoc can not only accurately measure the impact of significant dodd - frank act regulations but also efficiently coordinate with its members to leverage their retrospective reviews .
