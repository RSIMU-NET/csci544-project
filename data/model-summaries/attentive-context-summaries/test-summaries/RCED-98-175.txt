motor vehicles are responsible for up to half of the emissions of volatile organic compounds ( voc ) that affect ozone levels and up to 90 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions found in urban areas .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the progress made by the 23 states that are required to implement enhanced i&m programs , including the difficulties that the states have encountered , and ( 2 ) the impact that delays in implementing enhanced i&m programs may have on the states' ability to comply with the national air quality standard for ozone .
although the united states has significantly improved its air quality since the 1970s , air pollution problems , such as ozone and carbon monoxide , continue to threaten the health of millions of americans .
101-549 , nov. 15 , 1990 ) requires the states with the most serious ozone and carbon monoxide problems — 23 states have been identified — to implement enhanced inspection and maintenance ( i&m ) programs to reduce the emissions from motor vehicles .
however , in november 1992 , despite this requirement , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a regulation that postponed the required implementation date until january 1995 .
because of concerns about the implementation of the enhanced i&m programs , you asked us to determine the status of the states' programs .
title i of the clean air act amendments of 1990 ( p.l .
under the amendments , these states were required to have their programs implemented by november 1992 .
in view of the pivotal role that enhanced i&m programs play in reducing voc emissions and the delays experienced to date in implementing these programs , as well as the possibility of future delays , we recommend that the administrator of epa compile information on the more successful practices , such as public relations campaigns , used by the states that have implemented their enhanced i&m programs and share the information with those states that are in the early stages of developing and implementing their programs .
in order to address these issues , we used a mail survey to obtain information from the 23 states .
i&m programs test vehicles' emissions to ensure that the vehicles are adequately maintained and working properly .
if the vehicles pass these tests , they are assumed not to be emitting excessive amounts of vocs and carbon monoxide .
we also met with officials from epa's program and regional offices , as well as with officials from two states , to discuss the implementation of the enhanced i&m programs .
 ( app .
however , obtaining the required reductions from other sources will be difficult because many of them , especially stationary sources , have already made major reductions in their voc emissions , and any further reductions may be costly and take some time to achieve .
while enhanced i&m programs are an integral part of the effort to significantly reduce emissions from motor vehicles , states' efforts to implement their programs have been slow and troubled by numerous delays .
eight of the 23 states took advantage of the flexibility allowed by the revised regulation by implementing less stringent enhanced programs .
