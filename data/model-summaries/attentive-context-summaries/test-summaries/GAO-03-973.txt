the federal home loan bank system's ( fhlbank system ) traditional cooperative approach to providing housing and community finance through 12 regionally based federal home loan banks ( fhlbank ) faces continual challenges due to consolidation in the financial services industry and the emergence of mortgage lenders with nationwide operations .
specifically , you asked that we 1. describe the laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that fhlbanks can offer on advances ; 2. provide information on whether key differences exist in current advance pricing and other terms across the fhlbanks ; 3. determine whether holding companies face any legal or regulatory barriers in transferring assets among subsidiaries who are members of different fhlbank districts ; and 4. describe fhfb's safety and soundness oversight of the fhlbanks' advance pricing practices and review selected data that fhfb collects to monitor safety and soundness practices within the fhlbank system .
thus , these bank and thrift holding companies may , in effect , have access ( through their subsidiaries ) to advances from multiple fhlbanks .
recently , these concerns have been heightened as the federal housing finance board ( fhfb ) , the fhlbank system's financial regulator , has analyzed the benefits and costs associated with potential changes to the system's membership requirements that would allow financial organizations to join more than one fhlbank district ( these potential changes to the system's membership rules are commonly referred to as multidistrict membership ) .
traditionally , each fhlbank made loans , known as advances , that were secured by eligible collateral ( e.g. , single family mortgage loans ) to member institutions — particularly thrifts — located in its district to support housing finance .
as discussed with your staff , our report objectives are to ( 1 ) describe the laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that fhlbanks can offer on advances ; ( 2 ) provide information on whether key differences exist in current advance pricing and other terms across the fhlbanks ; ( 3 ) determine whether holding companies face any legal or regulatory barriers in transferring assets among subsidiaries who are members of different fhlbank districts ; and ( 4 ) describe fhfb's safety and soundness oversight of the fhlbanks' advance pricing practices and review selected data that fhfb collects to monitor the safety and soundness of the fhlbank system .
as discussed with your staff , this report provides an overview of advance term pricing requirements and practices within the fhlbank system that could be useful in assessing the extent of current competition among the fhlbanks and the potential competitive impacts of multidistrict membership .
to address these objectives , we obtained and reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations pertaining to the terms that the fhlbanks can offer on advances .
supporters of multidistrict membership believe that it is necessary to modernize the fhlbank system's structure , while critics believe that multidistrict membership would increase the potential for dangerous competition between the fhlbanks .
we also interviewed the 12 fhlbank presidents , credit and collateral staff from 7 of the 12 fhlbanks , and fhfb officials .
we sent a set of structured questions to each of the 12 banks and reviewed their credit and collateral policies .
