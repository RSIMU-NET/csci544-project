the department of transportation's ( dot ) federal highway administration ( fhwa ) provides about $40 billion each year to states to build , improve , and preserve the nation's road and bridge infrastructure through the federal - aid highway program .
this report examines ( 1 ) how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges , and ( 2 ) how state agencies regulate oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges .
to improve stewardship over the nation's highways and bridges , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the fhwa administrator to take the following action: conduct a study on state oversize - and overweight - permitting practices , including automated vehicle routing and escort driver certification , to identify areas of best practice and share the results with states .
the bridge repair cost $8.5 million in federal - aid highway funds .
this report examines ( 1 ) how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges and ( 2 ) how state agencies regulate oversize vehicles and loads on highways and bridges .
a national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) investigation of the skagit river bridge collapse reported that differences among states and regions on the various aspects of truck permitting could be a safety concern .
while federal funding is provided to state and local governments to help improve highway infrastructure and support commercial vehicle safety activities , states own and maintain most of the nation's highways and bridges .
dot's federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) also provides over $300 million each year to state and local government agencies in grants for commercial motor vehicle safety activities .
as a part of that effort , states develop regulations for vehicle size and weight to be enforced in their state ( subject to certain federal limits ) and issue permits that allow motor carriers to operate oversize and overweight vehicles , for example to deliver manufactured housing or to move heavy construction equipment to a job site .
however , because fhwa does not collect information on state permitting , it is not in the best position to advise states on practices and requirements that could improve their performance .
we have identified key steps agencies can take to improve agency performance ; one of them includes identifying best practices to help identify changes that might be needed to improve performance .
a similar study related to state permitting practices and requirements could help identify best practices to assist states in making decisions on their permitting practices .
the joint explanatory statement accompanying the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 directed gao to review the oversight of oversize loads and the role of federal and state agencies in that process .
however , fhwa has authority to conduct transportation research , including research on issues with national implications that could lead to improvements in highway safety , and in the past has worked with the trucking industry and others to identify best practices for related issues such as escort vehicles .
this incident in washington not only injured three people but also disrupted traffic in an important freight corridor for nearly 4 weeks while the bridge was closed .
