we were asked to determine ( 1 ) to what extent people aged 55 and over are enrolled in federal employment and training programs and what services they receive , ( 2 ) how employment and training services are provided to older workers , and ( 3 ) how performance measures may have affected services for older workers .
to determine what employment and training services are provided to people aged 55 years and older ( older workers ) and how these services are provided , we surveyed responsible officials in each of the 50 states and washington , d.c. , and puerto rico , on states' services for older workers through several of the major federal employment and training efforts: ( 1 ) the workforce investment act ( 49 states responded ) , ( 2 ) the senior community service employment program ( 50 states responded ) , and ( 3 ) the trade adjustment assistance programs ( 48 states responded ) .
if the potential labor shortage is not addressed , the nation's productivity , growth , and international competitiveness could be threatened .
concerned that existing federal employment and training programs may not be oriented towards the needs of older workers , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which people aged 55 and older are enrolled in federal employment and training programs and what services they receive , ( 2 ) how employment and training services are provided to older workers , and ( 3 ) how performance measures may have affected services for older workers .
with the potential labor shortage and an aging population , increasing demands will be made on the workforce development system to help ensure that older workers are provided adequate opportunities to help address the anticipated labor shortage and meet employer needs for labor .
some economists predict that by 2030 , the nation could experience a labor shortage of 35 million workers .
these programs included the senior community service employment program , which primarily provides low - income older workers with subsidized employment in public agencies and nonprofit organizations ; the workforce investment act programs , which provide job search assistance and training to adults and individuals who have lost their jobs because of layoffs or plant closings ( dislocated workers ) ; and the trade adjustment assistance programs , which provide employment and training assistance for those individuals who have lost their jobs due to the adverse effects of international trade .
as the shortage approaches and labor markets begin to tighten , one option available to increase the labor supply is to encourage people to stay in the labor force beyond traditional retirement ages , especially because people who are age 55 or older will constitute nearly a third of the total population â€” an increase of 46 percent over three decades .
in light of concerns that older workers have unique employment characteristics that could adversely affect certain program outcomes and that older workers who need in - depth job search assistance and job training to remain in , or re - enter , the workforce may not receive such services , we recommend that the secretary of labor assess wia performance measures and make adjustments as necessary to eliminate the disincentive to enrolling older workers in wia .
