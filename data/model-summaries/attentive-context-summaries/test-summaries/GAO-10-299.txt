to meet urgent needs , the department of defense ( dod ) can authorize contractors to begin work and incur costs before reaching a final agreement on the contract terms and conditions â€” known as an undefinitized contract action ( uca ) .
to identify and assess the actions the department of defense ( dod ) has taken to improve departmental insight into and oversight of undefinitized contract actions ( uca ) , we interviewed senior dod and service acquisition policy officials as well as local officials at the selected commands to identify new policies and guidance that would affect the amount of insight senior dod officials have .
the act requires dod to issue guidance that would include ( 1 ) circumstances in which it is appropriate for dod to use ucas , ( 2 ) procedures for ensuring compliance with definitization timelines and obligation amounts , ( 3 ) procedures for compliance with regulatory limitations on profit or fee with respect to costs incurred prior to definitization , and ( 4 ) reporting requirements for ucas that fail to meet required timelines for definitization or regulatory limitations on the obligation of funds or on profit or fee .
in june 2007 , we reported that dod did not know the extent to which it was using ucas and identified the need to improve dod's ( 1 ) oversight of ucas , ( 2 ) ability to meet required definitization time frames , and ( 3 ) contracting officer documentation of the basis for negotiating contractor profit or fee .
the act also required us to assess the extent to which dod's guidance resulted in improvements to its insight and use of ucas .
in august 2008 , the department issued a policy memorandum on uca oversight and management , which required dod components to report semi - annually on contract actions with an estimated value exceeding $5 million to the office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology & logistics ( ousd ( at&l ) ) , defense procurement and acquisition policy .
accordingly , we assessed whether actions taken by dod have ( 1 ) improved departmental insight and oversight of uca use ; and ( 2 ) resulted in local commands meeting dod's uca management standards for documenting the basis for negotiating the contractor profit or fee , definitization time lines and obligation percentages , and the circumstances in which ucas are used .
this type of contract , however , poses risk to the taxpayer as contractors lack incentives to control costs while contract terms and conditions are negotiated and definitized .
further , despite dod's call for increased management attention of uca use at dod components , management standards and tools designed to help mitigate uca - related cost risk have not always been met or used .
the department reported $18 billion in potential obligations for undefinitized actions exceeding $5 million , during fiscal year 2008 .
in addition , the memorandum advised dod components to obligate funds for the undefinitized period consistent with the contractor's requirements for the anticipated undefinitized period and to comply with existing defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) policy on uca use .
dod has instituted policies and proposed additional changes intended to enhance its departmental insight and oversight of uca use .
