 ( recommendation 2 ) in addition , we are making 40 recommendations to 14 agencies to fully address the electronic recordkeeping requirements found in the managing government records directive and the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 in their policies and procedures .
specifically , we are making the following recommendations to nara: the archivist of the united states should 1. require small and micro agencies that were determined to be at high risk of not complying with statutory and regulatory records management requirements to develop plans and timelines to address their records management weaknesses ( recommendation 1 ) 2. monitor the agencies' progress towards these efforts on a regular basis .
of the 17 other agencies in our review , six agencies ( cfpb , commerce , nasa , nsf , opm , and the udall foundation ) concurred with our recommendations ; five agencies ( marine mammal commission , omb , ondcp , opic , and presidio trust ) did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with our recommendations ; and six agencies ( afrh , eac , fhfa , ftc , peace corps , and sigar ) stated that they had no comments on the report .
advances in technology and electronic communications , such as email , have transformed agency operations while creating new opportunities with respect to the effective management of agency records .
for example , these services can improve agency performance and promote openness and accountability through better documentation of agency actions and decisions .
while nara requires agencies to self - assess their records management programs annually , it does not ensure that agencies that scored poorly on their self - assessments develop a plan to improve their programs or monitor their progress in such efforts .
we requested comments on a draft of this report from nara and the 17 other agencies included in our review .
however , these services also pose risks to the adequate protection of government information and have radically increased the volume and diversity of information that federal agencies must manage .
our objectives were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) selected agencies' policies and procedures address electronic recordkeeping requirements in the managing government records directive and the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 and ( 2 ) nara assisted selected agencies in managing their electronic records .
specifically , many agencies did not address requirements related to electronic system and email implementation , including establishing controls for their electronic information systems , incorporating preservation considerations into systems , and issuing retention and management requirements for email .
however , while nara oversees the selected agencies' compliance through records management self - assessments , it has not ensured that the selected small and micro agencies that were at high risk of improper records management have developed plans to address weaknesses in their records management programs .
we are making 42 recommendations to 15 agencies .
the directive , the federal records act ( fra ) , nara regulations , and the presidential and federal records act amendments of 2014 ( fra amendments ) , require federal agencies to take specific actions to create , manage , and preserve federal records and provide a framework for managing electronic records .
