specifically , this report assesses ( 1 ) irs's overall approach to ensure that innocent spouse cases were being processed in a timely , accurate , and consistent manner ; ( 2 ) the adequacy of irs's procedures to transfer tax liabilities between taxpayers when relief was granted to one of the taxpayers ; and ( 3 ) irs's efforts to evaluate the usefulness of its innocent spouse program web site to taxpayers .
since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act ( restructuring act ) of 1998 , irs has received thousands of requests from taxpayers for innocent spouse relief .
irs's inability to provide timely responses to such requests has generated concerns among taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders .
under the internal revenue service's ( irs ) innocent spouse program , irs can relieve taxpayers of tax debts on the basis of equity considerations , such as not knowing that their spouse failed to pay taxes due .
because of your concerns about irs's growing inventory of unresolved innocent spouse cases and the timeliness of irs's case processing , you asked us to review irs's administration of the program .
this is true even though only one taxpayer may have earned the wages or income shown on the tax return .
by law , married persons who file joint tax returns are each fully responsible for the accuracy of the tax return and for the full tax liability .
it took irs about a year , on average , to completely process an innocent spouse case in fiscal year 2001 .
to address these objectives , we reviewed and analyzed innocent spouse program data from irs's innocent spouse tracking system ( ists ) and management reports , and we reviewed related policies , procedures , and guidance .
we interviewed irs officials responsible for managing the innocent spouse program as well as officials in irs's national taxpayer advocate service office and electronic tax administration office and in the u.s. department of the treasury's ( treasury ) office of chief counsel .
we focused on program operations that cover the period march 1999 through december 2001 , because this period best reflected the program's results after the restructuring act's changes and because it covers the period for which performance data were most recently available .
we reviewed reports by the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) and the taxpayer advocate that addressed innocent spouse issues .
appendix ii provides similar information on cases that were scheduled to be tried in the federal courts but were settled by treasury's office of chief counsel and irs's office of appeals .
you also asked us to provide information on the number and disposition of innocent spouse cases that federal courts recently litigated ; appendix i provides this information .
our scope and methodology are discussed in more detail in a separate section of this report .
the data were the most currently available when we performed our review .
however , the decline in cases received does not fully account for irs's progress in reducing its inventory of undecided cases .
to further assess the management of the program , we relied on our past reports on managing organizational performance , irs's guidance regarding performance management , and other management literature , including the government performance and results act .
