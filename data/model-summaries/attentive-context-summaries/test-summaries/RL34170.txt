the republic of yemen remains a country of concern to u.s. policy makers .
although yemen itself is a resource - poor nation , it is strategically located next to saudi arabia ( figure 1 ) , one of the world's major oil producers , and the bab al mandab strait , through which commercial oil tankers carry an estimated 3.4 million barrels per day ( 3.5% to 4% of the global oil supply ) .
its poverty has been exacerbated by the quadrupling of its population over the last 30 years .
yemen's 1,184-mile coastline abuts the red sea and the gulf of aden across from the horn of africa , which until recently had been a major area of somalia - based piracy .
issues such as terrorism and yemen's political stability are tied to broader questions regarding the country's long - term economic and environmental viability .
for more than a decade , u.s. officials and members of congress have been concerned with the threat of terrorism emanating from yemen and directed against the united states .
yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , an affiliate of al qaeda ( aq ) .
to date , the terrorist group has unsuccessfully attempted to target the united states at least three times ( in 2009 , 2010 , and 2012 ) using concealed explosive devices designed to destroy commercial aircraft or detonate inside parcel packages .
according to the 2014 united nations human development index , yemen ranks 154 out of 187 countries .
such dire socio - economic prospects , combined with yemen's proximity to both africa and arab gulf states , have made it a global transit and destination point for migrants and refugees .
the u.s. department of homeland security considers aqap to be the aq affiliate "most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the united states. .
agricultural development has been decimated by water shortages , political strife , and lack of investment , making the country dependent on food imports for up to 90% of basic staples .
the intelligence services of saudi arabia helped disrupt two of these plots .
in may 2014 , the world food program estimated that 10 million yemenis out of a total population of 25 million could be categorized as either severely food insecure or close to it .
in recent years , saudi authorities have begun deporting more and more yemeni workers , thus exacerbating bilateral tensions .
each year , thousands of asylum - seekers and economic migrants from somalia , ethiopia , and eritrea make what can be a perilous journey to yemen , where they either remain or seek passage to the wealthier gulf monarchies .
however , in yemen no one group , including the central government , has a monopoly on armed force ; various actors can act as "spoilers" to disrupt the system in pursuit of their own interests ( figure 2 ) ; and that dynamic played out throughout 2014 .
before that , the obama administration and other observers considered yemen to be one of the few relative arab spring "success stories" ; the government had new leadership ( president hadi ) and had managed to bring all the nation's political factions together under the rubric of the national dialogue conference ( ndc ) in an attempt to reach consensus on governance .
