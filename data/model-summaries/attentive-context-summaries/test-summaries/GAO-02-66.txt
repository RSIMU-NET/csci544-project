aliens apply to the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) for such benefits as naturalization , work authorization , and adjustment of status .
 ( 3 ) how does ins address its dual responsibility of timely application processing and the detection and deterrence of fraudulent applications ? .
and ( 4 ) what performance measures does ins have in place to gauge the results of its benefit fraud enforcement activities ? .
 ( 2 ) how do ins's policies , procedures , and information systems support its immigration benefit fraud investigations ? .
immigration benefit fraud involves attempts by aliens to obtain such benefits through illegal means ( e.g. , using fraudulent documents ) .
immigration benefit fraud is a significant problem that threatens the integrity of the legal immigration system .
specifically , this report addresses the following questions: ( 1 ) what does ins know about the nature and extent of immigration benefit fraud ? .
at your request , we reviewed available information on the nature and extent of immigration benefit fraud and assessed ins's efforts to address it .
in its fiscal year 2000 threat assessment , ins predicted that immigration benefit fraud would intensify as smugglers and criminal enterprises searched for other methods to bring illegal aliens into the united states .
to identify data that indicate the nature and extent of immigration benefit fraud , we reviewed immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) reports and studies , interviewed ins officials , and used information developed in our prior reports .
ins officials believe that the problem is pervasive and serious ; they also believe that some aliens are using the benefit application process to enable them to carry out illegal activities , such as crimes of violence , narcotics trafficking , and terrorism .
the priorities are to ( 1 ) identify and remove criminal aliens ; ( 2 ) deter , dismantle , and diminish smuggling of aliens ; ( 3 ) respond to community reports and complaints about illegal aliens ; ( 4 ) minimize immigration benefit fraud and document abuse ; and ( 5 ) block and remove employers' access to unauthorized workers .
ins's management of its benefit fraud enforcement activities has been fragmented and unfocused owing to several problems .
regardless of how ins is restructured , addressing the issues discussed in this report would require that enforcement and service delivery priorities be recognized .
to determine how ins's policies , procedures , and information systems support its immigration benefit fraud enforcement activities , we reviewed relevant laws and regulations ; ins threat assessments , interior enforcement strategy , policy guidance , and information system data ; and testimonies and other reports and documents .
specifically , any restructuring plan should address the need to coordinate the efforts of the investigation units in the district offices and service centers ; balance the responsibility for timely adjudication of immigration benefit applications and the need to detect and investigate fraudulent applications ; establish guidance for deciding which immigration fraud investigations to pursue ; track immigration benefit fraud investigations ; determine the optimum means of providing adjudicators with access to ins's databases ; and establish outcome - based performance measures .
recently , proposals have been offered that would separate ins functions into enforcement and service components .
