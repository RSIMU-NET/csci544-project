the social security administration ( ssa ) is the nation's largest provider of income assistance to individuals with disabilities , paying $91 billion in federal benefits to 11.4 million beneficiaries with a disability and their families in 2003 .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the status of ssa's process unification initiative , ( 2 ) ssa's assessments of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels , and ( 3 ) whether ssa's new proposal incorporates changes to improve consistency in decisions between adjudication levels .
state agencies called disability determination services ( dds ) decide whether claimants meet ssa's definition of disability by applying ssa's decision - making criteria .
however , ssa continues to face challenges in its efforts to provide consistent disability decisions .
these challenges , and others associated with modernizing its disability programs , contributed to our decision to include federal disability programs on our list of high - risk government programs .
ssa noted that it has made changes to address training needs that have been identified by its reviews .
use the information from these improved analyses to develop a more focused and effective strategy for ensuring uniform application of ssa's guidance and to improve the consistency of decisions .
each year , about 2.5 million people file claims with ssa for disability benefits .
to accomplish this , ssa should clarify guidance for making disability decisions and develop mandatory training for adjudicators on issues identified as contributing to inconsistency .
in september 2003 , ssa's commissioner unveiled a new proposal that laid out the vision of a long - term strategy for improving the disability decision - making process and helping people with disabilities return to work .
primarily , ssa took issue with: ( 1 ) our characterization of the agency's progress over the past several years in analyzing and reducing the inconsistency of decisions , ( 2 ) our recommendation that the agency incorporate multivariate analysis into its assessments , and ( 3 ) our finding that the agency has not acted on the results of its reviews of decisions .
ssa has partially implemented its process unification initiative .
partly on the basis of early studies of potential causes of inconsistent decisions , ssa included in its process unification initiative efforts to provide consistent guidance to all adjudicators , clarify policy , provide training , test potential process changes , and perform a new quality review of allowances decided by aljs .
ssa does not plan to implement its proposed changes before it has successfully implemented its accelerated electronic disability ( aedib ) system .
ssa also has not updated its more effective approach of analyzing its disability hearings quality review data to identify problem areas and help improve its understanding of the factors that may be contributing to inconsistency .
several of the changes in the new proposal are intended to improve the accuracy , timeliness , and consistency of decisions , such as having the dds decision makers more fully develop and document their decisions , providing for centralized quality review of all decisions , and providing both adjudication levels equal access to medical expertise .
in response to your interest in the effectiveness of ssa's past and future efforts to improve and assess the consistency of decisions between levels , we evaluated these agency efforts .
