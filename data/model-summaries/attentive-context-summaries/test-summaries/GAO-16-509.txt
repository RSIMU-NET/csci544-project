the objectives of this report are to assess ( 1 ) the extent to which lessons learned from implementing the interim cap goals were incorporated into the governance of the current cap goals ; ( 2 ) the extent to which gprama requirements for reporting on cap goal progress are included in the selected cap goal quarterly progress updates ; and ( 3 ) the initial reported progress in implementing the selected cap goals .
many of the results the federal government seeks to achieve require the coordinated effort of more than one federal agency , level of government , or sector .
effectively managing these government - wide efforts requires coordination between multiple federal agencies and transparent communications to the congress and decision makers about progress toward achieving results .
the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) established a framework and processes aimed at encouraging a more crosscutting and integrated approach to federal performance , and improving transparency and accountability for these efforts .
these tasks include protecting the nation's critical information systems , responding to public health emergencies , ensuring food safety , and better managing the risks of climate change .
further , to ensure that the federal government is achieving its crosscutting goals , both top leaders and agency managers must have accurate and reliable performance information to monitor and track the progress they are making on achieving their goals .
among other things , gprama requires the office of management and budget ( omb ) to coordinate with agencies to develop federal government priority goals ( known as cross - agency priority or cap goals ) — 4-year outcome - oriented goals covering a number of crosscutting mission areas — as well as goals to improve management across the federal government .
to assess the extent to which omb incorporated lessons learned from implementing the interim cap goals into governance for the current cap goals , we reviewed gprama , omb , and performance improvement council ( pic ) guidance for assessing and reporting cap goal progress , and relevant omb and agency documentation .
performance goals and measures allow cap goal teams and other stakeholders to track the progress they are making toward their goals and provide critical information on which to base decisions for improving programs or activities .
to improve the transparency of public reporting on cap goal progress , we recommend that the director of omb , working with the pic , take the following action: report on performance.gov the actions that cap goal teams are taking , or plan to take , to develop performance measures and quarterly targets .
the cap goals we reviewed are intended to drive progress in important and complex areas , such as improving information technology and customer service interactions across government , coordinating federal stem education efforts , and improving federal hiring practices .
further , omb and the pic's efforts to build the capacity of the cap goal teams to implement the goals has resulted in increased leadership attention and improved interagency collaboration for these goals .
we found that during the first two years of goal implementation , omb and cap goal teams made improvements to their quarterly progress updates by adding new performance measures , providing additional information on performance trends , and reporting on new prospects for performance improvement , among other improvements .
