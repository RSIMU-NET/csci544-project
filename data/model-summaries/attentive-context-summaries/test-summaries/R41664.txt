111-152 ) .
all references to aca in this report refer to the law as amended .
for more detailed information on aca's provisions , crs has produced a series of more comprehensive reports , which are available at http: / / www.crs.gov .
the report provides a brief summary of major aca provisions , implementation and oversight activities , and current legal challenges .
the hhs secretary is tasked with implementation and oversight of many of aca's key provisions .
the costs of expanding public and private health insurance coverage and other spending are offset by revenues from new taxes and fees , and by savings from payment and health care delivery system reforms designed to reduce spending on medicare and other federal health care programs .
the new law also expands eligibility for medicaid ; amends the medicare program in ways that are intended to reduce the growth in medicare spending ; imposes an excise tax on insurance plans found to have high premiums ; and makes numerous other changes to the tax code , medicare , medicaid , the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) , and many other federal programs .
the information provided in these reports ranges from broad overviews of aca provisions , such as the law's medicare provisions , to more narrowly focused topics , such as dependent coverage for children under age 26 .
other federal agencies , notably the internal revenue service ( irs ) , also have substantial regulatory and administrative responsibilities under the new law .
implementation of aca , which began upon the law's enactment in 2010 and will continue to unfold over the next few years , involves all the major health care stakeholders , including the federal and state governments , as well as employers , insurers , and health care providers .
it also established the health insurance reform implementation fund ( hirif ) and appropriated $1 billion to the fund to cover federal regulatory and other administrative costs associated with aca's implementation .
aca is projected to have a significant impact on federal spending and revenues .
the primary goal of aca is to increase access to affordable health insurance for the millions of americans without coverage and make health insurance more affordable for those already covered .
the law includes spending to subsidize the purchase of health insurance coverage through the exchanges , as well as increased outlays for the expansion of the medicaid program .
while most of the major provisions of the law do not take effect until 2014 , some provisions are already in place , with others to be phased in over the next few years .
finally , the law established many new grant programs and provided for each an authorization of appropriations , and reauthorized funding for numerous existing programs whose authorization of appropriations had expired .
