the existing federal - aid highway formula is the vehicle for distributing billions of dollars annually for highway construction and repair and related activities to the 50 states , the district of columbia , and puerto rico ( hereafter called the states , unless otherwise noted ) .
it also discusses the major funding objectives implicit in the formula and the implications of alternative formula factors for achieving these objectives .
in response to section 1098 of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 and following discussions with your offices , this report discusses the way the formula for distributing federal highway funds works and the relevancy of the data used for the formula .
istea authorized funding to sustain and enhance the nation's surface transportation infrastructure .
since the mid - 1980s , a number of organizations ( including gao ) have suggested fundamental changes in the formula for apportioning these federal - aid funds because of perceived problems with the formula , such as its reliance , at least in part , on outdated data .
previously , the federal - aid highway program had focused on completing and preserving the interstate highway system and on maintaining other federal - aid highways as well as bridges eligible for federal funds .
section 1098 of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 ( istea ) tasked gao with reviewing the process for distributing highway funds to the states .
we are sending copies of this report to the secretary of transportation ; the administrator , federal highway administration ; the heads of the state departments of transportation ; and other interested parties .
section 1098 of istea tasked us with reviewing the process for distributing highway funds to the states .
chapter 3 discusses a process by which the congress may reconsider the formula during the next reauthorization of the federal - aid highway program and comments on the advantages and disadvantages of several alternative formula options .
istea broadened the overall goals of surface transportation .
although similar factors have been applied in other programs , they have not been applied to highway programs in the past .
additionally , istea's emphasis is intermodal — providing links in a seamless intermodal network that will enhance economic growth , international competitiveness , and national security .
but fhwa did provide a report to the congress in 1994 that addresses measures for assessing how much of their available resources the states or local areas devote to surface transportation .
while these goals remain a part of the overall surface transportation program , istea broadened the goals and included new programs , planning processes , and management systems that are intended to help ensure that the states' transportation plans are intermodal ( that is , coordinate various modes of transportation ) , environmentally sound , and energy efficient .
for example , the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program ( cmaq ) directs funds to transportation projects in clean air nonattainment areas — areas that have not achieved federal standards for air quality .
istea expanded the use of equity adjustments for the apportionment of federal - aid funds among the states .
istea authorized approximately $120 billion for highway construction and repair and related activities over 6 years , emphasized quality - of - life and intermodal objectives , revamped major highway programs , and offered states and localities unprecedented opportunities to use federal highway and mass transit capital funds across modal lines .
