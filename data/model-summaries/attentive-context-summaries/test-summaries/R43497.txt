for these reasons , congress , through the clean air act ( caa ) has required emission standards for new automobiles since 1965 , and has amended these requirements on several occasions .
further , over the last five decades , the scientific understanding of the effects of air pollutants has led to a tightening of air quality standards .
the caa , as amended , requires the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to set national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for common pollutants from numerous and diverse sources , which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare .
despite nationwide reductions in each of these major air pollutants by over 50% since 1970 , air quality still fails to meet ambient standards in areas where about one - third of the nation's population lives .
the agency reports that in 2013 on - road vehicles accounted for about 34% of carbon monoxide emissions in the united states , 38% of nitrogen oxides , 12% of volatile organic compounds , and 3% of particulate matter .
since the 1960s , emission standards for motor vehicles , coupled with standards for the fuels they burn , have reduced emissions from new cars and trucks by at least 95% .
nevertheless , because there are more vehicles on the road , because they are being driven more miles , and because the average useful life of a car exceeds the statutorily defined "useful life" over which emission standards must be met , emissions from motor vehicles continue to be a major component of the nation's air pollution problems .
in sum , epa estimates the annual compliance cost of the overall program in 2030 would be approximately $1.5 billion ( $760 million for the vehicle program and $700 million for the fuel program ) , and the 2030 benefits would be between $6.7 billion and $19 billion , or 4.5 to 13 times greater than the costs of the program .
as with tier 2 , the tier 3 standards consider the vehicle and its fuel as an integrated system and include changes to both vehicle emission limits and fuel formulation rules , lowering the allowable sulfur content of gasoline .
more controversial has been the potential impact on the cost of gasoline .
the agency estimates that the annual monetized health benefits of the tier 3 standards in 2030 ( 2011$ ) would be between $7.4 billion and $19 billion , assuming a 3% discount rate ( or between $6.7 billion and $18 billion assuming a 7% discount rate ) .
the american petroleum institute contends that the tighter sulfur controls would impose almost $10 billion in refinery capital expenditures , create an annual compliance cost of $2.4 billion , increase gasoline manufacturing costs from 6 to 9 cents per gallon , and increase refinery ghg emissions by 1% .
epa contends that many variables determine the retail price of gasoline , including the price of crude oil on the global market , taxes , transportation costs , and distribution and marketing costs , as well as refinery costs .
as finalized , the tier 3 standards set requirements on tailpipe emissions for the sum of non - methane organic gases ( nmog ) and nitrogen oxides ( no x ) , presented as nmog+no x , and for particulate matter ( pm ) .
