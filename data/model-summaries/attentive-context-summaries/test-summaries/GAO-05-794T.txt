this opportunity has many related pieces: addressing our nation's large and growing long - term fiscal gap ; deciding on the appropriate role and size of the federal government — and how to finance that government — and bringing the wide array of federal activities into line with today's world .
more broadly , pension reform represents a real opportunity to address part of our long - term fiscal problems and reconfigure our retirement security systems to bring them into the 21st century .
the pbgc's situation is an excellent example of the need for the congress to reconsider the role of government organizations , programs , and policies in light of changes that have occurred since pbgc's establishment in 1974 .
we therefore must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that our government can respond to a range of current and emerging security , social , economic , and environmental changes and challenges .
pbgc's challenges bear many similarities to the challenges facing our social security system .
as a result , timely action to address both private pension and social security reform is needed .
both programs have adequate current revenues and assets to pay promised benefits for a number of years ; yet , both face large and growing accumulated deficits on an accrual basis .
continuing on our current unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security .
in pursuing such reforms , consideration should be given to the interactive effects of any such reforms and how they contribute to addressing our nation's large and growing fiscal challenge , key demographic , economic and workforce trends , and the economic security of americans in their retirement years .
to summarize our findings , while pension funding rules are intended to ensure that plans have sufficient assets to pay promised benefit to plan participants , significant vulnerabilities exist .
further , very few sponsors of underfunded plans were required to pay an additional funding charge ( afc ) , a funding mechanism designed to reduce severe plan underfunding .
although from 1995 to 2002 most of the 100 largest db plans annually had assets that exceeded their current liabilities , by 2002 over half of the 100 largest plans were underfunded , and almost one - fourth of plans were less than 90 percent funded .
our recent work on db pension funding rules provides important insights in understanding the problems facing pbgc and the db system .
further , because of leeway in the actuarial methodology and assumptions that sponsors may use to measure plan assets and liabilities , underfunding may actually have been more severe and widespread than reported .
finally , our analysis confirms the notion that plans sponsored by financially weak firms pose a particular risk to pbgc , as these plans were generally more likely to be underfunded , to be subject to an additional funding charge , and to use assumptions to minimize or avoid cash contributions than plans sponsored by stronger firms .
additionally , on average over 60 percent of sponsors of these plans made no annual cash contributions to their plans .
