the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) housing assistance programs in our scope include the three major rental assistance programs — housing choice voucher ( voucher ) , public housing , and project - based programs ( including the project - based section 8 , section 202 supportive housing for the elderly , and section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities programs ) .
the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) is the primary federal provider of rental housing assistance through its housing choice voucher , public housing , and project - based programs .
disproportionately large numbers of military veterans have appeared among the homeless population in recent years , raising concerns about the incomes and housing conditions of veterans who rent , rather than own , their homes .
according to the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , on any given night at least 194,000 veterans were homeless in fiscal year 2005 — about one - third of the adult homeless population — and many veteran renters could be on the verge of homelessness if they have low incomes or precarious living conditions in overcrowded or substandard housing .
the return of more veterans from service in iraq and afghanistan — some with significant physical and psychological challenges — could increase demand for affordable housing with supportive services such as mental health and substance abuse treatment .
as our report states , our reporting objectives addressed both of these issues: ( 1 ) how hud's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( that is , whether a person is a veteran or not ) and veteran - specific benefits in determining eligibility and subsidy amounts and ( 2 ) the extent to which phas and property owners participating in hud's rental assistance programs establish a veterans' preference in their administrative and tenant selection plans .
specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households ; ( 2 ) how hud's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( that is , whether a person is a veteran or not ) and veteran - specific benefits in determining eligibility and subsidy amounts ; ( 3 ) the extent to which phas and property owners participating in hud's rental assistance programs establish a veterans' preference in their administrative and tenant selection plans ; and ( 4 ) the extent to which hud's rental assistance programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005 .
however , neither the va nor other government agencies report information specifically on the housing conditions or housing costs of veterans who rent .
furthermore , how veteran / nonveteran status affects eligibility for hud programs is distinct from whether or not a preference is extended once eligibility has been established .
among veteran households with a disability , about 41,000 ( or 46 percent ) received assistance from vouchers .
to determine the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran households , we utilized the bureau of the census's ( census ) 2005 american community survey ( acs ) , which identified households' veteran status , income , and other demographic characteristics , in conjunction with hud's defined income categories — low ( 80 percent of ami or less ) , very low ( 50 percent of ami or less ) , and extremely low ( 30 percent of ami or less ) .
