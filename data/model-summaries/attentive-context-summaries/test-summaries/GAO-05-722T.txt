since the onset of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) in october 2001 and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) in march 2003 , the department of defense ( dod ) has reported that more than 12,000 servicemembers have been injured in combat .
specifically , we ( 1 ) reviewed va's efforts to expedite vocational rehabilitation services to seriously injured servicemembers and ( 2 ) determined the status of an agreement between dod and va to share health data .
to ensure the continuity of medical care as a first priority as well as to coordinate efforts to ensure access to all other va benefits , such as vocational rehabilitation , va formed its seamless transition task force in august 2003 .
one key problem has been the lack of systematic data from dod about who is seriously injured , the nature of their injuries , and where the servicemembers received treatment .
as dod and va have worked toward a seamless transition , dod raised concerns about privacy issues and the sharing of individually identifiable health data .
in january 2005 , we reported that while va has given high priority to providing services to oef / oif servicemembers , it was challenged in its efforts to identify , locate , and follow up with seriously injured servicemembers .
you asked us to testify on va's and dod's efforts to provide a seamless transition for seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers .
we recommended that va and dod collaborate to reach an agreement for va to have access to dod data for seriously injured servicemembers that both departments agree are needed to promote recovery and return to work and both departments concurred .
thank you for inviting me to share our perspectives on seriously injured servicemembers who could benefit from services offered by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , such as vocational rehabilitation , disability compensation , and health care , as they transition from servicemember to veteran status .
to obtain systematic data from dod on seriously injured oef / oif servicemembers who may need va services , dod and va have been working on an agreement to exchange servicemembers' health data for over 2 years .
while many return to active duty after they are treated , others who are more seriously injured are likely to be discharged from their military obligations and return to civilian life with disabilities .
dod's and va's inability to resolve these differences has impeded coming to an agreement on exchanging servicemembers' individually identifiable health data .
to do our work on the status of dod's and va's data sharing agreement , we reviewed a draft memorandum of understanding for the sharing of data between dod and va , pertinent provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the hipaa privacy rule , which govern the sharing of individually identifiable health data .
dod's and va's inability to resolve these differences has impeded coming to an agreement on exchanging seriously injured servicemembers' individually identifiable health data .
our january 2005 report on va's efforts to expedite vocational rehabilitation services to oef / oif servicemembers was based on interviews with officials at va headquarters and at 12 of va's 57 regional offices .
