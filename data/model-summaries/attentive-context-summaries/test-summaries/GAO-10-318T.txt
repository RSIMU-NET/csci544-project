i appreciate the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to discuss our report , which is being released today , on the actions that the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has taken towards integrating its various management processes , systems , and people , both within and across areas such as information technology , financial management , acquisition , and human capital , as well as in its administrative services .
subsequently , the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) required dhs to develop a strategy for management integration .
these activities are primarily led by the under secretary for management ( usm ) , departmental management chiefs , and management chiefs in dhs's seven components .
we also reviewed dhs's performance goals and measures for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 , and assessed these goals and measures against government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) requirements to determine the extent to which they provided a framework for assessing management integration across the department .
it is critically important that dhs work to unify and strengthen its management functions because the effectiveness of these functions will ultimately affect its ability to fulfill its various missions .
after the department was first created , you asked us to assess the status of dhs's management integration .
dhs could also improve the extent to which it is measuring its progress on management integration , and holding its management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration .
in particular , dhs officials identified ( 1 ) departmentwide documents that provide guidance that relate to management integration across the department , such as dhs's integrated strategy for high risk management and management directorate strategic plan ; and ( 2 ) documents for management of functional areas .
for example , the transformation and systems consolidation ( tasc ) initiative is the department's current effort to consolidate its financial management , acquisition , and asset management systems .
without such a set of measures , dhs cannot assess its progress in implementing and achieving management integration both within and across its functional areas .
to address the extent to which dhs developed a management integration strategy , we assessed whether dhs documents and plans included the characteristics recommended in our 2005 report for a management integration strategy , which required that the strategy: look across the initiatives within each of the management functional units ; clearly identify the critical links that must occur among these initiatives ; identify trade - offs and set priorities ; set implementation goals and a time line to monitor the progress of these initiatives to ensure the necessary links occur when needed ; and identify potential efficiencies , and ensure that they are achieved .
we also recommended that the under secretary take several actions to implement existing performance management mechanisms — such as having the departmental management chiefs provide written input into component chiefs' performance plans and evaluations , and strengthening linkages between department goals and objectives in individual performance plans for component management chiefs — to ensure that the management directorate can exercise its authority and leadership to implement a management integration strategy .
we recommended that once the strategy is developed , dhs's usm should establish performance measures to assess progress made in achieving departmentwide management integration .
