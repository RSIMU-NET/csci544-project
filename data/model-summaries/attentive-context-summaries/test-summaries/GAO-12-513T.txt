thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the department of defense's ( dod ) latest round of base realignments and closures ( brac ) , commonly referred to as brac 2005 .
gao has two long - standing roles in the brac process .
my testimony today is based on work completed to date , and i will identify ( 1 ) key factors and challenges that contributed to brac 2005 implementation and results and ( 2 ) the most - recent estimated costs and savings attributable to brac 2005 .
second , once the recommendations became binding , our role has been to review dod's efforts to implement the recommendations , just as we routinely review the efficiency and effectiveness of many other congressionally mandated or authorized programs across the government .
first , as requested by congressional committees for the 1988 brac round and mandated by law since 1990 , we have served as an independent and objective observer of the brac process and have assessed and reported on dod's decision - making processes leading up to proposed realignment and closure recommendations .
the brac process is designed to overcome obstacles to eliminating unneeded infrastructure and to help dod match needed infrastructure to the force structure and to support military missions .
as such , we have issued about 50 reports related to the brac 2005 round and prior brac rounds since 1989 ( see related gao products at the end of this testimony ) in addition to our statutorily required report providing a detailed analysis of the brac 2005 selection process and the secretary of defense's proposed realignment and closure recommendations to the brac commission .
dod had to develop brac oversight mechanisms to improve accountability for implementation of the brac recommendations .
dod's management of its support infrastructure is on our high - risk list , in part due to the challenges dod faces in eliminating unneeded infrastructure .
the secretary acknowledged that the brac process is controversial but stated that it is the only effective way to achieve needed infrastructure savings , and that the upcoming request comes as a result of dod plans to reduce its force structure .
dod has faced long - term challenges in managing its portfolio of facilities , halting degradation of facilities , and reducing unneeded infrastructure to free up funds to better maintain the facilities it still uses and to meet other needs .
the brac legislation required dod to complete recommendations for closing or realigning bases made in brac 2005 by september 15 , 2011 â€” 6 years from the date the president submitted his approval of the recommendations to congress .
interdependent recommendations affected dod's ability to meet the statutory deadline .
we have operated in a real - time setting and had access to significant portions of the process as it evolved .
gao identified several factors and challenges that contributed to dod's implementation of brac 2005 and the results achieved .
as directed by the house armed services committee in its report accompanying the national defense authorization act for 2008 , we have been reviewing brac 2005 to monitor implementation of the recommendations and identify lessons that could be used to improve future brac rounds should congress authorize additional rounds .
