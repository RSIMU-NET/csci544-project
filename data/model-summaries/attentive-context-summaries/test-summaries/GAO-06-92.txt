these explosives are used by both public sector entities ( such as state and local government agencies ) and private sector companies for a variety of purposes â€” including mining , construction , avalanche control , and law enforcement .
more than 5.5 billion pounds of explosives are used each year in the united states .
in reviewing the security of state and local government explosives storage facilities , we focused on the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives' ( atf ) role in overseeing and regulating these facilities , including the extent to which atf's licensing operations address state and local government facilities and what authority atf has to enforce federal explosives law and regulations at state and local government facilities .
under current federal explosives laws and regulations , the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) is responsible for licensing and regulating explosives manufacturers , importers , dealers , and users .
nevertheless , current federal explosives law as enacted by congress does not provide atf with specific authority to conduct regulatory oversight with respect to public sector facilities .
what authority does atf have to regulate and oversee state and local government explosives storage facilities and how does this compare with its authority over private sector storage facilities ? .
further , because atf does not oversee state and local government storage facilities as part of the federal licensing process and atf does not have any other statutory authority to conduct regulatory inspections of these facilities , atf's ability to monitor the potential vulnerability of these facilities to theft or assess the extent to which these facilities are in compliance with federal explosives storage regulations is limited .
it is primarily through its licensing authority that atf oversees and inspects privately owned explosives facilities to ensure they comply with explosives storage laws and regulations .
atf's authority to regulate explosives stems originally from the organized crime control act of 1970 and was expanded further by enactment of the safe explosives act in 2002 .
most of these security measures are not currently required under federal storage regulations ( perimeter fencing , for example ) .
under federal regulations , only explosives licensees are required to perform periodic inventories and are subject to periodic atf regulatory inspections of their storage facilities ; other persons who store explosives are not .
however , if state and local government entities are unsure about whether they are required to report thefts and missing explosives , atf's ability to monitor these incidents and take appropriate investigative action may be compromised by a potential lack of information .
what security oversight measures are in place at selected state and local government storage facilities to ensure the safe and secure storage of explosives ? .
more specifically , to obtain the perspectives of u.s. government agencies on their efforts to regulate and oversee state and local government explosives storage facilities , and to obtain information on the numbers of explosives thefts and law enforcement bomb squads , we contacted officials from the department of justice ( doj ) , atf , and the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .
