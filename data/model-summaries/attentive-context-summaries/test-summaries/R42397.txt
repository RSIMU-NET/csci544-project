since opening to the public on december 2 , 2008 , the capitol visitor center ( cvc ) has had more than six million visitors .
added expenses were incurred because of higher - than - expected bids ; several design changes ; security upgrades following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ; necessary changes to the air filtration system ; house and senate expansion space costs ; and extra costs associated with working around the capitol , such as security screening for the thousands of construction workers and vehicles that entered the construction site .
a number of factors delayed the project's completion date and increased its cost .
the cost of the center was an estimated $621 million .
the square footage of the three levels of the center ( 580,000 square feet ) is nearly two - thirds that of the capitol itself ( 780,000 square feet ) .
this report addresses the rationale and planning for the cvc , an overview of construction and funding , and subsequent legislation related to its operations and design .
the footprint of the center covers approximately five acres ( 196,000 square feet ) and is larger than that of the capitol ( 175,000 square feet ) .
unusually wet weather in 2003 , the discovery of asbestos in the part of the capitol connected to the center , and an undocumented century - old well under the construction site were unanticipated .
located beneath the east front plaza , the cvc was designed to enhance the security , educational experience , and comfort of visitors to the u.s. capitol .
the project's designers sought to integrate the new structure with the landscape of the capitol grounds and ultimately recreate the park - like setting intended by landscape architect frederick law olmsted sr. in his 1874 design for the site .
the decision to build a subterranean facility largely invisible from an exterior perspective was made so the structure would not compete with , or detract from , the appearance and historical architectural integrity of the capitol .
improvements to the screening of delivery vehicles and additional safety benefits of the center were also cited at subsequent house and senate hearings .
the senate , after passing its own emancipation hall bill ( s. 1679 ) on november 15 , 2007 , agreed to the house bill by unanimous consent on december 6 .
in addition to serving as the security screening entry for visitors to the capitol , the center was designed to provide improved accessibility for disabled persons and enhanced visitor services and educational exhibits .
the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks at the pentagon and in new york , and the subsequent discovery of anthrax in congressional office buildings , also highlighted concerns regarding the potential vulnerabilities of the capitol and the need for improved security on capitol hill .
