this appendix provides information on the scope of work and the methodology used to examine the ( 1 ) outcomes of the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) enforcement actions , and the factors considered by federal and private parties in reaching these outcomes ; ( 2 ) trends , if any , in litigation to resolve superfund liability ; and ( 3 ) status and implementation costs of the superfund program .
information on these key issues is important for epa to effectively plan the future course of the superfund program , and the congress needs such data to help it make more informed decisions about program funding and policy issues .
in this context , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify the outcomes of epa's enforcement actions , and the factors federal and private parties consider in reaching these outcomes ; ( 2 ) examine the trends , if any , in litigation to resolve superfund liability ; and ( 3 ) determine the status and implementation costs of the superfund program .
cleanup actions are managed by epa's office of solid waste and emergency response ( oswer ) and progress through several steps: investigation and study ; selection and design of the cleanup method ; and implementation of the cleanup , known as the remedial action .
to help assess these financial constraints , epa needs comprehensive and reliable data that can be aggregated to provide information on key issues , such as the ( 1 ) status and cost of cleanups at sites that are not construction complete , particularly sites where cleanup is likely to be complex and expensive ; ( 2 ) extent to which sites lack responsible parties capable of paying for some or all of a site's cleanup activities ; and ( 3 ) financial impacts of having epa shoulder these sites' cleanup costs .
the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) of 1980 established the superfund program to protect human health and the environment from the effects of hazardous substances .
to assist the congress in making decisions about funding the superfund program , we are recommending that the administrator , epa , assess the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data the agency collects and , where necessary , improve the data for the purpose of providing aggregated information on the following issues: the status and cost of cleanups at individual sites , particularly complex and expensive sites ; the extent to which there are viable responsible parties at npl sites ; and the potential financial impacts from epa's inability to obtain reimbursement for agency cleanup costs from nonviable responsible parties .
epa can also take removal actions at any time ; these actions are generally short - term or emergency cleanups to mitigate immediate threats .
remedial actions — or remedies — are generally long - term cleanups that aim to permanently and significantly reduce contamination .
also , without this information , epa cannot determine the financial impacts that the absence of viable parties could have on the agency's future cost recovery efforts .
we also recognize that epa has made progress in developing measures that provide information on the extent to which contamination at sites has been addressed .
