to address gaps identified by federal and state officials in the federal government's ability to help states respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the administrator of fema , in consultation with the administrator of samhsa , to expeditiously take the following two actions: determine what types of expanded crisis counseling services should be formally incorporated into ccp and make any necessary revisions to program policy , and revise ccp policy to allow states and service providers that receive ccp funds to use them for indirect costs .
although state practices may contribute to delays , extended federal reviews also may contribute to delays in states' ability to implement their ccps .
 ( 2 ) what have been the states' experiences in obtaining and using ccp grants to respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters ? .
hhs also identified actions it had taken in response to gao's may 2005 report on the ccp , including improving the fiscal monitoring of grants .
to do our work , we obtained program documents and interviewed officials from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , including the administration for children and families , centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , national institutes of health , office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response , and substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) ; the department of education ; the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , including the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) ; the department of justice ; and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , including the national center for posttraumatic stress disorder ( ncptsd ) .
the primary long - standing federal postdisaster grant program for helping states respond to short - term crisis counseling needs following disasters is the crisis counseling assistance and training program ( ccp ) , which is administered by dhs's federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and its federal partner , samhsa .
within hhs the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) helps integrate mental health and substance abuse services into these federal efforts .
these services could include financial assistance to help state or local government agencies or qualified private organizations to provide case management services .
dhs said that fema and samhsa did not rely primarily on damage assessments , as few had been completed .
dhs stated that fema , in consultation with samhsa , took action to expedite the submission , review , and approval of isp applications submitted after hurricane katrina , including allowing the use of shorter applications by states hosting hurricane katrina evacuees .
in addition , other federal agencies have reported on difficulties that states have experienced implementing their ccps .
this could strengthen states' ability to assist disaster victims in coping with the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters .
