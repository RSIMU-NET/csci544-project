on june 30 , 1999 , u.s. and canadian officials signed a new comprehensive agreement to resolve long - standing disputes and to ensure implementation of the conservation and harvest - sharing principles of the 1985 pacific salmon treaty ( pst ) .
after years of failed negotiations , a combination of resource management studies , joint - fishery restrictions to protect wild salmon stocks , and the involvement of high - level government negotiators helped ease tensions between the united states and canada over the shared harvest of pacific salmon .
the 1999 agreement ( 1 ) established abundance - based fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst ; ( 2 ) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation , improve fishery management , and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts ; and ( 3 ) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation , improve the scientific basis for salmon management , and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission ( psc ) .
moreover , the two nations recognized that failure to reach a long - term conservation and harvest - sharing agreement was in no one's best interest .
pacific salmon have long been a matter of common concern to the united states and canada .
the provisions in this agreement's annex iv outline , in detail , the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the five species of pacific salmon .
most chapters of annex iv expired at the end of 2008 , and discussions began in 2005 on its renegotiation .
since their inception , salmon fisheries have experienced strong fluctuations in catch and stock abundance .
this report provides historical background about the pst , discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime , summarizes the 1999 salmon accord , and outlines issues relevant to the renegotiation of annex iv .
in the 1800s , with the advent of canning technologies , extensive commercial salmon fisheries developed in both countries .
the united states and canada recognized that some form of cooperation would be necessary for the sake of the resource .
the goal of the pst is coordinated management of pacific salmon throughout their range to ensure sustainable fisheries and maximize long - term benefits to the parties .
by the 20 th century , it had become obvious that the combined effects of fishing and natural variability in abundance could lead to overharvest .
however , because of the diversity in salmon fisheries and recurring disagreements over how best to address the interception problem , these agreements proved inadequate .
in addition , washington state and canada agreed to restrict several of their fisheries to help protect wild salmon stocks .
interceptions strained diplomatic relations between the united states and canada , and the parties fundamentally disagreed on how to achieve the conservation and harvest - sharing goals established by the pst .
however , failure to reach a long - term conservation and harvest - sharing agreement harmed several salmon stocks and hampered the ability of washington , alaska , and british columbia fishermen to plan fishing seasons and budget expenses because , without a harvest - sharing agreement , year - to - year salmon allocations were unpredictable .
