for years , gao and other entities have reported on weaknesses that affect the department of defense's ( dod ) ability to effectively manage its major defense acquisition programs ( mdap ) .
our objective was to identify previously reported weaknesses that impair the department of defense's ( dod ) ability to provide reliable cost information for military equipment acquired through major defense acquisition programs ( mdaps ) and determine what actions dod has taken to address them .
since 2003 , dod's portfolio of mdaps has increased steadily from 77 to 98 and the cumulative estimated investment in these programs has grown from approximately $1.2 trillion to $1.7 trillion .
111-23 ) , section 304 ( b ) , directed us to perform a review of weaknesses in dod's operations that affect the reliability of financial information on assets acquired through mdaps .
our objective was to identify previously reported weaknesses that impair dod's ability to provide reliable cost information for military equipment acquired through mdaps and determine what actions dod has taken to address them .
mdaps are used to acquire , modernize , or extend the service life of some of the department's most expensive assets , primarily military equipment such as aircraft , ships , tanks , and self - propelled weapons .
to address the objective , we searched databases of audit reports issued during calendar years 2005 through 2009 using key terms ( e.g. , military equipment ) to identify weaknesses in business operations that impair dod's ability to account for the cost of military equipment based on relevant federal financial accounting standards .
the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( pub .
while the department has reported over a trillion dollars in its military equipment investments on its financial statements , dod acknowledged that the department lacks the process and system capabilities to reliably identify , aggregate , and report the full cost of these assets .
in august 2009 , the dod comptroller directed that the department focus its limited financial management improvement resources and efforts on identifying and addressing weaknesses in areas deemed most useful to dod managers .
given the magnitude of dod's military equipment assets and the inherent risk associated with managing large acquisition programs , having reliable and timely cost information is essential for proper planning and effective management and oversight .
the dod comptroller stated that many difficult problems remain unresolved — including implementing compliant systems and valuing the department's significant investment in property , plant , and equipment — and will require the involvement of many functional groups across dod .
although mdaps can include any major acquisition program that meets the dollar or other criteria necessary for mdap designation , dod officials stated that approximately 75 percent of the total number of mdaps reported in july 2009 are likely to involve the acquisition of military equipment assets .
specifically , the comptroller prioritized efforts focused on ensuring the reliability of the department's budgetary information and property accountability records for mission critical assets , which includes military equipment .
the act also requires our office to review the growth in operating and support costs of major weapon systems .
dod has acknowledged that additional actions are needed before the department achieves cost accounting and management capabilities , but stated that its improvement efforts are not yet focused on achieving these capabilities .
