the provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are ( 1 ) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance , ( 2 ) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms , and ( 3 ) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
111-152 ) contains several provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly among small businesses .
on june 4 , 2013 , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) announced that it is delaying enforcement of the aca's requirement that the small business health options program ( shop ) exchanges offer more than one plan from 2014 to 2015 .
some maintain that the direct costs of the employer penalty and related compliance costs will be damaging to small businesses .
it is now up to the states to choose whether to expand their respective medicaid programs and increase health care coverage and affordability among some low - income workers .
core issues regarding the employer penalty as related to small businesses include hiring and workforce decisions , as well as their administrative costs .
the aca's employer penalty aims to encourage employers to retain or offer health coverage to their employees .
several events have altered the aca's implementation since its enactment in 2010: the supreme court ruled in 2012 that the aca's requirement that states extend their medicaid benefits to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level was unconstitutional .
the implementation of the aca's provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly those provisions that relate to small businesses , has been the subject of increasing attention .
on february 10 , 2014 , the department of the treasury issued a final regulation that would delay implementation of the employer penalty for firms with fewer than 100 full - time equivalent ( fte ) employees ( i.e. , firms with 50 fte employees to 99 fte employees ) from 2015 to 2016 .
on july 2 , 2013 , the obama administration announced a delay in the implementation of the employer penalty for all applicable firms until 2015 , citing the need to simplify administrative complexities for businesses and give businesses more time to comply with an appropriate plan .
although the employer penalty may not affect the decisions of employers with fewer than 50 employees because they are not subject to the penalty , the penalty could be part of decision - making calculations for employers that are on the margins of the penalty threshold and considering expanding their business .
111-148 and p.l .
lastly , this report presents several approaches that could address some criticisms of the aca's employer penalty and reduce its effects on small businesses .
