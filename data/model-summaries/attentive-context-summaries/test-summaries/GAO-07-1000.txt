given your interest in gsa's use of real property delegations of authority , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) what real property authority gsa has delegated to its tenant agencies , ( 2 ) what policies and procedures gsa used to manage delegated real property authority , and ( 3 ) reasons the tenant agencies requested delegated authority .
the general services administration ( gsa ) serves as the federal government's landlord and designs , builds , manages , and leases the facilities supporting the needs of other federal agencies throughout the government .
these six agencies are the departments of commerce , defense , interior , and justice ; the social security administration , and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
the program was an outgrowth of gsa's commitment to streamline its leasing operations , respond to the government's changing needs , and address recommendations from client agencies .
although gsa is responsible for managing over 8,000 government - owned and leased buildings , gsa's customer agencies may request authority to perform for themselves certain real property activities , such as leasing and maintaining their own space .
in the absence of ( 1 ) accurate program data on the numbers and types of key authorities delegated , ( 2 ) current policies and procedures to help guide decisions to delegate , and ( 3 ) complete cost - effectiveness analyses , gsa cannot ensure that delegations are an efficient use of federal dollars or in the best interests of the government .
we limited our review to the types of delegations issued to and exercised by gsa's top 10 customers ( its tenant agencies ) between fiscal years 1996 to 2006 .
to meet these objectives , we reviewed the law , federal management regulations , and gsa's existing policies and procedures for delegating real property authority .
effective management of its delegations is critical for gsa to help ensure that federal dollars are well - spent and adequate workspace is provided for federal employees .
under this program , called “can't beat gsa leasing,” federal agencies have the choice of using gsa as their leasing agent or assuming responsibility of their own leasing .
given your interest in the general services administration's ( gsa ) use of real property delegations of authority , we determined ( 1 ) what real property authority gsa has delegated to its tenant agencies , ( 2 ) what policies and procedures gsa uses to manage delegated real property authority , and ( 3 ) reasons the tenant agencies requested delegated authority .
in addition , we interviewed officials from gsa's office of governmentwide policy ( ogp ) , which provides oversight for delegations of real estate leasing authority .
we also interviewed gsa officials from the public buildings service ( pbs ) , which is responsible for managing the delegations .
when gsa delegates its real property authority , the delegations require the agencies to comply with the applicable laws , regulations , and terms of the delegations .
under the delegations , gsa can review the agency's performance to determine whether the agency is meeting its responsibilities .
if federal agencies do not perform their delegated responsibilities efficiently , they could , for example , pay more than gsa would charge for space , provide substandard space for their employees , or damage the quality or value of the space .
