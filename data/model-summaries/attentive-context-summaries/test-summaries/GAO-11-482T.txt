i am pleased to be here today to discuss the findings and recommendations from our march 2009 report on the international atomic energy agency's ( iaea ) technical cooperation ( tc ) program and the actions the department of state and iaea have taken to implement the recommendations in that report .
in march 2011 , we reviewed documentation provided by state and iaea and interviewed state and department of energy ( doe ) officials to obtain updated information on actions taken to implement our 2009 recommendations .
we also interviewed a doe official for his views regarding changes in the quantity and timeliness of information doe has received on tc proposals since our 2009 report and whether this information has improved doe's ability to assess proposed tc projects for potential proliferation concerns .
it has the dual mission of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and verifying that nuclear technologies and materials intended for peaceful purposes are not diverted to weapons development efforts .
to that end , the tc program helps iaea member states achieve their sustainable development priorities by furnishing them with relevant nuclear technologies and expertise , and the program plays a role in facilitating article iv of the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons ( npt ) , which affirms that all states party to the treaty have a right to participate in the exchange of equipment , materials , and scientific and technological information for peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
through the tc program , iaea has supported the development of nuclear technology for peaceful applications in a variety of areas , including energy , human health , food and agriculture , and nuclear safety .
the tc program is a main pillar of iaea's mission to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
iaea is an independent international organization based in vienna , austria , affiliated with the united nations .
in 2007 , the tc program disbursed over $93 million in nuclear technical assistance to 122 countries and territories .
proliferation concerns about the tc program have persisted because of the assistance it has provided to certain countries , including four countries — cuba , iran , sudan , and syria — that the united states has designated as state sponsors of terrorism , and because nuclear equipment , technology , and expertise can be dual - use — capable of serving peaceful purposes , such as the production of medical isotopes , but also useful in contributing to nuclear weapons development .
the united states participates as a donor and is the largest financial contributor to the tc program , providing approximately 25 percent of its budget , or approximately $19.8 million , in 2007 .
we also reviewed documentation provided by state and iaea concerning our recommendations and the steps taken to implement them .
all iaea member states are eligible for tc assistance ; however , not all countries request assistance .
despite its disagreement with our matter for congressional consideration , state has taken our other 2009 report recommendations seriously and has communicated directly with iaea officials on their potential implementation .
in its comments on our 2009 report , state objected to the matter for a number of reasons , noting that ( 1 ) it would be counterproductive to a separate recommendation we made in the report encouraging all states to pay their full share to the tcf ; ( 2 ) it would not stop tc projects in targeted countries because tcf funding is fungible ; ( 3 ) congress has exempted iaea contributions from this type of proportionate withholding ; ( 4 ) none of the tc projects in state sponsors of terrorism have been shown to have contributed to a wmd program ; ( 5 ) there are adequate safeguards within iaea's secretariat to prevent tc projects from contributing to a wmd program ; and ( 6 ) it would negatively impact the ability of the united states to achieve other critical objectives within iaea .
