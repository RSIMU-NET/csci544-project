this testimony addresses , for calendar years 2014 through 2016 , ( 1 ) the amounts and percentages of u.s. assessed contributions to the four organizations , ( 2 ) the extent to which u.s. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the organizations' strategic goals align with those of u.s. agencies .
state , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) also provide project - specific voluntary contributions to the oas , paho , and iica through assistance agreements , which include grants and cooperative agreements .
these organizations include the organization of american states ( oas ) , the pan american health organization ( paho ) , the inter - american institute for cooperation on agriculture ( iica ) , and the pan - american institute of geography and history ( paigh ) .
in our december 2017 report , we recommended that ( 1 ) usda ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and ( 2 ) usaid and usda ensure full documentation of monitoring activities .
the united states belongs to several inter - american organizations that , among other things , promote democracy , security , health care , agricultural development , and scientific exchange in the western hemisphere .
we identified key monitoring provisions agencies are to include as part of their agreements as provisions that ensure oversight of the use of funds by requiring monitoring activities , such as financial and progress reports .
for calendar year 2016 , the united states' assessed contributions to these four organizations totaled over $130 million , and voluntary contributions to the oas , paho , and iica totaled $32 million .
according to the department of state ( state ) , the oas is the premier multilateral forum in the western hemisphere for regional dispute resolution and promotion of democratic governance .
however , state took corrective action in may 2017 to address its gaps in documentation , and according to hhs officials , the food and drug administration addressed its gap in documentation by implementing its agreement monitoring program in fiscal year 2018 .
for example , in 2016 , usaid approved an assistance agreement for $2 million to oas to support international observation of government elections in haiti .
oas , paho , iica , and paigh have established mechanisms for overseeing their use of these funds , such as external auditors and internal audit boards as required by the standards of the institute of internal auditors .
the united states also works with paho , iica , and paigh to provide technical support and guidance in areas including public health , agriculture , and cartography .
for example , state did not include two of the key monitoring provisions ( a risk assessment and a monitoring plan ) in one of its agreements .
in october 2013 , the united states enacted the organization of american states revitalization and reform act of 2013 ( reform act ) .
the united states uses its membership in these organizations to promote u.s. interests in the western hemisphere .
