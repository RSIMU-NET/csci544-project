the objectives of this review were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) available data allow the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to accurately identify the marine mammal stocks that meet the marine mammal protection act's ( mmpa ) requirements for establishing take reduction teams , ( 2 ) nmfs has established take reduction teams for those marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory requirements , ( 3 ) nmfs has met the statutory deadlines established in the mmpa for the take reduction teams subject to the deadlines and the reasons for any delays , and ( 4 ) nmfs has developed a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take reduction plans that have been implemented .
we recommend that the assistant administrator of nmfs develop a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of each take reduction plan and implementing regulations , including , among other things , establishing appropriate goals and steps for comprehensively monitoring and analyzing rates of compliance with take reduction measures .
without a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of its take reduction plans and implementing regulations and industry's compliance with them , nmfs may be missing opportunities to better protect marine mammals .
in the context of nmfs's efforts to measure the success of take reduction plans and implementing regulations , such a strategy would include , at a minimum , ( 1 ) performance goals that identify the desired outcomes of the take reduction regulations ; ( 2 ) steps for assessing the effectiveness of potential take reduction regulations , such as fishing gear modifications , in achieving the goals ; ( 3 ) a process for monitoring the fishing industry's compliance with the requirements of the take reduction regulations ; and ( 4 ) reliable data assessing the regulation's effect on achieving the goals .
to facilitate the oversight of nmfs's progress and capacity to meet the statutory requirements for take reduction teams , congress may wish to consider taking the following three actions: direct the assistant administrator of nmfs to report on major data , resource , or other limitations that make it difficult for nmfs to accurately determine which marine mammals meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams ; establish teams for stocks that meet these requirements ; and meet the statutory deadlines for take reduction teams ; amend the statutory requirements for establishing a take reduction team to stipulate that not only must a marine mammal stock be strategic and interacting with a category i or ii fishery , but that the fishery with which the marine mammal stock interacts causes at least occasional incidental mortality or serious injury of that particular marine mammal stock ; and amend the mmpa to ensure that its deadlines give nmfs adequate time to publish proposed and final take reduction plans and implementing regulations while meeting all the requirements of the federal rulemaking process .
as congress prepares to consider the reauthorization of the mmpa , you asked us to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) available data allow nmfs to accurately identify the marine mammal stocks that meet the mmpa's requirements for establishing take reduction teams ; ( 2 ) nmfs has established take reduction teams for those marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory requirements ; ( 3 ) nmfs has met the statutory deadlines established in the mmpa for the take reduction teams subject to the deadlines , and the reasons for any delays ; and ( 4 ) nmfs has developed a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take reduction plans that have been implemented .
