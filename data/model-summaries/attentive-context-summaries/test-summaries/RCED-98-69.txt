accordingly , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the quality of the air inside the niehs building when it was first occupied in 1981 , ( 2 ) identify the health effects associated with exposure to formaldehyde , and ( 3 ) describe the current management practices at niehs for air handling and air monitoring .
the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) , the component of the national institutes of health that does research on environment - related diseases , moved into a new facility at research triangle park , north carolina , in april 1981 .
even though considerable time has passed , some employees continue to believe that the quality of the air — specifically , the level of formaldehyde emissions — in the building in 1981 has caused them to have continuing health problems .
in response to your inquiries , niehs and the inspector general ( ig ) of the department of health and human services issued two letter reports in 1997 addressing some aspects of the employees' complaints ; other questions , however , remained unanswered .
soon after the agency occupied the facility , some employees began complaining about the quality of the air , primarily in one of the facility's five modules .
our review included interviews with niehs officials , current and former niehs employees , and scientists and experts knowledgeable about modeling , air handling , air monitoring , and the exposure to and the effects of formaldehyde .
the ig's letter report , dated august 15 , 1997 , addresses niehs' ( 1 ) grievance procedures and treatment of employees , ( 2 ) compliance with appropriate policies and procedures regarding employee complaints , and ( 3 ) venting and other practices to ensure proper ventilation before the facility was occupied .
the agencies and their classifications of the effects of formaldehyde on humans are as follows: international agency for research on cancer: probably carcinogenic to humans ; national toxicology program: reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen ; epa: probable human carcinogen .
even though it has not been unequivocally proven that long - term exposure to formaldehyde has the same effect on humans , the results of the tests on animals have raised concerns that it may affect humans .
studies of long - term exposure have also shown that the occurrence of cancer increases as the concentration of formaldehyde increases .
while many studies have found no or uncertain correlation between formaldehyde and cancer , others have found that the incidence of some cancers increases from exposure to formaldehyde .
when the air quality problem occurred at niehs in 1981 , far less was known about indoor air pollution than is known today , and there was a strong emphasis on energy conservation .
as a result of the emphasis on energy conservation at that time , building engineers at facilities across the country had reduced the air exchange rate of air handling systems and initiated other conservation measures .
niehs' report , dated march 31 , 1997 , addresses the events and health effects that may have been caused by exposure to formaldehyde when the new facility was first occupied in april 1981 .
for example , factors such as the type of materials in the building did not change significantly , and the air exchange rate in september should have been higher than in april .
