assuming congress wants to maintain the present usps model â€” addressing these financial challenges will require ( 1 ) improving the usps's liquidity immediately ; ( 2 ) fortifying usps's long - term revenues ; and ( 3 ) controlling the growth of usps's long - term costs , all while ( 4 ) having usps continue to provide universal postal service to the public .

at present , the usps appears to be suffering from both a short - term liquidity crisis ( i.e. , dwindling cash and borrowing authority ) and a long - term structural deficit ( i.e. , stagnating revenues and rising overhead costs ) .
were it not for congressional action to reduce a statutorily required payment to the usps's retirees health benefits fund ( rhbf ) , the usps would have lost an additional $9.5 billion .
since fy2005 , the usps's debt has risen to $13 billion from $0 , $2 billion below its maximum statutory borrowing authority ( 39 u.s.c .
in the first half of fy2012 , the usps had an operating loss of $6.4 billion , which included a $6.1 billion charge for payments due to the rhbf in fy2012 .
as the usps's finances have deteriorated , its ability to absorb operating losses has been diminished .
the current year has brought further losses .
the agency has asked congress to enact a variety of reforms to improve the usps's financial condition .
