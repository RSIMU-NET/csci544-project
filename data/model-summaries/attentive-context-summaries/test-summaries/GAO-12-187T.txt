my statement today discusses ( 1 ) the role of the nextgen test facilities in the development of nextgen technologies and how private industry and partner agencies participate in projects at the nextgen test facilities , and ( 2 ) our previous findings on nextgen technology transfer and faa's efforts to improve the transfer and implementation of nextgen - related technologies .
transforming the nation's air transportation system affects and involves the activities and missions of several federal agencies , though the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is the lead implementer .
these test facilities provide access to the systems currently used in the national air space ( nas ) and house various types of hardware , simulators , and other equipment to allow for demonstrations of new technologies .
i appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the use of test facilities as a means of leveraging public , private , and academic resources to deliver technologies for the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
nextgen will affect nearly every aspect of air transportation and will transform the way in which the air transportation system operates today .
lack of coordination between faa and dod and faa and dhs could result in duplicative research and inefficient use of resources at both agencies .
the result will be an air transportation system that relies on satellite - based surveillance and navigation , data communications , and improved collaborative decision making .
faa has taken a number of actions to improve its ability to implement new technologies and increase partner agencies' and private sector participants' involvement in seeing the development of selected technologies through to successful implementation — including restructuring the organization responsible for implementing nextgen and linking the test facilities and improving their capabilities .
differences in mission priorities , however , particularly between faa and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and between faa and the department of defense ( dod ) , pose a challenge to coordination with those agencies .
three nextgen test facilities , collectively referred to as the nextgen test bed , are designed to foster the research and development of nextgen - related technologies and to evaluate integrated technologies and procedures for nationwide nextgen deployment .
in addition , nextgen was designed and planned to be developed in collaboration with aviation stakeholders — airlines and other airspace users , air traffic controllers , and avionics , aircraft , and automation systems manufacturers — in order to facilitate coordinated research activities , transfer technologies from faa and partner agencies to the private sector , and take advantage of research and technology developed by the private sector that could meet nextgen needs , as appropriate .
it is a complex undertaking that requires new technologies — including new integrated ground and aircraft systems — as well as new procedures , processes , and supporting infrastructure .
faa has also used research transition teams to coordinate research and transfer technologies from nasa and overcome technology transfer challenges .
dod has not completed an inventory of its research and development portfolio related to nextgen , impeding faa's ability to identify and leverage potentially useful research , technology , or expertise from dod .
across the test facilities private and public sector stakeholders contribute personnel , equipment , and funding to develop and integrate technologies .
