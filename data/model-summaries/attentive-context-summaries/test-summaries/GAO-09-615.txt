u.s. government agencies including the department of defense ( dod ) , the department of state , and the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) have spent billions of dollars in afghanistan to encourage economic development , improve governance , increase security , and positively influence the afghan people .
chief among dod's programs is the commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) .
we further recommend that the secretary of defense and administrator of usaid ; collaborate to create a centralized project - development database for use by u.s. government agencies in afghanistan , including establishing specific milestones for its development and implementation .
as of april 2009 , congress has authorized about $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2009 for cerp in iraq and afghanistan , of which dod allocated $683 million to fund cerp development projects in afghanistan .
as dod plans to increase u.s. troop presence in afghanistan , some dod officials expect the size and funding of cerp to further expand .
since 2004 , dod has reported total obligations of about $1 billion for cerp in afghanistan , growing from $40 million in fiscal year 2004 to $486 million in fiscal year 2008 .
dod concurred with our recommendation to collaborate with usaid to create a centralized project - development database for use by u.s. government agencies in afghanistan , including establishing specific milestones for its development and implementation .
dod partially concurred with our recommendation to require u.s. central command to evaluate workforce requirements and ensure adequate staff to administer the commander's emergency response program ( cerp ) .
cerp is designed to enable local commanders in both iraq and afghanistan to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction requirements within their areas of responsibility .
according to dod's financial management regulation implementing the cerp , there are 20 authorized uses of cerp that include projects and activities to develop afghanistan's transportation , electricity , and agriculture sectors .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the commander of u.s. central command to evaluate workforce requirements and ensure adequate staff to administer establish training requirements for cerp personnel administering the program , to include specific information on how to complete their duties and responsibilities .
due to significant congressional interest in this issue , we conducted a review of the cerp in afghanistan under the authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative and examined the following questions: to what extent ( 1 ) does dod have the capacity to manage and oversee the cerp in afghanistan and ( 2 ) has dod established mechanisms to coordinate its cerp projects with usaid ? .
to determine the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) has the capacity to provide adequate management and oversight of the cerp in afghanistan , we reviewed guidance from dod , combined joint task force - 101 ( cjtf - 101 ) , and combined joint task force - 82 ( cjtf - 82 ) to identify roles and responsibilities of cerp personnel , how personnel are assigned to the cerp , the nature and extent of the workload related to managing and executing the cerp , and the training curriculum provided to familiarize personnel with the cerp .
