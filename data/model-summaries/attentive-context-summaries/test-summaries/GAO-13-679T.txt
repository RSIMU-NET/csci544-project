this testimony provides our preliminary observations from our ongoing work , being performed at the request of this committee and other members of the senate , regarding: ( 1 ) fra's framework for safety oversight , ( 2 ) existing and emerging challenges to rail safety , and ( 3 ) ptc implementation .
we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing to discuss the federal railroad administration's ( fra ) rail safety oversight activities .
my statement will discuss our ongoing reviews of fra's rail safety oversight and the implementation of positive train control , a communications - based system designed to prevent train accidents caused by human factors .
the rail network is one of america's safest modes of transportation , although several recent rail accidents , including the metro - north commuter rail accident in bridgeport , connecticut , the collision of bnsf and up trains in chaffee , missouri , and the collision of a csx train and a truck in rosedale , maryland , have reinforced the need for constant effort from both the private and public sectors to ensure that rail transportation remains safe for passengers , the public , and railroad employees .
our preliminary assessments of fra's rail safety framework and the quantitative tools fra uses to implement that framework are based on our reviews of fra documentation and interviews with fra headquarters and regional officials .
we selected the railroads based on the class of railroad ( as a proxy for size ) , types of railroads ( long distance versus local service or a railroad that serves a small area such as a port or rail yard ) , and type of ownership ( publicly held , privately held , or owned by a public agency ) to get a range of different kinds of freight railroads .
we also selected ptc suppliers and independent ptc experts based on their involvement with ptc and recommendations from fra , industry associations , and others .
for our assessment of ptc implementation , we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from fra and railroad associations , the four largest freight railroads , commuter railroads that were selected based on ptc implementation status and ridership levels ( among other things ) , and amtrak .
accordingly , fra has requested authorities that could provide railroads the flexibility they need to successfully implement ptc .
railroads and fra both report continuing to search for ways to speed progress while maintaining safe rail operations in order to achieve complete deployment as soon as possible .
nonetheless , given the state of ptc technology and the myriad of ptc components that are required to work seamlessly in order for ptc to work reliably , concerns regarding the potential risks railroads may be taking in attempting to meet the deadline should be considered .
in addition , we interviewed state rail safety officials and freight railroad officials from selected class i , ii , and iii railroads .
our work to date indicates that most railroads will not complete ptc implementation by the 2015 deadline due to numerous , interrelated challenges caused by the breadth and complexity of ptc .
in 2006 , fra implemented a risk - based approach , using its national inspection plan ( nip ) , to allocate its limited inspection resources to ensure rail safety .
