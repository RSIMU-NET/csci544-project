in fiscal year 2003 , the federal food stamp program , administered by the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , reported it made payment errors totaling about $1.4 billion in benefits .
fns's quality control ( qc ) system measures payment accuracy and monitors how accurately states determine food stamp eligibility and calculate benefits .
fns and the states will continue to face a challenge in balancing the goals of payment accuracy , increasing program participation rates , and the need to contain program costs .
due to concerns about ensuring payment accuracy , we examined ( 1 ) what is included in the national food stamp payment error rate and how has the rate changed over time , ( 2 ) what is known about the causes of food stamp payment errors , and ( 3 ) what actions usda and states have taken to reduce these payment errors .
in addition , some food stamp participants receive benefits from other programs , such as medicaid or the cash assistance program temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) .
however , given the size of the food stamp program , the costs to administer it , and the current federal budget deficit , achieving program goals more cost - effectively may become more important .
to determine the causes of food stamp payment errors for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 , we analyzed the food and nutrition service's ( fns ) quality control ( qc ) system data of active cases used in error rate calculations .
it is not completely clear why some states have been more successful at lowering their error rates than others .
these differences add to the complexity of determining and recertifying eligibility and program benefits .
for example , households with earned income may be required to report more income changes to caseworkers than households without earned income , such as those that are dependent solely on retirement benefits .
fns has long focused its attention on states' accountability for error rates through its qc system by assessing penalties and providing financial incentives .
however , payment errors reflect the misuse of public funds and may undermine public confidence in the program .
although the caseworkers who process these eligibility determinations may be the same as those who administer the food stamp program , the rules for the various programs can differ .
however , they have little data to determine which practices have been most successful or cost - effective .
depending on household circumstances , some cases may require more adjustments than others .
fns's primary focus has been on monitoring progress in reducing error rates , which can help ensure eligible households receive the correct benefits and maintain public support for the program .
despite fns and state mechanisms used to track the initiatives and share promising practices , there are no data available on which initiatives are most cost - effective .
however , although it is difficult to determine which actions are most likely to succeed in particular circumstances , we found examples of strategies that did not succeed because they lacked adequate management attention or were not effectively implemented .
the three major causes of errors have remained the same over time and are closely linked to the complexity of program rules and reporting requirements .
