visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program to develop a system to collect biographic data ( such as name and date of birth ) and biometric data ( such as fingerprints ) from foreign nationals at u.s. ports of entry .
beginning in 1996 , federal law has required the implementation of an entry and exit data system to track foreign nationals entering and leaving the united states .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement a biometric exit system .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 required the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan to accelerate implementation of a biometric entry and exit data system that matches available information provided by foreign nationals upon their arrival in and departure from the united states .
within dhs , u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is tasked with , among other duties , inspecting all people applying for entry to the united states to determine their admissibility to the country .
since 2004 , dhs has tracked foreign nationals' entries into the united states as part of an effort to comply with legislative requirements , and since december 2006 , a biometric entry capability has been fully operational at all air , sea , and land ports of entry .
furthermore , dhs reported in may 2012 that significant questions remained regarding ( 1 ) the effectiveness of current biographic air exit processes and the error rates in collecting or matching data , ( 2 ) methods of cost - effectively integrating biometrics into the air departure processes ( e.g. , collecting biometric scans as passengers enter the jetway to board a plane ) , ( 3 ) the additional value biometric air exit would provide compared with the current biographic air exit process , and ( 4 ) the overall value and cost of a biometric air exit capability .
we interviewed dhs office of policy and s&t officials regarding dhs's plans for addressing recommendations in the department's may 2012 report and other ongoing efforts to develop a biometric exit system .
in 2003 , dhs initiated the u.s .
dhs generally agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to implement a number of them .
however , we have identified a range of management challenges that dhs has faced in its effort to fully deploy a corresponding biometric exit capability to track foreign nationals when they depart the country .
most recently , in july 2013 , we reported on dhs's progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system , as well as dhs's efforts to identify and address potential overstays â€” individuals who were admitted into the country legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized period of admission .
furthermore , any delays in providing this information to congress could further affect possible implementation of a biometric exit system to address statutory requirements .
dhs concurred with this recommendation and indicated that its component agencies plan to finalize the goals and objectives for biometric air exit by january 31 , 2014 , and that these goals and objectives will be used in the development of an evaluation framework that dhs expects to have completed by june 30 , 2014 .
