the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) , enacted in 1938 , is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers .
states generally have three options in setting their minimum wage policies: ( 1 ) they can set their own minimum wage provisions that differ from those in the flsa , ( 2 ) they can explicitly tie their minimum wage provisions to the flsa , or ( 3 ) they can include no specific minimum wage provisions in state law .
110-28 in 2007 , which increased the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in three steps ( the final step occurring in 2009 ) .
while most states' scheduled state minimum wage rate changes ( due to inflation adjustments or statutorily scheduled changes ) occurred on january 1 of each year , a few states have rate increases scheduled for later in the year .
since its establishment , the minimum wage rate has been raised 22 separate times .
the most recent change was enacted through p.l .
it also specifies certain categories of workers who are not covered by general flsa wage standards , such as workers with disabilities or certain youth workers .
the flsa mandates broad minimum wage coverage .
next , the report discusses the interaction of federal and state minimum wages over time , and finally , the appendix provides detailed information on the major components of minimum wage policies in all 50 states and the district of columbia .
the state policies covered in this report include currently effective policies and policies enacted with an effective date at some point in 2019 .
it then provides a summary of state minimum wage laws , followed by an examination of rates and mechanisms of adjustments in states with minimum wage levels above the flsa rate ( table 1 provides summary data ) .
the minimum wage provisions of the flsa have been amended numerous times since then , typically to expand coverage or raise the wage rate .
in 2019 , the range of state minimum wage rates is as follows: 29 states and the district of columbia have enacted minimum wage rates above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour ; 2 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate ; 5 states have no state minimum wage requirement ; and the remaining 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate .
in 1938 , the flsa established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour .
as discussed previously , for those states with current or scheduled minimum wages above the federal rate , three main mechanisms are in place to adjust future rates: ( 1 ) scheduled increases , ( 2 ) indexation to inflation , or ( 3 ) reference to the federal rate plus an add - on ( i.e. , a state minimum wage is a percentage or dollar amount above the federal rate ) .
following the three - step increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to the current $7.25 ( 2007-2009 ) , 15 states , comprising 33% of the civilian labor force , had rates above the federal minimum wage in 2010 .
