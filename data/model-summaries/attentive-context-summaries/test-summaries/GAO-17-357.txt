this report examines ( 1 ) factors federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders cited as affecting federal - nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and ( 2 ) actions federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders said could help improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities .
wildland fires are both natural and inevitable , and play an important role on our nation's lands .
over the past century , however , various land management practices , including fire suppression , have disrupted the normal frequency of fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems , resulting in abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation .
we also compared agency efforts to our previous reports related to interagency strategies and agencies' efforts to collaborate .
according to scientific reports , this altered landscape , combined with drought and other climate stressors , has contributed to larger and more severe wildland fires .
such measures could , as noted in the cohesive strategy , allow congress and other stakeholders to monitor and assess progress toward achieving the strategy's goals .
among the laws we reviewed were the federal land assistance , management , and enhancement act ; healthy forests restoration act of 2003 ; good neighbor authority ; wyden amendment ; and tribal forest protection act of 2004 .
this report examines ( 1 ) factors federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders cited as affecting federal - nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and ( 2 ) actions federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders said could help improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities .
however , wflc has not developed performance measures to assess the combined efforts of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the goals of the cohesive strategy .
as a result , it is not clear whether interior has fully considered the potential for using research findings or other tools described in the 2016 report to measure national progress in a cost - effective way .
over the past 2 decades , federal land management agencies have issued guidance and policies supporting a collaborative , cross - boundary approach to reducing wildland fire risk and have undertaken multiple efforts intended to reduce risk .
more broadly , the wildland fire leadership council ( wflc ) — the interagency organization responsible for oversight and leadership in implementing the cohesive strategy ( and which includes the forest service and interior as members ) — has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the cohesive strategy .
however , as we note in our report , agency performance measures are intended to separately assess each agency's performance — or , in some cases the performance of specific programs — and do not represent a set of measures to assess national progress toward meeting the cohesive strategy's goals , as called for in the strategy .
wildfire prevention messaging: efforts to provide prevention information or materials .
the forest service and interior each have performance measures to monitor and assess their wildland fire management efforts , but those measures apply to the agencies individually and do not represent the set of national measures called for in the cohesive strategy .
