in order for dea to better determine to what extent its efforts are decreasing diversions and to inform future program decisions , we recommend that the administrator of dea strengthen the agency's performance measurement for the diversion control program by reassessing its set of performance measures for the program to identify ways to enhance the measures and their link to the program outcome goal of reducing diversion .
according to the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) , the abuse of controlled prescription drugs such as pain relievers , depressants , and stimulants is the nation's fastest - growing drug problem .
by reassessing the program's current performance measures and making changes where necessary to the measures , dea will be in a better position to provide enhanced information to program managers , other decision makers such as congress , and the public on the extent to which the program is achieving its stated longer range performance goal of reducing diversion .
although such prescription drugs have legitimate medical uses , they also pose a potential for abuse and addiction and , thus , being diverted for nonmedical illicit uses .
how does dea help ensure that policies and procedures are followed for diversion investigations and to what extent does it determine the results of its efforts on the diversion problem ? .
making more meaningful information available externally about the program's results would enable program managers and external stakeholders to better understand what the program is accomplishing and provide more effective oversight .
because of the rising diversion and illicit use of controlled prescription drugs , you asked us to review dea's management of its diversion control investigations to combat this problem .
by developing an outcome measure that demonstrates programwide results of benefit to the public and revising other performance measures to better track and report on the results of investigations and their results on reducing diversion of prescription drugs , dea could make the measures more effective for demonstrating results .
dea has established a set of performance measures for the program , but the link between most of the measures and how they demonstrate the progress dea is making towards the overall goal of reducing diversion is unclear .
in its comments , dea stated it would take action to address the recommendation to strengthen its set of performance measures for the diversion control program but that it disagreed with the finding that its performance measures do not adequately measure how its efforts reduce diversion or that such deficiencies impede resource allocation decisions .
doing so could also provide dea program managers and other decision makers such as congress better information to target program approaches accordingly to further optimize results against diversion .
how does dea manage its investigation efforts to address the growing and evolving nature of prescription drug diversion ? .
within the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , the office of diversion control is directly responsible for enforcing the provisions of the csa as they pertain to ensuring the availability of substances such as prescription drugs and listed chemicals for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion .
to address the first objective , we reviewed dea policies and procedures on how dea carries out its investigative responsibilities , including program documents such as dea's current strategic plan and budget justification submissions for fiscal years 2008 to 2012 .
