we recently issued a report , entitled medicare: focus on physician practice patterns can lead to greater program efficiency , which discusses an approach to analyzing physicians' practice patterns in medicare and ways the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) could use the results of such an analysis to modify inefficient physician behavior .
one such strategy entails providing feedback to physicians on how their use of health care resources compares with that of their peers .
this topic has been of significant interest to the congress , as medicare's current system of spending targets used to moderate physician spending growth and annually update physician fees has been problematic .
the report fulfilled a 2003 mandate that we examine aspects of physician compensation in medicare , pertaining only to physicians serving beneficiaries in traditional fee - for - service ( ffs ) medicare .
this spending target system — called the sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) system — adjusts medicare's physician fees based on the extent to which actual spending aligns with specified targets .
against this backdrop , my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) the results of our analysis estimating the prevalence of inefficient physicians in medicare and ( 2 ) the potential for cms to profile physicians in traditional ffs medicare for efficiency and use the results in ways that are similar to other purchasers' efforts to encourage efficiency .
in the report , we used the term efficiency to mean providing and ordering a level of services that is sufficient to meet a patient's health care needs but not excessive , given a patient's health status .
medicare physician payment policy does little to change this situation ; payments under the medicare program are not designed to foster individual physician responsibility for the most effective medical practices .
policymakers are therefore concerned about the appropriateness of the sgr system for updating physician fees and about physicians' continued participation in the medicare program .
although these cuts have been overridden by legislative or administrative action , a sustained period of declining fees under the sgr system is projected .
in recent years , the sgr system has called for cuts in physician fees to offset volume and intensity increases that have exceeded spending targets .
as for implementing other strategies to encourage efficiency , such as the use of certain financial incentives , cms would likely need additional legislative authority .
in contrast , some public and private health care purchasers have initiated programs to identify efficient physicians and encourage patients to obtain care from them .
having considered the efforts of 10 private and public health care purchasers that routinely evaluate physicians for efficiency and other factors , we conducted our own analysis of physician practices in medicare .
experts agree that physicians play a central role in the generation of health care expenditures in total .
for example , the wide geographic variation in medicare spending per beneficiary — unrelated to beneficiary health status or outcomes — provides evidence that health needs alone do not determine spending .
i am pleased to be here today as you discuss the importance of physician - focused strategies to improve efficiency in medicare .
the problem , in part , is that the sgr system acts as a blunt instrument in that all physicians are subject to the consequences of excess spending — namely , downward fee adjustments — that may stem from the excessive use of resources by only some physicians .
