for this report , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) dod developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and has tracked the costs , estimated savings , and efficiencies from joint basing ; ( 2 ) joint base common standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for installation support services at the joint bases ; and ( 3 ) the joint bases or dod have a process in place to consistently identify and address any implementation challenges to facilitate achievement of joint basing goals .
gao has designated department of defense ( dod ) support infrastructure as a high - risk area , and identified installation support as one key support infrastructure category where opportunities existed for savings .
in order to assess the extent to which the department of defense ( dod ) developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and tracked the costs , savings , and efficiencies resulting from joint basing , we analyzed dod guidance related to joint base implementation , specifically looking for any measures or reporting processes on efficiencies and cost savings .
in originally citing support infrastructure as high risk , we stated that reducing the cost of excess infrastructure activities was critical to making use of scarce resources and maintaining high levels of military capabilities .
the brac commission approved a modified version of dod's recommendation , which the commission found more fully reflected statutory selection criteria and dod's force structure plan .
in a subsequent recommendation submitted to the 2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) commission , dod proposed that the department consolidate 26 military installations into 12 joint bases to take advantage of opportunities for efficiencies arising from such consolidation and elimination of duplicate support services on bases located close to one another .
as a result , in 2009 dod significantly reduced its estimated 20-year cost savings projection from $2.3 billion to about $273 million .
however , we also noted that despite the potential for reducing base operating support costs through greater reliance on interservice - type agreements , differing service traditions and cultures and concern over losing direct control of support assets had caused commanders to resist such measures .
as we believed in 1997 and continue to believe , dod needs to improve its ability to update savings from brac recommendations .
we are conducting this follow - on review under the comptroller general's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative in order to provide updated information on dod's progress in achieving its joint basing objectives .
our most recent high - risk report , issued in february 2011 , continued to designate dod's management of its support infrastructure as an area of high risk .
through updates to our high - risk series reports , we have continued to monitor dod's ability to achieve economies of scale and savings by consolidating and eliminating duplicate installation support services .
to enable dod to achieve cost savings and efficiencies and to track its progress toward achieving these goals , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the deputy under secretary of defense ( installations and environment ) to take the following two actions: develop and implement a plan that provides measurable goals linked to achieving savings and efficiencies at the joint bases and provide guidance to the joint bases that directs them to identify opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies .
