this report examines the ( 1 ) effects of usaid's prepositioning on delivery time frames for emergency food aid shipments , ( 2 ) the effects of prepositioning on the costs of emergency food aid , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the agency monitors prepositioning to maximize time savings and cost effectiveness .
to strengthen usaid's ability to help ensure that its food aid prepositioning program meets the goal of reducing delivery time frames in a cost - effective manner , we recommend that the usaid administrator take the following three steps to systematically 1. collect , and ensure the reliability and validity of , data on delivery time frames for all emergency food aid shipments , including prepositioned food aid shipments ; 2. monitor and assess data on delivery time frames for prepositioned food aid shipments ; and 3. monitor and assess costs associated with commodity procurement , shipping , and storage for prepositioned food aid shipments .
in fiscal years 2007 to 2012 , the united states donated about $9.2 billion in emergency food aid to recipient countries under title ii of the food for peace act ( title ii ) .
u.s. international emergency food aid assists nations affected by severe ongoing crises , such as the long - term food shortage in ethiopia , as well as unanticipated crises , such as the 2010 earthquake in haiti .
the u.s. agency for international development's ( usaid ) office of food for peace , which is responsible for managing the u.s. emergency food aid program , delivers this assistance through cooperating sponsors such as the world food program ( wfp ) , catholic relief services , and save the children .
furthermore , although cost savings are not usaid's primary goal for the prepositioning program , without systematic monitoring of the total cost of prepositioning the agency has limited ability to maximize the resources available for addressing emergency food crises .
to determine the extent to which usaid has monitored prepositioning , we reviewed agency documents to assess whether usaid's monitoring was consistent with its policy and regulations .
such data could also help usaid assess the tradeoffs between prepositioning's timeliness and its additional warehouse , shipping , and commodity costs .
to determine the effects of usaid's prepositioning on the delivery time frames and costs of emergency food aid , we analyzed data for 3,785 emergency food aid shipments in fiscal years 2007 through 2012 .
further , usaid does not systematically monitor the costs of prepositioning to maximize the program's cost - effectiveness .
in addition , some emergency food aid data that are currently available from wfp and usaid's other cooperating sponsors have limitations that constrain their usefulness for monitoring delivery time frames .
as a result , usaid lacks the ability to determine whether prepositioning is achieving its primary goal of shortening response times or to identify possible time savings relative to standard emergency food aid shipments .
