 ( recommendation 9 ) .
fema and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) — components of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and the department of defense ( dod ) , respectively — used advance contracts to procure goods and services provided in response to the catastrophic disasters the united states experienced in 2017: hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria ; and the california wildfires .
the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( pkemra ) required the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) to establish advance contracts — those that are established prior to disasters and that are typically needed to quickly provide life - sustaining goods and services in the immediate aftermath of disasters .
these weaknesses were: ( 1 ) challenges in fema's acquisition planning ; ( 2 ) limited record keeping or management of certain fema contracts ; and ( 3 ) incomplete reporting on fema's advance contract actions to certain congressional committees .
 ( recommendation 8 ) fema's administrator should ensure the head of the contracting activity communicates information on available advance contracts through the centralized resource to states and localities to inform their advance contracting efforts .
contracts play a key role in immediate disaster response and longer - term community recovery .
this report specifically addresses the use of advance contracts , assessing the extent to which ( 1 ) fema and usace used advance contracts , ( 2 ) the planning , management , and reporting of selected fema and usace advance contracts met certain contracting requirements , and ( 3 ) fema and usace identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts .
these include the need for: ( 1 ) additional advance contracts for certain goods and services ; ( 2 ) flexibility to increase contract ceilings ; ( 3 ) use of usace's debris removal advance contracts to respond to the california wildfires ; and ( 4 ) federal coordination and information sharing with state and local governments on advance contracts .
this report reviews the federal government's contracting efforts for preparedness , response , and recovery efforts related to the three 2017 hurricanes and california wildfires .
in september 2015 , we found issues related to the use of advance contracts , specifically that fema's contracting officers had limited awareness about advance contract requirements and how to coordinate advance contracting efforts with state and local governments .
we also found that dhs and dod accounted for about 97 percent of those obligations .
you asked us to review the federal government's contracting efforts for preparedness , response , and recovery efforts related to the three 2017 hurricanes and california wildfires .
this report specifically addresses the use of advance contracts , assessing the extent to which ( 1 ) the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) used advance contracts , ( 2 ) the planning , management , and reporting of selected fema and usace advance contracts met certain contracting requirements , and ( 3 ) fema and usace identified any lessons learned and challenges with their use of these contracts .
in february 2018 , we found that early estimates for hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria placed them among the costliest hurricanes in terms of federal contract obligations since 2005 , when tracking this information by hurricane began .
