we included the following six civilian agencies in our review: the general services administration ( gsa ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , the department of treasury , and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) .
you requested that we ( 1 ) determine the efforts civilian federal agencies are making to address their future acquisition workforce needs and identify the challenges , if any , they have encountered and ( 2 ) identify any “lessons learned” from the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to develop strategic plans for its acquisition workforce .
as a result , rigid procurement rules have given way to rules that allow the use of more judgment and initiative on the part of the individuals who make up the acquisition workforce .
it is also striving to maximize the value of the $200 billion it spends annually by taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the commercial marketplace .
the federal government is dramatically changing the manner in which it purchases goods and services .
leading public organizations here in the united states and abroad have found that strategic human capital management must be the centerpiece of any serious change management initiative and efforts to transform the cultures of government agencies .
at the same time , some agencies are contending with the fact that the acquisition workforce has decreased by 22 percent in the last decade .
we did not assess the effectiveness of the agencies' efforts .
workforce planning provides managers with a strategic basis for making human resource decisions and allows organizations to address systematically the issues that are driving workforce change .
industry and government experts alike recognize that a key to making a successful transformation toward a more sophisticated acquisition environment is having the right people with the right skills .
in order to leverage the experiences of federal agencies' efforts , including those of dod , to address future acquisition workforce needs , we recommend that the ofpp administrator work with procurement executives to ensure that the lessons learned from these efforts are shared with all federal agencies as they continue with their initiatives to improve the acquisition workforce .
four organizations — the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) , the procurement executives council ( pec ) , and the federal acquisition institute ( fai ) — have roles to play in dealing with workforce and acquisition workforce issues .
these six agencies accounted for about 72 percent of the federal dollars contracted by civilian ( non - dod ) agencies in fiscal year 2001 .
dod has been working for several years to strengthen its civilian acquisition workforce .
hhs concurred with our findings , but provided technical comments , including clarifying that it views acquisition as critical to mission success , although acquisition is not a primary function of the agency .
three agencies are developing specific acquisition workforce plans .
finally , doe believed that the lack of management support did not pose a challenge to its efforts to improve the acquisition workforce , but that a lack of resources to implement developmental programs has been a challenge .
