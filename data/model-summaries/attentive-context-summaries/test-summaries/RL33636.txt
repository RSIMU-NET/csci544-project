although the european union's ( eu ) 27 member states have ceded some national sovereignty ( or competency ) to eu institutions in a variety of areas , including economic and trade policy , energy policy remains primarily the responsibility of the member states .
decisions regarding long - term oil or gas purchases , the development and improvement of energy - related infrastructure , and the use of particular fuels continue to be made at the national level by individual member states .
the strain on global demand exerted by the emerging economies of countries such as china and india , persistent instability in energy producing regions , the threat of terrorist strikes against energy infrastructure , and russia's apparent willingness to use its energy power for political ends , are all raising concerns in europe over how to address external influences that could affect future energy requirements .
at their march 2007 summit , eu member states moved to boost european coordination to help secure and diversify energy supplies , increase the development and use of renewable and alternative energy resources within the eu , and reduce energy demand and consumption .
recent calls for eu - wide energy coordination have been driven by rising european concern about the effects of energy production and consumption on global climate change .
although member state governments remain reluctant to cede national sovereignty over energy - security aspects of their foreign policies , they have set binding eu - wide targets for the use of renewable energies and biofuels , and have agreed to ambitious but non - binding energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction targets for the year 2020 .
as uncertainties surrounding global energy supply and demand persist , issues pertaining to u.s. , european , and global energy security are may gain importance in the second session of the 110 th congress .
members of both parties have introduced legislation aimed at increasing energy independence and energy security and reducing carbon emissions .
the commission proposals focus on three broad interconnected goals: increasing european - wide energy security ; enhancing sustainability ; and fostering competition in europe's internal energy market .
nonetheless , most observers expect member states to continue to retain significant national control over national energy markets and external relations with energy - producing countries .
europe's renewed interest in energy security has been influenced by both internal and external factors .
in several hearings during the first session of the 110 th congress , members of congress voiced concern about europe's dependence on russian energy resources , and the potential for russian manipulation of european energy markets .
internally , steadily rising energy prices , declining european energy production and a fragmented internal energy market have contributed to anxieties over europe's ability to meet future energy demand .
concern over europe's dependence on russian energy resources has corresponded with growing public calls for eu - wide action on climate change .
to this end , eu member states' recent energy policy decisions center largely on promoting energy efficiency , developing renewable energy and clean fuel sources , and reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions .
in addition , member states are considering potentially significant reforms to further liberalize energy markets .
