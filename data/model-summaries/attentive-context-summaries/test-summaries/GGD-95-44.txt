this report responds to your request that we review the internal revenue service's ( irs ) processes for handling undeliverable mail .
you asked us to identify the amount of undeliverable mail and reasons why some of the mail irs sends to taxpayers was undeliverable and the impact nondelivery of this mail had on taxpayers and irs .
we focused on notices irs sent taxpayers involving the assessment and collection of taxes .
we also assessed irs' procedures for processing undeliverable mail .
these include ( 1 ) irs' participation in a project with the postal service and other federal agencies in which the postal service will collect change of address information and provide it to the participating agencies , and ( 2 ) irs' use of the postal service's national change of address database to contact taxpayers in order to verify addresses .
since the revenue act of 1928 , irs has been required to send such notifications to a taxpayer's last known address .
to help irs better manage its undeliverable mail we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue take the following actions: better encourage taxpayers to make address changes by ( 1 ) accepting changes of address over the telephone ; ( 2 ) making form 8822 , change of address , more conveniently available ; and ( 3 ) emphasizing to taxpayers the importance of keeping their addresses current with irs .
the implementation of these recommendations should have a significant impact on reducing irs' undeliverable mail .
a taxpayer's last known address was not defined by the revenue act nor has it been defined by department of the treasury regulations .
irs recognizes this problem and generally attempts to notify taxpayers of their tax obligations by sending additional notices to addresses it believes may be more current than the addresses in its records .
although previous efforts to deal with this mail were primarily limited to irs' service center collection functions , new efforts are expected to have service - wide consequences because irs agreed in august 1994 to implement the recommendations of the taxpayer ombudsman's study .
it should allow taxpayers to make address changes with minimum effort by such means as telephoning irs or using the change of address form , which should be conveniently available .
the taxpayer ombudsman has also recommended adopting procedures to help ensure that taxpayers' addresses are accurately updated in irs' databases .
in total , 25 recommendations aimed at helping irs better deal with undeliverable mail have been made .
we identified attempts by two service centers to consolidate efforts to locate taxpayers' addresses in order to reduce costs and improve effectiveness .
not only will the accounts receivable inventory show a higher balance , the government is denied access to funds it is owed .
the recommendations included ( 1 ) developing standardized procedures for processing undeliverable mail throughout irs and making the collection function's automated systems available to other service center functions ; ( 2 ) testing alternative methods for taxpayers to provide address changes to irs , such as the use of a tear - off return stub on notices ; and ( 3 ) adopting procedures to help ensure that taxpayers' addresses would be accurately updated in its databases .
