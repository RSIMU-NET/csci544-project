the disability insurance portion of the old - age , survivors and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program was enacted in 1956 and provides benefits to disabled workers under the full retirement age ( fra ) in amounts based on an individual's career - average earnings in covered employment .
a statutory formula determines monthly payment levels for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) .
in addition , the law also eliminates from benefit calculations one year of a ssdi beneficiary's lowest earnings for every five years of earnings ( also known as the one - for - five rule ) , which equates to a maximum of five "disability dropout years" for an individual with 25 or more years of earnings .
by statute , ssa also applies "childcare dropout years" ( cdys ) for years in which a beneficiary has zero earnings due to leaving the workforce to care for an infant child .
the application of cdys is not common , affecting approximately 0.16% of ssdi beneficiaries between 2000 and 2013 .
ssdi benefits , like those of the old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) program , are meant to replace income from work that is lost by incurring one of the risks the social program insures against .
to be eligible for ssdi benefits , a worker must be ( 1 ) disability insured , and ( 2 ) unable to engage in substantial gainful activity ( sga ) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or last at least 12 months .
at five elapsed years , a disability dropout year may be credited ( in addition to the two cdys ) for three total dropout years .
the ssdi benefit payment is based on a disabled worker's average indexed monthly earnings ( aime ) , which is used in the computation of the individual's primary insurance amount ( pia ) .
in addition , a beneficiary's payment increases each year from the year of eligibility to the year of benefit receipt based on the social security cost - of - living adjustment ( cola ) .
also known as the one - for - five ( or one - fifth ) rule , for every five elapsed years of earnings , the lowest year ( s ) of earnings will be dropped , up to a maximum of five total disability dropout years for a worker with 25 or more years of earnings .
this report describes how workers become insured for ssdi benefits , how ssdi benefits are calculated , and the use of dropout years in benefit calculations .
during this period , 84.5% of beneficiaries ( 1,129 ) who were credited with cdys had a pia of less than $1,000 .
generally , an individual must have one quarter of coverage ( also referred to as "credits" ) for each calendar year after the age of 21 up to the year before the individual ( 1 ) reaches the age of 62 , ( 2 ) dies , or ( 3 ) becomes disabled .
authorized by the social security disability amendments of 1980 ( p.l .
the ssdi program is financed primarily through a payroll tax levied on workers , their employers , and self - employed individuals in jobs covered by social security .
