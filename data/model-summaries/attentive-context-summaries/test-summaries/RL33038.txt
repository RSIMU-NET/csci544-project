this report analyzes the threat to u.s. security posed by the al qaeda organization .
this report will not analyze all al qaeda - inspired movements worldwide , but it will address al qaeda's relationship with some of its known affiliates .
the state department's report on international terrorism for 2004 deems the organization as "the most prominent component" of a global movement of islamic militants that has "adopted the ideology and targeting strategies of [al qaeda founder osama] bin laden and other senior al qaeda leaders. .
although u.s. officials say that the post - september 11 struggle against al qaeda uses all aspects of u.s. national power ( legal , economic , diplomatic , as well as military ) , a cornerstone of the post - september 11 u.s. effort has been the military effort in afghanistan .
the u.s. - led war succeeded in ousting the taliban regime there ( december 2001 ) and replacing it with a pro - u.s. , moderate government .
those who take this view tend to believe that u.s. counter - efforts should focus more intently on homeland security , stressing such measures as improving airline security , establishing enhanced security measures for passenger train travel , and expanding security of u.s. ports .
some tend to favor additional powers for law enforcement to investigate potential islamist cells in the united states .
many believe that , no matter the structure and capabilities of al qaeda , stabilizing iraq will likely be crucial to reducing the recruitment of militants willing to conduct acts of terrorism against the united states and its allies .
the september 11 attacks instilled greater urgency in the u.s. effort against al qaeda .
central intelligence agency paramilitary officers and other u.s. personnel ( some as contractors ) in pakistan are dedicated to this search , assisting pakistani forces and agents .
in july 1999 , president clinton imposed a ban on u.s. trade with taliban - controlled afghanistan and froze taliban assets in the united states .
the bush administration asserts that the absence of attacks inside the united states since september 11 demonstrates that the main thrust of administration policy is succeeding .
the united states did covertly finance ( about $3 billion during 1981-1991 ) and arm ( via pakistan ) the afghan mujahedin factions , particularly the islamic fundamentalist afghan factions , fighting soviet forces .
on december 19 , 2000 , u.n. security council resolution 1333 banned any arms shipments or provision of military advice to the taliban .
many believe that the weakening of central direction renders al qaeda less able to conduct catastrophic attacks inside the united states because its diffusion limits its ability to orchestrate complicated , coordinated plots similar to the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
reflecting this view , the state department report on terrorism for 2004 ( p. 7 ) says , as do many experts , that: ... the core of al - qa'ida has suffered damage to its leadership , organization , and capabilities...at the same time , al - qa'ida has spread its anti - u.s. , anti - western ideology to other groups and geographical areas .
the clinton administration also pursued a number of covert operations against bin laden during 1999-2000 , and the bush administration considered some new options prior to september 11 , including arming anti - taliban opposition groups .
