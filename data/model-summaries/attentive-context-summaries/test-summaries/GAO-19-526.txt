 ( recommendation 6 ) .
this review addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which fema and the red cross effectively coordinated mass care in response to the 2017 hurricanes , and ( 2 ) the extent to which fema supported and used state and local assessments of mass care capabilities for the 2017 hurricanes .
hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria — which all made landfall within a 4-week time period — caused a combined $265 billion in damage , and each ranks among the five costliest hurricanes on record , according to the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
 ( recommendation 3 ) to ensure more accurate mass care capability assessments , fema should require grantees to solicit capabilities information from key mass care service - delivery providers in making capability estimates and identify these providers in their submissions .
this report is also part of gao's comprehensive evaluation of the federal government's preparedness , response , and recovery efforts related to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria .
fema has an opportunity to use its review of capability assessments to improve its ability to assist with future disasters .
 ( recommendation 4 ) to build the emergency preparedness capabilities of grantees , fema should develop systematic , documented protocols to determine the conditions under which it will follow up and provide feedback to grantees about mass care capability assessments .
three catastrophic hurricanes affected over 28 million people living in texas , florida , puerto rico , and the u.s. virgin islands during the summer and fall of 2017 .
fema and the american red cross ( red cross ) are the primary agencies responsible for coordinating mass care under the federal disaster response framework .
we are making a total of six recommendations , including the following recommendation to the secretary of homeland security: to strengthen the mass care response to future disasters , the secretary of homeland security should direct fema to periodically review the current structure of esf - 6 leadership roles and responsibilities for coordinating mass care .
fema reported that the extraordinary scale and rapid succession of these hurricanes led to unprecedented demands to feed and shelter those affected by the storms , and complicated efforts to distribute supplies , which are key components of mass care after disasters .
department of homeland security - federal emergency management department of homeland security - federal emergency management support agencies with roles directly related to mass care ( feeding , sheltering , supply distribution , and family reunification ) : corporation for national and community service department of defense / u.s. army corps of engineers department of health and human services department of homeland security department of veterans affairs national center for missing & exploited children national voluntary organizations active in disaster ( national voad ) .
 ( recommendation 5 ) we are also making the following recommendation to the american red cross: to ensure assistance reaches all survivors , red cross should develop mechanisms for it and its partners to leverage local community groups , such as conducting regular outreach to communicate and regularly share aggregate information with these groups .
however , stakeholders have raised questions about the provision of mass care services by federal , state , local , and voluntary responders , particularly for populations such as low - income families , the elderly , and individuals who have disabilities .
