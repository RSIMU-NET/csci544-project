our objectives for this report were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the air force's on - order and on - hand secondary inventory reflects the amount of inventory needed to support requirements from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , and ( 2 ) the air force had shortages in its inventory needed to support requirements from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 .
at a time when u.s. military forces and their equipment are in high demand , the effectiveness and efficiency of the department of defense's ( dod ) inventory management is critical to ensure that the warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time .
dod has reduced the overall value of its secondary inventory â€” from more than $100 billion in 1990 to about $67 billion as of september 30 , 2002 .
each of the military services and the defense logistics agency ( dla ) maintain a supply of secondary inventory of spare parts to keep military equipment operating for its missions .
since 1990 , we have identified the department's management of its secondary inventory as a high - risk area due to ineffective and inefficient inventory management systems and procedures and high levels of inventory not needed to support required inventory levels ( hereafter referred to as requirements ) .
inventory that is not in dod's possession but for which contracts have been awarded or funds have been committed is considered to be on order .
the air force represents an average of about 39 percent ( $28.9 billion ) of the value of dod's total on - hand inventory .
to meet customer expectations while minimizing inventory and to reduce the air force's inventory not needed to support requirements , we are recommending that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to take the following four actions: modify its policies to provide incentives to reduce purchases of on - order inventory that are not needed to support requirements , such as requiring contract termination review for all unneeded on - order inventory or reducing the funding available for the air force materiel command by an amount up to the value of the air force's on - order inventory that is not needed to support requirements ; conduct a comprehensive assessment of the inventory items on hand that are not needed to support requirements and that have no recurring demands and revalidate the need to continue to retain these items , and , as part of this assessment , consider establishing ongoing requirements for items supporting weapon systems that have lengthy projected life spans ; evaluate the reasons why the air force continually experiences decreases in demands which have contributed to having more than half of its inventory on hand not needed to support requirements ; and after evaluating the reasons for the decreases in demand , determine what actions are needed to address these decreases and then take steps to implement these actions .
however , in recent years the trend has been reversed due to increases in the value and quantity and changes in the mix of items in dod inventory , with inventory values increasing to about $80 billion as of september 30 , 2005 , which is a 19 percent increase from september 30 , 2002 , to september 30 , 2005 .
