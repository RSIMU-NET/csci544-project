a health insurance exchange has been established in every state , as required by the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) .
a state can choose to establish its own state - based exchange ( sbe ) .
if a state opts not to , or if the department of health and human services ( hhs ) determines that the state is not in a position to administer its own exchange , then hhs will establish and administer the exchange in the state as a federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) .
each exchange has two parts , a marketplace where individuals can shop for and enroll in health insurance coverage , and a small business health options program ( shop ) exchange for small employers .
the center for consumer information and insurance oversight ( cciio ) at cms is responsible for implementing aca's private health insurance reforms and administering the grant programs discussed above .
each exchange is expected to generate its own funds to sustain its operations beginning january 1 , 2015 .
in some cases , a state has partnered with hhs to establish and administer the exchange , and in other cases hhs is administering the individual exchange while the state administers the shop exchange .
cms has requested an increase of $227 million for its program management account in fy2015 for aca implementation and other activities .
those funds included ( 1 ) discretionary funds transferred from other hhs accounts under the secretary's transfer authority ; ( 2 ) expired discretionary funds from the nonrecurring expenses fund ( nef ) ; ( 3 ) mandatory funds from the hirif ; and ( 4 ) mandatory funds from the prevention and public health fund ( see table 2 ) .
exchanges are not intended to supplant the private market outside of exchanges , and the aca does not require that individuals and small businesses obtain coverage through an exchange .
this report provides a state - by - state breakdown of the grants awarded to date .
some individuals are eligible to receive financial assistance for their coverage obtained through an exchange , and some small employers can obtain tax credits toward coverage purchased through a shop .
to fund the establishment of exchanges , the aca authorizes the hhs secretary to award grants to states through 2014 .
it then briefly describes the requirement for exchanges to be self - sustaining , and concludes with a discussion of the sources and amounts of funding that hhs has used and plans to use to support ffe operations .
fourteen states and dc established sbes in 2014 , while the remaining 36 states have ffes .
the remaining $125 million came from the health insurance reform and implementation fund ( hirif ) , a $1 billion fund within hhs that was established and funded to help pay for the administrative costs of aca implementation .
in many states with ffes , the exchange is wholly operated and administered by hhs .
figure 1 shows the total amount of funding each state has received from the grants as well as the type of exchange ( sbe or ffe ) each state has in 2014 .
of that amount , $629 million is from cms's program management account , and the remaining $1,159 million is projected to come from ffe user fees .
