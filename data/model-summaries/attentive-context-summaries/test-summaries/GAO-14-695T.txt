within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , tsa is the primary federal agency responsible for security of the nation's transportation system .
my testimony today addresses the extent to which tsa has ( 1 ) regularly analyzed data to identify program trends and areas working well or in need of corrective action , and ( 2 ) comprehensively assessed the effectiveness of pscs , and coordinated with stakeholders to deploy psc teams to the highest - risk airports and utilize them as intended .
i appreciate the opportunity to discuss our work on the transportation security administration's ( tsa ) national explosives detection canine team program ( nedctp ) .
this statement is based on our january 2013 report and includes selected updates on the status of tsa's efforts to implement the recommendations in that report .
2135 , 2178 ( 2002 ) .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , tsa has implemented a multilayered system of security composed of people , processes , and technology to protect the transportation system .
to update our work , we obtained related documentation from tsa from october 2013 through june 2014 , including reports used by nedctp to monitor canine team training minute requirements , results of psc effectiveness assessments , and psc deployment schedules .
we recommended that tsa expand and complete testing , in conjunction with dhs s&t , to assess the effectiveness of pscs and conventional canines in all airport areas deemed appropriate prior to making additional psc deployments to help ( 1 ) determine whether pscs are effective at screening passengers , and resource expenditures for psc training are warranted , and ( 2 ) inform decisions regarding the type of canine team to deploy and where to optimally deploy such teams within airports .
the homeland security act of 2002 subsequently transferred tsa to the newly established department of homeland security .
short notice assessments ( covert tests ) : we found that when tsa was performing short notice assessments ( prior to their suspension in may 2012 ) , it was not analyzing the results beyond the pass and fail rates .
however , in june 2012 , the dhs science and technology directorate ( s&t ) and tsa began conducting effectiveness assessments on the basis of to help demonstrate the effectiveness of psc teams.these assessments , dhs s&t and tsa's nedctp recommended that the assessment team conduct additional testing and that additional training and guidance be provided to canine teams .
one of tsa's security layers is nedctp , composed of over 800 explosives detection canine teams — a canine paired with a handler — aimed at deterring and detecting the use of explosive devices in the u.s. transportation system .
nedctp's mission is to deter and detect the introduction of explosive devices into the transportation system .
enacted in november 2001 , the aviation and transportation security act established , within the department of transportation , tsa as the agency responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems .
however , dhs s&t did not plan to assess the effectiveness of pscs on the public side , beyond the checkpoint , since tsa was not planning to deploy pscs to the public side of the airport when dhs s&t designed its test plan .
