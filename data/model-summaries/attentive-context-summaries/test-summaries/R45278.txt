the chesapeake bay ( the bay ) is the largest estuary in the united states .
congress has and may continue to examine chesapeake bay restoration efforts .
this report provides background on the physical and ecological properties of the bay and watershed , its economic value , the health of the ecosystem over time , and federal governance of bay restoration efforts .
over time , the bay's ecological conditions have deteriorated due to land - use changes , increased sediment loads and nutrient pollution , the use and spread of chemical contaminants , overfishing and overharvesting of aquatic species , and the introduction of invasive species .
it then discusses issues facing congress as work continues toward 2025 restoration goals set by several state and federal plans .
it is home to more than 18 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals .
since then , federal agencies have worked together under a watershed - wide agreement and through a restoration program spearheaded by the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
actions in the chesapeake watershed have served as examples for other estuary restoration efforts in the united states .
these changes have resulted in reductions to economically important fisheries , such as oysters and crabs ; the loss of habitat , such as underwater vegetation and sea grass ; annual dead zones , as nutrient - driven algal blooms die and decompose ; and potential impacts to tourism , recreation , and real estate values .
congress has described it as a "national treasure" ( p.l .
106-457 ) , and it is recognized as a "wetlands of international importance" by the ramsar convention .
joint state and federal restoration attempts did not begin until the early 1980s .
the chesapeake bay estuary resides in a more than 64,000-square - mile watershed that extends across parts of delaware , maryland , new york , pennsylvania , virginia , west virginia , and the district of columbia .
the chesapeake bay has experienced various natural and man - made changes over the course of its existence .
congress may examine the federal government's role in restoration efforts .
in its oversight role , congress continues to weigh if and how chesapeake bay federal restoration efforts should continue .
since the cbp's inception , stakeholders have considered whether appropriate progress is being made to restore the chesapeake bay and its resources .
if there is a federal role , congress may consider how bay restoration is coordinated , how much funding is available and may be needed for bay restoration efforts , and what progress is being made in restoring the bay .
congress may consider the mechanisms in place to guide restoration activities , what role the federal government has in bay restoration , and what federal agency authorities exist or are needed to complete , coordinate , and fund restoration activities in the bay .
congress has been interested in tracking costs related to bay restoration and enacted the chesapeake bay accountability and recovery act in 2014 ( cbara ; p.l .
congress continues to be interested in whether progress is being made in restoring the bay .
congress , gao , and the epa office of inspector general ( oig ) have addressed the cbp's reporting of bay health and restoration progress .
