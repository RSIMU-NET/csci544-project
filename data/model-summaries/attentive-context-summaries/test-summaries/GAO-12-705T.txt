gsa provided the results of its study to the house and senate committees on appropriations in november 2010 and also reported on its efforts to implement the federal strategic sourcing initiative â€” office supplies ii ( os ii ) , an initiative focused on leveraging the government's buying power to realize savings .
the conferees also directed gao to assess the gsa study , with particular attention to the potential for savings .
to conduct our work , we analyzed the data gsa used for its study ; met with and obtained documentation from officials at gsa and the departments of homeland security , air force , navy , and army , which were among the 10 agencies in gsa's study ; and reviewed contract documentation associated with the os ii initiative .
concerned that federal agencies may not be getting the best prices available , the conferees on the consolidated appropriation act , 2010 , directed gsa to conduct a study of the office supply purchases made by the top 10 largest federal agencies .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the general services administration's ( gsa ) efforts to reduce prices that federal agencies pay for office supplies .
my statement is based on a report we issued last year for the subcommittees on financial services and general government of the senate and house committees on appropriations .
since purchasing of office supplies is highly decentralized , gsa obtained data for its study from multiple disparate sources , such as the federal procurement data system - next generation , the department of defense ( dod ) electronic mall , and purchase card data from commercial banks .
for purposes of this hearing , we updated gsa's savings estimates for the os ii initiative .
we also identified additional data and other limitations in gsa's study , including: gsa may not have been able to properly control for purchases of different quantities of the same item .
several new business practices have been incorporated in the os ii program to meet the goals .
as part of the overall strategy , a gsa commodity council identified five overarching goals , in addition to savings , for the os ii initiative .
while the gsa report acknowledged some limitations with the data , we identified additional data and other limitations that lead us to question the magnitude of some of gsa's reported price premiums .
to determine the amount of funds spent on office supplies and to conduct related analyses , gsa had to sort through about 7 million purchase transactions involving over 12 million items .
gsa is using a combination of agency and vendor involvement to identify key requirements and cost drivers , increase the ease of use , and obtain the data necessary to manage the program .
we were not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations .
gsa has incorporated a range of activities representative of a strategic procurement approach into the os ii initiative .
for example , gsa set up a commodity council for the federal strategic sourcing initiative second generation domestic delivery services ii program .
for example , to meet the capture data goal , gsa is collecting data on purchases and vendor performance that are assimilated and tracked through dashboards , which are high - level indicators of overall program performance .
