an effective grant proposal has to make a compelling case .
things to be considered include the following: all of the requirements of the funding source must be met: prescribed format , necessary inclusions , deadlines , etc .
the proposal should have a clear , descriptive title .
each time it has been critiqued , it may be necessary to rethink the project and its presentation .
the proposal should be a cohesive whole , building logically , with one section leading to another ; this is an especially important consideration when several people have been involved in its preparation .
not only must the idea be a good one , but so must the presentation .
language should be clear and concise , devoid of jargon ; explanations should be offered for acronyms and terms which may be unfamiliar to someone outside the field .
while such revision is necessary to clarify the proposal , one of the dangers is that the original excitement of those making the proposal sometimes gets written out .
at various stages in the proposal writing process , the proposal should be reviewed by a number of interested and disinterested parties .
each of the parts of the proposal should provide as brief but informative a narrative as possible , with supporting data relegated to an appendix .
somehow , this must be conveyed in the final proposal .
nature of the problem ( provide as much hard evidence as possible ) .
remaining alternatives available when funding has been exhausted .
this section should provide the following: a brief history of the organization , its past and present operations , its goals and mission , its significant accomplishments , any success stories .
one of the pitfalls to be avoided is defining the problem as a lack of program or facility ( i.e. , giving one of the possible solutions to a problem as the problem itself ) .
restraint is important in determining inflationary cost projections ( avoid padding budget line items ) , but the applicant may attempt to anticipate possible future increases .
applicants are advised: make it interesting ! .
indicate whether funds for other parts of the project are being sought elsewhere ; such evidence will strengthen the proposal , demonstrating to the reviewing officer that all avenues of support have been thoroughly explored .
qualifications of its professional staff , and a list of its board of directors .
the applicant may discuss maintenance and future program funding if program funds are for construction activity ; and may account for other needed expenditures if the program includes purchase of equipment .
most federal agencies now require some form of program evaluation among grantees .
for federal grants , it is also important to become familiar with grants management requirements .
the consequences of the project as a result of funding should be highlighted , for example , statistical projections of how many people might benefit from the project's accomplishments .
the evaluation component is two - fold: ( 1 ) product evaluation and ( 2 ) process evaluation .
review the resources needed , considering how they will be used and to what end .
reference should be made to grants , endorsements , and press coverage the organization has already received ( with supporting documentation included in the appendix ) .
