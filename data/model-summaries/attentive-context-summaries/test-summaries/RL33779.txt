endangered and threatened species — and the law that protects them , the 1973 endangered species act ( esa , 16 u.s.c .
the most common cause of species' decline is habitat loss or alteration .
because of strong support and strong opposition , esa has not been reauthorized since the last authorization expired in 1992 .
 ) — are controversial , in part , because dwindling species are often harbingers of resource scarcity .
congress faces the issue of how to balance these interests ( which may fall on various sides of any given species controversy ) with the protection of endangered and threatened species and , as stated in esa , "the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend. .
consequently , congressional efforts in the 110 th congress focused on addressing specific controversial features of esa and on oversight of concerns such as the science used for making decisions and designation of critical habitat .
esa has been among the most contentious environmental laws , because of its strict substantive provisions , which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources .
habitat loss occurs due to development , changes in land management practices , competition from invasive species , and other factors , nearly all related to economic , political , or social interests .
increasing numbers of animal and plant species face possible extinction .
in the 109 th congress , there were several unsuccessful attempts to enact comprehensive legislation that would have reauthorized the esa .
§§ 1531 , et seq .
esa reauthorization has been on the legislative agenda since the funding authorization expired in 1992 , and bills have been introduced in each subsequent congress to address various aspects of endangered species protection .
others argue ( and the courts have largely agreed ) that fws and nmfs have misinterpreted and failed to enforce the current statute .
issues for the 110 th congress included effects of esa on private and federal land use , promotion of species recovery , agency use of scientific information , specific regional resource conflicts , and other matters .
in the absence of federal regulatory action on climate change , environmental groups are eyeing use of the endangered species act ( among other approaches ) as a means of restricting greenhouse gas emissions .
below are descriptions of some of the issues that were considered , either in oversight or legislation .
with limited exceptions , fws or nmfs must designate ch at the time a species is listed .
1422 ; s. 2223 , as reported by the senate committee on finance on october 24 , 2007 ( s.rept .
there are also disagreements over the value and timing of ch designation .
there may be little information on many species facing extinction , and only limited personnel or funds available to conduct studies on many of the less charismatic species , or those of little known economic import .
the 110 th congress considered several proposals to provide compensation to landowners who voluntarily provide habitat to threatened or endangered species: s. 700 ; h.r .
fws and nmfs developed an interagency cooperative policy on information standards under the endangered species act .
however , some critics argue that ch designation places undue burdens on landowners or that it has little conservation benefit .
