recognizing this potential , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) has included microenterprise development in the agency's strategy for economic development and poverty reduction .
to assist your committee in overseeing the agency's management of its microenterprise development program , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine the extent to which usaid's microfinance activities are meeting the program's key objectives , ( 2 ) assess the reliability of the agency's reporting on its overall microenterprise activities , and ( 3 ) examine the agency's role in identifying and disseminating microenterprise best practices .
to determine whether the u.s. agency for international development's ( usaid ) microenterprise development program is meeting its key objectives , we first identified those objectives by reviewing the agency's policy guidance and the pertinent legislation .
the key objectives of usaid's microenterprise development program are to reduce poverty among microenterprise owners , workers , and families ; target the poor and the very poor ; encourage participation by women ; and develop sustainable microfinance institutions ( mfi ) .
the microenterprise for self - reliance and international anti - corruption act of 2000 , enacted on october 17 , 2000 , expressed strong congressional support for microenterprise projects , stated policy preferences for implementing such projects , and authorized increased funding .
microenterprises — small businesses owned and operated by poor entrepreneurs — have potential to help the least advantaged populations in the developing world .
to identify key program objectives , we reviewed usaid's policy guidance and the microenterprise for self - reliance and international anti - corruption act of 2000 .
despite the general reliability of its data , certain methodological weaknesses in usaid's mrr system may prevent the agency from reporting with precision its program expenditures , the percentage of its funds going to the very poor , the percentage of mfis that are sustainable , and the extent of usaid's contributions to the institutions it supports .
efforts to reach the very poor that do not recognize and address these key concerns may not be fully effective .
in 2001 , the agency reported that it was conducting microenterprise projects in 52 countries and had obligated almost $2 billion since 1988 to support its program .
since 1996 , usaid has annually surveyed missions and implementing institutions regarding their microenterprise activities and issued a report to congress .
in its comments , usaid also agreed to ( 1 ) provide more explicit instructions on what activities to include in the mrr ; ( 2 ) revise the formula for estimating the extent of funding that benefits the very poor and include in its annual report additional language concerning the formula ; ( 3 ) improve the accuracy of data on obligations and poverty lending ; and ( 4 ) adopt a new standardized definition of sustainability if one is adopted by the field .
the majority of usaid's microenterprise funding supports microfinance services , particularly micro loans .
to determine whether usaid is meeting these objectives , we interviewed officials from usaid , usaid's implementing partners , and experts ; conducted fieldwork in peru , egypt , and bulgaria , three countries with established usaid microenterprise programs ; and reviewed academic and applied studies of microenterprise projects and outcomes .
