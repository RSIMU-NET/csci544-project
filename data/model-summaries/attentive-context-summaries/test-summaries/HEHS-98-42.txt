specifically , you asked us to evaluate ( 1 ) why women's benefits are lower than men's under the current social security system , ( 2 ) the possible differential effects on women of the new privatization reform proposals , and ( 3 ) what can be done to minimize the possibly negative effect on women of certain elements of the social security reform proposals .
increasing longevity and falling birth rates over the past 50 years have led to a growth in the elderly's share of the u.s. population .
this demographic change has led to a serious long - term financing problem for the social security system .
the share that is 65 and older is expected to continue to increase from 13 percent of the total u.s. population today to 20 percent by 2050 .
several different reform plans have been proposed to address the financing problem , and all would affect the financial well - being of current and future beneficiaries .
on april 10 , 1997 , we testified before the house ways and means subcommittee on social security on the issue of social security reform and women's retirement income .
although social security currently has more revenue than expenditures , over the next 75 years revenues are projected to be about 14 percent less than total projected expenditures .
some current beneficiaries , especially older unmarried women , are already experiencing higher poverty rates than other groups in the aged population and may be increasingly vulnerable if particular options are selected .
subsequently , you asked us to extend our analysis of the effect of the various reform proposals on women .
to evaluate these issues , we reviewed the literature on women's labor force participation and earnings , spoke with social security and insurance industry analysts , analyzed data on individual annuity benefits for men and women , and conducted an econometric analysis to estimate the relative levels of risk aversion of men and women .
among the various proposals for restoring long - term financial balance to the social security system are several that call for some degree of privatization .
social security is a retirement income program whose benefits are based , in part , on an individual's earnings .
in part , because of the anticipated increase in the size of the elderly population and the growing proportion of the total population that the elderly will constitute over the next 33 years , social security's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2029 .
a number of proposals have emerged to resolve this difficulty , with a great deal of variety in terms of both how the social security program would be structured and who would be eligible for benefits .
women's social security benefits are currently lower , on average , than men's because their labor force participation rates and earnings are lower .
some of these privatization proposals would redesign the social security system , patterning it , in part , after some private sector pension plans , such as 401 ( k ) plans .
women's labor force participation rates continue to be lower than men's at every age , despite substantial increases in women's rates in the past 35 years .
