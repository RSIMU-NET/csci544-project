this report examines ( 1 ) the number of mine plans the bureau of land management ( blm ) and the forest service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , the time it took these agencies to complete the mine plan review process , and the extent to which these agencies track this process ; and ( 2 ) the challenges , if any , that have affected the length of time for blm and the forest service to complete the review process , and the actions , if any , these agencies have taken to address these challenges .
without modifying the system to provide such information , blm is limited in its ability to effectively oversee the extraction of minerals from federal land and manage the mine plan review process .

the mining law of 1872 encouraged development of the west by opening up federal land to exploration , extraction , and development of hardrock minerals such as gold , silver , and copper .
the forest service ( responding on behalf of agriculture ) generally agreed with the findings in the report and indicated that our recommendations are consistent with efforts they have underway or plan to incorporate .
in addition , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to take actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions by , for example , developing guidance for mine operators and agency field officials that instructs them to hold pre - plan submittal meetings whenever possible ; issue a rule that assesses fees associated with reviewing hardrock mine plans that involve conducting environmental assessments ; and create new codes in its lr2000 database distinguishing between different types of mine plans to help track the length of time to complete the mine plan review process .
to determine the number of mine plans that were approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , we examined data from blm's legacy rehost 2000 ( lr2000 ) system and the forest service's locatable minerals database — automated information systems the agencies use to track key dates and milestones in the mine plan review process .
to ensure effective oversight , strengthen internal controls , and address challenges associated with the hardrock mine plan review process , we are making two recommendations to the secretary of agriculture and three to the secretary of the interior .
