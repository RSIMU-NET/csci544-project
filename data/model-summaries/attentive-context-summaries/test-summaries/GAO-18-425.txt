the department of education's assistant secretary for civil rights should determine the extent to which title ix coordinators at the k - 12 level are aware of and using the tools recommended in ocr's existing guidance and any barriers preventing their use of this guidance , and use this information in ocr's efforts to encourage them to work with athletics administrators on ensuring equal athletic opportunities .
