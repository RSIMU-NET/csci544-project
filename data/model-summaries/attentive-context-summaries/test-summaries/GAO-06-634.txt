recently , however , nasa acknowledged that the program has experienced cost growth exceeding $1 billion — which increased its life - cycle cost estimate from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion — and its schedule has slipped nearly 2 years .
because of the restructuring and past cost and schedule problems , we reviewed the program to determine the extent to which the jwst program's acquisition strategy follows nasa acquisition policy and government accountability office ( gao ) best practices for ensuring that adequate product knowledge is used to make informed investments .
to assess the extent to which the jwst acquisition strategy follows nasa policy and gao best practices for ensuring readiness to proceed into implementation , we reviewed nasa policy on program management and compared the jwst project office's management approach to nasa policy .
to assess the extent to which the jwst acquisition strategy follows nasa policy and gao best practices for ensuring readiness to proceed into implementation , we reviewed nasa policy guidance and compared it with the jwst program's acquisition strategy .
instruct the jwst program to continue to adhere to nasa acquisition policy and base the program's go / no - go review ( nar ) decision not only on adherence to that policy , but also on ( 1 ) the program's ability to demonstrate whether it is meeting the knowledge markers outlined earlier and ( 2 ) whether adequate funds are available to execute the program .
as the expected follow - on to the tremendously successful hubble space telescope , the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is being designed to explore the early universe and allow scientists to shed light on the origins and nature of the universe by allowing them to look deeper into space — and thus farther back in time — than ever before .
the agency restructured the program and is now anticipating a launch no sooner than june 2013 .
our nation faces large , growing , and structural long - term fiscal imbalances .
the jwst program recently revised its acquisition strategy to conform to nasa's acquisition policies ; however , the program still faces considerable challenges .
we also benchmarked the jwst acquisition strategy to best practices .
using a knowledge - based approach for nasa's new development programs such as the jwst could help the agency make the difficult choices about how to allocate its limited budget resources among competing priorities by utilizing common and consistent criteria in program evaluations .
the program needs to have sufficient knowledge at key junctures to successfully address its challenges and use incremental markers to make certain that resources in terms of knowledge , time , workforce , and money match the requirements .
given the severity of the fiscal challenges our nation faces and the wide range of competing federal programs , hard choices need to be considered across the government , and nasa is no exception .
we conducted our work under the comptroller general's authority and are addressing this report to you because of your committee's or subcommittee's interest in nasa activities .
we interviewed nasa and contractor officials to clarify our understanding of the program's management approach and technology development plan .
