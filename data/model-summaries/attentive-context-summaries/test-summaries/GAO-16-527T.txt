thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss some of the unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) pilot personnel challenges that the department of defense ( dod ) faces .
i will focus my remarks today on dod's progress in ( 1 ) taking actions to strengthen the management of air force uas pilots , ( 2 ) addressing challenges the army faces to ensure that its uas pilots complete their required training and receive high - quality training , and ( 3 ) coordinating the training of uas pilots within dod .
the air force flies the mq - 1 ( predator ) , the mq - 9 ( reaper ) , and the rq - 4 ( global hawk ) while the army flies the rq - 7 ( shadow ) , the mq - 5 ( hunter ) and the mq - 1c ( gray eagle ) .
in recent years , the size , sophistication , and cost of dod's uas portfolio has grown considerably , as has the demand for trained uas pilots .
in april 2014 and may 2015 , we reported on these other issues and made ten recommendations to dod to improve the air force's management of uas pilots , address army uas pilot training challenges , and enhance dod coordination of uas pilot training .
however , as of march 2016 , the office of the assistant secretary of defense ( readiness ) has not yet issued the dod - wide uas training strategy .
we found in our prior work that in recent years , the air force has not provided a sufficient number of uas pilots to meet requirements due to several factors including most notably the increase in demand for intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance .
however , without addressing if and how the services can enhance their coordination efforts on training uas pilots in dod's forthcoming training strategy , the services may not be able to achieve additional benefits to the efficiency and effectiveness of uas pilot training across the department .
in addition , the review included recommendations to increase emphasis on training in uas units including that the army should ( 1 ) issue guidance to unit commanders on uas training ; ( 2 ) ensure that uas warrant officers are qualified on their uas ; ( 3 ) increase the amount of home station training for uas units ; and ( 4 ) establish a system to report uas training readiness on unit status reports .
we recommended that dod establish a dod - wide uas training strategy to resolve challenges that affect the ability of the air force and the army to train personnel for uas operations and dod concurred with that recommendation .
we asked the army to provide information to update our may 2015 report to show ( 1 ) the amount of unit training that uas pilots completed in fiscal year 2015 , and ( 2 ) actions the army had taken in response to its internal recommendations to increase emphasis on unit training .
the army has not fully addressed challenges related to uas pilots completing their required training and its use of less experienced instructors , which could affect training quality .
agencies should identify the human , information technology , physical , and financial resources needed to initiate or sustain their coordinated effort .
