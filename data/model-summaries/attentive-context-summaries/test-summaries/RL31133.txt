in addition , congress has adopted a number of authorizations for the use of military force , the most recent being the joint resolution enacted on october 16 , 2002 , authorizing the use of military force against iraq .

the report does not address the issue of the constitutionality of presidential uses of military force absent a declaration of war or authorization for the use of force .
to buttress the nation's ability to prosecute a war or armed conflict , congress has also enacted numerous statutes which confer standby authority on the president or the executive branch and are activated by the enactment of a declaration of war , the existence of a state of war , or the promulgation of a declaration of national emergency .
pursuant to that power , congress has enacted 11 declarations of war during the course of american history relating to five different wars , the most recent being those that were adopted during world war ii .
this report examines a number of topics related to declarations of war and authorizations for the use of military force by the united states .
article i , section 8 , of the constitution vests in congress the power "to declare war. .
the report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
these reasons have included armed attacks on united states territory or its citizens , and attacks on or direct threats to united states rights or interests as a sovereign nation .
from the washington administration to the present , there have been 11 separate formal declarations of war against foreign nations enacted by congress and the president , encompassing five different wars â€” the war of 1812 with great britain , the war with mexico in 1846 , the war with spain in 1898 , the first world war , and the second world war .
from the administration of president john adams to the present , there have been various instances when legislation has been enacted authorizing the use of military force by the president instead of formally declaring war .
in each case the enactment of a formal declaration of war has been preceded by a presidential request to congress for such an action , either in writing or in person before a joint session of congress .
more recently , due to an expansive interpretation of the president's constitutional authority as commander - in - chief of the armed forces and of his inherent powers to use force without congressional authorization , the president has welcomed support from the congress in the form of legislation authorizing him to utilize u.s. military forces in a foreign conflict or engagement in support of u.s. interests , but has not taken the view that he is required to obtain such authorization .
