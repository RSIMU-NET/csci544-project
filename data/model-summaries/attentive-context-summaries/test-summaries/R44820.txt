u.s. insurers and congress face new policy issues and questions related to the opportunities and risks presented by the growth in the international insurance market and trade in insurance products .
insurance is often seen as a localized product and u.s. insurance regulation has addressed this through a state - centric regulatory system .
the international aspects of insurance have spurred the creation of a variety of entities and measures , both domestic and foreign , to facilitate the trade and regulation of insurance services .
the mccarran - ferguson act , passed by congress in 1945 , gives primacy to the individual states , and every state has its own insurance regulator and state laws governing insurance .
the new federal involvement in insurance issues , both domestic and international , has created frictions both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities , and has been a subject of both congressional hearings and proposed legislation .
financial services have been addressed in a number of u.s. trade agreements going back to the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) in 1994 .
the international association of insurance supervisors ( iais ) was created more than 20 years ago , largely under the impetus of the u.s. national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , to promote cooperation and exchange of information among insurance supervisors , including development of regulatory standards .
while the risks of loss and the regulation may be local , the business of insurance , as with many financial services , has an increasingly substantial international component as companies look to grow and diversify .
the 2007-2009 financial crisis sparked further international developments , with heads of state of the g - 20 nations creating the financial stability board ( fsb ) .
the postcrisis 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank ) altered the u.s. insurance regulatory system , particularly as it relates to international issues .
with the states continuing as the primary insurance regulators , following dodd - frank , the federal reserve exercised holding company oversight over insurers who owned a bank subsidiary or who were designated for enhanced supervision ( popularly known as systemically important financial institutions or sifis ) by the new financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) , which includes a presidentially appointed , independent voting member with insurance expertise .
this report discusses trade in insurance services and summarizes the various international entities and agreements affecting the regulation of and trade in insurance .
the fio is not a federal insurance regulator , but is tasked with representing the united states in international fora and , along with the united states trade representative ( ustr ) , can negotiate international covered agreements relating to insurance prudential measures .
dodd - frank also created a new federal insurance office ( fio ) .
it then addresses particular issues and controversies in greater depth , including the u.s. - eu covered agreement and issues relating to international insurance standards , and concludes with a section addressing legislation in the 115 th congress .
the statute limits the preemption with a provision that ( j ) savings provisions .
 — nothing in this section shall — ( 1 ) preempt — ( a ) any state insurance measure that governs any insurer's rates , premiums , underwriting , or sales practices ; ( b ) any state coverage requirements for insurance ; ( c ) the application of the antitrust laws of any state to the business of insurance ; or ( d ) any state insurance measure governing the capital or solvency of an insurer , except to the extent that such state insurance measure results in less favorable treatment of a non - united state insurer than a united states insurer ; further strictures are placed on the determination , including notice to the states involved and to congressional committees ; public notice and comment in the federal register ; and the specific application of the administrative procedure act , including de novo determination by courts in a judicial review .
