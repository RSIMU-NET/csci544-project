the mfn term , however , has remained universally in use in international trade relations,including trade agreements to which the united states is party .
in international trade , the expression "most - favored - nation," usually abbreviated "mfn,"status ( or treatment ) has a specific meaning quite different from what it appears to mean .
the understandable misinterpretation of the most - favored - nation term in its literal meaning,particularly in the context of u.s. trade policy of the mid - 1990s toward china , gave rise tolegislation ( 1 ) to replace theoften misleading term "most - favored - nation" treatment in the seven instances in the existing and inall future u.s. legislation with the term "normal trade relations" ( ntr ) or another appropriateexpression .
defined in a more specific detail in article i of thegeneral agreements on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) 1994 , an integral part of the world tradeorganization agreement , the term denotes the reciprocal extension of any concessions , privileges,or immunities granted , or yet to be granted , by a country in a trade agreement ( or in some other way ) to one country which is , or would be , the "most favored" in this respect to all countries to which itaccords mfn treatment .
whilesuggesting special and exclusive privileges granted to one country , it means in reality equal treatmentof all countries granted the mfn treatment .
because of this fact and for reasonsof historical continuity both terms ( mfn and ntr ) are used in this report with the identical meaningand also interchangeably with the term "nondiscriminatory," a term also often used in u.s. tradelegislation .
in this report , the mfn ( ntr ) treatment is discussed in the specific context of tariffs,because of the origins and historical development of the concept in the u.s. law and practice,particularly the denial or restoration of such treatment to nonmarket economy countrie .
thus , theextension of mfn treatment to a country can often mean a significantly lower cost and , hence,greater competitiveness of its products in the extending country's markets than would otherwise bethe case .
as a consequence , all countries to which a country extends mfn treatmentare , or would be , treated by the extending country equally or in a "nondiscriminatory" fashion .
in practice , the principal benefit a country gains from being accorded mfn status by anothercountry is that the latter's imports from the former are dutied at concessional rates ( often referred toas "mfn" rates , and listed in the u.s. tariff schedules as "general" ) rather than full rates .
all countries other than those to whichmfn treatment is specifically denied by law ( as listed in general note 3 ( b ) of the harmonized tariffschedule of the united states ) have mfn status .
there are three basic , often overlapping , ways in which the united states accords generalmfn treatment to its trading partners .
the continuation in force of an nme country's temporary mfn status is contingent on ( 1 ) automatic triennial extensions of the underlying trade agreement and ( 2 ) periodic renewal of theauthority of the jackson - vanik amendment .
