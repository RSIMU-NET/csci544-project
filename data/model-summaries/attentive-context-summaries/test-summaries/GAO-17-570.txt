the 11 selected agencies include the following: the departments of commerce ( commerce ) , energy ( doe ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( doj ) , and transportation ( dot ) , as well as the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , federal communications commission ( fcc ) , federal trade commission ( ftc ) , national science foundation ( nsf ) , and office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) .
these and other efforts , while under way , are likely to take several years or longer to fully implement and measure success .
recent advancements in iot - related technologies , such as the decreasing cost and size of electronics and the expansion of connectivity ( e.g. , broadband networks and wi - fi ) have allowed not only individuals and businesses , but also governments and communities , to use connected objects to gather and communicate new types and quantities of information .
for example , “smart” traffic lights may collect and evaluate real - time traffic information to update traffic signals' timing to reflect current traffic conditions , with the goal of improving traffic flow by easing congestion and reducing vehicles' emissions .
the internet of things ( iot ) generally refers to the technologies and devices that allow for the network connection and interaction of a wide array of devices , or “things,” throughout such places as buildings , vehicles , transportation infrastructure , or homes .
the u.s. government has shown increased interest in supporting iot in communities , in part to harness the economic potential ; help address anticipated challenges , such as risks to privacy or security ; and promote replicability — that is , make it easier for projects in one community to be deployed in other communities .
as a result of these advances , communities — both at home and abroad — are increasingly deploying projects with iot devices , generally with a goal of improving livability , management , service delivery , or competitiveness .
iot devices , or “smart” devices , are increasingly being used to communicate and process information to an extent that was not possible before .
how selected communities are using federal funds to deploy iot projects , including any challenges they face in integrating those projects .
the european union ( eu ) and some foreign governments also have made investments in supporting iot projects in communities .
for example , the eu , in 2015 , funded three large - scale pilot projects with the aim of identifying and deploying integrated community solutions — that is , projects or technologies that aim to meet community goals .
to identify how selected communities are using federal funds to deploy iot projects and any challenges they face in integrating those projects , we conducted semi - structured interviews by telephone or in person with representatives from multiple stakeholders groups in four communities that are using federal efforts to implement iot projects — chattanooga , tennessee ; chicago , illinois ; columbus , ohio ; and portland , oregon .
we requested comments on a draft of this product from commerce , doe , hhs , dhs , doj , dot , epa , fcc , ftc , nsf , and ostp .
