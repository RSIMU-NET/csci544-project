this report covers fiscal year 2014 and addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies met sbir and sttr program spending requirements , ( 2 ) the extent to which agencies and sba complied with certain program reporting requirements , ( 3 ) the potential effects of basing the spending requirements for the programs on an agency's total r&d budget authority instead of its extramural r&d obligations , and ( 4 ) what is known about how much agencies spent to administer the programs .
federal agencies support research or research and development ( r&d ) projects at small businesses through the small business innovation research ( sbir ) and small business technology transfer ( sttr ) programs .
federal agencies have awarded more than 150,000 contracts and grants , totaling more than $40 billion , through these programs since their inception in 1982 and 1992 , respectively .
complete the required reporting on the administrative pilot program for fiscal year 2014 , which could include an evaluation of the potential constraints that may hinder agencies' participation and any steps to address these constraints .
as part of its technical comments , sba provided additional information on steps it has taken to identify why its annual reports to congress have taken so long to complete and corrective actions it has taken to address the delays .
this administrative pilot program , as outlined in the reauthorization and policy directives , allows agencies to use not more than 3 percent of the funding allocated to the sbir program for new activities , including program administration ; outreach ; commercialization ; standardization and simplification of program procedures ; prevention of waste , fraud , and abuse ; and reporting .
the first report , issued in november 2013 , covered fiscal years 2006 through 2011 ; the second report , issued in june 2014 , covered fiscal year 2012 ; and the third report , issued in april 2015 , covered fiscal year 2013 .
the data that the agencies submitted to the small business administration ( sba ) indicate that 9 of the 11 participating agencies spent amounts for the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program that met or exceeded their fiscal year 2014 spending requirements , while spending for the remaining 2 agencies did not meet the requirements .
the 2011 reauthorization includes a provision for us to annually review the participating agencies' compliance with spending and reporting requirements for the programs , as well as other aspects of the programs .
these awards have supported development and commercialization of innovative technologies .
third , because sba has not submitted a report on the administrative pilot program to congress for fiscal year 2014 , it has not evaluated the effects of potential constraints on agencies' ability to participate in the pilot program for that year and the steps needed to address these constraints .
for example , one company , sanaria , received multiple sbir awards totaling approximately $10.8 million to develop a vaccine aimed at preventing malaria infection and disease among individuals living in severely affected areas .
sba has taken actions to address some of these recommendations and sba officials have told us of their plans to address others .
