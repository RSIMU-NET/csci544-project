in the context of these two arrangements , you asked us to determine the ( 1 ) legal authority niehs and ord used to enter into the arrangements with acc ; ( 2 ) extent to which niehs and ord evaluated and managed the possibility that conflicts of interest could result from their arrangements with acc ; ( 3 ) extent to which niehs complied with nih's gift acceptance policy when accepting acc's funds ; and ( 4 ) extent to which similar research arrangements exist within other offices and programs of nih and epa , as well as other regulatory agencies .
in fiscal year 2002 , the federal government devoted an estimated $45 billion to research , $35 billion of which funded research conducted by universities , industry , nonprofit organizations and state and local governments .
some agencies fund this extramural research through direct federal grants to or contracts with researchers , which are generally considered an effective way to encourage federal and nonfederal research partnerships .
a goal of both research arrangements is to provide scientific tools or knowledge that will ultimately help improve the effectiveness of human health and ecological risk assessments .
in addition , nih emphasized that is it not a regulatory agency and suggested changes to the report to clarify its role .
in addition , we contacted officials at the food and drug administration ( fda ) and the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , both of which , like epa , are regulatory agencies that have significant extramural research budgets .
the american chemistry council ( acc ) — a nonprofit organization that represents the chemical industry — has entered into two such research arrangements ; one with the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) in the national institutes of health ( nih ) , and the other with the office of research and development ( ord ) in the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
however , nih's policy — both the wide discretion allowed in deciding on whether and how officials should evaluate conflicts of interest and the lack of required documentation — provides little assurance of systematic evaluation of gifts that may present potential conflicts of interest for the agency .
the director of nih should further revise the nih gift acceptance policy to require nih officials to evaluate gifts , particularly from organizations that represent regulated industry , for potential conflicts of interest and to document the basis for their decisions , including what , if any , steps are needed to manage potential conflicts .
as requested by the ranking member of the subcommittee on environment , technology and standards , house committee on science , and the ranking member of the subcommittee on research , house committee on science , we determined the ( 1 ) legal authority the national institutes of health's ( nih ) national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) and the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) office of research and development ( ord ) used to enter into arrangements with the american chemistry council ( acc ) ; ( 2 ) extent to which niehs and ord evaluated and managed the possibility that conflicts of interest could result from their arrangements ; ( 3 ) extent to which niehs complied with nih's gift acceptance policy when accepting acc's funds ; and ( 4 ) extent to which similar research arrangements exist within other offices and programs within nih and epa , as well as other regulatory agencies .
