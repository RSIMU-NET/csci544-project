my testimony is based on several previously published gao reports on stem education , including our january 2012 report entitled science , technology , engineering , and mathematics education: strategic planning needed to better manage overlapping programs across multiple agencies and also addresses actions taken by the administration to better plan and coordinate federal stem education programs since our 2012 report was issued.agencies and programs that provided funding for stem education programs in fiscal year 2010 ; ( 2 ) the extent to which these stem programs overlap ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which federal stem education programs have measured their effectiveness and were aligned to a governmentwide strategy .
the lack of performance outcome measures may hinder decision makers' ability to assess how agencies' stem education efforts contribute to agencywide performance goals and the overall federal stem effort .
in addition to the federal effort , state and local governments , universities and colleges , and the private sector have also developed programs that provide opportunities for students to pursue stem education and occupations .
we interviewed officials from the office of management and budget ( omb ) and ostp , and officials from other federal agencies that administer stem education programs .
these programs can serve an important role both by helping to prepare students for careers in stem fields and by enhancing the nation's global competitiveness .
over the decades , congress and the executive branch have continued to create new stem education programs , even though , as we previously reported , there has been a general lack of assessment of how well stem programs are working .
however , research shows that despite this investment , the united states lacks a strong pipeline of future workers in stem fields and that u.s. students continue to lag behind students in other highly technological nations in mathematics and science achievement .
in conclusion , if nstc's 5-year strategic plan is not developed in a way that aligns agencies' efforts to achieve governmentwide goals , enhances the federal government's ability to assess what works , and concentrates resources on those programs that advance the strategy , the federal government may spend limited funds in an inefficient and ineffective manner that does not best help to improve the nation's global competitiveness .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the findings from our prior work on fragmentation , overlap , and potential duplication in federally funded science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) education programs .
governmentwide strategic planning could help better align federal efforts in an efficient and effective manner .
to conduct this work , we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations as well as previous gao work on overlap , duplication , and fragmentation .
for our 2012 report , we reviewed fiscal year 2010 annual performance plans and reports of the 13 agencies with stem programs and found that most agencies did not connect stem education activities to agency goals or measure and report on the progress of those activities .
a framework for monitoring agency progress towards nstc's strategic plan is necessary to improve transparency and strengthen accountability of nstc's strategic planning and coordination efforts .
overlap among stem education programs is not new .
