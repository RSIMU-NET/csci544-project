this report assesses the extent to which ( 1 ) dod and faa have identified security and operations risks and approved solutions to address these risks to military aircraft equipped with ads - b out technology ; and ( 2 ) dod has implemented key tasks in the 2007 deputy secretary of defense memorandum on implementing nextgen ( hereinafter referred to as the 2007 nextgen memorandum ) .
this report assesses the extent to which ( 1 ) the department of defense ( dod ) and the faa have identified security and operations risks and approved solutions to address these risks to military aircraft equipped with ads - b out technology ; and ( 2 ) dod has implemented key tasks in the 2007 deputy secretary of defense memorandum on implementing nextgen .
senate report 114-255 , accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2017 , included a provision that we assess issues related to the defense implications of implementation of the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) and automatic dependent surveillance — broadcast ( ads - b ) , a main component of nextgen .
we interviewed officials from norad , dod , and faa about potential risks , vulnerabilities , and mitigation strategies .
the north american aerospace defense command ( norad ) and dod have also expressed concerns about the faa's plan to decommission faa legacy radar systems on which norad relies to conduct aerospace warning and aerospace control missions , and on which dod relies to conduct its air traffic missions .
these documents address ads - b implementation , acquisition , operations , cybersecurity , risk management and mitigation , and any other issues that may be pertinent to identifying and addressing operations and security risks resulting from ads - b .
this technology — known as automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast ( ads - b ) out — is a key component of the faa's next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) , which seeks to modernize the current ground - based radar system to a satellite - derived system for automated aircraft position reporting , navigation , and digital communications .
to assess the extent to which dod and faa have identified risks and approved solutions to address these risks to military aircraft equipped with ads - b out technology , we reviewed policies , procedures , guidance , assessments , and other relevant documents from norad , dod , and faa .
while military aircraft and existing radar systems may be equipped with other devices ( such as mode s transponders ) that could also pose security risks , this report focused primarily on risks and potential solutions associated with ads - b out technology that faa mandated dod to install on its aircraft by january 1 , 2020 .
this report does not identify specific classified details of dod assessments , security risks , and other actions dod is taking to address security risks related to ads - b out or the nextgen system that dod deemed to be sensitive .
over the years , the department of defense ( dod ) has expressed concern about the operations security risk of openly transmitting flight data from military aircraft .
