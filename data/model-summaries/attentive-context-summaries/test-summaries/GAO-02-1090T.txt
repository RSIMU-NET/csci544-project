there are concerns that the projected increases in freight tonnage for all transportation modes will place pressures on the marine , aviation , and highway transportation systems .
my testimony today , which is based on our report that is being issued today , addresses three topics: ( 1 ) the federal funding approaches used for the marine transportation system as compared with the aviation and highway systems , ( 2 ) the amount of customs duties on imported goods shipped through the marine , aviation , and highway systems , and ( 3 ) a framework to assist the congress as it considers future federal investment decisions .
an intermodal perspective appears especially important as the nation reacts to the increased security needs for transportation networks and as it plans for better , more efficient transportation for the future .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss challenges in defining the federal role with respect to freight transportation issues .
as a result , there is growing awareness of the need to view various transportation modes , and freight movement in particular , from an integrated standpoint , particularly for the purposes of developing and implementing a federal investment strategy and considering alternative funding approaches .
diverse industry stakeholders believe that substantial new investments in the maritime infrastructure may be required from public and private sources because of an aging infrastructure , changes in the shipping industry , and increased concerns about security .
to develop a framework to assist the congress in making decisions about the federal role in financing the marine transportation system , we built on prior gao work on federal investment approaches and managerial best practices and interviewed u.s. army corps of engineers and department of transportation officials .
the federal approach for funding the marine transportation system relies heavily on general revenues , while the approach for funding the aviation and highway systems relies almost exclusively on collections from users of the systems .
our recently completed work on marine transportation is based on our analysis of data collected from 15 federal agencies that expended revenue on the various transportation systems and / or collected funds from users of the systems during fiscal years 1999 through 2001 .
the first component — establishing national goals for the system — requires an in - depth understanding of the needs of the system and the relationship of the system to other transportation modes .
for example , in the $2.4 billion alameda corridor program , state and local stakeholders had both a financial incentive to relieve congestion and the commitment and ability to bring financial resources to bear .
a third component — determining the funding tools and other approaches that will maximize the impact of any federal investment — is important to help expand the capacity to leverage funding resources and to promote shared responsibilities .
a systematic framework would be helpful to decision makers as they consider the federal government's purpose and role in providing funding for the system and as they develop a sound investment approach to guide federal participation .
during the same period , nearly all of the $10 billion in federal funds expended each year for the aviation system and the $25 billion in federal funds expended each year for the highway system came from revenues generated by users of those two systems .
