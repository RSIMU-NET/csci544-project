 ( recommendation 4 ) .
u.s. research facilities , including those managed by federal agencies , use a wide range of animal species in research , testing , teaching , and experimentation .
the agencies are commerce , defense , hhs , department of homeland security ( dhs ) , interior , usda , va , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and the smithsonian institution .
these activities can occur in laboratories or field settings and have many purposes , such as developing knowledge about human disease diagnosis and treatment , testing medicines and other products for toxicity , training professionals in veterinary methods , and conserving animal populations .
the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) has used cattle , poultry , and other agricultural species in research on animal production and health and on the effects of animal agriculture on the environment , among other things .
federal agencies may have additional information about their animal use programs .
federal agencies conducted research using animals at about 120 domestic and international research facilities in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 .
for example , the departments of defense , health and human services ( hhs ) , and veterans affairs have used rats , mice , nonhuman primates , and other species in research on disease prevention and treatment .
iii for more information about stakeholders' responses to our questions ) .
the hhs's national institutes of health ( nih ) is responsible for establishing guidelines implementing certain provisions of the health research extension act of 1985 .
we included these questions to understand the extent to which stakeholders use available data and whether they had suggestions for changes in how aphis currently makes data routinely available .
to examine the extent to which aphis and nih provided federal agencies with guidance for reporting on their animal use programs , we took the following steps: aphis .
the public may request information about agencies' research activities using procedures established under the freedom of information act ( foia ) , which requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information , with some exceptions , on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability in government .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of aphis should instruct federal agencies to report their use of animals covered by the animal welfare act in federal facilities located outside of the united states .
we selected 10 types of information for stakeholders to consider , including some types of information that federal agencies may have for internal purposes and , in some instances , may provide to other agencies or organizations but that neither they nor others are required to proactively share with the public .
we are making the following four recommendations to aphis: the administrator of aphis should develop a timeline for ( 1 ) defining birds that are not bred for research and that are covered by the animal welfare act , and ( 2 ) requiring that research facilities report to aphis their use of birds covered by the act .
 ( recommendation 2 ) in developing the definition of field studies , the administrator of aphis should provide research facilities with clear criteria for identifying field studies that are covered by the animal welfare act's regulations and that facilities should report to aphis as well as field studies that facilities should not report .
