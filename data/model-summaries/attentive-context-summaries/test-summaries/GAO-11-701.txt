our objectives were to describe ( 1 ) states' practices for overseeing health insurance premium rates in 2010 , including the outcomes of premium rate reviews , and ( 2 ) changes that states that received department of health and human services ( hhs ) rate review grants have begun making to enhance their oversight of health insurance premium rates .
this report describes ( 1 ) states' practices for overseeing health insurance premium rates in 2010 , including the outcomes of premium rate reviews ; and ( 2 ) changes that states that received hhs rate review grants have begun making to enhance their oversight of health insurance premium rates .
we selected these states — california , illinois , maine , michigan , and texas — based on differences among the five states in terms of their ( 1 ) state insurance departments' authority to oversee premium rates , ( 2 ) proposed changes to their existing practices for overseeing premium rates , ( 3 ) size , and ( 4 ) geographic location .
while oversight of private health insurance , including premium rates , is primarily a state responsibility , the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) established a role for the department of health and human services ( hhs ) by requiring the secretary of hhs to work with states to establish a process for the annual review of unreasonable premium increases .
since the enactment of ppaca , members of congress and others have continued to raise questions about rising health insurance premium rates and states' practices for overseeing them .
finally , some states reported taking steps to review their current authority to determine if changes were necessary .
in 2009 , about 173 million nonelderly americans , about 65 percent of the u.s. population under the age of 65 , had private health insurance coverage , either through individually purchased or employer - based private health plans .
specifically , respondents reported that they have taken steps in order to ( 1 ) improve their processes for reviewing premium rates , ( 2 ) increase their capacity to oversee premium rates , and ( 3 ) obtain additional legislative authority for overseeing premium rates .
to describe states' practices for overseeing health insurance premium rates in 2010 , including the outcomes of premium rate reviews , we surveyed officials from the insurance departments of all 50 states and the district of columbia ( collectively referred to as “states” ) .
hhs announced the second cycle of rate review grants in february 2011 with $199 million available in grant funding to states .

the cost of this health insurance coverage continues to rise .
specifically , the practices reported by state insurance officials varied in terms of ( 1 ) the timing of rate filing reviews — whether rate filings were reviewed before or after the rates took effect , ( 2 ) the information considered during reviews , and ( 3 ) opportunities for consumer involvement in rate reviews .
