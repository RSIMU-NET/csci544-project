to determine whether existing department of defense ( dod ) funds control systems , processes , and internal controls provide reasonable assurance that potential antideficiency act ( ada ) violations will be prevented and detected , we interviewed dod comptroller officials and reviewed gao and dod inspector general audit reports , including financial - related reports ; performance reports ; and reports specifically related to the ada , compliance with laws and regulations , or both .
to comply with legal and regulatory requirements , dod must implement and maintain administrative controls that ensure the proper use of its appropriated funds , including the use of accounting and funds control systems that are able to accurately record obligations , collections , and disbursements against appropriations and the accounts established to track the status of appropriations .
federal agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , are responsible for ensuring that appropriated funds are used only for purposes , and within the amount and time frames , prescribed by the congress .
in fiscal year 2008 , dod had appropriations totaling more than $669 billion .
dod financial management has been on our high - risk list since 1995 because of the department's continuing inability to provide accurate , timely , and complete financial and performance information for management use and reporting .
the antideficiency act ( ada ) prohibits any dod officer or employee from incurring obligations or making expenditures in excess or in advance of appropriations or apportionments .
under the ada , the office of management and budget ( omb ) apportions appropriated funds and other budgetary resources to dod .
to improve management and oversight of preliminary reviews and formal investigations of potential ada violations , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) to take the following two actions to update the department's fmr to require that ( 1 ) ada case files document that the investigating officer ( s ) selected to conduct a preliminary review or formal investigation is ( are ) free of personal , external , and organizational impairments and ( 2 ) dod components maintain documentation of the date by which an investigating officer must receive refresher training in order to remain qualified to perform ada reviews and investigations .
the act further requires dod to establish by regulation a system of administrative controls to restrict obligations and disbursements to the amounts of appropriations , apportionments , and dod's subdivisions of those apportionments .
110-77 , which accompanied the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , directed gao to review the department's ada procedures for preventing , identifying , investigating , and reporting ada violations and the disciplinary actions taken when violations occur .
although dod has taken steps to improve visibility over the investigation process , additional actions are needed to improve its ability to prevent , detect , investigate , and report on ada violations .
dod has acknowledged the financial management weaknesses reported by gao and dod auditors and the impact these weaknesses have on the reliability of the department's financial information .
additionally , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army , the secretary of the navy , and the secretary of the air force to take the following four actions: ( 1 ) implement and document processes , procedures , and controls to identify and help ensure that key funds control personnel , including funds certifying officials , are properly trained so that they can fulfill their responsibilities to prevent , identify , and report potential ada violations ; ( 2 ) implement and document processes , procedures , and controls to oversee and monitor compliance with dod fmr provisions requiring the maintenance and use of a roster for selecting qualified ada investigating officers ; ( 3 ) develop , implement , and document policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with the dod fmr requirements for investigating officer training ; and ( 4 ) develop , implement , and document policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with the dod fmr requirements for investigating officer independence .
