this report focuses on ( 1 ) best management practices used in the commercial airline industry to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service , ( 2 ) air force reengineering efforts to improve the responsiveness of its logistics system and reduce costs , and ( 3 ) barriers that may stop the air force from achieving the full benefits of its reengineering efforts .
we compared the air force's management of its $33 billion reparable parts inventory with the operations of leading - edge private sector firms to identify opportunities where costs could be reduced and service improved .
this report focuses on ( 1 ) best management practices used in the commercial airline industry to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service , ( 2 ) air force reengineering efforts to improve the responsiveness of its logistics system and reduce costs , and ( 3 ) barriers that may stop the air force from achieving the full benefits of its reengineering efforts .
this report was prepared in response to your request that we continue to compare commercial logistics practices with similar department of defense ( dod ) operations .
the private sector , driven by today's globally competitive business environment , is faced with the challenge of maintaining and improving quality service at lower costs .
since the department of defense's ( dod ) environment is also changing , it needs to do the same .
time also has a significant impact on cost .
although the airline has reaped significant gains from improvements to date , it continues to reexamine operations and is making continuous improvements to its logistics system .
as a result , many firms have radically changed , or reengineered , their ways of doing business to meet customer needs .
british airways has used an integrated approach to reengineer its logistics system .
also , due to the pressures of budgetary limits , dod must seek ways to make logistics processes as efficient as possible .
the airline did not delay initiatives to streamline specific processes until changes in corporate culture and upgrades in data systems had been made ; it began reexamining its processes concurrently .
the air force , however , could build on its reengineering effort by including additional practices pursued and successfully adopted by the private sector .
with the end of the cold war , dod's logistics system must now support a smaller , highly mobile , high - technology force .
to build on the existing air force reengineering efforts and achieve major logistics system improvements , we recommend that the secretary of defense commit and engage top - level dod managers to support and lead air force reengineering efforts to ensure its success .
complexity also plays an important role ; it adds to costly overhead and pipeline time .
although not as large as the air force , commercial airlines' operations resemble the air force's in several ways .
these changing roles and missions , combined with ongoing fiscal constraints , has resulted in dod's call for a smaller , highly mobile , high - technology force and a leaner , more responsive logistics system .
british airways' initiatives have helped improve the responsiveness of logistics operations and reduced associated costs .
