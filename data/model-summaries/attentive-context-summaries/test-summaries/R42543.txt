the first responder network authority ( firstnet ) is a federal agency that includes private sector and other non - federal representation on its board of directors .
firstnet was created by congress with provisions in title vi ( spectrum act ) of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 ( p.l .
112-96 ) to ensure the deployment and operation of a nationwide , broadband network for public safety communications .
in addition to establishing the structure and goals for firstnet , congress provided $7 billion for costs related to planning and deploying the broadband network , and a $135 million grant program to assist states with plans to connect to firstnet's broadband network .
it is established as an "independent authority" within the national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) , part of the department of commerce .
the act requires that firstnet deploy its network using the fourth - generation wireless technologies of long term evolution ( lte ) .
lte is also a platform for commercial carrier - expansion into fifth - generation ( 5g ) wireless communications and the internet of things .
the act therefore provides for public - private partnerships with firstnet or with states , and for fees ( charged to states and other users ) to ensure that firstnet becomes self - sustaining .
firstnet holds a license for 20 mhz of broadband spectrum , assigned by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , as required by the act .
lte is a powerful cellular technology with industry standards that are consistently being upgraded to expand its capabilities .
there are many challenges for public safety leaders and policymakers in establishing the framework for a nationwide network that meets state , local , tribal , and territorial needs for robust , interoperable emergency communications .
furthermore , each state has its own laws and procedures for building , managing , and funding communications infrastructure .
notably , gao found that firstnet has not fully assessed the risks associated with its planning efforts ( such as conflict of interest ) ; has not established standards of conduct ; and is not fully evaluating the information from five "early builder" projects .
also on april 24 , the proposed acquisition approach and the draft request for proposal ( s ) ( rfp ) were considered in a closed meeting .
among the challenges facing firstnet is establishing a governance model that accommodates current investments and future needs of its clients without compromising the coherence of a national network .
the act allows states that meet specified requirements to lease spectrum from firstnet and thereby negotiate their own partnerships that share spectrum in radio area networks for their state or region .
to attract private sector partners , firstnet can offer access to its assets , including radio frequency spectrum capacity , in return for financial payment or other support .
the anticipated cost of building and operating a nationwide core broadband network — and the interoperable radio networks that connect to it — is significantly in excess of the amount appropriated .
currently , for example , state emergency communications needs are typically met by separate networks using different technologies .
these funds are provided from revenue realized through auctioning licenses for radio frequency spectrum , as designated in the act .
