the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is charged with improving access to health care services for people who are uninsured , isolated , or medically vulnerable and enhancing the capacity of the health care workforce .
these grantees serve millions of people each year through programs that provide health care to uninsured individuals ; people with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) ; pregnant women , mothers , and children ; people living in rural communities ; and others .
to help ensure complete and effective monitoring of grantees , we recommend that the administrator of hrsa develop a process , either at the agency or bureau level , to ensure that bureaus' sops address all of the key components of grantee monitoring as established by the agency .
in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which hrsa has developed guidance for its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hrsa has implemented training for its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; ( 3 ) hrsa's oversight of its staff responsible for monitoring grantees ; and ( 4 ) what practices , if any , hrsa has in place to ensure that the contractors conducting grantee monitoring activities are qualified and carry out their work as appropriate .
in fiscal year 2013 , hrsa awarded over $6 billion in grants , which accounted for over 80 percent of the agency's appropriations .
to manage its grant programs , hrsa employs project officers in its programmatic bureaus and staff in its office of federal assistance management ( ofam ) .
because hrsa did not ensure that the bureaus' sops included the required information and detail , and thus provided comprehensive guidance to staff responsible for monitoring grantees , the agency has put itself at risk for incomplete or ineffective grantee monitoring , which could jeopardize its stewardship of federal dollars .
hrsa has four main methods for overseeing project officers , grants management specialists , and financial integrity staff that are responsible for monitoring its grantees — supervisors reviewing information in , and reports from , ehb ; participating in staff interactions with grantees ; communicating regularly with staff ; and conducting performance appraisals .
to carry out its mission , hrsa provides funding and support for a wide variety of programs , most commonly through grants .
the performance appraisals for all staff with responsibility for monitoring grantees include performance elements related to monitoring .
in addition , hhs provided information on its plans for implementing the recommendation , stating that hrsa officials had already begun to take action .
in the past few years , hrsa has taken steps to increase and improve its guidance and training related to monitoring grantees , including implementing new training programs for key staff responsible for grantee monitoring and developing sops for these staff at both the agency and bureau level .
hrsa's workforce — its staff and contractors — is responsible for monitoring grantees .
the communication components that were not fully addressed by the sops were specifying the frequency and purpose of communication with grantees ( 3 sops ) , the process for communicating concerns or noncompliance ( 1 sop ) , and coordinating with ofam ( 2 sops ) .
