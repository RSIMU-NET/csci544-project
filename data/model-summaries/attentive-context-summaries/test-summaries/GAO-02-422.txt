preventive health care services can extend lives and promote well - being among our nation's seniors .
such preventive services are a growing part of medicare , the federal government's health insurance program for some 34 million americans age 65 and older , as well as 6 million younger disabled persons .
medicare , administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , now covers 10 preventive services — 3 types of immunizations and 7 types of screening .
what action has cms taken to increase use of preventive services among the medicare population ? .
screening for some types of cancer may extend and improve the quality of life through early detection and treatment .
a report evaluating the cost effectiveness of the demonstration projects , the quality of preventive services provided , and beneficiary and health care provider satisfaction is due to the congress in 2004 .
cms provided details on its publication and educational campaigns to inform medicare beneficiaries about preventive service benefits and to encourage their use .
for example , immunizations against the flu can prevent thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year among those age 65 and older .
while beneficiary education activities are worthwhile , cms studies have shown that other interventions , such as those that are directed at changing the way a health delivery system operates so that patients are more likely to receive services , are more effective .
you asked us to examine two questions regarding preventive services for older americans: to what extent are medicare beneficiaries using covered preventive services ? .
to answer these questions , we estimated medicare beneficiaries' use of services from a nationwide , state - based survey conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .
use of preventive services offered under medicare has increased over time .
to help ensure that preventive services are being delivered to those beneficiaries who need them , cms sponsors efforts — called “interventions” — aimed at increasing preventive service usage rates .
these beneficiaries may , for example , face barriers in obtaining the services or simply choose not to use them .
while the current efforts include 3 of the 10 preventive services covered by medicare , cms is also developing indicators and performance measures necessary for interventions to increase use of screening services for osteoporosis and colorectal and prostate cancer .
cms has sponsored reviews of studies looking at the effectiveness of interventions to increase use of preventive services among people age 65 and older .
cms also has efforts under way aimed at increasing the use of preventive services among minority and low - income seniors .
we acknowledge that our report does not describe all of cms's health promotion / education activities underway that relate to increasing the use of preventive services among the medicare population .
although medicare provides coverage for these preventive services , some beneficiaries do not receive them .
cms also takes action to implement interventions in each state through its peer review organization ( pro ) program .
one of these reviews evaluated the effectiveness of interventions targeting people over age 65 for five services covered by medicare — immunizations for flu and pneumonia and screenings for breast , cervical , and colon cancer .
