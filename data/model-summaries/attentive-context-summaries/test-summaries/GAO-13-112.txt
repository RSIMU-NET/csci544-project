postal service ( usps ) was unable to make its statutorily required payments of $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 and $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 to prefund retiree health benefits .
implementing strategies and options to better align costs with revenues may better enable usps to be in a financial position to prefund its retiree health benefit liability for its over one million active and retired postal employees and their beneficiaries .
this report ( 1 ) describes the status and financial outlook of the postal service retiree health benefits fund ( psrhbf ) , ( 2 ) analyzes how alternative proposals for funding retiree health benefits could affect future usps payments and unfunded liabilities , and ( 3 ) determines key considerations for policymakers assessing the alternative proposals or other approaches .
usps has also proposed withdrawing from the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) and administering its own health care plan for its employees and retirees .

the postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) required usps to make fixed annual payments to begin prefunding the cost of future retiree health benefits accrued by current employees and retirees .
in previous reports , we have provided strategies and options , to both reduce costs and enhance revenues , that congress could consider to better align usps costs with revenues and address constraints and legal restrictions that limit usps's ability to reduce costs and improve efficiency .
because of significant financial difficulties , the u.s .
the act required annual payments ( ranging from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion per year ) from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 to be deposited into a new fund established in the u.s. treasury and administered by the office of personnel management ( opm ) called the postal service retiree health benefits fund ( psrhbf ) .
as of the end of fiscal year 2012 , opm estimated that usps's total health benefit liability was approximately $94 billion â€” of which for future and current retirees$48 billion was unfunded and $46 billion was in the psrhbf .
while usps may have limited control of its revenue stream because of advances in technological communication , it is important that usps reduce its expenses to avoid even greater financial losses , repay its outstanding debt , and increase capital for investment .
we have suggested that congress must take action to address the uncertainty related to: 1 ) usps's inability to meet the current retiree health prefunding 2 ) reducing the unfunded retiree health benefit liability over time , 3 ) determining the proper allocation of costs between current and 4 ) enacting comprehensive postal reform legislation that would improve prospects for usps's long - term financial viability .
projected declines in mail volumes and revenues will continue to exacerbate usps's difficulties in paying for the cost of its retiree health benefits .
we have previously reported that usps cannot be financially viable until congress and usps address the cash flow problems that limit its immediate prefunding capability while also addressing how to pay for the long - term cost of usps's unfunded retiree health benefit liability .
