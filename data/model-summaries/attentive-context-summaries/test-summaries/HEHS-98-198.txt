in 1997 , the social security administration ( ssa ) paid about $66 billion to 9.3 million disabled beneficiaries under the social security disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs .
to help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remain on the rolls , ssa is required by law to conduct continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) for all di beneficiaries and some ssi disability recipients to determine whether they continue to meet the disability requirements of the law .
ssa's regulations call for cdrs to begin as soon as 6 months after benefits are awarded for some beneficiaries , or as long as 7 years after benefits are awarded for other beneficiaries .
to fund this 7-year initiative , the congress authorized a total of about $4.1 billion .
ssa funds state agencies called disability determination services ( dds ) to process disability applications and conduct cdr medical reviews in accordance with ssa policies and procedures .
as of fiscal year 1996 , about 4.3 million cdrs were due or overdue .
ssa developed a plan for a 7-year initiative to conduct about 8.2 million cdrs during fiscal years 1996 through 2002 .
in fiscal year 1996 , to reduce the unnecessary costs incurred by not doing cdrs , ssa and the congress focused on providing funding to conduct overdue cdrs and new cdrs as they become due .
under the new plan , ssa set a goal of 8.1 million cdrs for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 ( the last 5 years of the cdr initiative ) .
you asked that we determine ( 1 ) whether ssa's plan to process 8.1 million cdrs during fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will result in cdrs being done for all beneficiaries for whom cdrs are required by law and ( 2 ) whether the ddss' cdr processing capacity and the cdr funding authorized by the congress for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will be sufficient to process the cdrs required by law .
since fiscal year 1993 , ssa has significantly increased its use of mailers and plans further significant increases .
however , we have reported on several occasions that , because ssa did not consistently perform required cdrs when due , hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary costs were incurred each year , and program integrity was undermined .
during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 , the first 2 years of ssa's cdr initiative , a total of 1.2 million cdrs were processed .
in march 1998 , ssa issued a revised cdr plan that reflected the experience gained during the first 2 years of the cdr initiative and incorporated additional cdrs for certain children receiving ssi disability benefits , as required by a statutory provision enacted after the original cdr plan was developed .
on the basis of the congress' commitment to fund increased cdr workloads , ssa negotiated with the ddss to increase their efforts to hire new staff .
ssa's more cursory mailer questionnaires require about 6 months .
to develop this information , we interviewed officials from ssa and seven state ddss about their workloads and priorities ; reviewed applicable laws and regulations and relevant ssa documents ; and analyzed the process ssa uses to determine which beneficiaries should receive a cdr , including the formulas used to estimate the likelihood that beneficiaries' impairments have improved medically since benefits were awarded .
