to provide states with fiscal relief and to help maintain state medicaid programs so beneficiaries are assured continuity of services during this most recent recession , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) provided states with $89 billion through an increased federal share of medicaid funding from october 2008 through december 2010 .
during economic downturns , states' employment and tax revenues typically fall as enrollment in the medicaid program , a federal - state health financing program for low - income populations , tends to increase .
the federal funding states receive for medicaid is determined by a statutory formula , the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) .
we found that past economic downturns hampered states' ability to fund increased medicaid enrollment and maintain existing services , and that the recovery act assistance began during the national recession while nearly all states were experiencing medicaid enrollment increases .
the mandate specifically called for recommendations to improve the starting and ending of temporary assistance , and to account for variations in state economic conditions .
the most recent national recession , as defined by the national bureau of economic research ( nber ) , lasted from december 2007 through june 2009 .
while the medicaid fmap formula was the mechanism used for delivering federal aid under the recovery act , the level of funding was intended to assist states with fiscal needs beyond medicaid .
in a march 2011 report , we reviewed how past economic downturns affected states' ability to fund medicaid , examined the responsiveness of past increased fmap assistance to state medicaid needs , and identified options for adjusting the increased fmap formula for use during future economic downturns .
the recovery act also mandated that we conduct an analysis of past national economic downturns , including the effects of any increased fmap during these periods , and provide recommendations for modifying the increased fmap formula to make it more responsive to state medicaid program needs during future downturns .
the formula was designed to provide assistance to states during periods of national economic downturns , not for downturns limited to an individual state or group of states .
however , as of july 2011 , 20 states and the district of columbia continued to experience unemployment rates above 9 percent , and more than 13.9 million people were considered unemployed .
state budget challenges — due to increased unemployment and lowered tax revenues — can persist well beyond the end of a recession .
however , we also found that the increased fmap funds provided through the recovery act did not distinguish among states with varying degrees of reduced revenue in the allocation of assistance .
in keeping with the general framework provided in our past reports , we use the period of the most recent national economic downturn — from december 2007 through june 2009 — to evaluate the three components of our prototype formula , including the start of assistance , the methods used to target funds based on states' medicaid program needs , and the end of assistance .
to ensure that federal funding efficiently and effectively responds to the countercyclical nature of the medicaid program , congress could consider enacting an fmap formula that is targeted for variable state medicaid needs and provides automatic , timely , and temporary increased fmap assistance in response to national economic downturns .
