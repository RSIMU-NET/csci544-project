this report examines: ( 1 ) how the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds in the federal budget have changed over time , ( 2 ) the extent to which federal trust funds and other dedicated funds are supported by their dedicated collections , and ( 3 ) the extent to which federal trust funds and other dedicated funds support mandatory programs , including major entitlement programs .
for example , collections from federal fuel taxes are credited to the highway trust fund and used to build and maintain the nation's highways and bridges .
some of the largest federal programs , including medicare , social security , and postal services , are funded through trust funds and other dedicated funds , which link collections that have been dedicated to a specific purpose with the expenditures of those collections .
trends and projections in the inflows , outflows , and balances of these funds can provide signals about the financial health of individual funds and the impact of these funds as a group on the overall federal fiscal condition .
entitlement authority is a provision of law that requires payments to any person or unit of government that meets the eligibility criteria established by law ( see textbox ) .
mandatory spending is a large and growing part of the federal budget .
although trust funds and other dedicated funds have their own dedicated collections and the ability to retain accumulated balances , these collections do not necessarily fund the full current or future cost of the government's commitments to the designated beneficiaries .
to provide a complete count of these funds , including accounts with small balances that fall below omb's $1 million reporting threshold , we used data from the department of the treasury ( treasury ) fiscal year 2018 combined statement of receipts , outlays , and balances of the united states government ( combined statement ) .
to examine trends in the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds , we used omb budget data to identify the income , outgo ( i.e. , outlays and transfers to another government account ) , and balances for all trust funds and other dedicated funds reported in omb's budget database for fiscal years 2014 to 2018 in nominal terms .
you asked us to review issues related to federal trust funds and other dedicated funds .
trust funds and other dedicated funds may receive income from general revenues — collections that are not dedicated by law for a specific purpose — in addition to their dedicated collections .
we previously reported that , in fiscal year 1999 , trust fund collections represented nearly half of all federal budget collections and that most trust funds and other dedicated funds had mandatory budget authority , which , in general provides authority to spend collections without further appropriation .
