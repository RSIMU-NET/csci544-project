 ( recommendation 7 ) .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on professional military education ( pme ) and joint professional military education ( jpme ) to prepare its military personnel , throughout their careers , for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service .
in this report , we assess the extent to which ( 1 ) the military services' pme programs have met civilian and jpme accreditation requirements , ( 2 ) the office of the secretary of defense has assessed the effectiveness of the military services' pme programs , and ( 3 ) the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) has monitored the military services' pme program budgets .
where appropriate , we also considered select training and development leading practices ( which include education ) , standards for internal control in the federal government , and the dod financial management regulation to assess ousd ( p&r ) oversight of these programs .
finally , usd ( comptroller ) 's ability to monitor the military services' pme programs is limited because the services' budget request data are incomplete and lack uniformity .
requiring the marine corps to report budget request data on its senior - level pme program annually , and specifying how to account for costs in the exhibits would enhance the usd ( comptroller ) 's ability to monitor the military services' pme programs and also enhance congress's ability to identify trends among these programs .
 ( recommendation 5 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) updates the dod financial management regulation to require the marine corps to include a budget request data exhibit for the marine corps war college in support of dod's annual budget request .
these programs include content on warfighting and leader development ; joint planning , doctrine , and joint force requirements ; national security and theater strategy ; and civil - military relations .
usd ( comptroller's ) ability to monitor the military services' pme programs is limited because the military services' budget request data are incomplete and lack uniformity .
the usd ( comptroller ) focuses on budgetary formulation and execution ; financial management and oversight ; and accounting policy ; among other things .
 ( recommendation 3 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness , in coordination with the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , issue and implement performance measures — to include the tracking of costs — that align with the department - wide mission statement for pme .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness , in coordination with the chairman of the chiefs of staff , develop and issue a department - wide mission statement for pme that will explain the program's purpose and goals , and serve as a basis for performance measures .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , in coordination with the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness and the military services , develop policy concerning actions , if any , the military services can take to mitigate jpme seminar student mix shortfalls and still meet the intent of the opmep's joint acculturation requirement .
