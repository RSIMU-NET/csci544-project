according to the energy information administration ( eia ) , the nation's approximately 130 million housing units account for about 23 percent of total energy consumption in the united states .
our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify states that have funded programs to replace older manufactured homes with more energy efficient models and describe these programs ; ( 2 ) identify challenges , if any , these states reported facing in implementing these programs ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which these programs resulted in energy savings sufficient to offset replacement costs .
many of the occupants of these homes qualify for federal assistance to help pay their energy bills through the u.s. department of health and human services' ( hhs ) low income home energy assistance program ( liheap ) .
in fiscal year 2013 , congress appropriated about $3 billion for liheap nationwide .
approximately 2 million of these housing units are manufactured homes ( i.e. , mobile homes ) that were built before 1976 , when new standards for energy efficient construction went into effect .
program officials cited less measureable benefits of replacement , including fewer trips to the doctor , greater physical security ; improved safety in the home , especially for vulnerable beneficiaries ; and strengthened community identity .
state program officials we spoke with had not quantified these benefits .
questions have been raised about whether improving the energy efficiency of older manufactured homes or replacing them with newer , more energy efficient models would save the federal government money by reducing federal spending on liheap .
some states have conducted pilot programs to replace older manufactured homes ; however , liheap funds are statutorily prohibited from being used for new construction — which includes replacing existing homes .
you asked us to identify and review state - based or other programs that have replaced older manufactured homes — particularly those built before 1976 – – with newer , more energy efficient models , and the extent to which these programs may be cost - effective based on reduced energy costs .
liheap is a federal block grant program in which funds are provided to grantees , including states , territories , and tribes and tribal organizations , based on a number of factors , such as climate and income .
state officials provided data spanning about 2 years of operation of these programs on funding sources , replacement program costs , and energy costs , to the extent that they collected these data .
to identify which states had replacement programs , we surveyed liheap grantees from all 50 states and the district of columbia and received a 100 percent response rate .
a portion of liheap funds can be used to improve the energy efficiency of these homes but , in many cases , because of the ways these homes were built , and their sometimes poor condition , improving their energy efficiency cannot be accomplished cost effectively .
we determined early in the course of our work that these programs were not designed to save liheap funds , but we examined available information about the energy savings that resulted from these programs and the extent to which they offset replacement costs , which could inform deliberations about whether such programs could help reduce liheap costs .
