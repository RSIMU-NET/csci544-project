for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been challenged in modernizing its business systems .
in 1998 , the army initiated the logistics modernization program ( lmp ) in order to replace two aging army systems used to manage its inventory and its repair operations at the depots .
in 1995 , we designated dod's business system modernization program as high risk , and continue to do so because these systems are fundamental to addressing long - standing weaknesses related to the management of contracts , finance , and the supply chain .
you also asked us to monitor the actions taken by the army after the system has been deployed to ensure that its stated processes are adequate and have been effectively implemented .
however , the effectiveness of the army's management processes could not be evaluated until the second deployment had occurred on may 14 , 2009 .
moreover , we continue to report on business system investments that fail to effectively deliver promised benefits and capabilities on time and within budget .
through 2009 , the army has obligated more than $1 billion to implement lmp , and estimates a total life cycle cost in excess of $2.6 billion to procure and operate the system .
accordingly , the objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of the army's management processes in enabling the second deployment sites to realize the full benefits of lmp .
organizations that implement enterprise resource planning systems have faced substantial challenges because of the complexity of the endeavor , and the army is no exception .
you asked us to continue monitoring the army's efforts to deploy lmp and evaluate the army's progress in addressing the issues that are critical to successful implementation .
we previously assessed the army's preparation for the second deployment of lmp and reported that the army had begun to implement our prior recommendations related to past issues on data conversion , billing and collection , requirements management and testing , and independent verification and validation .
lmp was originally scheduled to be completed by 2005 , but the army delayed fielding lmp because of the significant problems faced by the first deployment sites — the communications - electronics command and tobyhanna army depot — in july 2003 , which we detailed in several reports .
the army has since determined that fielding of lmp would occur in two additional phases of deployment: the aviation and missile command in 2009 , which includes corpus christi army depot and letterkenny army depot , and the tank - automotive and armaments command , the joint munitions and lethality command , and the army sustainment command in october 2010 .
the army expects that lmp will reduce redundant and stove piped information technology investments and assist in driving business transformation across the army , which will enable the army to supply and service the warfighter more quickly and cost effectively .
we also reported that the army had implemented critical project management processes and controls that enabled the army to identify and understand the risks associated with making a deployment decision .
in written comments on a draft of this report , dod stated that the army concurred with our recommendations and highlighted the corrective actions it is taking to ( 1 ) improve testing activities to obtain reasonable assurance that the data used by lmp can support the lmp processes , ( 2 ) improve training for lmp users , and ( 3 ) establish performance metrics that will enable the army to assess whether the deployment sites are able to use lmp as intended .
