on july 9 , 1997 , we briefed you , other members of your staff , and officials from the defense information systems agency ( disa ) on the results of our review to date of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to improve the defense integration support tools database ( dist ) .
during our review , we focused on determining the status of the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications and intelligence ( asd / c3i ) and disa's efforts to address data integrity and other problems associated with dist and whether these efforts will be completed in time to beneficially affect departmentwide and component year 2000 efforts .
dist serves as the dod inventory of automated information systems and is intended to be used as a tool to help dod components in correcting year 2000 date problems .
the issues we discussed in our briefing were part of the work we performed concurrent with our overall review of dod's year 2000 computer systems efforts for the chairman , senate committee on governmental affairs ; the chairman and ranking minority member , subcommittee on government management , information and technology , house committee on government reform and oversight ; and the honorable thomas m. davis , iii , house of representatives .
the impact of these failures could be widespread , costly , and debilitating to important military missions .
if the year 2000 date problem is not addressed in time , dod computer systems could malfunction or produce incorrect information .
disa was included in our review because of its unique role in dod's information processing and the year 2000 process .
this letter summarizes the concerns we raised during the briefing , provides recommendations that — if implemented — should alleviate those concerns , and documents the actions your representatives and disa officials agreed to for improving dist .
given the fact that defense has a major effort ongoing to improve its information systems , and that the year 2000 problem will likely call on the department to divert resources from other information technology - related initiatives , decisive action is needed to provide the resources and schedule priorities needed to accomplish dist improvements , and to ensure that the currency and accuracy of dist information is maintained in the future .
after the new criteria for reporting information systems are applied by system managers , we recommend that your staff , and the director of disa , in conjunction with the services and components , act to ensure that the dist database is kept up - to - date and accurate , identify instances of noncompliance so that responsible command organizations can take corrective actions , and move forward with any other initiatives needed to make dist an effective management tool .
in order to ensure that dist can be effectively used for year 2000 efforts , we recommend that you direct your staff assigned to oversee implementation of the dod year 2000 management plan and the director of the defense information systems agency to ensure that all duplicate , inactive , and incomplete entries be identified and expedite development and implementation of the purging methodology , expand year 2000 information included in dist for individual systems to include key program activity schedules that managers of interfacing systems need to ensure that their system interfaces are maintained during the renovation phase .
