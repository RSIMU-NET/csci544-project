we are also ( 1 ) reviewing records documenting key activities and interactions among these agencies , and examining their current responses to the lead problem , ( 2 ) contacting academic and non - governmental experts in lead contamination , and ( 3 ) examining how other water systems facing similar circumstances notified and educated their customers on lead health risks , and how they interacted with federal , state , and local agencies to respond to the problem .
at the request of this subcommittee , we are examining issues concerning lead in drinking water generally and the situation in washington , d.c. , in particular .
you asked that we ( 1 ) examine the current structure and level of coordination among key government entities that implement the safe drinking water act's regulations for lead in the district of columbia , and identify any improvements to increase efficiency and accountability , ( 2 ) determine how other drinking water systems that exceeded the epa action level for lead have conducted public notification and outreach , ( 3 ) assess the availability of data necessary to determine which adult and child populations are at greatest risk of exposure to elevated lead levels , and what information wasa is gathering to help track their health , ( 4 ) evaluate the state of research on lead exposure , and how this information could help inform other drinking water utilities of potential problems in their systems .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work to date on the issues surrounding elevated levels of lead in washington , d.c. drinking water .
although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning , lead in drinking water can significantly increase a person's total lead exposure .
as our work continues , we will seek to examine ( to the extent appropriate ) specific ways in which improved coordination between epa and wasa could help both agencies better fulfill their responsibilities .
according to epa , its philadelphia office is responsible for providing technical assistance to the aqueduct and wasa on how to comply with federal regulations ; ensuring that they report the monitoring results to epa by required deadlines ; taking enforcement actions if violations occur ; and using those enforcement actions to return the water systems to compliance in a timely fashion .
we will also examine interrelationships among other key agencies ( such as the aqueduct and the d.c. department of health ) ; how other water systems in similar situations interacted with federal , state , and local agencies ; and what the experiences of these other jurisdictions may suggest concerning how improved coordination can better protect drinking water in the district of columbia .
their exposure to lead may delay their physical or mental development .
accordingly , we do not take a position on these issues and on how they bear on the question of interagency coordination and communication , and instead report them only as stated by the affected parties .
to respond to these questions , we are interviewing key officials and staff with the federal and local agencies responsible for managing drinking water and monitoring health for lead exposure in washington , d.c. , including officials at epa's headquarters and in its philadelphia office , wasa , the washington aqueduct , and the d.c. department of health .
