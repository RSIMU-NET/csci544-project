the objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) describe changing factors that the national wildlife refuge system experienced from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , including funding and staffing changes , and ( 2 ) examine how habitat management and visitor services changed during this period .
fws's efforts to prioritize its use of funding and staff through workforce planning have restored some balance between refuge budgets and their associated staff costs .
if threats and problems afflicting refuges continue to grow as expected , it will be important for the refuge system to monitor how these shifts in resources are affecting refuge conditions .
fish and wildlife service ( fws ) , comprises about 585 refuges on more than 96 million acres of land and water that provide habitat for millions of waterfowl and other migratory birds , threatened and endangered species , and other plants and wildlife .
you asked us to ( 1 ) describe changing factors that the refuge system experienced from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , including funding and staffing changes , and ( 2 ) examine how habitat management and visitor services changed during this period .
while some refuges have high - quality habitat and visitor service programs and others have seen improvements since 2002 , refuge managers are concerned about their ability to sustain high - quality refuge conditions and continue to improve conditions where needed because of expected continuing increases in external threats and habitat problems affecting refuges .
already , fws has had to make trade - offs among refuges with regard to which habitat will be monitored and maintained , which visitor services will be offered , and which refuges will receive adequate law enforcement coverage .
in addition , the act generally requires refuges to complete comprehensive conservation plans — long - range plans for managing , among other things , habitats and providing visitor services — by 2012 .
in light of continuing federal fiscal constraints and an ever - expanding list of challenges facing refuges , maintaining the refuge system as envisioned in law — where the biological integrity , diversity , and environmental health of the refuge system are maintained ; priority visitor services are provided ; and the strategic growth of the system is continued — may be difficult .
the refuge system spans all 50 states , american samoa , guam , puerto rico , the u.s. virgin islands , and other u.s. territories .
some have noted concerns with refuges reducing hours or closing refuges to the public because of staff constraints .
this is most likely due to staffing changes resulting from workforce planning , which were targeted at targeted - reduction refuges .
while some refuges have visitor services staff and sufficient infrastructure , refuge managers indicated that staffing changes , partially resulting from workforce planning , and a lack of resources for increasing and maintaining infrastructure , raise concerns about their ability to provide quality visitor services into the future .
these activities also are important , according to refuge managers , because the refuge system increasingly is turning toward partnerships with private landowners in an effort to maintain and improve ecosystems both on and around refuges ; public education about the refuge system can increase the viability of important refuge partnerships with nonprofit environmental and land management organizations who work with adjacent landowners , other federal and state land management agencies , and others on conservation efforts .
