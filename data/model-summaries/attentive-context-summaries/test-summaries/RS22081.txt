the supreme court has twice struck down attempted global asbestos settlements , in both instances inviting congress to craft a legislative solution .
in an attempt to resolve this problem , senator arlen specter introduced s. 852 , the fairness in asbestos injury resolution ( fair ) act .
claims of asbestos - related injury have flooded the courts since the 1970s , but litigation has proven to be an inadequate means to resolving all the claims .
the bill was reported out of the senate judiciary committee on june 16 ( s.rept .
the bill would establish within the department of labor the office of asbestos disease compensation , which would award damages to claimants on a no - fault basis according to their respective levels of injury and asbestos exposure .
the comparable time period for all other asbestos claims ( with the exception of the least serious claims ) would be two years .
the office would be headed by an administrator , who would be appointed by the president — with the advice and consent of the senate — to a five - year term and report directly to the assistant secretary of labor for the employment standards administration .
this scheme would set medical criteria and awards for nine levels of asbestos - related injury , with awards ranging from medical monitoring for claimants in level i ( asbestos - related non - malignant disease and five years occupational exposure to asbestos ) to $1.1 million for claimants in level ix ( mesothelioma ) .
for claimants who have asbestos claims pending in court , the statute of limitations would be five years from enactment of the bill .
new asbestos claims — and most pending ones — could no longer be pursued in federal or state court .
one of the more controversial aspects of the effort to reach a legislative solution to the asbestos problem has been the question of smoking .
upon enactment of s. 852 , all pending asbestos claims ( other than some individual actions at the evidentiary stage and actions with final verdicts , judgments , or orders ) would be stayed .
the bill would specifically exempt from the prohibition: ( 1 ) asbestos - containing products necessary to the "critical functions" of the defense department or nasa ; ( 2 ) asbestos diaphragms used in the manufacture of chlor - alkali and its derivatives ; and ( 3 ) roofing cements , coatings , and mastics containing asbestos that is totally encapsulated by asphalt .
if , after nine months , the administrative process outlined in the bill is not up and running so that it can review and pay "exigent health claims" — i.e. , claims by those suffering from mesothelioma or having a life expectancy of less than one year , or claims by relatives of those who died from asbestos - related conditions after enactment of the bill — at a reasonable rate , then those claims could be maintained in the same courts in which the claims were pending when the act was enacted .
the office would pay awards from the privately funded asbestos injury claims resolution fund ( "the fund" ) , discussed in greater detail below .
