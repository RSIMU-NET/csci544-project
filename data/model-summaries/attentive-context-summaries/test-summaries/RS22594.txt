concern is twofold: ( 1 ) widespread termination of account relationships could result in the loss of access to financial services and products by the significant market segment currently served by check cashers and ( 2 ) if these businesses are consequently forced "underground" the potential loss of transparency could damage ongoing efforts to safeguard the u.s. financial system .
the bank secrecy act regulations define check cashers as money services businesses ( msbs ) .
the office of the comptroller of currency ( occ ) a federal bank regulatory agency included check cashers and other msbs in a list of inherently high - risk businesses in its bank secrecy act / anti - money laundering manual .
both banks and nonbank msbs must have written anti - money laundering programs , file currency transaction reports ( crts ) and supicious activity reports ( sars ) , and maintain certain records .

in april 2005 , bank regulators issued interagency guidance in response to concerns over the loss of access to banking services by check cashers and other msbs .
the goal was to clarify the regulatory expectations for banking institutions providing services to domestic businesses .
there was general agreement that banks were re - evaluating their businesses strategies in light of bsa due diligence costs .
fincen strengthened bsa enforcement after the enactment of the usa patriot act and with the increased focus on terrorism financing after 9 / 11 .
check cashers provide access to financial services for individuals without accounts at conventional banks .
the news release announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking input on what additional guidance or regulatory action would be appropriate to address the ongoing concerns about check casher's and other msb's access to banking services .
the news release emphasized the important role of msbs and the negative effect on the health and safety of the u.s. financial system if these businesses are driven underground .
