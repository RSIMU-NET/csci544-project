according to fema — a component within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — these disasters affected 47 million people , or about 15 percent of the nation's population .
once a major disaster has been declared by the president , federal contracts play a key role in its immediate aftermath and in long - term community recovery by providing life - sustaining goods and services to survivors .
implementing our recommendations to update its planning guidance and advance contract strategy ; assess acquisition workforce needs ; improve coordination with state , local , and federal partners ; and improve tracking of disaster contracting actions will help fema overcome key challenges it faces in contracting during a disaster , and improve future response efforts .
the post - katrina emergency management reform act ( pkemra ) of 2006 required fema , among other things , to establish advance contracts .
fema obligated about $2.9 billion of this total through advance contracts , and roughly an additional $1.6 billion through post - disaster contracts .
according to our analysis of federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) data , federal agencies had obligated about $9.5 billion in response to the three 2017 hurricanes and the california wildfires as of june 30 , 2018 — the most recent and complete data available .
yet fema faced continued challenges and inconsistencies in its coordination with states and localities over the use of advance contracts .
the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) requires agencies to perform acquisition planning activities for all acquisitions to ensure that the government meets its needs in the most effective , economical , and timely manner possible .
for the reports cited , among other methodologies , we reviewed fpds - ng data through june 30 , 2018 — the most recent and complete data available — to identify fema contract obligations for the 2017 disasters .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the federal emergency management agency's ( fema ) contracting practices in response to the catastrophic 2017 disasters — hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , and the california wildfires .
fema may also award new contracts to support disaster response efforts following a disaster declaration .
this statement is primarily based on reports we issued in december 2018 and april 2019 on fema's disaster contracting activities in response to the 2017 hurricanes and california wildfires .
advance contracts are established prior to disasters to quickly provide life - sustaining goods and services in the immediate aftermath of a disaster .
our prior work also showed that fema's ability to adequately plan for and manage its disaster contracts is further complicated by persistent acquisition workforce challenges , including attrition and staffing shortages .
fema has obligated billions of dollars on contracts in response to the 2017 disasters .
we also analyzed fema guidance and documentation and interviewed fema officials to discuss the use of contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters .
we recommended fema assess its workforce needs to address these shortcomings and develop a plan , including timelines .
but fema had not assessed its contracting workforce — including regional contracting workforce needs — since at least 2014 .
without planning and guidance on its use of advance contracts , fema lacks reasonable assurance that it is maximizing their use to the extent practicable and cost - effective to quickly provide goods and services following a disaster .
