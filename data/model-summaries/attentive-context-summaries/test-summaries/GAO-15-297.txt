specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) evaluate irs's efforts to address our recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information ; ( 2 ) summarize the reported cost , schedule , and performance of irs's major it investments ; and ( 3 ) assess the status and plans of selected investments .

the internal revenue service ( irs ) relies extensively on information technology ( it ) systems to annually collect more than $2 trillion in taxes , distribute more than $300 billion in refunds , and carry out its mission of providing service to america's taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations .
for fiscal year 2014 , irs expected to spend about $2.4 billion for it investments ; this is about 21 percent of irs's total budget for the year .
accordingly , the senate appropriations committee directed gao to review the cost and schedule performance of irs's major it investments .
given the significant amount spent on irs's it investments and the challenges inherent in successfully delivering them , it is important that congress be provided ongoing , accurate , and objective information on the progress toward completion and the risks facing irs's projects .
they address ( 1 ) the timely reporting of cost and schedule variance information for completed activities ; ( 2 ) consistently updating cost and schedule information for in - process activities ; ( 3 ) developing guidance on best practices to consider when determining cost and schedule variances for in - process activities ; ( 4 ) reporting cost and schedule information at the investment or investment segment level ( rather than by fiscal year only ) ; and ( 5 ) reporting qualitatively on how delivered scope compares to what was planned for investments until a quantitative measure is developed .
providing similar ratings for its remaining 6 major investments would allow congress to more easily determine the ones requiring greater attention .
he mentioned ( 1 ) irs's quarterly reporting to congress , and ( 2 ) the omb exhibit 300 baseline change request process as examples of such practices and processes .
in his written comments , the commissioner stated that irs appreciated the acknowledgment of progress it had made to address two prior year recommendations to improve the consistency and timeliness in reporting cost , schedule and scope information for its major information technology ( it ) investments , but disagreed with our assessment of its efforts to address three prior recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information .
irs's implementation of these recommendations is critical in ensuring that congress receives the reliable information it needs for effective oversight and decision making .
however , these deviations were not transparent in congressional reporting because irs has yet to implement our prior recommendations regarding cumulative performance and scope reporting .
