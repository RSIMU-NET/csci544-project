a persistent set of issues has stymied significant progress in detecting and deterring existing threats and implementing effective safeguard measures .
issues that appear to continually challenge u.s. cybersecurity efforts include uncertainty of the geographic location of the perpetrators of cyber attacks ; the evolving integration of mobile technology devices into critical information infrastructure ; the introduction of new vulnerabilities to the nation's infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated threats ; a poorly coordinated federal - private sector approach to addressing emerging risks ; and legal ambiguities with respect to u.s. response and offensive actions .
comprehensively addressing national cybersecurity - related issues is a difficult task because of a number of technical and policy considerations .
while the ever - changing nature of modern technological devices is often noted as a complicating factor in securing the nation's telecommunications and cyber infrastructure , many security observers suggest that an equally daunting group of strategy and policy challenges must be addressed if the united states is to continue to rely on technology as a major component of societal activities .
recent events such as the april 2007 cyber attacks on estonia and cyber attacks during the 2008 georgian incursion have served to increase awareness that cybersecurity is not just about protecting computers , but also has implications for u.s. national security and economic well - being .
since 2008 , a number of strategy and policy proposals have been offered that may assist in addressing the appropriate balance of relying on emerging technology and network - centric governance while safeguarding critical infrastructure and control systems , as well as privacy and civil liberty considerations .
recognizing the importance of cyberspace over the past few years , both the legislative and executive branches of government have developed cybersecurity legislation and related initiatives , respectively .
the obama administration declared that u.s. critical information infrastructures are a strategic national asset in a may 29 , 2009 , speech by the president .
for the department of defense , cybersecurity takes on an offensive or defensive national security role .
as the president stated , "no single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government , and no single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of the challenge .
however , just as there is no single congressional committee that can claim primary jurisdiction over cyberspace , neither is there a single executive agency or department with sole cybersecurity responsibility or commensurate authorities .
for example , the u.s. military views cyberspace as a warfighting domain as well as a force enabler , enhancing troops' ability to operate in real - time and with improved situational awareness .
for other government stakeholders , cybersecurity means information security , or securing the information that resides on cyber infrastructure such as telecommunications networks , or the processes these networks enable .
cybersecurity is a cross - cutting field that affects many government and non - governmental stakeholders .
and for some , cybersecurity means protecting the information infrastructure from a physical or electronic attack .
indeed , when it comes to cybersecurity , federal agencies have overlapping missions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should â€” with each other or with the private sector. .
