the purpose of this report is to ( 1 ) compare the honor and conduct systems at each academy and describe how the various systems provide common due process protections and ( 2 ) describe the attitudes and perceptions of the students toward the honor and conduct systems .
as part of a comprehensive review of student treatment at the department of defense ( dod ) service academies originally requested by senator nunn and senator glenn , we collected information on the honor and conduct adjudicatory systems at the military academy , the naval academy , and the air force academy .
due process protections are greater in criminal proceedings than in non - criminal proceedings ( such as administrative hearings ) .
courts have established that students facing expulsion from tax - supported colleges and universities have constitutionally protected interests that require minimal due process protections and established standards for student disciplinary proceedings .
as arranged with your staff , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier , we plan no further distribution of this report until 1 day from its date of issue .
while these standards and guidelines have been used in devising due process requirements for academy adjudicatory proceedings , courts have ruled that the government's interest in assuring the fitness of future military officers permits the academies greater freedom in providing due process protections than is accorded civilian institutions or authorities .
in reviewing judicial and administrative proceedings , we identified 12 categories of due process protections commonly used to ensure fairness in hearings .
we believe the due process protections and limitations applicable to academy adjudicatory proceedings can be best understood by comparing them with the broadest range of due process protections available in civilian proceedings .
these 12 categories of due process rights include several rights derived from criminal hearings .
the courts have generally found that the academies' adjudicatory systems provide students with the due process protections required by existing law for administrative systems .
over the last several decades , the authority of academy officials to impose sanctions other than dismissal has increased .
the congress , through the uniform code of military justice ( ucmj ) , provides commanders with quasi - judicial responsibility when they act in an administrative ( nonjudicial ) punishment capacity , and judicial authority when they act as a court - martial convening authority .
all midshipmen still maintain their american rights. .
a primary objective of adjudicatory systems , from the point of view of those subject to the systems , is “fairness.” to try to ensure fairness , adjudicatory systems are typically designed in ways that minimize or structure the discretion of the adjudicator ( s ) by imposing standardized procedures and mandating certain protections for the accused .
since the courts view due process as a concept that should be flexibly applied to fit the needs of a particular context , a body of case law has developed regarding the applicability of procedural due process protections to specific subgroups and particular settings .
unless excluded by statute , all statutory provisions applicable to military members are also applicable to cadets .
the former chairman of the senate committee on armed services and the former chairman of its subcommittee on manpower and personnel asked us to review various aspects of student treatment , including the adjudicatory systems , at the three department of defense ( dod ) service academies .
