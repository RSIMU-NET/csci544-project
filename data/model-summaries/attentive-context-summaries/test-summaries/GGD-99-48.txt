irs has two quality review functions to see whether correspondence audits comply with its requirements and standards .
in recent years , congress has been concerned about irs' use of its enforcement tools , particularly about whether the tools are used fairly and in a manner that does not impose excessive burdens on taxpayers .
in reviewing irs' correspondence audit processes and requirements , we found weaknesses that undermine its ability to ( 1 ) identify and audit all questionable tax issues on tax returns , ( 2 ) support its audit recommendations for additional taxes , ( 3 ) consistently accept justification for eic claims , ( 4 ) review adherence to audit requirements and quality standards , and ( 5 ) solicit taxpayers' responses about the tax issues being audited .
the act included provisions affecting audits .
concerns such as these led , in part , to the passage of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 .
improving controls over the audit processes as well as collecting more information about the weaknesses would help to accomplish these ends .
irs does not require supervisory reviews to be documented .
this selection process results in a determination of whether a return has audit potential .
the results of these reviews are to be entered into the correspondence examination quality management system ( ceqms ) database and used to identify procedural and systemic weaknesses and to develop improvements where needed .
this elapsed time is significant in two respects .
gao recommends that the irs commissioner improve controls to better ensure that irs' correspondence audit processes adhere to existing audit requirements and standards on classifying filed returns , and in particular , referring returns with complex schedules that may have potential tax changes to staff with sufficient knowledge to classify them ; documenting the support for audit findings and recommendations in the ensuring consistency in the treatment of audited eic claims by collecting and using the information required , including verification from third parties , to justify the claims ; and including all types of closed audits across the 10 service centers in the samples for measuring audit quality .
