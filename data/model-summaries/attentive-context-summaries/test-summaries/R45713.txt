some have called on congress to restrict or even prohibit such content , which raises the question of whether the first amendment would allow such regulation .
the report then discusses the overarching first amendment principles that bear on what the government may regulate under the first amendment , including ( 1 )  the distinction between regulating conduct and speech ; ( 2 )  the presumed invalidity of content - based laws ; and ( 3 )  relevant "unprotected" categories of speech that generally can be restricted because of their content .
a number of legal scholars have explored these issues , and some have proposed recommendations to congress about how best to address these concerns in accordance with the first amendment .
while justices of the court have often disagreed over when free speech rights must yield to the government's interests , when it comes to speech promoting violence , the court has rejected an all - or - nothing approach .
but when speech promotes violence , a tension can form between the values of liberty and security .
a s the supreme court has observed , while the first amendment protects the "freedom of speech," it "does not protect violence. .
in more recent years , some have begun to question whether and how the court's decisions in this area should apply to speech online .
many policymakers and commentators , including some members of congress , have expressed concerns about the proliferation of social media content promoting terrorism and violence and the influence such speech can have on other internet users .
although governmental efforts to combat online content promoting terrorism or violence could take a number of forms , this report focuses on the first amendment implications of imposing civil or criminal liability on individual internet users ( i.e. , the originators of the content ) rather than the social media companies or internet service providers themselves .
over the past 50 years , the court has drawn a line between speech that advocates violence in the abstract and speech that facilitates it in a specific way , with the former receiving more robust constitutional protections .
the "vast democratic fora of the internet" have provided ample platforms not only for those seeking to debate issues or express controversial views , but also for individuals and entities planning violent attacks or threatening violence online .
it has done so because , in the court's view , upholding the first amendment requires preserving "uninhibited , robust , and wide - open" debate on public issues , even if that means allowing individuals to express ideas that are "deeply offensive to many. .
as such , it focuses on the underlying first amendment issues that are likely to be common to both forms of government action , but does not discuss the additional considerations attendant to regulating a social media platform , which are the subject of another crs report .
the report begins with some background on the use of the internet by terrorist groups and the reported influence of online content on certain individuals accused of committing violent attacks .
in an oft - quoted passage from a dissenting opinion , justice robert jackson argued that the problems this tension creates are not insurmountable but must be confronted with a dose of pragmatism: a government can temper "liberty with order," but to treat free speech as absolute threatens to "convert the constitutional bill of rights into a suicide pact. .
