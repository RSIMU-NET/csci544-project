these issues relate to ( 1 ) the reasonableness of cost structures and agent practices in the title insurance market that are not typical of other insurance markets ; ( 2 ) activities identified in recent investigations that may have benefited real estate or other professionals rather than consumers ; and ( 3 ) proposed regulatory changes that would affect the way that title insurance is sold .
as you are aware , title insurance is designed to ensure clear ownership of a property when it is sold or refinanced , and is a required part of most real estate purchases .
we also had discussions with officials from national organizations whose members are involved in the marketing or sale of title insurance ; the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) ; the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) ; several state regulatory officials ; title insurers and agents ; and industry consultants .
according to a recent national survey of lenders , title insurance can account for as much as one - third of loan origination and closing fees .
recent investigations and studies have raised questions about practices and competition within the industry , in part because title insurance differs markedly from other types of insurance .
for example , hud is considering revisions to regulations that implement the real estate settlement procedures act ( respa ) , and naic is considering changes to the model laws for title insurers and title agents .
further review of the effects and feasibility of such changes will help congress , hud , and state regulatory agencies in their oversight and decision - making processes .
second , although title agents play a key role in the underwriting process , the extent to which state insurance regulators review their operations is unclear .
my remarks are based on a review of studies of the title insurance industry , title insurance regulations in selected states , and financial information on title insurers and agents .
finally , multiple regulators oversee the different entities involved in the title insurance industry , but the degree of regulatory involvement and coordination among agencies is also not clear .
first , while the amount of premium paid to or retained by title agents — generally to pay for title search and examination costs and agents' commissions — is commonly title insurers' largest expense , most states do not take these costs into account during premium rate reviews .
the investigations alleged instances of real estate agents , mortgage brokers , lenders , and attorneys receiving referral fees ( or other inducements ) in return for steering business to particular title insurers or agents .
my remarks today focus on our preliminary report , which identifies issues for further study that was completed as part of ongoing work in this area for the chairman of the house financial services committee .
finally , some consumer advocates have suggested that requiring lenders to pay for the title policies from which they benefit might increase competition and ultimately lower costs for consumers , because lenders could then use their market power to force title insurers to compete for business based on price .
third , while the competition among agents for their share of the business can be intense , the extent to which a competitive environment that benefits consumers exists within the title insurance market is also not clear .
