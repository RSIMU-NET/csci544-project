the u.s. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly - pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) .
as of june 17 , 2015 , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda's ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) reported 223 cases of hpai in domestic flocks in 15 states .
cases have been caused by several highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza ( ai ) strains that result in substantial mortality in domestic poultry .
established u.s. animal health policy is to eliminate the ai virus ( both hpai and lpai strains ) , when it is found , through depopulation ( i.e. , euthanasia and disposal ) of affected poultry .
according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , no infections in humans have been associated with the current hpai outbreak , and cdc considers the public health risk to be low .
 ( in this context , a "case" is an affected premise. ) .
the poultry export sector is also faced with numerous bans on shipments of u.s products .
more than 48 million chickens , turkeys , and other poultry have been euthanized to stem the spread of the disease .
outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza ( lpai ) are more frequent , but result in minor illness in poultry .
prior hpai outbreaks in the united states occurred in 1924 , 1983 , and 2004 .
with loss of production , consumers see higher retail prices .
to control the 1983 outbreak , 17 million birds were euthanized in the u.s. northeast .
nonetheless , efforts are made to also eliminate lpai outbreaks , because lpai strains could potentially mutate to become more pathogenic .
commercial broiler farms have not been affected to date .
aphis , state , and local animal health officials euthanize poultry , clean and disinfect premises and equipment , and then test for elimination of the virus to ensure that farms can be safely restocked .
turkey and egg - laying hen farms in minnesota and iowa have been hardest hit .
the 1924 and 2004 outbreaks were quickly contained .
114-82 ) accompanying the fy2016 agriculture appropriations bills also would direct usda to use its existing authority to transfer funds from ccc as needed to address the hpai outbreak .
this process is time consuming , and poultry producers lose significant income as barns and laying houses are out of production for several months .
on july 16 , 2015 , the senate committee on appropriations marked up the fy2016 agriculture appropriations bill ( s. 1800 ) , which would provide aphis with $52 million for avian health , unchanged from fy2015 .
usda indemnifies poultry owners and pays for cleaning , disinfecting , and testing .
the cost of the hpai outbreak to the poultry industry is high .
the house and senate appropriations committee reports ( h.rept .
with all flyways likely involved , hpai could be introduced into large poultry production areas in the southeastern united states that have not been affected so far .
3049 ) , which includes $55 million for avian health , $3 million more than appropriated for fy2015 .
according to usda , the avian health program includes ai prevention and control activities ; avian health and management studies ; disease threat planning and response for the livestock , poultry , and zoological industries ; comprehensive poultry disease surveillance ( including wildlife surveillance ) ; and zoonotic disease prevention and response .
