i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to transform dod's business operations and the actions that dod needs to take to maintain continuity of effort , change the status quo , and achieve sustainable success , both at the enterprisewide level and within dod's many components .
in particular , i will focus on the progress dod has made in developing its business enterprise architecture ( bea ) , enterprise transition plan ( etp ) , and financial improvement and audit readiness ( fiar ) plan ; dod's investment controls for new business systems ; the extent to which dod is complying with applicable legislation ; and the degree to which the department has integrated the roles of the military services in these efforts .
since the first financial statement audit of a major dod component was attempted almost 20 years ago , we have reported that weaknesses in business operations not only adversely affect the reliability of reported financial data , but also the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of these operations .
dod continues to dominate our list of high - risk programs designated as vulnerable to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement , bearing responsibility , in whole or in part , for 15 of 27 high - risk areas .
eight of these areas are specific to dod and include dod's overall approach to business transformation , as well as business systems modernization and financial management , which are the focus of this hearing .
however , our nation is threatened not only by external security threats , but also from within by large and growing fiscal imbalances , due primarily to our aging population and rising health care costs .
before i go further , i also want to commend the subcommittee for its continued focus , oversight , and legislative initiatives to address these critical issues .
given the current security environment and growing long - range fiscal imbalance facing our nation , dod , like other federal agencies , will need to ensure prudent and proper stewardship of the resources it is provided to perform its mission .
congress , under the leadership of this subcommittee and others , has been instrumental in transforming dod through oversight and through legislation that has codified many of our prior recommendations , particularly with respect to the modernization of dod's business systems .
absent policy changes to cope with rising health care costs and known demographic trends , a growing imbalance between expected federal spending and revenues will mean escalating and ultimately unsustainable federal deficits and debt levels .
my testimony today will provide perspectives on the progress dod has made and the challenges it faces in its approaches to overall business transformation , business systems modernization , and financial management capabilities improvements .
with about $546 billion in discretionary budget authority provided thus far in fiscal year 2008 , along with total reported obligations of about $492 billion to support ongoing operations and activities related to the global war on terrorism since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks through september 2007 , the department has been given stewardship of unprecedented amounts of taxpayer money .
