providing for the national defense is a central concern of congress , and technological advantage has long provided u.s. forces with a battlefield overmatch , deterring potential conflicts and contributing to decisive u.s. military victories .
congress plays a central role in how the department of defense ( dod ) creates and acquires leading - edge technologies , including establishing and refining the organizational structure of dod research and development activities , providing policy direction , and appropriating funds for r&d and innovation - related activities .
underpinning u.s. technological advantage are leading - edge innovations built on a foundation of insights gained from research and development ( r&d ) activities .
today , many analysts believe that u.s. technological overmatch — and , by extension , national security — is at risk due to a number of factors , including a rapidly evolving global landscape for innovation ; changes in the composition of r&d funding ; and the increasing technological prowess of potential adversaries .
congress and the administration have undertaken actions in these areas in an effort to ensure that the united states maintains superiority over its potential adversaries .
many policymakers believe that new approaches and mechanisms are required to maintain u.s. technological advantage .
this report provides an overview of the changes that have occurred in the global r&d landscape , the administration's policies and perspectives on how to maintain u.s. military technological leadership , actions taken by congress , and potential issues for consideration .
world war ii ( wwii ) initiated a vastly expanded role for the u.s. government in funding , administering , and conducting research and development .
some have also expressed concerns about the extent and effectiveness of dod's engagement with leading - edge companies that have not historically been a part of the dod innovation ecosystem .
in the mid - term and long - term , congress may want to focus its oversight efforts on outcomes of congressional and dod actions .
prior to the 1940s , the united states depended on europe as a major source of scientific capital .
in support of the war effort , new offices were established at the highest levels of the federal government to support the planning and oversight of scientific and technological efforts .
president franklin roosevelt created the u.s. office of scientific research and development ( osrd ) by executive order in june 1941 to ensure "adequate provision for research on scientific and medical problems relating to the national defense. .
china's emergence as a global science and technology leader is evidenced in part by its rising position among nations in the funding of r&d .
despite continued u.s. science and technology ( s&t ) leadership , it is widely asserted that the gap between the united states and china has been decreasing in recent years .
china is making significant and targeted investments in the same technologies of interest to the department.… china has made it a national goal to acquire foreign technologies to not only advance its economy , but also to use these technologies to advance its military capabilities , and it is doing so through both licit and illicit means .
some assert that dod has been slow to react and adapt to this new reality , raising concerns that the united states military may be unable to maintain its historical technological advantages .
