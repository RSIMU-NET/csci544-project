 ( recommendation 4 ) .
in fiscal year 2016 , the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) spent $478 million to provide more than 150 million meals to children through the summer food service program ( sfsp ) .
this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing three research objectives: ( 1 ) what is known about participation in the summer food service program ( sfsp ) and how has it changed in the last 10 years ? .
 ( 2 ) what other programs help feed low - income children over the summer ? .
to assess the reliability of sfsp and nslp data , we ( 1 ) performed electronic testing of relevant data elements , ( 2 ) reviewed existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data .
what challenges exist , if any , in providing summer meals to children , and to what extent does fns provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges ? .
as a federal nutrition assistance program , the primary purpose of the sfsp is to provide food service to children in low - income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation .
 ( recommendation 3 ) the administrator of fns should disseminate information about existing flexibilities available to state agencies to streamline administrative requirements for sponsors participating in the sfsp and other child nutrition programs to help lessen the administrative burden .
what is known about participation in the summer food service program and how it has changed in the last 10 years ? .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the administrator of fns should evaluate and annually report to congress , as required by statute , on its use of waivers and demonstration projects to grant states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume sfsp meals on - site in areas experiencing crime or violence , to improve its understanding of the use and impact of granting these flexibilities on meeting program goals .
however , a lack of clarity concerning the circumstances under which fns grants flexibilities in areas of violence and crime , and a lack of information on its use of these flexibilities and their impact on program administration , hinder efforts to ensure program goals are met .
what other programs help feed low - income children over the summer ? .
usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) oversees the sfsp , which is administered by the states and operated by a variety of public and private nonprofit organizations and government entities that sponsor meals at sites such as schools , camps , parks , churches , and libraries .
and ( 3 ) what challenges exist , if any , in providing summer meals to children , and to what extent does the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) provide assistance to states and sponsors to address these challenges ? .
in the last decade , federal expenditures have increased as the program has expanded , according to fns data .
furthermore , absent a reminder to states regarding existing options for streamlining administration across multiple nutrition programs , some providers may continue to be discouraged from participating in these programs due to duplicative and burdensome administrative requirements , which may ultimately limit the provision of nutritious meals to children .
