and , we suggested several improvements to the draft plan , including that dod ( 1 ) more completely state strategies for achieving its goals and include schedules of significant actions ; ( 2 ) link and discuss how external factors could affect its ability to achieve its goals ; ( 3 ) discuss how program evaluations were used in developing its goals and identify key issues for future evaluations ; ( 4 ) discuss planned or ongoing actions to resolve persistent management problems , including time frames and required resources ; and ( 5 ) identify and discuss coordination efforts for programs that crosscut with other agencies' programs .
among the remaining critical challenges are ( 1 ) clearly establishing a strategic direction for agencies by improving goal - setting and measurement ; ( 2 ) improving the management of crosscutting program efforts by ensuring that those programs are appropriately coordinated to avoid duplication , fragmentation , and overlap ; and ( 3 ) ensuring that agencies have the data systems and analytic capacity in place to better assess program performance and costs , improve management and performance , and establish accountability .
these twin demands are the broad forces behind the move to a performance - based approach to management in public sector organizations — the most important effort to improve government management in over a generation .
the small business administration ( sba ) improved its ability to assess progress toward its strategic goals by stating when specific performance objectives would be met .
these improvements include ( 1 ) explaining interagency coordination for crosscutting issues and ( 2 ) addressing previously identified management problems .
in recent years , governments around the world , including ours , have faced a citizenry that is demanding that government become at the same time more effective and less costly .
as agreed , we focused our reviews on the progress of agencies' strategic planning efforts , specifically their efforts to improve their strategic plans , with particular attention to the key planning challenges that are most in need of sustained attention .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) is also to prepare the annual federal government performance plan that is based on the performance plans of individual agencies .
to do these reviews , we used the results act supplemented by omb's guidance on developing the plans ( circular a - 11 , part 2 ) as criteria to determine whether the plans contained the six elements required by the act .
this report is based on our reviews of 24 major agencies' strategic plans that were formally submitted to congress and omb by september 30 , 1997 .
congress enacted the government performance and results act of 1993 , commonly referred to as “gpra” or “the results act,” in conjunction with the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act and information technology reform legislation , such as the clinger - cohen act of 1996 , to address these twin demands and to instill performance - based management in the federal government .
the widespread lack of available program performance information is equally troubling .
the results act seeks to shift the focus of government decisionmaking and accountability away from a preoccupation with the activities — such as grants and inspections made — to a focus on the results of those activities — such as real gains in employability , safety , responsiveness , or program quality .
