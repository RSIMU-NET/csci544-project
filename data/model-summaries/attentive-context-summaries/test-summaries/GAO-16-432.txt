the food and drug administration ( fda ) — an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) — has faced challenges carrying out its responsibilities to approve and oversee the safety and efficacy of medical products sold in the united states .
systematically track funding of regulatory science projects across each of its priority areas .
systematic tracking of both progress on measurable goals and funding is essential for fda to strategically plan its regulatory science initiative across the agency .
we examined the achievements related to regulatory science for 17 projects funded by the food and drug administration ( fda ) .
in 2013 , fda issued another strategic plan for regulatory science , as required by the food and drug administration safety and innovation act of 2012 ( fdasia ) .
develop and document measurable goals , such as targets and time frames , for its regulatory science efforts so it can consistently assess and report on the agency's progress in regulatory science efforts .
to evaluate fda's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities for medical products , we analyzed fda documents , including its 2011 and 2013 strategic planning documents , its reports on strategic priorities , and a 2015 progress report .
in order to improve fda's strategic planning for regulatory science efforts , we recommend the secretary of health and human services direct the commissioner of fda to take the following two actions: 1 .
since then , fda issued two reports on its progress .
such goals are a best practice for strategic planning and could enable fda to assess and report its progress in addressing its identified priority areas and strategically plan and allocate resources for its broader regulatory science initiative .
this report 1. evaluates fda's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities for medical products , 2. describes fda's funding targeted at regulatory science projects related to medical products , and 3. describes the achievements of selected fda regulatory science projects related to medical products .
as a result , we identified fda's oversight of medical products as an area of high risk , and we noted that rapid changes in science and technology had contributed to these challenges .
we also reviewed relevant criteria from gao's body of work on effectively managing performance under the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) as enhanced by the gpra modernization act of 2010 .
nevertheless , fda should develop measureable goals that are related to the impacts that are discussed in hhs's comments , including the effectiveness and efficiency of fda's regulatory review , new pathways for medical product development , enhancements in the agency's ability to provide useful guidance to sponsors , and new technologies to monitor manufacturing and real world use of approved medical products .
the agency faces another obstacle to its strategic plan without consistent information about centers and offices' distribution of targeted regulatory science funding among those identified priority areas .
in 2007 , fda's science board reported that the agency's ability to fulfill its mission was at risk because of a weak scientific base .
we classified these achievements into three categories: shorter - term achievements , such as sharing information via dissemination of project findings ; medium - term achievements , such as internal changes at fda ; and longer - term achievements such as changes by industry and other groups outside of fda .
