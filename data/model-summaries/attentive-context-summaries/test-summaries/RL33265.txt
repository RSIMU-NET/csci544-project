the logan act , designed to cover relations between private citizens of the united states and foreign governments , has prompted much controversy as to its scope and effect in its more than 200 years .
as amended , the act states: any citizen of the united states , wherever he may be , who , without authority of the united states , directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof , in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states , or to defeat the measures of the united states , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years , or both .
described as either a "paper dragon or sleeping giant" by one commentator , proclaimed to be possibly unconstitutional by others , it represents a combination of legal and policy factors in both domestic and international concerns .
this section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply , himself or his agent , to any foreign government or the agents thereof for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects .
because the united states had not assisted the french revolutionaries to their satisfaction and because the united states had ratified the jay treaty with great britain , the french government authorized plunderings of american merchant ships .
otherwise , there do not appear to have been any substantial changes in the act since its original enactment on january 30 , 1799 , as 1 stat .
three of these issues involve the constitutionality of the act , its application in this situation to members of congress , and its current viability .
after the french revolution , difficulties developed between the federalist administration of the united states and the various revolutionary governments of france .
this mission resulted in the xyz letters controversy , and its failure led to such strong anti - france feelings in the united states that preparations for war were begun by the congress .
it is possible that this interest will result in congressional consideration of whether the act should be repealed or retained .
the house of representatives passed the bill on january 17 , 1799 , and the senate passed it on january 25 , 1799 .
representative roger griswold of connecticut introduced a resolution in congress to prevent actions similar to logan's: resolved , that a committee be appointed to inquire into the expediency of amending the act entitled "an act in addition to the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the united states," so far as to extend the penalties , if need be , to all persons , citizens of the united states , who shall usurp the executive authority of this government , by commencing or carrying on any correspondence with the governments of any foreign prince or state , relating to controversies or disputes which do or shall exist between such prince or state , and the united states .
 , that if any person , being a citizen of the united states , or in any foreign country , shall , without the permission or authority of the government of the united states , directly or indirectly , commence or carry on any verbal or written correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government , or any officer or agent thereof , relating to any dispute or controversy between any foreign government and the united states , with an intent to influence the measures or conduct of the government having disputes or controversies with the united states , as aforesaid ; or of any person , being a citizen of or resident within , the united states , and not duly authorized shall counsel , advise , aid or assist , in any such correspondence with intent as aforesaid , he or they shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor ; and , on conviction before any court of the united states having jurisdiction thereof , shall be punished by a fine not exceeding — thousand dollars , and by imprisonment during a term not less than — months , not exceeding — years .
