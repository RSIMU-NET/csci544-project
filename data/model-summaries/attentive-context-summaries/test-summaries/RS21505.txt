in order to "improve portability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets," congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) on august 21 , 1996 , p.l .
in the absence of the enactment of federal legislation , hipaa required hhs to issue privacy regulations .
subtitle f of title ii of hipaa is entitled "administrative simplification," and states that the purpose of the subtitle is to improve health care by "encouraging the development of a health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information. .
several statutory limitations are imposed on the secretary's authority to impose civil money penalties ( cmp ) .
hipaa requires health care payers and providers who transmit transactions electronically to use standardized data elements to conduct financial and administrative transactions .
enforcement of the privacy rule began on april 14 , 2003 , except for small health plans ( those with annual receipts of $5 million or less ) who have until april 2004 to comply .
hhs will enforce the civil money penalties , and the department of justice will enforce the criminal penalties .
section 264 of hipaa requires hhs to submit to the congress detailed recommendations on standards with respect to privacy rights for individually identifiable health information .
the final privacy rule was issued by hhs and published in the federal register on december 28 , 2000 at 65 fed .
where congress has not expressly preempted state and local laws , two types of implied federal preemption may be found: field preemption , in which federal regulation is so pervasive that one can reasonably infer that states or localities have no role to play , and conflict preemption , in which "compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility , or where the state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress. .
hipaa does not give hhs authority to regulate other private businesses or public agencies .
"contrary" is defined as situations where: ( 1 ) a covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the state and the federal requirements , or ( 2 ) when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress .
the secretary is also authorized to conduct compliance reviews .
judicial review of the secretary's determination and the issuance and enforcement of subpoenas is available in the united states court of appeals .
as part of its responsibilities under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) , the national committee on vital and health statistics ( ncvhs ) monitors the implementation of the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa , including the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information ( privacy rule ) .
the interim final rule establishes procedures for investigations , imposition of penalties , and hearings for civil money penalties ; and is effective may 19 , 2003 thru september 16 , 2003 .
enforcement and other activities to facilitate compliance include the provision of technical assistance ; responding to questions ; providing interpretations and guidance ; responding to state requests for preemption determinations ; investigating complaints and conducting compliance reviews ; and seeking civil monetary penalties and making referrals for criminal prosecution .
