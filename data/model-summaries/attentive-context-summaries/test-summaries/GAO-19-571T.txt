my statement today focuses on the status of va's efforts to address its high - risk designations and open gao recommendations in the following areas: ( 1 ) managing risks and improving va health care ; ( 2 ) va acquisition management ; ( 3 ) improving and modernizing federal disability programs ; and ( 4 ) other government - wide high - risk areas that have direct implications for va and its operations .
however , important recommendations remain unimplemented ( open ) , and we continue to identify similar deficiencies in recent and ongoing work .
we categorized these recommendations into nine areas: ( 1 ) veterans' access to timely health care ; ( 2 ) veterans' community care program ; ( 3 ) human capital management ; ( 4 ) information technology ; ( 5 ) appeals reform for disability benefits ; ( 6 ) quality of care and patient safety ; ( 7 ) national policy documents ; ( 8 ) contracting policies and practices ; and ( 9 ) veterans' access to burial options .
to address these deficiencies , we have made over 1,200 recommendations to va since 2000 ; va has implemented approximately 70 percent of them .
we , along with va's inspector general and other entities , continue to identify significant deficiencies in va's governance structures and operations â€” all of which can affect the care provided to our nation's veterans .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) efforts to address longstanding management challenges .
fully addressing these open recommendations could significantly improve va operations ; however , the recommendations highlight issues that are symptomatic of broader , systemic management and oversight challenges that will only be addressed through transformative action .
va is in need of transformation .
this list focuses attention on government operations that are most vulnerable to fraud , waste , abuse , or mismanagement , or in need of transformation .
congress has also acted to drive overarching change by , for example , passing the va mission act of 2018 ( va mission act ) .
for example , va is currently implementing its modernization plan , a framework through which the department intends to systemically overhaul its structure , culture , governance , and systems through organizational improvements .
as a result of these challenges , we added several va programs to our high - risk list .
in march 2019 , we sent a letter to the secretary of va that detailed 30 open recommendations that we deem the highest priority for implementation ( priority recommendations ) .
secretary wilkie has said that va is committed to addressing our high - risk concerns and has launched several transformational efforts .
specifically , more than 125 recommendations related to va health care remain open , including 17 recommendations that have remained open for 3 years or more ; 15 recommendations related to improving va acquisition management remain open , including 1 recommendation that has remained open for 3 years or more ; and 12 recommendations related to management of disability claims workloads .
this statement also describes va's ongoing efforts to transform and modernize the department .
