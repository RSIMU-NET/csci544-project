in his state of the union address on january 28 , 2003 , president george w. bush announced a new $720 million research and development ( r&d ) initiative to promote hydrogen as a transportation fuel .
the hydrogen fuel initiative is intended to complement the freedomcar initiative , which focuses on cooperative vehicle research between the federal government , universities , and private industry .
the freedomcar initiative replaced a related clinton administration initiative , the partnership for a new generation of vehicles ( pngv ) , announced in 1993 .
for fy2004 , however , overall funding for research ( within the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ) into hydrogen fuel , fuel cells , and vehicle technologies increased by about 30% .
through fy2003 , the overall level of funding for pngv - and freedomcar - related research at the department of energy ( doe ) remained relatively constant , with some of the funds for hybrid vehicles transferred to fuel cell research .
while both initiatives aimed to increase fuel efficiency of the automotive fleet , freedomcar extended the time frame by another 10 to 15 years and focused research on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ; pngv focused mainly on diesel - fueled hybrid vehicles .
some of this increase was offset by funding reductions in other programs , but the major portion of the increase was new funding .
the initiative's goals are to develop hydrogen fuel cell power systems that are durable , and deliver higher efficiency at lower cost than today's systems ; transportation fuel cell systems that deliver greater efficiency and lower cost , and meet or exceed emissions standards ; hydrogen refueling systems that are highly efficient and deliver fuel at the market price of gasoline ; and on - board hydrogen storage systems with improved energy density and cost over existing systems .
however , in 2007 congress enacted more stringent fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks as part of the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( p.l .
these issues include the proper role of the government in r&d , as well as the proper level of funding , and concerns over energy efficiency and fuel consumption .
the creation of freedomcar and the president's hydrogen fuel initiatives have raised debate over several issues .
the four goals for the hydrogen fuel initiative focus on improvements in fuel cell technology and improvements in the storage and delivery of hydrogen fuel .
for example , the national automotive center ( nac ) , part of the army's tank - automotive research , development , and engineering center ( tardec ) , coordinates fuel cell vehicle research between the department of defense ( dod ) and private contractors , and partners with doe , the department of transportation ( dot ) , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , academia , and industry .
most federal research on hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles is overseen by two offices within the doe office of energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) .
on august 8 , 2005 , president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .
however , for fy2009 , the bush administration has requested 30% below the fy2008 appropriation for hydrogen , fuel cell , and vehicle technologies programs .
