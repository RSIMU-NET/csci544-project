in addition to providing printing services to the federal government , the government printing office ( gpo ) provides government publications to the public through its sales program at 24 bookstores across the country ; by telephone , fax , and mail order sales at its headquarters in washington , d.c. ; and through consigned sales agents in other agencies .
this report responds to your request of july 21 , 1997 , that we review gpo's procedures involving the management of its inventory of publications that it determines to be excess , particularly its management of a major inventory reduction of excess publications that took place in september 1996 .
specifically , our objectives were to determine the facts surrounding the september 1996 inventory reduction: whether it followed existing policies and procedures , and how 3,258 copies of the senate 1789-1989 , a four - volume set written by senator byrd , were destroyed as part of that reduction .
gpo periodically reviews its inventory of publications to determine whether any can be considered excess — i.e. , no longer expected to sell — and then disposes of the excess copies .
we obtained the information for this report from gpo's policies and procedures manuals , inventory and financial records , interviews with agency and contractor personnel , and observations at gpo's warehouse in laurel , maryland .
gpo was established in 1861 to ( 1 ) assist congress and federal agencies in the production and replication of information products and services , and ( 2 ) provide the public with government information products and services .
our review was conducted in july and august 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
while gpo's initial actions could have helped prevent a recurrence , they did not appear to address all of the underlying causes of the problems associated with the september 1996 major inventory reduction .
on september 5 , 1997 , we provided a draft of this report to the public printer for review and comment .
gpo has taken action or has actions in process that are aimed at helping to prevent a recurrence of a situation in which excess publications are disposed of without regard to established policies and procedures .
the september 1996 inventory reduction involved 2,127 publications that had a printing and binding cost of about $3 million , which was about one - third of the surplus publications expense gpo charged for publications it excessed and disposed of in fiscal year 1996 .
as a result of the projected loss for fiscal year 1996 , the superintendent of documents tasked a management team with developing an action plan to increase revenue and reduce expenses , with the objective of returning the sales program to full cost - recovery in fiscal year 1997 .
the sales program operates within the revolving fund and is expected to recover its costs from its sales .
in may 1996 , financial projections indicated that the sales program expected a substantial loss for fiscal year 1996 , the first such loss in 15 years .
gpo has taken or plans to take actions that , if effectively implemented , should prevent this situation from recurring .
the inventory reduction began in early september 1996 , even before the action plan was issued , with a deadline for completion of september 30 , 1996 .
