this challenge is made more difficult by the age and poor documentation of some of the government's existing systems and its lackluster track record in modernizing systems to deliver expected improvements and meet promised deadlines .
as you know , the federal government is extremely vulnerable to year 2000 problems due to its widespread dependence on computer systems to process financial transactions , deliver vital public services , maintain national security , and carry out its operations .
today , i will briefly discuss the year 2000 risks facing the government ; highlight our major concerns with the government's progress in fixing its systems ; and introduce our guidance on year 2000 testing , which is designed to assist agencies in the most extensive and expensive part of remediation .
likewise , more attention needs to be devoted to ( 1 ) ensuring the government has a complete and accurate picture of year 2000 progress , ( 2 ) setting national priorities , ( 3 ) ensuring that the government's critical core business processes are adequately tested , ( 4 ) recruiting and retaining information technology personnel with the appropriate skills for year 2000-related work , and ( 5 ) assessing the nation's year 2000 risks , including those posed by key economic sectors .
many of the federal government's computer systems were originally designed and developed 20 to 25 years ago , are poorly documented , and use a wide variety of computer languages , many of which are obsolete .
for example: flights could be grounded or delayed and airline safety could be degraded ; the military services could find it extremely difficult to efficiently and effectively equip and sustain their forces around the world ; internal revenue service tax systems could be unable to process returns , thereby jeopardizing revenue collection and delaying refunds ; the social security administration process to provide benefits to disabled persons could be disrupted ; and payments to veterans with service - connected disabilities could be erroneous or severely delayed .
addressing the year 2000 problem in time will be a tremendous challenge for the federal government .
overall , the government's 24 major departments and agencies are making slow progress in fixing their systems .
because of the urgent nature of the year 2000 problem and the potentially devastating impact it can have on critical government operations , we designated the problem as a high - risk area for the federal government in february 1997 .
these included establishing governmentwide priorities and ensuring that agencies set their own agencywide priorities , developing a comprehensive picture of the nation's year 2000 readiness , requiring agencies to develop contingency plans for all critical core requiring agencies to develop an independent verification strategy to involve inspector general or other independent organizations in reviewing year 2000 progress , and designating lead agencies responsible for ensuring end - to - end operational testing of processes and supporting systems is performed .
in may 1997 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) reported that about 21 percent of the mission - critical systems ( 1,598 of 7,649 ) for these departments and agencies were year 2000 compliant .
since that time , we have issued over 40 reports and testimony statements detailing specific findings and recommendations related to the year 2000 readiness of a wide range of federal agencies .
