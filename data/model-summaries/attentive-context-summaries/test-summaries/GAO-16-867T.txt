i will address 1 ) the organizational structure of va's procurement function , 2 ) va procurement policies , and 3 ) the extent to which opportunities exist to improve va's key procurement functions and to save money .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) spent about $20 billion on goods and services in fiscal year 2015 .
the wide range of goods and services that va procures — including construction , information technology , medical supplies , and many other categories — is essential to meeting its mission to provide health care , pensions , and other benefits to the nation's military veterans .
prior assessments of va management , both internal and external , have found shortcomings in va procurement .
in 2015 , gao added va health care to our high risk list because of issues including ambiguous policies , inconsistent processes , and inadequate oversight and accountability .
however , many of va's regulations and policies are outdated , most notably the va acquisition regulation ( vaar ) , which has not been updated since 2008 .
as part of our work for our september 2016 report , in order to evaluate va's procurement organizational structure , we reviewed policy documents and interviewed officials in leadership , local contracting office management , and contracting officer roles .
to assess va's procurement policies , we obtained and analyzed policy documents , and interviewed officials responsible for making and implementing procurement policy .
to assess opportunities to improve va's key procurement functions and to save money , we obtained and analyzed information regarding va's medical - surgical prime vendor program and interviewed officials with roles in management , contracting , and operations for the program .
to provide the necessary leadership commitment to take advantage of these opportunities , we recommended in our september 2016 report that vha procurement and logistics conduct a review of visn - level strategic sourcing efforts , identify best practices , and , if needed , issue guidance .
the selected contracts were chosen from the national contracting offices and local veterans health administration ( vha ) contracting offices we visited , and the basis for selection included dollar value and whether these contracts were competed or not .
a new revision of the vaar is also in development , but has faced delays .
va began the process in 2011 but does not plan to finalize the new vaar until december 2018 , including the required rulemaking process .
we also reviewed a non - generalizable sample of 37 contracts and 19 associated task orders from fiscal years 2013 through 2015 .
most orders are placed through the integrated funds distribution control point activity , accounting and procurement ( ifcap ) system , a decades - old it system with a text - based interface , which does not include a tool to look up items that are available on the national contracts .
va has done this successfully in some areas , such as pharmaceuticals , and the planned changes to the mspv program could result in greater use of discounted national contracts for medical supplies if they are successfully implemented .
key va procurement policies are outdated and difficult for contracting officers to use .
