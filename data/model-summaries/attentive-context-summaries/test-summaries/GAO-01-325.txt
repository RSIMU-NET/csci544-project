since use of the in - lieu - fee mitigation option has increased over the last decade , you asked us to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the in - lieu - fee option has been used to mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands , ( 2 ) the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its intended purpose of mitigating such impacts , and ( 3 ) in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers' mitigation business .
of an estimated 220 million acres of marshes , bogs , swamps , and other wetlands in the contiguous united states during colonial times , over half have disappeared , and some of the remaining wetlands have been degraded .
this decrease is due , primarily , to agricultural activities and development .
agencies need adequate success criteria in order to measure whether progress is being made toward achieving the national goal of no net loss of the nation's remaining wetlands .
developers whose projects adversely affect wetlands must , as prescribed in regulations and guidance issued by the army corps of engineers ( corps ) and environmental protection agency ( epa ) under the clean water act , first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable .
to better ensure the ecological success of mitigation efforts under ad hoc arrangements , we recommend that the secretary of the army instruct the corps to establish procedures to clearly identify whether developers or recipients of funds are responsible for the ecological success of mitigation efforts and , using the same success criteria applicable to in - lieu - fee arrangements , to develop and implement procedures for assessing success .
it is not clear , however , whether such arrangements have , in practice , been an adequate method for mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands .
where states play a significant role in decisions on compensatory mitigation , the agencies could coordinate with them in developing the criteria .
in addition , several districts have never taken steps to assess whether in - lieu - fee mitigation has adequately mitigated adverse impacts , and those that did make assessments used varying criteria .
to ensure that in - lieu - fee organizations adequately compensate for adverse impacts to wetlands , we recommend that the administrator of epa , in conjunction with the secretaries of the army , commerce , and the interior , establish criteria to determine the ecological success of mitigation efforts and develop and implement procedures for assessing success .
recognizing the value of wetlands , in 1989 , the administration set a national goal to protect against additional loss .
the corps and epa , in coordination with the department of the interior's fish and wildlife service ( fws ) and the department of commerce's national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) , work together to ensure that developers mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands and other waters of the united states .
epa , in conjunction with the corps , fws , and noaa , issued guidance setting standards for mitigation banks effective december 1995 and for in - lieu - fee mitigation effective october 2000 .
corps districts supplied us with contradictory information or were not able to provide us with data to support claims that acreage and / or functions and values of wetlands that had been restored , enhanced , created , or preserved equaled or exceeded those that had been lost through development .
