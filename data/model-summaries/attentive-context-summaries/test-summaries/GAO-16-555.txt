what federal efforts have been made to determine the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states ? .
federal agencies , including the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , justice ( doj ) , labor , and state , as well as state and local law enforcement and non - governmental organizations , have taken a collaborative approach to combating human trafficking in the united states , both in conducting investigations and prosecutions and ensuring that victims have access to needed services .
what federal grant programs are intended to combat human trafficking and assist victims within the united states , and what steps have federal agencies taken , if any , to reduce the potential for duplication among grant programs ? .
we also reviewed documentation issued by the president's interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking to learn about additional federal efforts to determine prevalence .
sometimes perceived to be a foreign issue , human trafficking — the exploitation of a person typically through force , fraud , or coercion for such purposes as forced labor , involuntary servitude or commercial sex — is occurring in the united states .
we analyzed data from federal investigative and prosecutorial agencies and two federally - funded entities , the national human trafficking resource center ( nhtrc ) and the national center for missing and exploited children ( ncmec ) , which , while not specifically intended to do so , could give an indication of where human trafficking is occurring in the united states for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 .
to address the first objective , we reviewed the jvta and other federal laws related to human trafficking , and interviewed doj , dhs , and hhs officials to learn whether any federal agencies had efforts underway to collect data that could be used to determine the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states .
specifically , the updated guidance directs participating agencies to share information with members of the grantmaking committee prior to final decisions in at least one of the following ways: ( 1 ) share plans for programs containing anti - trafficking components during the grant program development process ; ( 2 ) notify the spog of grant solicitations within a reasonable time after they are issued ; or ( 3 ) notify spog partner agencies of proposed funding recipients prior to announcing the award .
human trafficking victims include women , men and transgender individuals , adults and children , and foreign nationals and u.s. citizens or nationals who are diverse with respect to race , ethnicity , and sexuality , among other factors .
