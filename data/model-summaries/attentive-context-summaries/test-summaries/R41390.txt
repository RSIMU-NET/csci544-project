implementation of the affordable care act ( aca ) is having a substantial impact on federal mandatory spending .
the two agencies primarily responsible for the aca's implementation are the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the internal revenue service ( irs ) , within the department of the treasury .
first , it discusses all the aca authorizations ( and reauthorizations ) of appropriations for grant and other programs .
most of the mandatory spending under the law is for expanding health insurance coverage .
this includes premium tax credits and cost - sharing subsidies for individuals and families who purchase private insurance coverage through the aca health insurance exchanges , as well as federal matching funds for states that choose to expand their medicaid programs .
in addition , the aca authorized new medicare spending and appropriated billions of dollars in mandatory funds to support numerous other activities and programs .
second , there are the costs incurred by federal agencies to administer and enforce the health insurance reforms and other core requirements of the law .
the aca is having a more modest impact on federal discretionary spending , which is subject to the annual appropriations process .
for example , it provided a permanent appropriation — available for 10-year periods — for a center for medicare & medicaid innovation to test and implement innovative health care payment and service delivery models .
furthermore , the aca established four special funds — and appropriated amounts to each one — to support primary care , public health , and comparative effectiveness research , and help pay for the administrative costs of the law's implementation .
both agencies have requested additional administrative funding in recent years to help cover the costs of implementing the law .
the next update will occur after congress completes its work on the fy2017 appropriations acts and the president releases the fy2018 budget .

discretionary spending and the budget control act of 2011 congress has taken a number of steps in recent years to limit federal discretionary spending .
