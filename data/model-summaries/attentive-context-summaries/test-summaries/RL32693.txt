distributional effects are often central policy issues in debates over tax legislation .
although economic analysis can be used to estimate the distribution of the tax system , or a tax change ( a positive or descriptive analysis ) , it cannot be used to provide a normative or prescriptive analysis .
even in the case of distribution issues , however , economic analysis can be used to facilitate the understanding of desirable distributions , measure them correctly , and determine the implications of different assumptions about social welfare for the optimal distribution of the tax burden .
in particular , it addresses the question of the justifications for a progressive tax system ( one where the share of income collected as a tax rises as income rises ) .
descriptive analyses indicate the expected effects of policies , but normative analyses indicate the optimal policy .
some of the private researchers involved in this work include the urban institute and brookings institution tax policy center ( tpc ) and the institute on taxation and economic policy ( itep ) of citizens for tax justice ( ctj ) .
the first section of this report , which is normative in nature , therefore discusses different philosophies about how the tax burden should be distributed , and what those philosophies imply for the shape of the tax system .
the third section of the report discusses the measures that can be used to characterize the distributional effects of tax changes .
most normative analysis in economics is focused on efficiency .
this section is presented for the interested reader , but is not a necessary preliminary to examining the analysis in the second section , which presents estimates of the distribution of the federal and total u.s. tax burden .
some of the measures that have been presented include ( 1 ) the share of taxpayers benefitted that fall below an income level ; ( 2 ) the percentage reduction in taxes paid ; ( 3 ) the tax cut as a percentage of income ( both pre - tax and disposable ) ; ( 4 ) the distribution of the tax cut by income class ; and ( 5 ) the average tax cut .
the governmental entities include the treasury department , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and joint committee on taxation ( jct ) .
one of them is how to pay for the goods that the government provides ( such as national defense , or highways ) .
the second issue is whether the tax system should be used for direct income redistribution ; in that case the optimal tax burden depends on the degree to which redistribution is deemed desirable .
their analyses vary in several ways , including how they define income , the definition and ordering of tax units , and the taxes included .
indeed , it is difficult even to determine the degree of progressivity or regressivity of a system so that the old and new tax systems can be compared based on their degree of progressivity .
when effective tax rates rise with income a tax system is progressive , it is proportional when effective tax rates are relatively constant , or regressive , if effective tax rates fall as income increases .
