 ( 3 ) enacting statutory rights for whistleblowers and establishing new executive agencies toprotect those rights has not produced the protections that some expected .
 ( 1 ) over the years , agency employees have received credit for revealing problems of defense costoverruns , unsafe nuclear power plant conditions , questionable drugs approved for marketing,contract illegalities and improprieties , and regulatory corruption .
national security whistleblowers wereexempted from the civil service reform act of 1978 and the whistleblower protection act of 1989 .
individual members and congressionalcommittees have attempted to provide long - term protections to whistleblowers , enabling them toprovide the kinds of agency information that congress wants without costs and injuries to theirgovernment careers .
some protections are available in statutes passed in recent years , including the intelligencecommunity whistleblower protection act of 1998 .
as explained in this report,the office of special counsel , the merit systems protection board , and the federal circuit - - theagencies created by congress to safeguard the rights of whistle blowers - - have not in many casesprovided the anticipated protections to federal employees .
the purpose of this report is to explore the statutory and political protections available tonational security whistleblowers .
in 1978 , a senate panel found that the fear of reprisal "renders intra - agency communications a sham,and compromises not only the employee , management , and the code of ethics , but also theconstitutional function of congressional oversight itself. .
first , an examination of the civil service reform act and thewhistleblower protection act will explain why national security whistleblowers were excluded fromthe protections provided in those statutes .
agency whistleblowers operate within a system of mixed messages .
on the one hand , thecode of ethics adopted by congress in 1958 directs all government employees to "expose corruptionwherever discovered. .
second , to the extent that those statutes are consideredmodels to protect national security whistleblowers , the experience of the office of special counsel,the merit systems protection board , and the federal circuit is relevant in evaluating protections fornational security whistleblowers .
 ( 2 ) on the other hand , exposingcorruption can result in their being fired , transferred , reprimanded , denied promotion , or harassed .
this conflict between the branches is seen in the issuance of executive orders by presidentstheodore roosevelt and william howard taft in 1902 and 1909 and the resulting legislation - - thelloyd - lafollette act of 1912 - - adopted by congress to maintain access to agency information .
presidents may decide to centralize control of agency information by requiring the agencyhead to approve the release of any information .
whistleblower activity is often viewed as a struggle between the executive and legislativebranches .
members of congress regularly express a need toobtain information from employees within the agency , without seeking the approval of the agencyhead .
theconstitutionality of the lloyd - lafollette act continues to be challenged today by the justicedepartment .
congress passed legislation in 1978 to abolish the civil service commission and create suchnew institutions as the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the merits systems protectionboard ( mspb ) , and the office of special counsel ( osc ) .
 ( 45 ) the legislative history of the civil service reform act anticipated that federal agencywhistleblowers would report wrongdoing not only to their supervisors but to congress , the public,and the press .
