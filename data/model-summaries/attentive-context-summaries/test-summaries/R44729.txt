it begins by providing a broad overview of ( 1 ) congress's powers under the constitution and ( 2 ) congress's role in interpreting this document .
on january 5 , 2011 , the house of representatives adopted an amendment to house rule xii to require that members of the house state the constitutional basis for congress's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution .
 ( the amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions. ) .
the report then specifically addresses house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , discussing its key requirements and limits , the legal effect of a cas , and the debate over the rule's value .
the constitutional authority statement ( cas ) rule , found at house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , was subsequently adopted in the 113th , 114th , 115th , and 116th congresses .
as the cas rule begins its ninth year , the requirement continues to be a topic of congressional debate and inquiry , as members of the house contemplate how to comply with the rule prior to every submission of a bill or joint resolution .
this report aims to aid in understanding the cas requirement .
given the powers of congress and the limits on those powers under the constitution , the question remains as to which branch of the federal government may interpret the scope of congress's powers .
the report concludes by discussing trends with regard to the house's recent cas practices and by providing considerations for congressional personnel drafting cass .
other cass have gone beyond citing to the affirmative powers that the constitution provides congress and have discussed potential restraints the constitution imposes that may prohibit the enactment of the underlying legislation .
a house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , statement regarding the constitutionality of legislation is required only when a member of the house introduces legislation .
to the contrary , the early history of the united states is replete with examples of all three branches of the federal government playing a role in constitutional interpretation , with congress and the executive openly questioning the supreme court's pronouncements on constitutional law , such as the court's rulings on the national bank or slavery .
understanding the purpose and logic of the cas rule first requires an understanding of both the powers provided to the congress under the constitution and congress's role in interpreting the constitution .
while the customary practice with regard to cass , to date , has been to provide a short citation to the provision in the constitution that affirmatively grants congress the authority to enact the underlying legislation , it is not unprecedented for members to cite sources beyond the text of the constitution , such as supreme court case law , primary source materials on the constitution , or a constitutional law treatise .
the court's decision in cooper , coupled with broader institutional factors that may further constrain congress's ability to engage in constitutional interpretation , has provided support for the notion of judicial supremacy in constitutional interpretation within the coordinate branches of government .
while only congress may exercise the legislative power , this power , like those belonging to the other branches of the federal government , is cabined by the terms of the constitution .
