the cooperative threat reduction ( ctr ) programs , funded by the department of defense ( dod ) , are the most visible of these programs .
it describes potential recipients of such funding ( those states with wmd programs and terrorism problems ) ; the kinds of assistance that may be possible ; potential legal , political , and technical constraints on assistance ; and potential costs and benefits to the united states of providing such assistance .
