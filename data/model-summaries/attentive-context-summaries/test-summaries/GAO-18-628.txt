in the coming decades , the need for long - term services and supports ( ltss ) to assist individuals with limited abilities for self - care is expected to increase , in part due to the aging of the population .
medicaid , a federal - state health financing program for low - income and medically needy individuals , is the nation's primary payer of ltss .
in recent years the congress , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the federal agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) responsible for overseeing states' medicaid programs — and states have taken steps to expand the use of hcbs and shift the provision of ltss away from institutional settings .
in addition , states may seek permission from cms to provide hcbs under waivers of traditional medicaid requirements ; for example , in order to provide services to a specific population , such as individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities , or to limit the number of beneficiaries who can receive hcbs .
for example , the patient protection and affordable care act , enacted in 2010 , created new options and provided additional funding for states to make hcbs available to eligible medicaid beneficiaries .
you asked us to review the approaches states use to provide coverage for hcbs in the medicaid program .
ltss comprise a broad range of health care , personal care , and supportive services to help individuals with physical , developmental , or cognitive disabilities maintain their quality of life .
this report describes 1. decisions that influenced the structure of selected states' medicaid 2. selected states' challenges providing hcbs to medicaid beneficiaries and efforts to respond to these challenges .
given the variety of options available for providing hcbs and the wide variation in hcbs spending among states , questions arise about how states are structuring their hcbs programs , as well as challenges they may face in providing access to these services .
in fiscal year 2016 , the most recent year of data available , medicaid spent an estimated $167 billion on ltss .
however , the extent to which states cover hcbs in their medicaid programs varies , as does the proportion of ltss spending used for hcbs ; the proportion of medicaid ltss spending on hcbs ranged from 27 percent to 81 percent among states in 2016 , a three - fold difference .
cms's recent report on the growth of mltss also notes states' desire for improvements in quality of care and outcomes ; increased access to hcbs providers ; and better care coordination , among other factors .
in concert with these efforts , the proportion of ltss spending for hcbs has increased nationwide .
states have a number of different options to provide medicaid coverage of hcbs .
as a result , states vary in the structure of their hcbs programs .
the use of mltss has increased over time ; mltss spending rose from $10 billion in fiscal year 2012 to about $39 billion in 2016 .
states can provide certain types of hcbs under their state medicaid plans .
ltss delivered outside of institutional settings are known as home - and community - based services ( hcbs ) , and include adult day care , personal care services , and services provided in assisted living .
