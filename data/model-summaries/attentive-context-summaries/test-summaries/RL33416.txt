as the economy of the people's republic of china ( prc ) has boomed in the past decade , raising living standards for many of its citizens , incidents of social protest also have risen dramatically .
economic development has brought about or exacerbated a host of economic , social , and political problems , including income inequality , environmental pollution , official corruption , and ambiguous property rights , which in turn have fueled grievances .
in the medium term , ongoing u.s. efforts to promote civil society and the rule of law in the prc could help people and institutions in china to develop legal understanding and procedures for expressing and resolving social grievances .
to a large extent , the prc government at various levels has been unable or unwilling to mitigate social anger .
social unrest in china affects ongoing u.s. policies promoting human rights and democracy in china and broader considerations about engagement with the prc .
in the longer run , social unrest may adversely affect the business climate for foreign investment , the pace of economic reforms ( including compliance with wto commitments ) , political stability in the prc , and chinese foreign policy .
in the short run , social unrest raises many human rights concerns toward china among many u.s. policy - makers .
as part of its recommendations to the president and the congress in 2005 , the congressional - executive commission on china urged the united states government to encourage the prc to take further steps to address the causes of social unrest .
the prc government's efforts to address social unrest have been hampered by tensions between the central and local governments , institutional weaknesses , inconsistent policies , and the inability or unwillingness to undertake fundamental political reforms .
workers are not allowed to form unions independent of the state - controlled all china federation of trade unions ( acftu ) .
policy options for congress include monitoring the situation , increasing assistance for local democracy , civil society , and rule - of - law programs in china , supporting a free press and independent judiciary , or pressing the chinese government to respect the rights of protestors and release jailed activists .
at the end of 2005 , the central government pledged a number of additional reforms aimed at rural unrest , including better management of land use , strengthening the legal system , protecting farmers' land , raising rural incomes , increasing social spending on health care and education , and abolishing the national tax on farmers .
these steps include ensuring that village elections are free from government interference , giving chinese citizens the power to enforce constitutional protections , making the judiciary independent , and removing restrictions on the news media and non - governmental organizations .
some analysts argue that the challenges of addressing grievances and controlling protests will encourage beijing to seek a stable international environment in which it can focus on domestic economic growth and social stability .
others argue that social unrest may cause beijing to adopt a more hostile international posture .
social unrest could also undermine the power of the chinese communist party , although current indicators do not point to a significant loss of political control .
