97-291 - - nafta: related environmental issues and initiatives updated september 28 , 200 .
environmental issues emerged early in nafta negotiations , and linkages between trade and environmental issues were reflected inthe outcome of these negotiations more so than in any previous trade talks .
while not a new issue , the question ofwhether acountry's stricter environmental measures could be found to pose non - tariff trade barriers received an unprecedentedlevel of attentionduring the nafta debate .
a related concern was that expected nafta - driven industrialization andpopulation growthin the u.s. - mexico border region would worsen the severe pollution problems already present .
nafta's standards provisions do not affect a country's ability to determine its levelsof environmentalprotection for manufacturing and other process standards ( such as water pollution controls and resource harvestingpractices ) .
at least20 cases have beenfiled , including 6 against the united states , one of which involves california's ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether ( mtbe ) in gasoline .
ultimately , the nafta parties included language to conditionally protect a party's stricter environmental,health , and safetystandards for products and produce ( provided that , among other things , such measures are scientifically based ) .
nafta set a precedent in addressing its relationship to multilateral environmental agreements ( meas ) .
the u.s. - central america fta ( cafta ) , which the president has signed but which requiresimplementing legislation,includes similar provisions and also adapts the naaec provisions that allow citizens to file submissions concerninga party's failureto effectively enforce its environmental laws .
interest in the 108th congress also has continued regarding the implications of nafta and the naaec for new trade agreements.the u.s. - chile and u.s. - singapore ftas both include an obligation for parties to enforce their environmental laws,and make thisobligation subject to dispute settlement procedures .
additionally , the question was raised whether a country's weaker environmentalprotection measures ortheir ineffective enforcement would create a competitive advantage and provide an added incentive for businessesto relocateproduction to the least regulated country .
u.s. - mexico and u.s. - canada bilateral waste - tradeagreements also areincluded , and the parties may agree to add others .
in 1993 , the three nafta governments adopted the north american agreement on environmental cooperation ( naaec ) , whichincludes dispute settlement provisions to address a party's failure to enforce environmental laws .
although tradeofficials argued thatenvironment was not a customary trade matter and that nafta talks were not the best forum for resolving theseissues , the level ofconcern over environmental issues in congress prompted nafta negotiators to respond to them .
the u.s. - chile fta further calls for parties to negotiate a u.s. - chile environmentalcooperationagreement .
other nafta provisionsencourageupward harmonization of standards and encourage parties to integrate environmental protection and sustainabledevelopment intoeconomic decision - making .
the listed agreements include the montreal protocol on substances thatdeplete the ozonelayer ; the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal ; and theconvention on international trade in endangered species .
6 , the energy bill ( section 146 ) would amend naftaimplementinglegislation to direct u.s. nadb board members to encourage the bank to finance infrastructure projects related toclean energy andenergy conservation .
