the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the ssi program , which is the nation's largest cash assistance program for the poor .
in 2001 , outstanding ssi debt and newly detected overpayments totaled $4.7 billion .
last year , ssi provided $33 billion in benefits to 6.8 million aged , blind , and disabled persons .
my testimony today focuses on our current review of actions taken by ssa over the last several years to improve its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities as well as its ability to recover overpayments once they occur .
for example , to better deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients' financial eligibility for benefits ; enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads ; and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities .
we designated ssi a high - risk program in 1997 after several years of reporting on specific instances of abuse and mismanagement , including poor overpayment detection and recovery practices .
these factors also make the ssi program vulnerable to overpayments .
benefit eligibility and payment amounts for the ssi population are determined by complex and often difficult to verify financial factors such as an individual's income , resource levels , and living arrangements .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
individual financial circumstances also often change , requiring staff to frequently reassess recipients' continuing eligibility for benefits .
to examine these issues , we reviewed ssi performance data and various internal and external reports on ssi management and operations .
in addition to improving its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities , ssa has also made recovery of overpaid benefits a higher priority .
the following year we issued a report with recommendations for improving ssi operations .
for example , ssa now seizes the tax refunds of individuals with unresolved ssi debt and recently began more aggressive actions to recover overpayments from former ssi recipients by reducing their social security retirement or disability benefits .
thus , the ssi program tends to be difficult and labor intensive to administer .
we also conducted more than 175 interviews with ssa managers and staff at its headquarters in baltimore and in its philadelphia , san francisco , and atlanta regions and with managers and staff from state disability determination services .
in summary , ssa has taken many actions over the last several years to strengthen ssi program integrity .
further , at a time when ssa has enhanced its debt recovery capability , its current overpayment waiver policies and practices may be causing ssa to unnecessarily forego the collection of millions of dollars in overpaid benefits annually .
further , there are vulnerabilities that ssa has yet to address , such as excessively complex program rules for determining recipient living arrangements and underused penalty authorities for persons who fail to report information affecting their benefits .
however , because a number of initiatives are still in the planning or early implementation stages , it is too soon to assess their ultimate impact on ssi payment accuracy .
during our meetings with management and staff , we documented their views on the priority ssa places on improving ssi program integrity , and verified policy and procedural changes that have been made in operations .
