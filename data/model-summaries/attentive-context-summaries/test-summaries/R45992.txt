more specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) the history and purpose of the clauses ; ( 2 ) whether the president is a person holding an "office of profit or trust under [the united states]" for purposes of the foreign emoluments clause ; ( 3 ) the scope of the emoluments clauses , focusing specifically on disputes over the breadth of the term "emolument" ; and ( 4 ) how the clauses may be enforced .
for most of their history , the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses ( collectively , the emoluments clauses or the clauses ) were little discussed and largely unexamined by the courts .
t he constitution contains three provisions that mention the term "emolument": 1 .
recent litigation involving the president , however , has led to multiple federal court decisions more fully addressing the clauses' scope and application .
the first two of these clauses are the focus of this report .
article i , section 6 , clause 2 provides ( among other things ) that no member of congress shall "be appointed" during his or her term "to any civil office under the authority of the united states , which shall have been created , or the emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time[.] .
article i , section 9 , clause 8 provides that "no person holding any office of profit or trust under [the united states] , shall , without the consent of congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state" ; 2 .
article ii , section 1 , clause 7 provides that "[t]he president shall , at stated times , receive for his services , a compensation , which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected , and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the united states , or any of them" ; and 3 .
this report accordingly provides an overview of the emoluments clauses as they relate to the president , focusing on the legal issues that have been central to the recent litigation .
the foreign emoluments clause .
the domestic emoluments clause .
that said , it is unclear whether legislative actions would provide an effective means to enforce the emoluments clauses against the president , given the possibility of veto and potential separation - of - powers objections .
the ineligibility clause .
for instance , given that the foreign emoluments clause explicitly provides a role for congress in evaluating the propriety of the receipt of foreign emoluments by federal officers , congress may be empowered to create civil or criminal remedies for violations or establish prophylactic reporting requirements through legislation .
separate from issues regarding the scope of the emoluments clauses is how the provisions' mandates are enforced , including whether and to what extent the federal courts and congress have a role in addressing violations of the clauses .
this question has divided legal scholars and has only recently been addressed by any federal courts .
