china has made clear advances in space capabilities over the past decade .
the country has launched over 100 orbital missions since 1970 , including a string of 50 consecutive successful long march rocket launches from 1996 to 2006 , after overcoming technical problems with the help of u.s. companies in the mid - 1990s .
china's space program was initially institutionalized under the people's liberation army ( pla ) .
china's space activities and intentions are not transparent ; the dual - use nature of most space technology compounds the uncertainties of interpreting chinese decision making .
in a series of government reforms in the 1990s , the china national space administration ( cnsa ) — roughly equivalent to the u.s. national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — was created under the civilian commission of science , technology and industry for national defense .
china sent humans into space in 2003 and 2005 , and orbited a lunar explorer in october 2007 that is paving the way for additional moon exploration .
china is now a world leader in yearly space launches , yet remains notably less active than russia or the united states , as shown in table 1 .
the pla continues to play a role in china's overall space activities , managing both manned civilian and military efforts , while cnsa handles unmanned scientific projects and international collaboration .
china has been a strong proponent of an arms control regime in space and has argued for the peaceful use of outer space in the united nations' conference on disarmament and at the prevention of an arms race in outer space dialogue .
china's space white paper of 2006 states that chinese space activities are subservient to domestic social and economic development goals , which include national security .
some claim that china takes this stand in order to prevent further progress by the united states in space while allowing it to covertly catch up .
china's spending on space is growing , although details are often not available .
this includes cooperation on the eu - led galileo satellite positioning system , but progress on this has been slow and sometimes controversial .
competition in space also exists among china , india , japan , and south korea .
chinese budget opacity , the dual - use nature of most space technology , and currency conversion difficulties make direct comparisons uncertain .
currently , china collaborates with russia , the european union ( eu ) , brazil , canada , nigeria , and others .
a china - eu collaborative framework on space has been in place since 1998 .
the potential benefits of expanded cooperation and dialogue with china include: improved transparency .
the cnsa reports to have a budget about one - tenth the size of nasa's .
western experts estimate chinese space spending at $1.4-2.2 billion per year , on par with france and japan .
the russian partnership is probably the most active and has benefitted china's manned space effort significantly .
china collaborates with other countries on civilian space activities , but it is not considered a key member of the international space community .
on january 11 , 2007 , china conducted its first successful anti - satellite ( asat ) weapons test , destroying one of its inactive weather satellites .
