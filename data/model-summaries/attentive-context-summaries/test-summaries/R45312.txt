the electric power grid in the united states comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems which bring power to end - use customers .
electricity generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the united states .
the u.s. electric grid has historically operated with a high level of reliability ; however , the various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural , operational , or manmade events .
the grid also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and other wholesale power companies in different states and regions of the united states .
adoption of digital technologies has improved the efficiency and speed of operations and processes , and allowed for an almost instantaneous exchange of information between connected devices .
current efforts to ensure the reliability of the grid are highlighted , and potential grid vulnerabilities are explored with a focus on the electric power sector's mutual dependency on other critical infrastructure .
while natural and operational failures can be mitigated somewhat by planning and prudent investments , cybersecurity is a growing concern for both electric utilities and other critical infrastructure entities .
congress gave the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk - power system under the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l .
technologies and actions to address perceived future threats are described , and possible risks to approaches moored in technology - based cybersecurity defense systems .
further attacks on u.s. critical energy infrastructure are expected , as nation states view disruption of the u.s. economy as a potential target .
finally , since the possibility does exist for a major cyber and / or physical security attack to result in significant damage or impairment , the potential need to build resilience into the grid to enable a quicker recovery is discussed .
often , these digital devices are also connected to the internet to increase the ability to share information with a multitude of users and devices .
this report discusses the current state of electric grid cybersecurity , and the interconnected dependency of critical infrastructure with regard to electric sector reliability .
in march 2018 , the united states computer emergency readiness team ( us - cert ) issued an alert concerning cyber intrusions at critical energy and manufacturing infrastructure companies .
while these intrusions have not been reported as having resulted in significant disruptions , concerns have increased over the potential for these intrusions to result in damaging cyber attacks in the future .
while the benefits of internet - connected digital technologies are many , so too are the risks of a cybersecurity breach from exposure to a globally internet - connected environment .
the intrusions , which have been directed at the ics networks of energy , manufacturing , communications and nuclear entities , include the following: cyber intrusions on the scada systems of the bowman dam in rye , new york resulted in federal indictments against a group of hackers linked to iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps .
the electric grid relies on a number of electronic devices , switches , and circuit breakers to regulate and report on the flow of electricity at different parts of the system .
