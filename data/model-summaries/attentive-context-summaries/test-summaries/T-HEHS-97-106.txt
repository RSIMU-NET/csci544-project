we are pleased to be here today to discuss medicare's skilled nursing facility ( snf ) , home health care , and inpatient rehabilitation benefits and the administration's forthcoming legislative proposals related to them .
the information presented today is based on our previous work and the most recent data on the benefits available from the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) , which manages medicare .
after relatively modest growth during the 1980s , medicare's expenditures for snfs and home health care have grown rapidly in the 1990s .
snf payments rose from $2.8 billion in 1989 to $11.3 billion in 1996 , while home health care costs grew from $2.4 billion to $17.7 billion over the same period .
rehabilitation facility payments increased from $1.4 billion in 1989 to $3.9 billion in 1994 .
administration officials also have discussed their intention to propose in the future a coordinated payment system for all post - acute care as a method to give providers efficiency incentives .
the administration's major proposals for both snfs and home health care are designed to give the providers of these services increased incentives to operate efficiently by moving them from a cost reimbursement to a prospective payment system .
my comments today will focus on the reasons for cost growth and the administration's announced legislative proposals for these three medicare benefits .
earlier discharges from hospitals led to the substitution of days spent in snfs for what in the past would have been the last few days of hospital care ; use of ancillary services , such as physical therapy , in snfs has increased , and specific controls for these services have not been implemented ; rapid growth in the number of inpatient rehabilitation beds available and use of these beds by beneficiaries , as well as the likelihood of some substitution of rehabilitation days for general hospital days , led to higher expenditures for inpatient rehabilitation ; and a diminution of administrative controls over the benefits , resulting at least in part from fewer resources being available for such controls , reduced the likelihood of inappropriately submitted claims being denied .
expenditures for inpatient rehabilitation facilities have grown rapidly since the mid - 1980s .
over those periods , annual growth averaged 22 percent for snfs , 33 percent for home health care , and 23 percent for rehabilitation facilities .
what remains unclear about these proposals is whether an appropriate unit of service can be defined for calculating prospective payments and whether hcfa's databases are adequate for it to set reasonable rates .
because the legislative proposals were only recently released by the administration , our analysis was primarily based on summaries of them that were publicly released earlier in the year and our discussions with hcfa officials about the proposals .
finally , the administration is proposing that snfs be required to bill for all services provided to their medicare residents rather than allowing outside suppliers to bill .
this concept has appeal , but we have concerns about it similar to those we have for snf and home health prospective payments .
this latter proposal has merit because it would make control over the use of ancillary services significantly easier .
