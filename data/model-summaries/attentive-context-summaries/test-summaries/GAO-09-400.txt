in fiscal year 2008 , the department of defense ( dod ) granted eligibility for initial or renewal security clearances to more than 630,000 applicants who were military , dod civilian , or private industry personnel working on dod contracts .
long - standing delays in the clearance process led us to designate dod's personnel security clearance process as a high - risk area in 2005 .
 ( 3 ) to what extent did executive branch reporting to congress from 2006 through 2009 on dod and other federal agencies include information on quality in the security clearance process ? .
that designation continued in 2007 and 2009 , when we identified continued delays in the clearance process and additional concerns with clearance documentation .
 ( 2 ) how complete is the documentation of investigations and adjudications for initial top secret security clearances favorably adjudicated within dod ? .
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( irtpa ) established , among other things , milestones for reducing the time to complete initial clearances .
moreover , because the executive branch has not fully addressed quality in its irtpa - required reports to congress , it has missed opportunities to provide congressional decision makers with full transparency over the clearance process .
finally , the executive branch has not been reporting on quality in the clearance process , further impeding the ability of decision makers to carry out effective oversight .
we are making five recommendations to omb , opm , and dod .
with respect to dod's personnel security clearance process , dod is responsible for determining which military , dod civilian , and private industry personnel working on dod contracts require access to classified information and must apply for a security clearance and undergo an investigation .
specifically , we addressed the following questions regarding security clearances for military , dod civilian personnel , and private industry personnel working on dod contracts: ( 1 ) how complete are the timeliness data that the executive branch reported for clearances granted in fiscal year 2008 ? .
clearances potentially give these applicants access to information that , if improperly disclosed , could , in some cases , cause exceptionally grave damage to national security .
we limited our focus to initial top secret clearances because ( 1 ) we have identified documentation problems with this clearance level in previous work ; ( 2 ) investigators gather the most information for investigations for top secret clearances ; and ( 3 ) individuals granted top secret clearances have access to information that , if improperly disclosed , could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security .
to determine the completeness of the timeliness data that the executive branch reported for clearances granted in fiscal year 2008 for the department of defense ( dod ) , we reviewed title iii of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( irtpa ) , measured the timeliness of nearly 630,000 clearances completed in fiscal year 2008 for military , dod civilian , and industry personnel , and analyzed the executive branch 2009 annual report to congress required by irtpa .
to provide more transparency in future versions of the irtpa - required annual report to congress on personnel security clearances , we recommend that omb's deputy director for management , in the capacity as the chair of the performance accountability council , include metrics on quality .
