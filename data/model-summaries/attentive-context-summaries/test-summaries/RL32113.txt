one manifestation of this struggle occurs when congressional committees engage in oversight of the administrative bureaucracy ; another when members of congress attempt to intervene in administrative proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the member's constituency .
the inevitable tension between congress and the executive created by our constitutionally mandated system of separated but shared powers has been the source of continual interbranch conflict .
both such interventions involve varying degrees of intrusion into agency decisionmaking processes .
it concludes that the courts , in balancing congress's performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies , have shown a decided predilection for protecting the congressional prerogatives .
on relatively rare occasions these interventions have resulted in court actions challenging the congressional intercession as exertions of undue political influence on agency decisionmakers which violate the due process rights of participants in the proceedings in question and impugn the integrity of the agency decisional processes ; or in disciplinary proceedings before ethics committees of either house alleging that such member actions violated institutional rules or other ethical standards .
past high profile incidents raising questions regarding the legal and ethical propriety of congressional exertions of influence on administrative decisionmaking have surprisingly produced only a paucity of authoritative commentary on and analysis of the guiding principles and standards applicable to the constitutional bases of the roles members play when they act as part of the committee oversight process or in their individual representative capacities .
it notes that since congressional intervention and expressions of interest in administrative matters from a member's office are recognized as legitimate , official representational and oversight functions and duties of members of congress , the primary focus of these ethical and statutory conduct restraints is limited to ( 1 ) any improper enrichment or financial benefit accruing to the member in return for or because of his or her official actions and influences , including the receipt of gifts or payments , or existing financial interests in , or relating to the matter under consideration ; and ( 2 ) any overt coercion or threats of reprisals , or promises of favoritism or reward to administrators from the member's office which could indicate an arguable abuse of a member's official representational or oversight role .
such challenges have arisen in the context of congressional intercessions into rulemakings , ratemakings , informal decisionmaking , adjudications , and agency investigations that arguably would lead to an adjudicatory proceeding .
toward that end , part ii reviews the judicial development and application of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence will be deemed to have tainted an agency proceeding .
thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved , the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors congress did not intend to make relevant .
this report is designed to provide a contemporary overview of applicable guidelines and considerations in the judicial and congressional forums .
while campaign contributions from private individuals to members have a facial legitimacy and necessity in our government and electoral system which other forms of monetary transfers to legislators ( such as gifts ) do not , and may be treated differently , both houses of congress advise members and staff to avoid any appearance of a "linkage" between campaign contributions and interventions .
