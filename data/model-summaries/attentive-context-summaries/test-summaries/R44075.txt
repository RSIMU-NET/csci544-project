established as part of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l .
111-148 , as amended ) , the independent payment advisory board ( ipab ) is charged with developing proposals to "reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending. .
the board's proposals are to be implemented by the secretary of health and human services ( the secretary ) unless congress acts either by formulating its own proposal to achieve the same savings or by discontinuing the automatic implementation process defined in the statute .
by statute , the ipab's proposals must ( 1 ) relate only to the medicare program ; ( 2 ) result in a net reduction in total medicare program expenditures at least equal to the savings target established by the chief actuary of cms [to reduce the expenditure per capita growth rate] ; ( 3 ) not include any recommendation to ration care , raise revenues or medicare beneficiary premiums , increase cost sharing , restrict benefits , or alter eligibility ; ( 4 ) not reduce payments to providers or suppliers scheduled to receive a reduction in payment as the result of certain productivity adjustments under aca section 3401 ; ( 5 ) include recommendations to reduce medicare payments under parts c and / or d ; and ( 6 ) include recommendations with respect to administrative funding for the secretary to carry out the board's recommendations .
several proposals have been advanced over the years to create an independent policymaking entity that would ( 1 ) be charged with limiting the future growth in medicare expenditures ; ( 2 ) be insulated from special interests and lobbyists because its members would be appointed , rather than elected ; and ( 3 ) be comprised of officials who would serve for extended terms .
in 2008 , senator daschle proposed the federal health board , modeled after the federal reserve board , with broad authority over both private and public health care programs , including benefit and coverage recommendations , regulation of private insurance markets , and improvements in quality of care .
historic patterns of growth in overall health care spending , and in the medicare program in particular , are viewed as not being sustainable .
prior proposals for similar entities include the following: in 2000 and 2001 , senators breaux and frist introduced reform proposals to increase the budget of the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , create separate agencies to administer parts of the medicare program , and establish a medicare board to manage competition among private plans and traditional medicare ( referred to as "breaux - frist i," s. 1895 , and "breaux - frist ii," s. 358 ) .
the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , in its cost estimate of the aca prior to passage , projected that the cumulative impact of the board's recommendations from 2015 through 2019 would reduce total spending by $15.5 billion ; during the same period , total medicare expenditures were projected to be $3.9 trillion with average spending per beneficiary increasing from $13,374 in 2015 to $15,749 in 2019 .
while the council would have had authority to recommend broader policy reforms , its authority outside of medicare payment policy would have been limited .
