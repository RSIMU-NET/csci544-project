on behalf of the federal government , the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , in coordination with the office of management and budget ( omb ) , prepares the cfs .
the purpose of this report is to ( 1 ) discuss the details of the weaknesses we identified during our audit of the fiscal year 2006 cfs regarding financial reporting procedures and internal control over the process for preparing the cfs , ( 2 ) recommend improvements to address those weaknesses , and ( 3 ) provide the status of corrective actions on the recommendations detailed in our prior reports and listed in appendix i .
in our report dated december 1 , 2006 , we disclaimed an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2006 and 2005 .
for the past 10 years , certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices have resulted in conditions that prevented us from expressing an opinion on the cfs .
we have reported that the federal government did not have adequate systems , controls , and procedures for preparing the cfs .
other internal control weaknesses were identified during our tests of the federal government's process for preparing the cfs .
many of the weaknesses in internal control that have contributed to our continuing disclaimers of opinion were identified by auditors during their audits of federal agencies' financial statements and were reported in detail with recommendations to the agencies in separate reports .
we have discussed each of the new weaknesses identified during our fiscal year 2006 audit with your staff and have incorporated their comments as appropriate .
this appendix includes open recommendations from four of our prior reports: financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government needs improvement , gao - 04-45 ( washington , d.c.: oct. 30 , 2003 ) ; financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government needs further improvement , gao - 04-866 ( washington , d.c.: sept. 10 , 2004 ) ; financial audit: process for preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government continues to need improvement , gao - 05-407 ( washington , d.c.: may 4 , 2005 ) ; and financial audit: significant internal control weaknesses remain in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government , gao - 06- 415 ( washington , d.c.: apr .
