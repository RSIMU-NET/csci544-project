this report examines ( 1 ) how energy storage can be used to enhance grid operations and performance ; ( 2 ) factors that affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations ; and ( 3 ) federal and state policies and other efforts that address the deployment of energy storage .
we selected 29 studies from the congressional research service ( crs ) ; doe ; national laboratories ; government - sponsored research ; non - governmental organizations such as nonprofits and research institutes ; industry associations ; and peer - reviewed scientific and trade journals .
moreover , the california public utility commission has approved rules that increase the ways for energy storage systems to obtain revenue for multiple uses , or grid services , for example , from frequency regulation , capacity , or other services .
through interviews with stakeholders and our review of documents , we identified examples of policies and other efforts that have encouraged the deployment of energy storage or aim to address market barriers , including the establishment of mandates and targets for storage adoption , the revision of interconnection rules and planning requirements , financial incentives , and funding .
the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which regulates interstate electricity transmission and oversees wholesale interstate electricity markets , plays a role in addressing barriers to competition in electricity markets as part of its statutory duty to ensure that market rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential .
electricity is supplied through a complex network of power plants and power lines — the electricity grid — managed by utility companies and other operators .
the traditional model for generating and selling electricity in the united states is changing .
specifically , we interviewed officials and representatives from 4 federal agencies ( doe , ferc , crs , and the internal revenue service ) ; 3 national laboratories ( the national renewable energy laboratory , the pacific northwest national laboratory , sandia national laboratories ) ; 8 state government agencies ; 11 grid operators and utilities ; 7 industry associations ; 2 nongovernmental organizations ; and 6 other market participants , including storage project developers and consultants .
while doe has undertaken a range of efforts over the past several years to address challenges to deployment , future funding of these efforts is uncertain .
the operation of electric power systems involves a complex process of forecasting the demand for electricity , and scheduling and operating power plants to meet that varying demand .
the ability to store electricity more easily could change the operating capabilities of the electricity grid .
given our methodology , we identified examples that illustrate the range of state policies and other efforts that may encourage the deployment of energy storage or that address market barriers ; however , these examples do not represent a comprehensive list of all state policies and efforts .
ferc has taken several steps to address market barriers to energy storage deployment , but the impact of these efforts will depend on implementation by rtos .
federal and state policymakers have used a variety of policies and other efforts to encourage the deployment of storage and address market barriers .
efforts to address safety and reliability challenges .
