our objectives were to evaluate ( 1 ) the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives ( directives ) and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of the directives , including agencies' implementation of directive requirements .
recognizing the importance of effective policies for securing federal information and systems , congress passed the federal information security modernization act of 2014 ( fisma ) , which granted new authorities to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) for administering the implementation of agency information security policies and practices .
the specific objectives of our review were to evaluate ( 1 ) dhs's process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of the binding operational directives , including agencies' implementation of the directive requirements .
federal agencies depend on information technology ( it ) systems to carry out critical operations and to process essential data .
since 2015 , dhs has issued eight such directives to address vulnerabilities impacting federal civilian agencies .
 ( recommendation 4 ) .
the federal government's development , implementation , and enforcement of policies that mitigate unauthorized access to these systems and unauthorized disclosure of the information they contain are vital to securing federal information systems .
the challenges included ( 1 ) outdated systems that require costly updates or replacements before they can be brought into full compliance ; ( 2 ) the lack of specialized expertise to address technical requirements ; ( 3 ) the complexity of achieving full dmarc compliance ; and ( 4 ) general issues associated with addressing weaknesses in agency hvas .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the secretary of homeland security should ensure that the binding operational directive performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified by high value asset assessments aligns with the process dhs has established .
federal civilian agencies have made many significant improvements in cybersecurity by implementing the directives' requirements .
these directives require agencies to safeguard federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat , vulnerability , or risk .
specifically , fisma authorized the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the director of the office of management and budget ( omb ) , to develop and oversee the implementation of compulsory directives to federal civilian agencies â€” referred to as binding operational directives ( directives ) .
given these shortcomings , dhs has been reassessing key aspects of the hva program .
however , the risks to these systems are increasing , including insider threats from malicious or unwitting employees , escalating cyber threats from around the globe , and the emergence of new and more destructive attacks .
further , dhs has only completed about half of the required assessments for fiscal year 2019 .
however , an important performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified by hva assessments does not align with the process dhs has established .
without such a schedule and plan , agencies may continue to face increased and prolonged cybersecurity threats .
in addition , dhs does not plan to issue the guidance , standards , and methodologies on tier 2 and 3 systems until at least the end of fiscal year 2020 .
