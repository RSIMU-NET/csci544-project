our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what factors were primarily responsible for the price increase , ( 2 ) if the prices charged customers during fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003 recovered the reported actual costs of performing the work , and ( 3 ) if the air force has taken effective steps to improve efficiency and control the activity group's costs .
the air force depot maintenance activity group supports combat readiness by providing services necessary to keep air force units operating worldwide .
because the activity group's customers are expected to request about 20.8 million hours of in - house work in fiscal year 2004 , this means that customers will have to pay about $4.9 billion for work that they would have paid about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2000 .
the group's in - house operations generate about $5 billion in annual revenue principally by repairing and overhauling a wide range of assets , including fighter aircraft such as the f - 15 , intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the minuteman and peacekeeper missiles , jet aircraft engines , electronics , avionics , software , and inventory items for the military services , other government agencies , and foreign governments .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
this should include initiative information on costs , return on investment , and quantifiable results for all process improvement initiatives .
of the 19 initiatives containing some cost information , only 10 initiatives had recorded costs totaling $6,328,000 .
periodically review the data contained in the data repository to ( 1 ) determine whether the data provided by the air logistics centers is complete and useful and ( 2 ) identify ways to consolidate initiatives and share lessons learned from the initiatives with the three centers .
the remaining 13 initiatives had recorded return on investment information with no dollar savings identified or as not applicable .
we also met with officials from air force materiel command and the air logistics centers to discuss ( 1 ) process improvement initiatives , especially information on initiative costs , savings , and the sharing of information and ( 2 ) whether all initiatives were included in the database .
the air force lacks systematic and effective processes for controlling costs .
our review was performed from june 2003 through april 2004 in accordance with u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .
the air force materiel command has not effectively implemented its data repository , which is a key part of its process improvement program .
dod policy requires working capital fund activity groups to ( 1 ) establish sales prices that allow them to recover their expected costs from their customers and ( 2 ) operate on a break - even basis over time â€” that is , not make a profit nor incur a loss .
in fact , dod has already taken action to help eliminate the excess cash in the air force working capital fund by transferring $1.1 billion of the excess cash to the army and navy operation and maintenance appropriation accounts in april 2004 .
