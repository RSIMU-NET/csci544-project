the coast guard authorization act of 2010 required that that the transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) reader pilot report include ( 1 ) the findings of the pilot program with respect to key technical and operational aspects of implementing twic technologies in the maritime sector ; ( 2 ) a comprehensive listing of the extent to which established metrics were achieved during the pilot program ; and ( 3 ) an analysis of the viability of those technologies for use in the maritime environment , including any challenges to implementing those technologies and strategies for mitigating identified challenges .
given dhs's challenges in implementing twic over the past decade , at a minimum , the assessment should include a comprehensive comparison of alternative credentialing approaches , which might include a more decentralized approach , for achieving twic program goals .
over $23 million had been made available to pilot participants from two federal emergency management agency ( fema ) grant programs â€” the port security grant program and the transit security grant program .
ports , waterways , and vessels handle billions of dollars in cargo annually , and an attack on our nation's maritime transportation system could have serious consequences .
we recommended , among other things , that dhs ( 1 ) assess twic program internal controls to identify needed corrective actions ; ( 2 ) assess the twic program's effectiveness ; and ( 3 ) use the information from the assessment as the basis for evaluating the costs , benefits , security risks , and corrective actions needed to implement the twic program in a manner that will meet program objectives and mitigate existing security risks .
the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) program was initiated in december 2001 in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
instead , congress should require that the secretary of homeland security first complete an assessment that evaluates the effectiveness of using twic with readers for enhancing port security , as we recommended in our may 2011 report , and then use the results of this assessment to promulgate a final regulation as appropriate .
maritime workers , including longshoremen , mechanics , truck drivers , and merchant mariners , access secure areas of the nation's estimated 16,400 maritime - related transportation facilities and vessels , such as cargo container and cruise ship terminals , each day while performing their jobs .
securing transportation systems and maritime - related facilities requires balancing security to address potential threats while facilitating the flow of people and goods that are critical to the u.s. economy and necessary for supporting international commerce .
the depth and pervasiveness of the twic program's planning and implementation challenges require a reassessment of dhs's efforts to improve maritime security through the issuance of a u.s. government - sponsored twic card and card readers .
within dhs , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) and the u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) jointly administer the twic program .
this limited tsa's ability to assess performance results by various reader and access control system characteristics .
thus , a comprehensive comparison of alternative credentialing approaches , which could include a more decentralized approach , would provide the necessary assurance that dhs is pursuing the most effective option for enhancing maritime security .
