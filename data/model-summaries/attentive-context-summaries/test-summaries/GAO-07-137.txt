to support the education and training of health professionals , the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , administers numerous health professions education and training programs authorized under title vii of the public health service act .
as discussed with the appropriations subcommittees with responsibility for hhs programs , this report addresses , for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , ( 1 ) hrsa's process for awarding hcop grants and ( 2 ) the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees .
an appropriate supply of health professionals is vital to ensuring that all americans have adequate access to health care .
one such program , the health careers opportunity program ( hcop ) , provides grants to health professions schools — such as medical or dental schools — and other entities to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare for , and succeed in , education and training for the health professions .
it is also possible for the same entity to have had more than one hcop grant at the same time , provided that each grant had a distinct purpose and budget .
to conduct our work , we analyzed hrsa's data on hcop applications , including the scores and funding preference determinations made during the application review process , and hcop grant award decisions for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 .
a new fiscal year 2002 grantee would have had to apply for a competitive continuation grant for fiscal year 2005 after the end of its 3-year project period .
as shown in figure 1 , the amounts distributed on a noncompetitive basis to continue funding existing grant projects varied , from a low of $18 million for fiscal year 2005 to a high of $30 million for fiscal year 2003 , and the remaining funds awarded as competitive grants ranged from a low of $4 million for fiscal year 2003 to a high of $15 million for fiscal year 2005 .
as a result , hrsa cancelled the competition for grants and distributed all funds available for hcop for fiscal year 2006 — about $4 million — on a noncompetitive basis to continue funding 4 of 58 existing hcop grant projects within their approved project periods .
in reports accompanying hhs appropriations bills for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 , congressional appropriations committees with responsibility for hhs programs noted with approval that hrsa had given “priority consideration for hcop grants to minority health professions institutions.” in the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2005 appropriations act , however , the conference committee expressed concern that several applications for new or competitive continuation grants from historically minority health professions schools had not been funded for fiscal year 2004 .
for the summary , we believe it is appropriate to use percentages to convey that applications from minority - serving institutions generally received grants in greater proportion than all applications .
in response to guidance in an appropriations committee report , which strongly urged hrsa to give priority to those institutions with a historic mission of training minorities in the health professions , the agency distributed the $4 million for fiscal year 2006 to continue funding existing hcop grant projects at four institutions that met that criterion .
