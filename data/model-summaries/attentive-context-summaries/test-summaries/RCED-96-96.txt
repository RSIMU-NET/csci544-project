specifically , we obtained the best available information on the ( 1 ) frequency of foodborne illness , ( 2 ) health consequences and economic impacts of foodborne illnesses , and ( 3 ) adequacy of knowledge about foodborne illnesses to develop effective control strategies .
over the past decade , a number of widely reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by microbial contamination — the most commonly identified cause of such outbreaks — have heightened the public's concern about the safety of food .
while such outbreaks have brought the issue to the public's attention , public health and food safety officials agree that the largest number of foodborne illnesses occur as isolated cases , not as part of a publicized outbreak .
given the scale of the u.s. food production and distribution system and the lack of control over how consumers handle food after they purchase it , there is little likelihood that foodborne illnesses can be completely eliminated .
the most that can be hoped for is that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the problem is minimized .
in this context , we have attempted in this report to provide a factual picture on the extent of foodborne illness in the united states today .
the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) is the federal agency primarily responsible for monitoring the incidence of foodborne illness in the united states .
some economists attempt to estimate the costs related to medical treatment and lost wages ( the cost - of - illness method ) ; others attempt to estimate the value of reducing the incidence of illness or loss of life ( the willingness - to - pay method ) .
cdc coordinates its activities concerning the safety of the food supply with the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the department of health and human services and those concerning the safety of meat , poultry , and eggs with the food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) in the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
to monitor , control , and prevent foodborne illnesses , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) relies primarily on four types of data from local and state health departments , according to cdc officials .
funding was decreased slightly for this project in 1996 , and these officials are concerned about the continuing availability of funding , in this era of budget constraints , to conduct this discretionary effort over the longer term .
in collaboration with state and local health departments and other federal agencies , cdc investigates outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and supports disease surveillance , research , prevention efforts , and training related to foodborne illnesses .
cdc also investigates a limited number of more severe or unusual outbreaks when state authorities request assistance .
fda and fsis , which are the primary federal agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the food supply , maintain liaison with cdc in atlanta , georgia .
in the first , usda's economic research service ( ers ) used the cost - of - illness approach to estimate that the 1993 medical costs and losses in productivity resulting from seven major foodborne pathogens ranged between $5.6 billion and $9.4 billion .
