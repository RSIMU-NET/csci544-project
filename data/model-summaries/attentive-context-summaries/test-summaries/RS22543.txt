it provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires , as a condition for the receipt of such funds , the provision of a free appropriate public education ( fape ) .
the individuals with disabilities education act is both a grants statute and a civil rights statute .
originally enacted in 1975 , the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities , and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities .
the statute contains detailed due process provisions , including the right to bring suit in order to ensure the provision of fape .
whether the parents are parties aggrieved turns in large part on whether the rights guaranteed under idea are guaranteed for the child with a disability , for the parent of such a child , or both .
idea states in part "[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision ... made under this subsection , shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented pursuant to this section ...." the judicial decisions concerning the rights of non attorney parents of children with disabilities to bring suit without an attorney have raised issues concerning whether the parents of a child with a disability are "part[ies] aggrieved" under idea .
courts have varied in their views on this issue and therefore on the issue of whether non - attorney parents have the ability to pursue an idea case pro se .
jacob winkelman has autistic spectrum disorder and , in accordance with an individualized education program ( iep ) , was placed in a preschool with the concurrence of both his parents and the parma city school district .
in addition , the court observed that the intended beneficiary of idea is the child with a disability , not the parents , and that although idea does grant parents some procedural rights , these only serve to ensure the child's substantive right and do not provide the parents with substantive rights .
currently , there is a three way split in their determinations of this issue with some circuits finding that non - attorney parents may not proceed pro se , another circuit holding that non - attorney parents have no limitations on their ability to proceed , and other courts of appeals holding that parents can proceed on procedural claims but must use a lawyer for substantive claims .
the parents and the child were thus found to possess different idea rights: the parents "possess explicit rights in the form of procedural safeguards" while the child possesses both procedural and substantive rights .
they noted that parents are often the only available advocates for their child and that attorneys are often unwilling to take idea cases due to their specialized and complicated nature and since the cases often lack significant retainers .
in addition , pro se litigants were seen as imposing burdens on the courts and schools districts due to poorly drafted or vexatious claims .
