to enhance dod's ability to determine whether the regional centers are achieving departmental priorities , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for policy to develop an approach to assess the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities , including identifying measurable goals and objectives , metrics , or other indicators of performance , and develop a methodology for using performance information , to include defining the role of the governance board in the process .
moreover , dod's ability to assess the regional centers' performance would provide congress with the information it needs as it evaluates current and similar programs and considers future funding levels .
in recent years , the department of defense ( dod ) has emphasized security cooperation approaches to build the defense capacity of foreign partners and advance the u.s. objective of international peace and cooperation .
until measurable program goals and objectives linked with performance metrics are implemented , dod cannot fully assess or adequately oversee the regional centers .
while dod has taken positive steps by establishing a new governance body and updating dod guidance applying to the regional centers for fiscal year 2013 , dod does not yet have a process to assess the regional centers' progress .
conducting routine assessments using measurable goals and objectives , with metrics to evaluate progress , and a methodology for using performance information to include defining the role of the governance board , would provide dod a sounder basis for assessing the regional centers' progress in achieving results and better determining the allocation of resources .
112-239 ) mandated us to conduct a study of dod's regional centers .
while dod has expressed challenges entailed in establishing metrics to capture the effects of a program premised on relationship - building and has taken steps to study the matter , it has yet to establish an initial set of metrics .
ousd policy has not established a methodology for assessing the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities , to include clarifying how it will use performance data provided by the regional centers and clearly identifying the role of its governance board in the assessment process .
however , dod has not yet established an initial set of metrics .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe how the regional centers' activities compare with those of other dod training and education organizations , and ( 2 ) evaluate the extent to which dod has developed and implemented an approach to oversee and assess the regional centers' progress in achieving dod priorities .
effective management of efforts to build the defense capacity of foreign partners will help dod steward its resources to achieve its strategic priorities and will likely better position the u.s. government to respond to changing conditions and future uncertainties around the world .
specifically , we have found instances in which dod had not consistently defined measures to evaluate progress , and in which reporting on the progress and effectiveness of some defense capacity - building activities had been limited .
as part of the department's efforts to build partner capacity , dod relies on its regional centers for security studies ( regional centers ) to coordinate with the geographic combatant commands in developing training and educational programs around the globe to enhance security , deepen foreign officials' understanding of the united states , and foster bilateral and multilateral partnerships .
