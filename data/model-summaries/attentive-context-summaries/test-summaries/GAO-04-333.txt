in 2001 , hhs — through its administration for children and families' ( acf ) children's bureau — began implementing a new federal review system , known as the child and family services reviews ( cfsr ) , to hold states accountable for improving child welfare outcomes .
in addition , the federal department of health and human services ( hhs ) monitors states' compliance with key federal goals , specified in part by the adoption and safe families act ( asfa ) of 1997 , to keep children safe and ensure their placement in stable and permanent homes .
the objectives of our study were to report on ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in the pip ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being .
to help states investigate reports of child abuse and neglect , provide placements to children outside their homes , and deliver services to help keep families together , the federal government provides approximately $7 billion dollars to states annually .
without clear guidance on how to systematically prepare and monitor pip - related documents , and how regional officials can integrate their many oversight responsibilities , acf has left state officials unsure of how their progress over time will be judged and potentially complicated its own monitoring efforts .
unlike prior federal reviews — which determined states' adherence to certain process measures — acf designed the cfsrs as an outcome - oriented approach to assess children's safety ; their timely placement in permanent homes ; and their mental , physical , and educational well - being .
to better understand the cfsr process , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) acf's and the states' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; ( 2 ) acf's and the states' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in their pips ; and ( 3 ) additional efforts , if any , that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to help ensure that all states meet federal goals of safety , permanency , and well - being for children .
further , states are required to develop and implement program improvement plans ( pip ) to improve their child welfare practice and capacity when they are found to be deficient .
to ensure that acf uses the best available data in measuring state performance , we recommend that the secretary of hhs expand the use of additional data states may provide in their statewide assessments and consider alternative data sources when available , such as longitudinal data that track children's placements over time , before making final cfsr determinations .
acf also developed a number of factors to assess states' performance in systemic areas , such as staff training and foster parent licensing .
in addition , to ensure that acf regional offices and states fully understand the pip development , approval , and monitoring processes , and that regional offices fully understand acf's prioritization of the cfsr as the primary mechanism for child welfare oversight , we recommend that the secretary of hhs take the following two actions: issue clarifying guidance on the pip process and evaluate states' and regional offices' adherence to this instruction , and provide guidance to regional offices explaining how to better integrate the many training and technical assistance activities for which they are responsible , such as participation in state planning meetings and the provision of counsel to states on various topics , with their new cfsr responsibilities .
