the increasing popularity of e - mail , instant messaging , and wireless technology , to name a few , poses a long - term threat to the postal service's core business â€” first - class mail ( primarily letters ) and standard mail ( primarily advertising ) .
the united states postal service faces formidable financial , operational , and human capital challenges because of unfunded liabilities , stagnant revenues , inefficient operations , and a business model that is unsustainable .
part of its reform strategy is to find more efficient ways to procure goods and services .
in the face of these challenges , the postal service has been under pressure to cut costs while improving overall performance .
to assist congressional efforts to enact fundamental postal reform , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the postal service has been successful in implementing and realizing savings from its supply chain management initiatives and ( 2 ) whether these initiatives have had an effect on small businesses .
while the postal service achieved notable success in fiscal year 2003 , this respite is likely to be short - lived because first - class mail continues to decline , key costs are rising , and productivity gains are likely to slow .
in april 2001 , we placed the postal service's transformation and long - term outlook on our high - risk list , and we recently reported that comprehensive postal service reform is urgently needed .
in fiscal year 2003 alone , the postal service spent over $11.3 billion on such items as supplies , services , rent , and transportation .
to reduce spending , postal service officials have been focusing on supply chain management , the process used to integrate the flow of goods and services from the suppliers to delivery of the end product to the retail customer .
since fiscal year 2000 , with the help of supply chain management initiatives , the postal service reported that it has saved about $866 million by leveraging its buying power and insisting on continuous improvement .
commercial companies use this management process to help reduce costs and to do business in the most efficient way possible .
as agreed , we focused our work on three major supply chain management initiatives: bulk fuel program , an effort to leverage the postal service's buying power for the millions of gallons of fuel purchased by highway contractors who transport mail ; reverse auctions , a web - based tool that enables highway contractors to compete for contracts in an electronic bidding format ; and national contracts , the consolidation of smaller contracts for goods and services into large , nationwide contracts .
nevertheless , the postal service has developed a 3-year plan to maintain a supplier base that includes small , minority - owned , and woman - owned businesses and tracks contracts awarded to those businesses .
the postal service is an independent establishment of the government's executive branch that is expected to act like a business and is not subject to the small business act .
the difficulties the postal service has encountered are primarily due to ( 1 ) resistance from many highway contractors ; ( 2 ) setbacks in the postal service's plans to expand the number of fuel delivery locations under the program ; and ( 3 ) lack of an automated system to accurately capture fuel prices , which means that inaccurate and burdensome manual calculations must be used .
