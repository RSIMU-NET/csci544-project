senate report 105-52 , dated july 22 , 1997 , on the 1998 military construction appropriations bill requested the continuation of our annual review of the department of defense's ( dod ) base closure accounts and its budget request for base closure activities .
specifically , this report discusses opportunities for offsetting the budget request for fiscal year 1999 , including the validity of two proposed military construction ( milcon ) projects included in that request .
specifically , dod stated that ( 1 ) $35.7 million in unreported proceeds generated by brac activities is unavailable to offset fiscal year 1999 requirements because the proceeds have been or will be reprogrammed to cover unfunded requirements , ( 2 ) $54.8 million in unobligated balances is unavailable as an offset since it has already been earmarked for other unfunded requirements , ( 3 ) $40.6 million for two separate milcon projects is unavailable for offset because previously approved actions that were deferred until 1999 still need to be fully funded , and ( 4 ) reductions of this magnitude will eliminate the management flexibility envisioned by the congress and , adversely impact dod's ability to close installations and speed the economic recovery of affected communities .
in the late 1980s , dod decided to close excess military bases because changing national security requirements had resulted in a military base structure that was larger than needed .
consequently , the congress enacted base realignment and closure ( brac ) legislation that instituted base closure rounds in 1988 , 1991 , 1993 , and 1995 .
our questions center on the potential ( 1 ) use of unreported proceeds from brac actions , unused funds allocated to the brac 1991 round , and withheld brac appropriations from fiscal year 1998 to offset equivalent amounts of funding included in the 1999 budget request and ( 2 ) need for funding requested for two milcon projects , where the requirements for one project have not been determined and the other has already been funded .
as a result , navy officials had to restructure the navy's brac program to meet this shortfall .
as the congress develops the budget authority for dod's base closure activities in fiscal year 1999 , it may wish to consider appropriating up to $131.1 million less than dod is requesting in its fiscal year 1999 brac budget submission because prior year funds are available to meet these requirements and the request to fund two milcon projects could be eliminated .
dod's fiscal year 1999 budget request did not reflect $35.7 million in proceeds that was collected but not included in the request .
in march 1998 , dod requested more than $1.7 billion for the brac program in fiscal year 1999 .
dod withheld $26 million appropriated in fiscal year 1998 from the brac program that could be used to offset the fiscal year 1999 brac budget request .
the 1999 brac budget request contains $40.6 million for two milcon projects for which requirements have not been determined or have already been funded .
as a result of this effort , the army reduced its unliquidated balance for its brac environmental projects .
public law and dod guidance provide that proceeds generated from brac actions be reported in dod's annual budget estimate request .
