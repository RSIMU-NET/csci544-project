in recent years , particularly since the enactment of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( restructuring act ) , the demand for offers has increased significantly .
a growing backlog of cases and longer processing times have prompted concern on the part of taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders about the management of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) offer in compromise ( oic ) program .
specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine why the inventory of cases and case processing times have continued to grow ; ( 2 ) assess whether irs's current initiatives for managing the oic program will reduce inventory and processing times ; and ( 3 ) determine whether irs is fulfilling the requirements of the restructuring act in terms of independently reviewing all proposed rejections of offers , considering the facts and circumstances of each case , and not rejecting offers from low - income taxpayers solely on the basis of the amount offered .
an offer in compromise is an agreement between a taxpayer and the irs to settle or “compromise” the taxpayer's tax liability for less than the full amount owed .
irs now takes about 10 months , on average , to make an offer determination .
generally , irs considers offers in cases in which taxpayers cannot afford to pay the full tax liability .
because of your concern about the growing inventory and processing times , you asked us to review irs's administration of the program .
because of concern that this decision would leave some taxpayers unable to qualify for either an installment agreement or an offer , you asked us to determine the extent to which irs has information on how the counsel decision affects taxpayers and to evaluate irs's legislative proposal for a new partial payment installment agreement program .
to address these objectives , we reviewed and analyzed program data from irs statistical reports and program documents and reviewed offer policies and procedures and studies by an outside contractor and the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) .
even though irs added staff to the program , the inventory of unresolved offers and the processing times have grown .
in 1998 , irs counsel determined that irs did not have the authority to enter into an installment agreement that would not fully pay the tax liability within the time allowed by law .
you also asked us to review a recent change to irs's installment agreement program .
an installment agreement allows taxpayers to pay their tax liability over time .
we focused on fiscal years 1997 through 2001 because this was a period of enormous change in the oic program .
we also interviewed irs officials , including officials responsible for the oic and installment agreement programs .
as irs makes changes to its oic program , we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue develop evaluation plans for the various offer initiatives that include details on data to be collected , data collection methods , basis for comparing outcomes , quality of decisions , and an analysis plan and move no new initiatives into implementation without a finalized evaluation plan ; determine which oic program performance and cost data should be collected to monitor program performance , given resource constraints , and ensure that such data are collected in a timely and reliable manner ; and set goals for offer processing time that are based on taxpayer needs , other benefits , and costs .
