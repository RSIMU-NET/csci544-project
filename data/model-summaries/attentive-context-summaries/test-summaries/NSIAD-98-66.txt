the report made 27 recommendations to reduce the impact of the u.s. military presence on the okinawan people .
as requested , we reviewed the contents of the final report , evaluated the impact on readiness of u.s. forces based on okinawa after implementation of the report recommendations , estimated the u.s. cost of implementing the recommendations , and determined the benefit or necessity of having u.s. marine corps forces on okinawa .
the united states and japan released the final report of the special action committee on okinawa on december 2 , 1996 .
in response to representative duncan hunter's concerns about the impact of implementing saco's recommendations on u.s. force readiness , we describe ( 1 ) the benefit or necessity of retaining u.s. forces in japan and on okinawa and ( 2 ) saco's report recommendations and identify the impact of implementation on u.s. operations , training , and costs .
since the end of world war ii , the u.s. military has maintained a presence in japan and on okinawa , first as an occupation force and later as an ally committed to maintaining security in the asia - pacific region .
the report also identifies two environmental issues that may remain after the saco recommendations have been implemented .
over half of the u.s. forces in japan are on okinawa , a presence that has caused increasing discontent among the people of okinawa .
dod also noted that the role of congress will be critical in maintaining the strategic relationship with japan and therefore the gao report was timely and welcome .
the security relationship between the united states and japan is defined through bilateral agreements and is managed through a joint process .
the committee developed 27 recommendations to reduce the impact of u.s. operations .
to determine dod's views on the benefit or necessity of having u.s. forces stationed on okinawa , we interviewed officials and obtained relevant documents , including the quadrennial defense review report , the president's national security strategy for a new century , the security strategy for east asia , the commander - in - chief of the pacific command's regional strategy , and other documents .
however , they also stated that if japan does not provide adequate replacement facilities or complete action needed to implement some recommendations , the united states will not be obligated to implement those particular recommendations .
we are sending copies of this report to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the house committee on national security , the senate committee on armed services , and the house and senate committees on appropriations ; the secretaries of state , defense , the army , the navy , and the air force ; and the commandant of the marine corps .
however , in a june 1997 report , we concluded that dod had not adequately considered alternatives to forward presence to accomplish its stated security objectives .
usfj and marine corps bases , japan , indicated that this has not cost the united states any money and has had no impact on operational capability , deployment plans and schedules , or training .
the committee developed recommendations on ways to limit the impact of the u.s. military presence on okinawans .
