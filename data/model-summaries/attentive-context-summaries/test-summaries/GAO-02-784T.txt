thank you for the opportunity to discuss financial management at the department of defense ( dod ) .
to date , none of the military services or major dod components has passed the test of an independent financial audit because of weaknesses in financial management systems , operations , and controls .
in this regard , on september 10 , 2001 , secretary of defense rumsfeld announced a broad initiative intended to “transform the way the department works and what it works on” which he estimated could save 5 percent of dod's budget — or about $15 billion to $18 billion annually .
today , dod faces financial and related management problems that are pervasive , complex , long - standing , and deeply rooted in virtually all business operations throughout the department .
today , we will provide our perspectives on the ( 1 ) department's long - standing inability to effectively reform its financial management and other business systems and processes and ( 2 ) keys to successfully carrying out the secretary's business process transformation .
of the 22 areas on gao's governmentwide “high - risk” list , 6 are dod program areas , and dod shares responsibility for 2 other high - risk areas that are government wide in scope .
overhauling dod's financial management represents a major challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting to the very fiber of the department's range of business operations and management culture .
previous administrations have tried to address these problems in various ways but have been unsuccessful .
the president has made financial management and the use of technology integral to his fiscal year 2002 management agenda for making the federal government more focused on citizens and results .
dod's financial management deficiencies , taken together , represent the single largest obstacle to achieving an unqualified opinion on the u.s. government's consolidated financial statements .
even before the events of september 11 , increased globalization , changing security threats , and rapid technological advances were prompting fundamental changes in the environment in which dod operates .
the president's management agenda notes , “without accurate and timely information , it is not possible to accomplish the president's agenda to secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for the american people.” with the events of september 11 , and the federal government's short - and long - term budget challenges , it is more important than ever that dod effectively transform its business operations to ensure that it gets the most from every dollar spent .
secretary rumsfeld recognized that transformation would be difficult and expected the needed changes would take 8 or more years to complete .
the department must be able to effectively carry out its stewardship responsibilities for the funding it receives and for the vast amount of equipment and inventories used in support of military operations .
our experience with other federal agency business transformation efforts supports the secretary's position .
transforming dod's business operations would free up resources that could be used to enhance readiness , improve the quality of life for our troops and their families , and reduce the gap between “wants” and available funding in connection with major weapon systems .
