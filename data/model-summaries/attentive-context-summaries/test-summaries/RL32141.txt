congress recently completed action on the bush administration's fy2004 supplemental budgetrequest to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan .
some members of congress have urged the president to include thecosts of current and future operations in iraq and afghanistan in the department of defense's ( dod's ) regular appropriations , arguing that these are now ongoing operations that should beplanned for and funded in the annual defense budget .
 ( 1 ) a majorissue in the congressional debate on this , and other such supplementals of the past , is whethermilitary and peacekeeping operations should be funded with supplemental requests or via the regulardefense appropriations process .
this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations , supplemental appropriations , or acombination of the two .
in initial post - combat peacekeeping operations,however , congress has tended to rely on a combination of supplemental and regular appropriations .
others prefer supplementals due to theunpredictability of military and peacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan .
as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing , congress has switched to using regularappropriations .
 ( 2 ) infy1995 , when the united states first launchedairstrikes in support of u.n. peacekeepers , dod used a combination of supplemental appropriationsand fy1995 regular appropriations to fund combat operations .
 ( 3 ) except for funds appropriated forafghanistan in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution , both operations have beenfunded to date using supplemental appropriations , including the recently enacted fy2004supplemental .
according to the president , the united states concluded major military operations inafghanistan in december , 2001 and in iraq on may 1 , 2003 .
examining the funding patterns for combat operations in the first gulf war , somalia , haiti,kosovo , afghanistan , and operation iraqi freedom shows they were all funded initially withsupplemental appropriations .
although the president has declared the end of major combat in both operations , lowintensity conflict is still prevalent , making it unclear whether iraq and afghanistan can yet bereferred to as ongoing peacekeeping operations .
table 1 shows that since 1990 , congress generally has funded combatoperations with supplemental appropriations .
thisunpredictability , they argue , makes it extremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type ofoperation in advance .
thus , although supplementalappropriations were not used to fund the united states' initial involvement in bosnia , congress didturn to supplemental appropriations to fund combat and later peacekeeping operations after the initialhumanitarian airlift .
table 1 suggests that in the past decade , congress generally has funded combat operations withsupplemental appropriations and ongoing peacekeeping operations with regular appropriations .
in each case , the president requested supplemental funding shortlyafter operations were underway , and congress approved the requests within months .
eachoperation , however , has gone through an interim period of initial post - combat peacekeeping in whichcongress has used different combinations of supplemental and regular appropriations .

going forward , congress might designate a pointat which an operation becomes ongoing , and thus merits funding in the regular appropriationsprocess .
