this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing ( 1 ) the u.s. department of education's ( education's ) current income - driven ( idr ) repayment plan budget estimates and how they have changed over time and ( 2 ) the extent to which education's approach to estimating idr plan costs and its quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates .
education has also increased its estimates of idr plan costs .
since 2009 , the u.s. department of education ( education ) has created several new income - driven repayment ( idr ) plans that borrowers can select to reduce challenges they face in repaying their loans .
currently , over 30 million student loan borrowers hold more than $900 billion in william d. ford federal direct loans ( direct loans ) , and there are indications that some face difficulties repaying their loans .
given questions among policymakers and experts about idr plan costs to the federal government , you asked us to examine education's idr plan budget estimates and evaluate its approach to estimating costs .
for instance , in its fiscal year 2016 budget justification , education revised its prior - year estimates of direct loan costs upward by $12.3 billion , and cited growing idr plan enrollment as the primary cause .
in april 2016 , the administration announced a new goal to add 2 million new borrowers to idr plans over the next year , through efforts including targeted outreach .
for instance , almost 20 percent of direct loan borrowers were delinquent on their loan payments at the end of 2015 , and more than a million borrowers defaulted on their loans over the 2015 fiscal year .
by june 2016 , 24 percent of borrowers repaying their loans ( or 5.3 million borrowers ) were doing so in idr plans , and it is likely that more will join in the future .
to what extent do education's approach to estimating idr plan costs and quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates ? .
participation in idr plans is growing , as is their estimated cost to the government .
this information could help better support efforts to assess the cost - effectiveness of idr plans and design any needed reforms .
more robust model testing , including more extensive sensitivity analysis , could also help education's management identify and mitigate problems that may reduce the reliability of its budget estimates .
in addition to correcting its methodological weaknesses , education could enhance the reliability of its budget estimates by implementing more robust quality control practices .
what are education's current idr plan budget estimates and how have they changed over time ? .
to address these objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance on the william d. ford federal direct loan ( direct loan ) program and idr plans .
implementing our previous recommendation to more thoroughly document and review its approach could help education's management identify and resolve weaknesses .
these plans primarily base payment amounts on a borrower's income and extend repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years with any remaining balance forgiven at the end of that period .
