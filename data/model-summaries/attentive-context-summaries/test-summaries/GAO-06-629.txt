in this report , we discuss ( 1 ) the current extent and potential for geothermal development ; ( 2 ) challenges faced by developers of geothermal resources ; ( 3 ) federal , state , and local government actions to address these challenges ; and ( 4 ) how provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 ( act ) are likely to affect federal geothermal royalty collections .
this report formalizes the content of our briefings and our work since then , including: ( 1 ) the current extent of and potential for geothermal development ; ( 2 ) challenges faced by developers of geothermal resources ; ( 3 ) federal , state , and local government actions to address these challenges ; and ( 4 ) how provisions of the act are likely to affect federal geothermal royalty disbursements and collections .
however , the act is new and insufficient time has passed to assess its effectiveness .
increasing demand and rising prices for electricity and natural gas have increased interest in alternative forms of energy , including geothermal energy .
to assist in these efforts , the congress has authorized the agencies to use the federal government's share of royalty collections to implement the geothermal program for 5 years .
american families and businesses rely heavily on electricity and natural gas to heat and light homes and buildings , to power appliances , to manufacture goods , and to supply services .
to assist in achieving the same level of geothermal royalties as would have been collected prior to the energy policy act of 2005 , we recommend that the secretary of the department of the interior instruct the appropriate managers within the minerals management service to take the following two actions: correct erroneous and missing royalty data , when necessary , so that it will have an accurate baseline of royalty collections for each payor ; and routinely collect from royalty payors the gross sales revenues for electricity sold in order to compare these revenues with past royalty collections and to verify compliance with the percentages prescribed within the act for leases to be issued in the future .
without such knowledge , mms will have difficulty collecting the same level of royalties from lessees that elect to use the new royalty process .
geothermal energy is a unique type of renewable resource in that it can provide power that is independent of weather and climate , thereby enabling a consistent and uninterrupted supply of heat and electricity .
because many areas that have the potential to produce additional geothermal energy are located on federal lands , the federal government is a major participant in the future development of geothermal energy .
although it is impossible to predict with reasonable assurance how these prices will change in the future , the federal agencies must make their best effort to mitigate the impact of changing prices if federal royalty revenue are to remain the same .
blm's 5-year strategic plan for its geothermal program also attempts to address some challenges to federal leasing .
geothermal energy also creates fewer environmental impacts than the production of natural gas and other conventional fossil fuels that are used to generate electricity .
shortly thereafter , the congress passed the act , which contains provisions to simplify the federal royalties on electricity generation and reduce royalties on direct use .
