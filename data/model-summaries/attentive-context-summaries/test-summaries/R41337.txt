the resulting information may be used to better understand policy problems and to help inform the design , implementation , and oversight of policies .
an evaluation may provide information at any stage of the policy process about how a federal government policy , program , activity , or agency is working .
a variety of stakeholders may seek evaluation information and data to help them exercise their responsibilities , obligations , and rights in a representative democracy , including the establishment , implementation , oversight , and other requirements of a federal program or project .
a program's context , including its longevity and the manner in which it is implemented , typically influences choices about evaluation design .
these stakeholders and interested parties include , among others , congress , the president , federal agency officers and employees , state and local governments , interest groups , private sector contractors , the news media , and the general public .
these differences , in turn , could affect their capabilities , effectiveness , and assistance to others , including their contributions to the oversight of a program or project by the executive or legislature .
after an overview of such entities — which include newly and specially created units as well as existing ones , such as the government accountability office ( gao ) and offices of inspector general ( oigs ) — this report suggests possible broad characteristics and criteria of independent evaluators or similar units .
for a number of reasons , there is not necessarily a best way to design and carry out an evaluation of a particular program , activity , or operation .
this report focuses on the characteristics of independent evaluators ( ies ) — examples of which are described in the appendix — when an evaluation is to be conducted by an entity outside the immediate organization that is responsible for policy implementation , and the ie is also intended to have one or more dimensions of independence .
in addition , stakeholders often have different needs and research questions about which they would like more information .
independence also may refer to an entity that conducts evaluations that also is located outside the immediate organization responsible for policy implementation ( "independent evaluator" ) .
in some situations , there may be little need for independence in evaluations ( e.g. , when equipping a program with capacity to improve its own operations iteratively , or when "adaptively" managing a project to help restore an ecosystem ) .
ies and similar constructs that conduct independent evaluations , however , vary across a number of attributes: structure , jurisdiction , authority , resources , length of tenure , and specific duties and responsibilities .
there is some diversity of opinion regarding how to define independence and what makes an evaluator ( or evaluation ) independent .
in situations when some extent of independence in an existing or proposed evaluator were deemed desirable , congress might consider the different kinds and degrees of independence that could be pursued .
nonetheless , instances of independent evaluators appear to be growing in number and variety .
on one hand , for example , the term may relate to independence of an evaluation from the policy preferences of an individual or group ( "independent evaluation" ) , perhaps by prohibiting political appointees from revising an evaluation .
