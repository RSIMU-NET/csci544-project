specifically , you wanted us to determine ( 1 ) if fpi has data , either from its management information systems or other sources , to support overall conclusions about how federal customers who buy and use its products and services view their timeliness , price , and quality ; and ( 2 ) whether agencies that are among the largest buyers of fpi products and services monitor fpi's performance the same way they do commercial vendors in terms of timeliness , price , and quality .
to meet these objectives , we interviewed fpi officials and gathered information on their customer satisfaction efforts at fpi in washington , d.c. we also met with officials at fpi's customer service center in lexington , ky and the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) ; and spoke with officials at five of fpi's major customer agencies â€” the defense logistics agency ( dla ) ; the general services administration's ( gsa ) federal supply service ( fss ) in arlington , va , and fort worth , tx ; the department of the army's office of the assistant secretary of the army for research , development , and acquisition in falls church , va ; the social security administration ( ssa ) in baltimore , md ; and the united states postal service ( the postal service ) in washington , d.c .
this report responds to your july 8 , 1997 , request for information on whether federal prison industries ( fpi ) collects and maintains data that would enable it to make reliable , generalizable statements about the satisfaction of its federal agency customers with respect to the quality , cost , and timely delivery of fpi's products .
in addition , we reviewed key laws and regulations , such as the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) pertaining to procurement from commercial vendors and fpi , especially in relation to vendor performance .
we did not assess fpi's overall efforts to promote customer satisfaction , such as resolving complaints ; nor did we assess customer agencies' efforts to award and administer vendors' contracts .
you also wanted to determine whether fpi's statutory status as a mandatory supplier to the government caused federal agencies to develop and use past performance information about fpi differently from how the agencies used information about private sector government contractors .
in order to institutionalize within fpi an assessment of overall customer satisfaction and the use of this assessment to measure and improve performance , we recommend that the director , bureau of prisons , direct fpi's chief operating officer to ( 1 ) examine available approaches to collect and use customer satisfaction data to determine the most cost - effective approaches for fpi ; ( 2 ) develop a plan for collecting customer satisfaction data that would allow for supportable conclusions about federal customers' views on timeliness , price , and quality ; ( 3 ) develop a timetable for implementing the plan ; and ( 4 ) set performance goals for the levels of customer satisfaction that fpi wants to attain and measure results against these goals .
federal agencies are generally required to buy fpi products , but not services , because under 18 u.s.c .
