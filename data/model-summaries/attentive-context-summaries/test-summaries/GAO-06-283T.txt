through these programs , va provided almost $30 billion in cash disability benefits to more than 3.4 million veterans and their survivors in fiscal year 2004 .
for years , the claims process has been the subject of concern and attention within va and by the congress and veterans service organizations .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the claims processing challenges and opportunities facing the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) disability compensation and pension programs .
many of their concerns have focused on long waits for decisions , large claims backlogs , and inaccurate decisions .
va's disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions .
our work and media reports of significant discrepancies in average disability payments from state to state have also highlighted concerns about the consistency of decision making within va .
while va is making efforts to address these problems , several factors may impede va's ability to make and sustain significant improvements in its claims processing performance .
in january 2003 , we designated modernizing va and other federal disability programs as a high - risk area , because our work over the past decade found that these programs are based on concepts from the past and continue to experience management problems .
 ( see related gao products. ) .
you asked us to discuss the challenges and opportunities va faces in processing disability compensation and pension claims .
these include the potential impacts of laws , court decisions , and continued increases in the number and complexity of claims being filed .
while va has improved the accuracy of its rating - related compensation decisions to 84 percent in fiscal year 2005 â€” close to its goal of 88 percent in fiscal year 2005 , it has 3 years to reach its strategic goal of 98 percent .
in addition , va still experiences lengthy processing times and lacks a clear understanding of the extent of possible decision inconsistencies .
to update our work , we reviewed recent claims processing performance data and va's fiscal year 2005 performance and accountability report , but did not perform independent verification of va's data .
opportunities for improvement may lie in more fundamental reform of va's disability compensation programs .
for example , as of the end of fiscal year 2005 , rating - related claims were pending an average of 120 days , 9 days more than at the end of fiscal year 2003 , and far from va's strategic goal of 78 days .
for example , in recent years , gao has found that va and other federal disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions .
in summary , va continues to face challenges processing disability claims .
my statement draws on numerous gao reports and testimonies on va's compensation and pension claims processing operations .
further , we have identified concerns about the consistency of decisions across va's regional offices .
during the same period , the rating - related inventory grew by about 92,000 claims to a total of about 346,000 claims .
