local efforts have produced a variety of single - gender in - school and after - school programs .
growing concern over student performance and behavior in public elementary and secondary schools has led some educators and policymakers to consider single - gender educational settings to improve student performance .
because of this recent interest , you asked us to identify the major educational and legal issues involved with public single - gender education and to cite some examples of recent public single - gender education programs .
on the federal level , in recent years the senate has seen at least three bills with single - gender education components .
to develop this information , we interviewed local education agency officials in certain districts that had a variety of single - gender programs and officials at the department of education and other organizations who have had a role in single - gender education issues or research .
for example , virginia recently passed legislation permitting schools to establish single - gender classes consistent with constitutional principles , and in california the governor's 1996-97 budget proposes single - gender academies for students at risk of low achievement or dropping out .
certain states have also shown interest in promoting single - gender settings .
the latest , s. 1205 , the mentor schools act , was introduced in the fall of 1995 .
in addition , the department of education's office for civil rights ( ocr ) provided us with examples of different types of single - gender educational settings from the complaints and requests for guidance it had received .
we also reviewed some recent court decisions , law review articles , and other literature .
some single - gender programs , however , are subject to legal impediments .
the purposes of the proposed bill are to ( 1 ) award grants to local education agencies for establishing same - gender schools for low - income students ; ( 2 ) determine whether same - gender schools make a difference in the educational achievement and opportunities of low - income , educationally disadvantaged individuals ; ( 3 ) improve academic achievement and persistence in school ; and ( 4 ) involve parents in the educational options and choices of their children .
we conducted our study between february and april 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
educators and other experts with whom we spoke view single - gender programs as a way to address ( 1 ) high dropout rates , low academic achievement , and other problems faced by many urban males — particularly minorities — and ( 2 ) girls' low academic performance in advanced mathematics and science ; general lack of confidence , competence , and leadership skills ; and narrow views of potential careers .
in a more recent study of single - gender schools in four countries ( belgium , new zealand , thailand , and japan ) , however , riordan concluded that single - gender schools do not have uniform and consistent effects and their effects are conditional .
whatever the effectiveness and desirability of single - gender programs , single - gender public elementary and secondary education is limited by law .
officials we talked to in schools that have experimented recently with single - gender education said that such programs have resulted in observable qualitative differences in the behavior of children in single - gender environments ; conclusive quantitative research , however , on the effectiveness of such public school programs is not available .
