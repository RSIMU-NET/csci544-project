in response , the office of management and budget's ( omb ) federal chief information officer ( cio ) launched the federal data center consolidation initiative ( fdcci ) in 2010 .
as federal agencies have modernized their information technology ( it ) operations , put more of their services online , and increased their information security profiles , their need for computing power and data storage resources has resulted in a dramatic increase in the federal data centers and a corresponding increase in operational costs .
for example , in july 2012 , we reported on the progress the 24 participating federal departments and agenciesmaking on this initiative and found that , while progress had been made , nearly all of the agencies had not yet completed a data center inventory or the consolidation plans needed to implement their consolidation initiatives .
over the past few years , we have reported and testified on federal data center consolidation , noting that , while the initiative has the potential to provide billions of dollars in savings , improvements in the oversight of agencies' efforts are needed .
were you asked us to testify on our report being released today that evaluated agencies' reported progress against omb's planned consolidation and cost savings goals and assessed the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by omb for fdcci are adequately performing oversight of agencies' efforts to meet these goals .
omb has not reported on agencies' progress against its key performance goal of achieving $3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015 .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss federal agencies' continuing efforts to consolidate their data centers .
the lack of a new cost savings goal will further limit omb's ability to determine whether or not the new combined initiative is on course toward achieving its planned objectives .
further , omb's march 2013 memorandum does not address whether the task force and gsa's program management office will continue their oversight roles , which does not help to mitigate this risk .
we have previously reported that oversight and governance of major it initiatives help to ensure that the initiatives meet their objectives and performance goals .
improved oversight could better position omb to assess progress against its cost savings goal and minimize agencies' risk of not realizing anticipated cost savings .
until omb tracks cost savings data , the agency will be limited in its ability to determine whether or not fdcci is on course toward achieving planned performance goals .
further compounding this lack of clarity , total cost savings to date from data center consolidation efforts have not been determined , creating uncertainty as to whether omb will be able to meet its original cost savings goal of $3 billion by the end of 2015 .
however , most notably , 21 agencies did not fully report their expected cost savings ; of those , 13 agencies provided partial cost savings information and 8 provided none .
we further reported that , to assist agencies with their data center consolidation efforts , omb had sponsored the development of a fdcci total cost of ownership model that was intended to help agencies refine their estimated costs for consolidation ; however , agencies were not required to use the cost model as part of their cost estimating efforts .
