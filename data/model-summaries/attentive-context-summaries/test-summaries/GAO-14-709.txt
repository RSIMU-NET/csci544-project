the department of justice's ( doj ) federal bureau of prisons ( bop ) requested about $6.9 billion in fiscal year 2014 to provide for the custody and care of an inmate population that has increased from about 24,000 in fiscal year 1980 to over 216,000 in july 2014 .
to better address obstacles that occur during the activation process and to help ensure that institutions are activated within estimated timeframes , including those institutions that do not currently have inmates , such as administrative usp thomson and usp yazoo city , we recommend that the director of the bureau of prisons take the following three actions: direct the central office to analyze staffing data at individual institutions in the activation process to assess their progress toward reaching authorized staffing levels and use that assessment to develop effective , tailored strategies to mitigate those challenges ; develop and implement a comprehensive activation policy that incorporates the knowledge of staff with experience activating institutions ; and develop and implement an activation schedule that incorporates the four characteristics of scheduling best practices .
taking action to address challenges that bop can control will help mitigate obstacles in ongoing and future activation of new institutions .
according to doj , as of july 2014 , bop - operated institutions are about 31 percent overcrowded , which occurs when institutions house more inmates than they are designed to hold .
to ensure that the challenges that bop faces activating new institutions are clearly conveyed to decision makers , we recommend that , in future activations , the attorney general use doj's annual congressional budget justification for bop to communicate to congress factors that might delay activations , such as challenges hiring staff and placing inmates associated with the locations of new institutions .
each of the federal bureau of prisons' ( bop ) institutions in the activation process has had schedule slippages due to delays in receiving congressionally directed activation funding .
bop considers reducing crowding rates system - wide to be a strategic goal and has spent over $1.3 billion on the construction and acquisition of six new federal institutions to help alleviate crowding across the prison system .
we also analyzed data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) human resources database , enterprise human resources integration ( ehri ) statistical data mart , for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 to determine the extent to which staffing challenges identified by institutions in the activation process affected bop's ability to meet estimated time frames related to activation .
while the success of new institution activations relies heavily on congressional direction regarding activation funding , bop ultimately is responsible for the taxpayer dollars it spends on construction , acquisition , and activation of new institutions .
additionally , over the past 2 years , members of congress have introduced at least five bills to date that seek to modify federal sentencing requirements in order to reduce the length of incarceration of inmates convicted of nonviolent drug - related offenses .
our analysis compared crowding rates with and without the addition of new beds provided by the six institutions and examined the effect of that additional capacity across ( 1 ) all bop institutions , ( 2 ) respective security levels of each institution , and ( 3 ) gender .
