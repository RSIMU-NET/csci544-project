a "lame duck" session of congress is one that takes place after the election for the next congress has been held but before the current congress has reached the end of its constitutional term .
since 1935 , the constitutional term of a congress has begun on january 3 of each odd - numbered year and has ended on january 3 of the next odd - numbered year .
as a result , any meeting of congress that occurs between the congressional election in november of an even - numbered year and the following january 3 is a lame duck session .
the significant characteristic of a lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting members of the existing congress , not those who will be entitled to sit in the new congress .
for the purposes of this study , a lame duck session commences on the first day of consecutive sessions following an election .
a lame duck session may occur under the following circumstances: ( 1 ) by a previously enacted law prescribing an additional session of congress ; ( 2 ) following a recess within a session but spanning the election ; ( 3 ) under authority granted to the leadership at the time of a contingent adjournment or recess of the session ; ( 4 ) by continuing to meet , perhaps in pro forma sessions , throughout the period spanning the election ; and ( 5 ) in response to a presidential proclamation calling an extraordinary session .
it ends on the day of final sine die adjournment .
although some of these methods have been used rarely and others not at all , each helps to illuminate the constitutional arrangements that make lame duck sessions possible and the conditions in which they may operate .
since 2000 ( 106 th congress ) , both the house and senate have reconvened after every election ; see table 3 .
congress was unable to resolve its differences on the appropriations bills .
in seven of the nine 21 st century lame duck sessions , congress passed regular appropriations bills or continuing resolutions that maintained government funding .
in the four of past five election years , the house or senate adjourned in january .
congress also debated congressional reform issues , including restructuring the committee system and increasing congressional pay .
under the twentieth amendment , lame duck sessions can still occur but only as a result of specific actions undertaken either by the congress already sitting or by the president .
in both the house and senate , the average election break declined by 14 days in the post - 1998 period ( five days when omitting 1948 ) .
in addition to the dhs , congress adopted several other significant measures , including the defense authorization act , the intelligence authorization act , and measures regulating terrorism insurance and seaport security .
83 ) combined several appropriations bills into one omnibus bill , including a continuing resolution .
lame duck sessions were used sporadically by congress from 1935 , when the twentieth amendment became effective , to 1998 , when just the house met following the election .
congress did pass legislation to adjust overtime pay for government workers and to provide for the military draft of 18- and 19-year - old men ( although congress deferred deciding whether to require a full year's training before sending them into combat ) .
