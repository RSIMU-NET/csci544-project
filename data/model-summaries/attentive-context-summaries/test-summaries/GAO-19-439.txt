many of the department of defense's ( dod ) major defense acquisition programs face challenges delivering innovative technologies to the warfighter to keep pace with evolving threats .
in the national defense authorization acts for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 , congress included numerous reforms that could help to streamline acquisition oversight and field capabilities faster .
 ( recommendation 4 ) .
this report also includes an assessment of dod's efforts to implement our previous portfolio management recommendations and identifies opportunities and challenges related to portfolio management that dod may face as it continues to implement acquisition reforms .
second , dod has yet to address persistent portfolio management challenges that affect its ability to effectively manage its portfolio of weapon system investments .
dod is beginning to monitor the implementation of certain reforms , but has yet to establish processes to assess the overall effectiveness of its reform efforts .
in congressional hearings in 2017 and 2018 , the chairmen of the senate and house armed services committees emphasized the importance of these reforms and expressed concerns that without improving the speed of and increasing the amount of innovation in the dod acquisition process , the u.s. military would lose its technological advantage .
middle - tier acquisition programs are generally exempt from dod's traditional acquisition and requirements development policies .
to assess the progress dod has made to implement selected oversight reforms for major defense acquisition programs , we analyzed three selected reforms that affect processes related to dod's oversight of major defense acquisition programs: designating military departments to be the milestone decision conducting independent technical risk assessments ; and establishing cost , fielding , and performance goals .
lastly , dod has yet to develop processes to assess the effectiveness of recent reforms .
collectively , the reforms congress put forth fundamentally altered roles and responsibilities for major defense acquisition program oversight to give significantly more authority for managing acquisition programs to the military departments .
you asked us to examine dod's efforts to implement provisions to streamline acquisition oversight included in the national defense authorization acts for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 .
further , the reforms included an alternative acquisition process for programs intended to field capabilities within 2 to 5 years â€” a process referred to as middle - tier acquisition .
in fact , these recommendations may take on more importance for dod in light of the implementation of acquisition reforms that will further diffuse responsibility for initiating and overseeing acquisition programs .
