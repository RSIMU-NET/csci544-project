the general services administration ( gsa ) has taken some important steps to improve the capacity of the federal real property profile ( frpp ) to allow agencies to better record data ; however , questions remain about the accuracy of data collected and reported .
as of september 30 , 2015 , this real estate portfolio included approximately 240,000 federally owned buildings that are under the custody and control of the 24 civilian and defense chief financial officer ( cfo ) act agencies in the united states and u.s. territories .
this report assesses ( 1 ) the reliability of government - wide data and reporting on domestic , federally owned buildings' disposal data in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and ( 2 ) steps omb , gsa , and selected cfo act agencies have taken to improve disposal data .
the combined initiatives ( 1 ) of omb's requirement for cfo act agencies to implement standard data - validation and verification checks beginning in fiscal year 2017 , ( 2 ) of gsa's updated guidance and the expanded capacity of the frpp to allow agencies to enter more complete disposal data , and ( 3 ) of selected agencies' development of new processes should lead to improved data reliability .
the federal government is the largest real property owner in the united states with a vast and complex inventory costing billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain .
in this time of fiscal constraint , the administration and congress have taken an interest in the disposal of unneeded buildings through demolition , sale , and transfer to other federal agencies that need them .
an official from the office of management and budget ( omb ) testified in june 2015 and in september 2016 on government - wide building disposals .
in fiscal year 2014 , chief financial officer ( cfo ) act agencies reported that they disposed of nearly 50 percent of their domestic , federally owned buildings through “other” means ( see table 2 ) .
such disposals have the potential to save the government and taxpayers millions of dollars .
to assess the reliability of government - wide reporting on domestic , federally owned buildings' disposal data reported in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 , we examined the disposal date , disposal method , square footage , and annual operations and maintenance ( o&m ) data fields within the frpp database to determine whether the data were complete , within reasonable ranges , and internally consistent ( e.g. , federally owned buildings reported as disposed would not be listed as disposed of through “lease termination” ) .
in 2003 , we added “managing federal real property” to our high risk list , in part due to long - standing challenges federal agencies face in managing their real property , including disposal of excess and underutilized properties and collecting and reporting reliable real - property data .
although we found that the government - wide real property data were generally reliable , continued improvements in data reliability could lead to more effective real - property management decision making .
to assess steps omb , gsa , and selected cfo act agencies have taken to improve the reliability of reported frpp data since the fiscal year 2014's reporting cycle , we interviewed omb and gsa officials as well as real property officials at a non - generalizable selection of three civilian agencies — the united states department of agriculture ( agriculture ) , the department of energy ( energy ) , and the department of the interior ( interior ) — with the highest numbers of disposed buildings during the evaluation period .
