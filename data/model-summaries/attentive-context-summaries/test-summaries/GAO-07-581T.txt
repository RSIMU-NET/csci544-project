combating nuclear smuggling is one of our nation's key national security objectives and the deployment of radiation detection equipment including portal monitors at u.s. ports of entry , including border crossings and domestic seaports , is an integral part of this system .
dhs , through its domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) , is responsible for acquiring and supporting the deployment of radiation detection equipment , including portal monitors , within the united states .
i am pleased to appear here today to discuss our assessment of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) may 2006 cost - benefit analysis used to support the purchase and deployment of next generation radiation portal monitors .
the pacific northwest national laboratory ( pnnl ) , one of the department of energy's ( doe ) national laboratories , is under contract to manage the deployment of radiation detection equipment for dhs .
in response to our recommendation , dndo issued its cost - benefit analysis in may 2006 , and an updated , revised version in june 2006 .
for these reasons , dhs's cost - benefit analysis does not meet the intent of our march 2006 report recommendation to fully assess the costs and benefits before purchasing any new equipment .
in july 2006 , dhs awarded contracts to three vendors for developing the advanced spectroscopic portals' capabilities .
to ensure that dhs's substantial investment in radiation detection technology yields the greatest possible level of detection capability at the lowest possible cost , in a march 2006 gao report , we recommended that once the costs and capabilities of asps were well understood , and before any of the new equipment was purchased for deployment , the secretary of dhs work with the director of dndo to analyze the costs and benefits of deploying asps .
u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for screening cargo as it enters the nation at our borders , which includes operating radiation detection equipment to interdict dangerous nuclear and radiological materials .
this is an important decision because , if procured , these new portal monitors will be considerably more expensive than the portal monitors in use today .
specifically , i will discuss whether dndo's june 2006 cost - benefit analysis provides an adequate basis for the substantial investment that acquiring and deploying asps will necessitate .
these new , advanced portals are known as advanced spectroscopic portals ( asps ) .
the cost - benefit analysis shows the total cost for deploying both current and new portal monitors to be about $1 billion .
in comparing the costs of the new and current technologies , the procurement costs of the current generation portal monitors were highly inflated because dndo assumed a unit cost of about $131,000 , while the contract price at the time of the analysis was about $55,000 .
further , we recommended that this analysis focus on determining whether any additional detection capability provided by the asps was worth the considerable additional costs .
regarding the performance of the portal monitors: instead of using the results of its performance tests conducted in 2005 , dndo's analysis simply assumed that asps could detect highly enriched uranium 95 percent of the time , a performance level far exceeding the capabilities of the new technology's current demonstrated capabilities .
