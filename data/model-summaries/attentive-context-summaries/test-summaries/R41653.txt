the first of these bills , the continuing appropriations act , 2011 ( p.l .
111-242 ) , was enacted on september 30 , 2010 , and provided funding through december 3 , 2010 .
normally , a continuing appropriation permits government agencies to operate at the same rate as experienced in the most recent full - year appropriation — in this case fy2010 — for the duration of the appropriation .
the most substantial adjustment to military construction accounts was the reduction of the brac 2005 account from the $8.0 billion needed near the height of brac construction in fy2010 to $2.4 billion .
a second full - year continuing appropriation , including funding for military construction , was introduced to the house on april 11 as division b of h.r .
since then , six other bills have extended federal funding through march 4 , 2011 .
 ( a ) no appropriation or funds made available or authority granted pursuant to section 101 for the department of defense shall be used for ( 1 ) the new production of items not funded for production in fiscal year 2010 or prior years ; ( 2 ) the increase in production rates above those sustained with fiscal year 2010 funds ; or ( 3 ) the initiation , resumption , or continuation of any project , activity , operation , or organization ( defined as any project , subproject , activity , budget activity , program element , and subprogram within a program element , and for any investment items defined as a p - 1 line item in a budget activity within an appropriation account and an r - 1 line item that includes a program element and subprogram element within an appropriation account ) for which appropriations , funds , or other authority were not available during fiscal year 2010 .
crs has published a report , recently updated , on continuing appropriations that discusses at length and tracks the seven bills that have thus far funded federal government operations through fy2011 .
although the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 ( p.l .
1473 , the department of defense and full - year continuing appropriations act , 2011 .
111-383 ) , enacted on january 7 , 2011 , authorized the expenditure of appropriations for a number of military construction projects , dod has taken this section to be a barrier to the initiation of any new fy2011 construction .
1 , a full - year continuing appropriation , on february 19 , 2011 .
nevertheless , the bill failed passage in the senate .
when a final appropriation for fy2011 is enacted , the various defense agencies and military departments will have to adjust their spending rates to end the fiscal year without exceeding their newly enacted budget authority .
none of the subsequent enacted appropriations altered this language , and dod has reported that no new fy2011 construction has yet been undertaken .
with the exception of new construction projects , dod may be assumed to be obligating funds in each account at a rate commensurate with its fy2010 appropriation .
the bill would have set new fy2011 full - year appropriations amounts for each of the military construction and family housing accounts , as indicated in table a - 1 and table a - 2 in the appendix .
