since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent anthrax incidents , there has been concern about the ability of the federal government to prepare for and coordinate an effective public health response to such events , given the broad distribution of responsibility for that task at the federal level .
in order to assist the committee in its consideration of this extensive reorganization of our government , this statement focuses on titles iii and v of the president's proposal and the implications of ( 1 ) the proposed transfer of specific public health preparedness and response programs currently housed in hhs into the new department , ( 2 ) the proposed transfer of control over certain other public health preparedness assistance programs from hhs to the new department , and ( 3 ) the proposed transfer of responsibility for research and development on chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear threats to the new department .
the aspects of the proposal concerned with public health preparedness and response would involve two primary changes to the current system , which are found in title v of the proposed legislation .
the president's proposed homeland security act of 2002 would bring many of these federal entities with homeland security responsibilities — including public health preparedness and response — into one department , in an effort to mobilize and focus assets and resources at all levels of government .
our earlier work found , for example , that more than 20 federal departments and agencies carry some responsibility for bioterrorism preparedness and response and that these efforts are fragmented .
second , it would transfer the control over , but not the operation of , other public health preparedness assistance programs , such as providing emergency preparedness planning assistance to state and local governments , from the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to the new department .
however , we have concerns about the proposed transfer of control of public health assistance programs that have both basic public health and homeland security functions from hhs to the new department .
title iii of the proposed legislation would also transfer responsibility for certain chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear research and development programs and activities to the new department .
i appreciate the opportunity to submit this statement for the record on the proposed creation of the department of homeland security .
the proposed department of homeland security would also be tasked with developing national policy for and coordination of the federal government's civilian research and development efforts to counter chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear threats .
the statement is based largely on our previous and ongoing work on homeland security , as well as a review of the proposed legislation .
first , the proposal would transfer certain emergency preparedness and response programs from multiple agencies to the new department .
emergency response is further complicated by the need to coordinate actions with agencies at the state and local level , where much of the response activity would occur .
we expect that , in addition to improving overall coordination , the transfer of programs from multiple agencies to the new department could reduce overlap among programs and facilitate response in times of disaster .
