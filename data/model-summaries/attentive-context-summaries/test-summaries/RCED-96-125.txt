over the past several decades , manufacturing has been declining in many of the nation's cities .
because , in part , of the high cost of assessing the sites to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to clean them up in accordance with federal and state environmental laws , some new businesses have chosen to locate on uncontaminated sites outside of urban areas , known as “greenfields.” these decisions lead to the loss of tax revenue and employment in central city neighborhoods .
the senate's proposed legislation to reauthorize superfund , s. 1285 , seeks to encourage local governments to redevelop brownfields by addressing two of the barriers to redevelopment: liability under the superfund legislation and the costs of assessing the sites .
when the businesses closed , they left abandoned and idled properties commonly known as “brownfields,” which are sometimes contaminated with chemical wastes from the manufacturing processes .
they have often cited the liability provisions in the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) , commonly known as superfund , as one of the major disincentives to redeveloping brownfields .
it also proposes to assist with the costs of assessing the sites by providing interest - free loans of $100,000 per year , up to a total of $200,000 per site , which local governments could use to cover these costs .
to help you evaluate whether these provisions in s. 1285 would encourage redeveloping the brownfields in the nation's cities , you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) what the universe of potential brownfield sites nationwide is , ( 2 ) what legal barriers superfund presents for redeveloping brownfields , and ( 3 ) whether the proposed loans to local governments are likely to be sufficient for conducting site assessments .
lenders and developers are wary of investing in such contaminated property because , under the environmental laws , they could be held liable for cleaning up the contamination .
in june 1995 , we reported on the barriers , including liability under cercla , to redeveloping urban industrial property .
the bill would protect lenders and property purchasers from superfund liability under certain circumstances .
additionally , epa clarified its enforcement policies toward lenders , property purchasers , and certain property owners to alleviate their concerns and facilitate their involvement in the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields .
they also noted a number of policies that epa has issued to help remove some of these liability barriers to brownfield redevelopment .
some of the research and advocacy organizations involved in urban issues have developed estimates , and municipalities have also estimated the potential number of brownfield sites , or acreage , within their borders .
several legislative proposals that would address brownfield issues , including s. 1285 , have been introduced .
while the federal government and the states have not identified and listed brownfield properties , several local governments that received grants under epa's brownfields pilot program have also developed estimates of brownfield acreage within their borders .
however , any estimate of the number of brownfields is likely to be imprecise because the cities and others measuring the number of brownfields often use different techniques and definitions .
