i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to resolve long - standing problems in supply chain management .
dod maintains a military force with unparalleled logistics capabilities and can claim success in meeting the challenges to supplying the warfighter .
as requested , my comments today will focus on dod's progress in ( 1 ) implementing the supply chain management improvement plan and ( 2 ) incorporating performance measures for tracking and demonstrating improvement .
for example , by early 2005 , dod moved more than 2 million short tons of cargo , including equipment , spare parts , and supplies , several thousand miles to the persian gulf in support of operation iraqi freedom .
the under secretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics , as well as other senior dod officials , has shown a commitment to improving supply chain management .
over the next 6 years , dod also plans to invest about $54 billion in aircraft , trucks , ships , and other mobility assets to deploy and supply its forces .
at the same time , there are pervasive , decades - old problems in dod's supply chain management that need to be addressed and resolved .
however , as dod moves forward , we believe that there are opportunities to further improve dod's ability to show progress toward resolving long - term supply chain problems .
challenges may include fragmentation in the way supply chain management is understood and applied , failure to develop true integration of supply chain processes , organizational resistance , lack of buy - in from top managers , lack of or slow development of needed measurement systems , and lack of integrated information systems linking participants in the supply chain .
the fundamental premise of supply chain management is the operation of a continuous , unbroken , comprehensive , and all - inclusive logistics process , from initial customer order for materiel or services to the ultimate satisfaction of the customer's requirements .
the continued active involvement of this subcommittee is important to focusing attention on this issue and encouraging dod to demonstrate progress .
finally , the materiel distribution initiatives were included to improve the timely and seamless flow of materiel in support of deployed forces .
the plan's initiatives that affect asset visibility seek to improve dod's ability to provide timely and accurate information regarding the location , quantity , condition , movement , and status of materiel assets across the department .
 ( attachment 1 provides a description of the initiatives and shows the focus area or areas that they are intended to address ) .
since october , dod has regularly updated its supply chain management improvement plan , added more details , and has made progress implementing individual initiatives by generally meeting the milestones laid out in its plan .
more specifically , with the plan's inception in july 2005 , dod hoped to produce significant improvements over the next 2 years .
second , given the high demand for goods and services to support ongoing u.s. military operations , the investment of resources in the supply chain is substantial .
last year , with the encouragement of the office of management and budget ( omb ) , dod developed a supply chain management improvement plan aimed at putting dod on a path toward resolving long - term supply chain problems and , eventually , removal from our list of high - risk programs .
