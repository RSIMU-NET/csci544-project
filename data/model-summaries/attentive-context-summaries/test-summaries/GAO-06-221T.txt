concern about the nation's preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic has been growing for some time , in part because of the increase in the number of identified human cases of avian influenza in asia .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to provide information on our recent review of the 2004 – 05 influenza vaccine shortage , with lessons to consider as the nation improves its ability to respond to an influenza pandemic ( a global influenza outbreak resulting from a major genetic change in the influenza virus ) .
studies suggest that a pandemic's effects in the united states could be severe , and shortages of vaccine could occur .
the nation's experience responding to the shortage of annual influenza vaccine for the 2004 – 05 influenza season — in which the nation faced an unexpected loss of nearly half its projected vaccine supply — offers insight into the some of the challenges that federal , state , and local entities will face if a pandemic occurs .
this body of work includes interviews with officials in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , such as officials from the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the national vaccine program office .
the absence of such a plan led to delays and uncertainties on the part of state and local public health entities on how best to ensure access to vaccine by individuals at high risk of severe influenza - related complications .
second , streamlined mechanisms to expedite vaccine availability are key to an effective response .
during the 2004 – 05 shortage , for example , federal purchases of vaccine licensed for use in other countries but not the united states were not completed in time to meet peak demand .
my statement includes findings from our recent report on last winter's influenza vaccine shortage and discusses lessons learned from that experience that could help prepare the nation to respond to future vaccine shortages in either an annual influenza season or an influenza pandemic .
we also interviewed officials from public health departments and a major influenza vaccine manufacturer ; national organizations , including the association of state and territorial health officials and the association of immunization managers ; organizations that conduct mass immunization clinics ; and a large purchaser of influenza vaccine .
some states' experience also highlighted the importance of mechanisms to transfer available vaccine quickly and easily from one state to another .
third , effective response requires clear and consistent communication .
consistency among federal , state , and local communications is critical for averting confusion .
my statement also draws from several gao reports and testimonies on influenza vaccine supply , pandemic planning , and emergency preparedness for emerging infectious diseases that we have issued since october 2000 .
since 2000 , we have encouraged the development of a plan to address critical issues that could arise in an influenza pandemic .
at the start of the 2004 – 05 influenza season , when the nation unexpectedly lost roughly half its projected influenza vaccine supply , the nation lacked a contingency plan specifically for a severe vaccine shortage .
state and local health officials also emphasized the value of updated information when responding to changing circumstances , using diverse media to reach diverse audiences , and educating providers and the public about prevention alternatives .
