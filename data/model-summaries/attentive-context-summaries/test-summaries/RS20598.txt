combating terrorism has emerged as one of the most important u.s. foreign policy and national security priorities .
rs20598 - - national commission on terrorism report: background and issues for congress updated february 6 , 200 .
the united states andother cooperating nations confront four majortasks , namely , ( 1 ) deterring / identifying terrorists and their sponsors / supporters , ( 2 ) weakening terrorist financial andother infrastructures , ( 3 ) hardening potentialtargets , and ( 4 ) containing damage in the aftermath of terrorist incidents .
areas not covered in the commission's report but dealt with by other panelsor expert advisory groups include ( 1 ) u.s. embassy security ( 1999 overseas advisory panel report ) ; ( 2 ) securityof u.s. military installations overseas ( 1996downing commission khobar towers report ) ; and ( 3 ) weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) disaster consequencemanagement ( 1999 gilmore commissionreport ) .
the report advocates: ( 1 ) using full , and what can be characterized as proactive , intelligence and law enforcement authority to collect intelligence regardingterrorist plans and methods ; ( 2 ) targeting firmly - - and with sanctions - - all states that support terrorists ; ( 3 ) disrupting non - governmental sources of terrorists'support - - especially financial and logistical ; ( 4 ) enhancing planning and preparation to respond to terrorist attacksinvolving biological , chemical , radiological ornuclear materials ; and ( 5 ) creating stronger mechanisms to ensure that funding for individual agencycounterterrorism programs reflects priorities integrated into acomprehensive national counterterrorism plan subject to congressional oversight .
this is especially true of thoserecommendations which relate to ( 1 ) enhancingintelligence gathering ; ( 2 ) modernizing retrieval capability of databases which monitor the visa status of foreignstudents ; ( 3 ) expulsion of suspected terrorists ; and ( 4 ) contingency planning for an active military role ( including a possible lead role ) in the event of a catastrophicterrorist attack on u.s. soil .
the most likely areas ofscrutiny include: ( 1 ) more productive counterterrorismpolicies and mindsets ; ( 2 ) enhanced use of legislative authority to impose sanctions on states that support or activelycountenance terrorism , and ( 3 ) methods ofachieving a more cohesive , better coordinated federal counterterrorism effort through enhanced budget coordinationmechanisms .
laws , policies , and practices for preventing and punishing terrorism aimed at u.s. citizens ( p.l .
for example , how might sanctions be fine tuned or graduated to enhance their effectiveness and make theirimposition more likely ; ( 5 ) what is an appropriate role for covert operations in a proactive counterterrorism policy ( should the u.s. ban on assassinations be reviewed ) ; ( 6 ) how can one insure that the best international talent joins forces to enhance technological research and development efforts to support counterterrorism goals ; and ( 7 ) what role , if any , should the media assume in a proactive counterterrorism policy .
the number of terrorist groups is reportedlygrowing and the technology to inflict mass casualties is becoming more readily available .
it also notes u.s. failure to use sanctions , or thethreat thereof , in response to greece'sinactivity / reluctance to investigate and prosecute terrorist activity - - inaction by greece which is portrayed astantamount to complicity .
