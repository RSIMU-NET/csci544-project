the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) is charged with reducing illicit drug use , manufacturing and trafficking , drug - related crime and violence , and drug - related health consequences .
to achieve these goals , the office formulates a national drug control strategy that includes multipronged approaches to combating national drug use .
among these approaches is an effort to reduce and prevent drug use among america's youth by conducting educational and community action programs , including a national youth anti - drug media campaign .
although annenberg was responsible for providing overall support to westat with respect to the entire scope of work detailed in the prime contract , it was specifically directed to provide particular support for the following six tasks: ( 1 ) project management , ( 2 ) development of the campaign evaluation plan , ( 3 ) instrument development , ( 4 ) data analysis and report generation , ( 5 ) preparation of contract reports , and ( 6 ) modification of the campaign evaluation plan .
since then , over $1 billion has been appropriated for the media campaign .
the campaign combines paid and donated advertising with public communications outreach in an effort to change teen and parental beliefs and behaviors regarding drug use .
congress first authorized funding for the media campaign in fiscal year 1998 , with the expectation that demonstrable changes in youth drug behaviors would be apparent within 3 years .
as such , the report expressed concern about the amount of resources consumed by consultants and the extent to which funds were spent for consulting services rather than media time and space for advertisements .
in a committee report for the fiscal year 2004 appropriations cycle , the senate appropriations committee asserted that drug use was increasing in spite of the campaign and that some observers had concluded that the campaign was having no noticeable impact .
this report focuses on the following question: what services did contractors and their subcontractors provide in support of ondcp's media campaign and what were the estimated award amounts for these services for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 ? .
we are currently conducting a separate review examining the design and execution of ondcp's primary effort to evaluate the media campaign's effectiveness .
given these issues , the committee report directed us to review how consultants were used in support of the media campaign .
in addition , the report asserted that a large portion of the campaign's budget pays for outside media and advertising consultants .
ogilvy & mather retained 20 subcontractors for nearly $5 million to provide two types of services: ( 1 ) multicultural media planning and buying agencies and ( 2 ) substance use behavioral change experts , who constituted the behavioral change expert panel ( bcep ) .
the ad council retained one subcontractor , madison advertising management , ltd. , ( mam ) , to provide advertising production cost review services for about $636,000 .
fleishman - hillard awarded about $8 million of its total contract award to 80 subcontractors for public communications and outreach services .
ondcp's 2005 appropriation provides $120 million for the media campaign , which represents a $25 million decline from the 2004 appropriation and a $75 million decline from the first - year funding in 1998 .
