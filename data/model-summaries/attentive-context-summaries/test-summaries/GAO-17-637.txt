we compared the u.s. department of transportation's ( dot ) practices and procedures for aspects of its air ambulance oversight to federal internal control standards related to information collection and external communication .
to describe what is known about factors affecting prices and selected stakeholders' views on actions the federal government could take to address pricing , we selected and interviewed 26 stakeholders , including representatives from: 8 air ambulance providers ( 3 large independent providers and 5 hospital - affiliated providers ) chosen to represent a range of business model types ( independent and hospital - affiliated ) , sizes , and known perspectives in the industry ; 2 associations representing air ambulance providers ; 6 groups familiar with air ambulance business and billing , such as industry analysts and consultants ; 4 states active in assessing air ambulance costs and prices charged ; 2 associations of state officials ; 2 associations representing health insurers ; and 2 groups involved with consumer policy or research .
consider consumer disclosure requirements for air ambulance providers , which could include information such as established prices charged , business model and entity that establishes prices , and extent of contracting with insurance .
we reviewed documentation — including pertinent laws , regulations , guidance , enforcement actions , and legal opinions — and interviewed officials from dot and the department of health & human services' centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) .
assess available federal and industry data and determine what further information could assist in the evaluation of future complaints or concerns regarding unfair or deceptive practices .
for this work we examined: ( 1 ) what is known about the prices charged for air ambulance service , ( 2 ) what is known about the factors that affect the prices charged for air ambulance service , and ( 3 ) what actions , if any , selected stakeholders believe the federal government should take regarding air ambulance pricing .
without better information , dot has limited ability to understand the industry including the nature of competition that could affect its decisions on whether to take investigative or enforcement actions .
air ambulance transportation is widely regarded as having a beneficial impact on improving the chances of survival and recovery for trauma victims and other critical patients , particularly in rural areas that lack readily accessible advanced - care facilities such as trauma or burn centers .
furthermore , dot lacks data needed to assess several key aspects of the industry , ranging from basic aspects — such as the composition of the industry by provider type , prices charged by provider , or number of overall air ambulance transports — to the more complex , such as the extent of contracting between providers and insurers or extent of balance billing to patients .
see hcci , data brief: non - shoppable health care services: inpatient hospitalizations ( february 2017 ) , 9-10. documentation and comparing our results across both data sets and to published sources , among other things , and determined both sources were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report .
for example , media reports of balance billing have included a provider placing a lien on a patient's home as well as patients having their credit negatively affected or filing for bankruptcy .
