however , if clinicians want to bill medicare for these services , the service must meet medicare's statutory requirements for payment .
we provided a draft of this report to hhs , dod , and va for review and comment .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , another hhs agency , oversees medicare payments for telehealth services .
in this report we 1. describe the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are used by medicare and other federal programs to provide health care services ; 2. assess the extent to which cms oversees telehealth payments in medicare ; 3. describe the factors associations representing providers and patients rated — and payers cited — as affecting the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare ; and 4. describe how emerging payment and delivery models could affect the potential use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare .
to describe the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are used by medicare and other federal programs , we reviewed available data , statutes , regulations , and other relevant documentation related to telehealth in medicare , medicaid , the department of defense ( dod ) , and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) .
while medicare currently uses telehealth primarily in rural areas or regions designated as having a shortage of health professionals , in the future emerging payment and delivery models may change the extent to which telehealth and remote patient monitoring are available and used by medicare beneficiaries and providers in other areas .
in recent years there have been efforts to increase the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in federal health care programs .
our report also describes the use of remote patient monitoring by selected health plans in the private insurance market ( see app .
a federal strategic plan prepared by the office of the national coordinator for health information technology within hhs calls for an increased use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in federal health care programs .
beyond the medicare program , other federal programs , along with some private insurers , also pay for — or provide — some telehealth and remote patient monitoring services .
according to cms officials , clinicians using telehealth and remote patient monitoring for these purposes do not have to bill medicare for the service in order to receive credit for it under the merit - based incentive payment system , and these services can count for credit under the improvement activities performance category regardless of whether they meet the statutory telehealth requirements .
these departments provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
for dod , we obtained data on the use of telehealth for fiscal year 2015 , the most recent fiscal year available , and we interviewed officials about the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in dod's health care program .
the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 included a provision that we study telehealth and remote patient monitoring .
cms relies on medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) , which process and pay medicare claims in specific geographic jurisdictions .
as part of our work , we interviewed officials from health plans in the private insurance market ( private payers ) about the use of remote patient monitoring .
