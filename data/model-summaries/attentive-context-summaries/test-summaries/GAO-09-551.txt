specifically , we are reporting on ( 1 ) the flooding and erosion threats that alaska native villages currently face , ( 2 ) the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , ( 3 ) the status of village relocation efforts , and ( 4 ) how federal assistance to relocating villages is prioritized .
to determine the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , we met with officials from additional federal agencies , such as the department of homeland security's federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , interior's bureau of indian affairs , the department of health and human service's indian health service , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , and the department of transportation's federal aviation administration .
in december 2003 , we reported that most of alaska's more than 200 native villages were affected to some degree by flooding and erosion , most commonly caused by severe storm events on alaska's coastline or by river flooding , such as during the spring breakup of river ice .
flooding and erosion have caused millions of dollars of property damage in these remote villages and , in some cases , pose imminent threats to lives , homes , and infrastructure .
while federal and state agencies administer programs for constructing flooding and erosion control projects in threatened villages , some villages must relocate to safer locations due to the severity of the problems .
since 2003 , state officials have identified the growing impacts of climate change in alaska — which include melting polar ice , increasing storm intensity , and coastal flooding — increasing the urgency of federal and state efforts to identify imminently threatened villages and assess their relocation options .
in 2004 , a congressional committee directed the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to conduct an alaska erosion baseline study to coordinate and plan assistance for alaska villages with the greatest need and to provide an overall assessment on the priority of which villages should receive assistance .
in september 2007 , alaska's governor established the climate change sub - cabinet to lead the preparation and implementation of an alaska climate change strategy .
we found that successful relocation efforts would involve collaboration among multiple federal and state entities and the villages , and we reported on alternatives for addressing barriers that villages face in obtaining federal services to mitigate flooding and erosion threats .
while such efforts have begun to address the immediate needs of some of the most imminently threatened villages , many challenges remain .
these obstacles include the inability of many villages to meet the financial and other criteria for federal assistance , the high cost of implementing protection or relocation projects for the remote communities , and the lack of scientific erosion data for sound decision making .
within the sub - cabinet , an immediate action workgroup was created for the early assessment and development of an action plan addressing climate change impacts on coastal and other vulnerable communities in alaska .
in its deliberations regarding assistance to relocating villages , congress may want to consider designating , or creating , a lead federal entity that could work in conjunction with the lead state agency to coordinate and oversee village relocation efforts .
