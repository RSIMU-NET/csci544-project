postal service's ( usps ) international mail facilities or private carriers ; the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) food and drug administration ( fda ) , which is responsible for ensuring the safety , effectiveness , and quality of domestic and imported drugs ; the department of justice's drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , which regulates controlled substances ; and the department of homeland security's u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , which has law enforcement responsibilities that include investigations of prescription drugs coming into the united states through the mail and express carriers .
 ( 4 ) what efforts have federal agencies undertaken to coordinate the enforcement of the prohibitions on personal importation of prescription drugs ? .
 ( 3 ) what factors affect federal agency efforts to enforce the prohibition on prescription drug importation for personal use through international mail and carrier facilities ? .
however , in recent years , congress and others have debated whether americans should be allowed to purchase drugs from pharmacies located in foreign countries .

they include the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , which can inspect international mail and packages for potentially illegal drugs entering the united states through the u.s .
in view of the fda's continuing concern about the statutory notification requirement and its impact on enforcement , we also recommend that the secretary of hhs assess the ramifications of removing or modifying the requirement , report on the results of this assessment , and , if appropriate , recommend changes to congress .
the principles of the act include ( 1 ) establishing measurable goals and related measures , ( 2 ) developing strategies for achieving results , and ( 3 ) identifying the resources that will be required to achieve the goals .
hhs observed that , given the increased volume of illegally imported prescription drugs since its initial request for modification of fda's notification process , other actions might be needed , and hhs would work with its federal partners to determine the actions required .
at a minimum , this strategic framework should include establishment of an approach for estimating the scope of the problem , such as the volume of drugs entering the country through mail and carrier facilities ; establishment of objectives , milestones , and performance measures and a methodology to gauge results ; determination of the resources and investments needed to address the flow of prescription drugs illegally imported for personal use and where resources and investments should be targeted ; and an evaluation component to assess progress , identify barriers to achieving goals , and suggest modifications .
