health care delivery in the united states has long been characterized by fragmentation at the national , state , and local levels .
one way that hospitals , physicians , and other providers have addressed fragmentation is by forming integrated delivery systems ( ids ) to improve efficiency , quality , and access to care .
fragmentation of care delivery can lead to poor quality of care , medical errors , inefficient delivery of services , higher costs , and patient dissatisfaction .
because of cost and connectivity issues , its school - based health centers do not currently have access to the system's ehrs .
fragmentation can be especially burdensome for patients with chronic illnesses because of their ongoing care needs and for underserved populations — individuals who are uninsured or medically underserved — because of their financial and other challenges to accessing services .
the health care safety net act of 2008 directed gao to report on integrated health system models that integrate primary , specialty , and acute care and serve uninsured and medically underserved populations .
care is delivered by multiple providers , in multiple care settings , and often without systematic coordination and communication across providers and settings .
henry ford has also encountered challenges in implementing its ehr system .
in this follow - on report , we provide more in - depth information on 1. organizational features that idss use to support strategies to improve 2. approaches idss use to facilitate access to care for underserved 3. challenges idss encounter in providing care , including care provided to underserved populations .
an ids can be integrated across its providers and facilities in terms of such aspects as clinical care , financial management , and human resources .
payer mix ( percentage of patient population ) uninsured medicaid medicare private other 2 some idss are organized into multiple subsystems — local or regional delivery systems that are organized below the system level — that integrate clinical care within themselves .
to address our research objectives , we selected a judgmental sample of 15 idss that clinically integrate primary , specialty , and acute care and serve uninsured and medically underserved populations .
a henry ford official said that the school - based health centers have competing priorities for funds provided by henry ford , including staffing needs , and that henry ford has not been able to pay for the implementation of the ehr at the school - based health centers but plans to do so eventually .
the organizational features , patient care strategies , approaches to facilitate access , and challenges that we describe are not necessarily unique to idss , but may also be found in other health care settings and experienced by different providers .
to fulfill its mission to provide health care to underserved populations , seton provides primary care services to uninsured patients through its community clinics .
rural residents also face barriers to access because of physician shortages in rural areas .
while public idss have a mission of providing care to underserved populations , some private idss share this mission and others serve these populations to varying degrees .
we administered a structured interview protocol with chief medical officers ( or other system officials , as appropriate ) to obtain information on organizational features that idss use to support strategies to improve patient care ; approaches idss use to facilitate access to care for underserved populations ; and challenges idss encounter in providing care , including care provided to underserved populations .
