 ( recommendation 1 ) .
the objectives of our review were to examine ( 1 ) the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of these impacts on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure ; ( 2 ) technical assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional technical assistance to utilities ; and ( 3 ) financial assistance federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional financial assistance to utilities .
this report examines ( 1 ) the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of these impacts on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure ; ( 2 ) technical assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional technical assistance to utilities ; and ( 3 ) financial assistance selected federal agencies provided to selected utilities to help make drinking water and wastewater infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change , and options experts identified for providing additional financial assistance to utilities .
in addition , a 2017 drinking water and wastewater sector work group report cochaired by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) found that natural disasters are among the most significant risks to our nation's drinking water and wastewater infrastructure .
 ( matter for consideration 1 ) .
such changes could also help limit the fiscal exposure to the federal government for future recovery costs .
the five agencies are epa , noaa , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , and the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) rural utilities service .
significant risks from natural disasters can result from acute disasters related to extreme weather events , such as floods and hurricanes , and chronic hazards related to climate change , such as drought and sea level rise .
human health and well - being require clean and safe water , and the lack of access to such water is a significant threat to human health , according to a 2014 study by the water research foundation .
our work over the last decade has identified key federal roles in recognizing and managing risks in order to limit the federal government's fiscal exposure to the potential impacts of climate change .
you asked us to review what federal actions may be taken to reduce the potential impacts of climate change and related effects on drinking water and wastewater infrastructure .
federal agencies such as epa , fema , hud , and usda provide financial assistance to help ensure the long - term success of drinking water and wastewater utilities .
such changes could help ensure that drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects that receive federal financial assistance adequately address risks from climate change and ensure that utilities carry out their critical operations .
climate change impacts have the potential to negatively affect drinking water supplies , water and wastewater conveyance , and treatment infrastructure , as well as stormwater management systems .
