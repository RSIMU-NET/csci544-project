the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is the lead federal agency for increasing access to behavioral health services .
samhsa funds community - based mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention services and collects information on the incidence and prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse at the national and state level .
possible reauthorization issues include increased performance measurement and accountability for samhsa grants , granting specific authority for the access to recovery program , improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response , requiring collaboration between samhsa and other federal agencies , increasing samhsa's level of emphasis on primary prevention , increasing samhsa's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce , and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute samhsa's block grants .
samhsa's two largest programs are the $1.8 billion substance abuse prevention and treatment ( sapt ) block grant and the $421 million community mental health services ( cmhs ) block grant , which account for more than 60% of the agency's budget in fy2010 .
authorizations of appropriations for most of samhsa's grant programs expired at the end of fy2003 , though many of them continue to receive funding .
it also highlights some of the issues that may be addressed by congress when it next considers legislation to reauthorize samhsa and its programs .
in addition , performance and outcome data are used to measure the impact of programs and interventions .
comprehensive reauthorization of samhsa was discussed during the 110 th congress , and reauthorizing legislation was introduced in the 111 th congress .
these activities support samhsa's mission to improve the lives of people with substance abuse disorders and mental illnesses .
these data provide information on the incidence and prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse , the availability and utilization of treatment services , and the outcomes of mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services .
samhsa uses this information to monitor mental health and substance abuse trends and to help determine how resources should be directed .
this report provides an overview of samhsa's organization and programs and includes some analysis of the agency's funding over the past decade .
samhsa funds mental health and substance abuse services through formula and competitive grants .
samhsa provides formula funding to states , u.s. territories , and the red lake indian tribe , while competitive funding is awarded through numerous grant programs to states , territories , tribal organizations , local communities , and private entities .
samhsa was last reauthorized in 2000 .
the difference reflects the historical role federal and state governments have played in funding services in these two areas , with states providing a much larger portion of mental health funding than substance abuse funding .
the sapt block grant provides approximately 40% of the expenses of state agencies responsible for substance abuse prevention and treatment services .
by comparison , the cmhs block grant funds on average 2% of the expenses of state mental health agencies .
samhsa also collects data on mental health and substance abuse at the national and state level .
