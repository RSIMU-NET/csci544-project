lawmakers and the public have expressed increasing concern over the solvency of the disability insurance ( di ) trust fund , from which social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) benefits are paid .
in november 2015 , the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( h.r .
114-74 ) extended the projected solvency of the di trust fund by authorizing a reallocation of the social security payroll tax rate between the di and the old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) trust funds to provide di with a larger share .
until recently , the di trust fund was projected to be depleted in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 , at which time ongoing revenues to the di trust fund were projected to be sufficient to pay only about 80% of scheduled benefits .
although the reallocation averted a potential benefit cut in late 2016 , without additional legislation action ( i.e. , revenue increases , cost reductions , or some combination thereof ) , the di trust fund is projected to be unable to pay scheduled benefits in full and on a timely basis by the early 2020s .

enacted in 1956 under title ii of the social security act , ssdi is part of the old - age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program , more commonly known as social security .
to improve the financial outlook of the di trust fund over the long term , congress could consider a variety of legislative changes to increase tax revenues , reduce program cost ( i.e. , alter benefit levels or program eligibility requirements ) , or some combination of those approaches .
