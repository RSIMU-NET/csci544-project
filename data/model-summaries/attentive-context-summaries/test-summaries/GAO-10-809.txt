congress enacted the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) to help stimulate the united states economy by providing an estimated $862 billion over 10 years through a variety of programs .
in response , we determined ( 1 ) the extent of recovery act funding obligated by federal agencies on contracts , and the extent to which these contracts were awarded noncompetitively , ( 2 ) the reasons selected federal agencies awarded noncompetitive recovery act contract actions , ( 3 ) the extent of oversight of recovery act contracting at selected federal agencies , and ( 4 ) state officials' level of insight into and oversight of the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts within selected states .
we mentioned our prior findings regarding 8 ( a ) eligibility only to illustrate that there may be issues that merit consideration by agency igs as part of their overall approach to audits related to recovery act contracts that were not apparent when they developed their recovery act audit plans .
as of may 2010 , $26 billion of recovery act funds had been obligated on contracts awarded by federal agencies .
as the igs of the five agencies we reviewed periodically revisit and revise their recovery act audit plans , they should assess the need for allocating an appropriate level of audit resources , as determined using their risk - based analyses , to the noncompetitive contracts awarded under sba's 8 ( a ) program .
federal agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) were provided funding under the recovery act to audit the act's programs and projects , including grant and contract awards .
a portion of those funds is being provided directly to federal agencies , which may award contracts and grants for their respective programs .
to determine the extent to which contracts using recovery act funds are being awarded noncompetitively by federal agencies , we analyzed governmentwide data from the federal procurement data system — next generation ( fpds - ng ) .
another portion of recovery act funds is being provided directly to the states , which in turn may award contracts or grants to businesses or local governments .
four agencies — the departments of defense ( dod ) , energy ( doe ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) , and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — are the four agencies that obligated the most recovery act funds using noncompetitive contracts .
states generally are expected to use competition to the extent practicable when awarding contracts using federal funds .
state audit organizations for the selected states are focusing their audit resources on programmatic reviews rather than focusing on the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts , consistent with their assessments of relative risk .
with respect to oversight , each state has supplemented its state - level guidance with some additional recovery act - specific policies and procedures but does not routinely provide state - level oversight of contracts awarded at the local level .
the benefits of competition are well - established .
it saves taxpayer money , helps improve contractor performance , and promotes accountability for results .
the recovery act provides that to the maximum extent practicable , federal agencies' contracts should be awarded competitively with fixed prices .
