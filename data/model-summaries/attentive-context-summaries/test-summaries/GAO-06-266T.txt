keys to making this safety oversight system work are to: ( 1 ) establish programs that focus resources on areas of highest safety risk and on mitigating risks ; ( 2 ) provide training and other communication to ensure that inspectors maintain the skills and knowledge to consistently carry out the agency's oversight programs ; and ( 3 ) have processes and data to continuously monitor , evaluate , and improve the numerous oversight programs that make up the safety oversight system .
this record is a result of the efforts of the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , airlines , manufacturers , and others in the aviation industry to maintain one of the safest aviation systems in the world .
the u.s. commercial aviation industry , with less than one fatal accident per 5 million flights from 2002 through 2005 , has an extraordinary safety record .
this statement focuses on these three key areas of faa's “early warning system” and is based on our recent reports on faa's inspection oversight programs , industry partnership programs , enforcement program , and training program .
in order to maintain a high level of safety , it is critical to have a safety oversight system that is comprehensive , efficient , and effective and can provide an early warning of hazards that can lead to accidents .
faa's workforce of about 3,200 inspectors stationed at more than 100 field offices throughout the world is responsible for carrying out the agency's processes to certify , inspect , and enforce safety regulations for all aspects of the aviation industry , including the aircraft and its component parts , over 100 commercial airlines , about 5,000 aircraft repair stations , and hundreds of thousands of pilots and mechanics .
faa augments its inspector workforce with nearly 13,600 designated organizations and individuals ( designees ) that conduct the more routine aspects of industry oversight , such as administering tests to pilots and mechanics as part of their certification requirements , and augments the safety information that it obtains from inspections with industry partnership programs .
it is equally important to have a skilled , well - trained workforce to implement and monitor this safety oversight system .
evaluative processes and relevant data are particularly important as faa works to change its culture by incorporating a system safety approach into its oversight , and we have recommended that faa develop continuous evaluative processes for its oversight of non - legacy airlines , its designee programs , and its enforcement program , and systematically assess inspectors' technical training needs .
faa's enforcement program , which is an outgrowth of its inspection process , is intended to ensure industry compliance with safety regulations and is another important element of its safety oversight system .
furthermore , faa's ability to evaluate its programs is hindered by the lack of useful nationwide data .
faa has made training an integral part of its safety oversight system , but several actions could improve the results of its training efforts .
faa's aviation safety oversight system includes programs that focus on risk identification and mitigation through a system safety approach , the leveraging of resources , and enforcement of safety regulations , but the benefits of these programs are not being fully realized .
