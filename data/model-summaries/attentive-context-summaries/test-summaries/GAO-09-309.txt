develop appropriate mechanisms to collect and use feedback from grantees .
disseminate information to grantees about common implementation challenges and successful projects to leverage the investment that has been made across the programs .
beginning in 1965 , congress enacted several grant programs under the higher education act ( hea ) to strengthen and support developing postsecondary institutions .
with more than two - thirds of 2008 high school graduates estimated to enroll in college soon after graduating , higher education has become more accessible than ever before .
in this requested report , we address the following questions: ( 1 ) what are the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v , including the characteristics of students served ; ( 2 ) what challenges do grantees face , and how have they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges ; and ( 3 ) to what extent does the department of education monitor the financial and programmatic performance of title iii and v grantees , and use this information to target its technical assistance ? .
education has made progress in developing tools , such as an electronic monitoring system and risk - based criteria , to assess potential risks associated with title iii and v grants , but it lacks a comprehensive risk - based monitoring and technical assistance approach to target its efforts .
in an environment where education is called on to administer additional programs with limited resources , a coordinated approach to guide its efforts is critical to ensuring that grant funds are appropriately spent and the needs of grantees are met .
we reviewed title iii and v grants programs to determine ( 1 ) what are the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v , including the characteristics of students served , ( 2 ) what challenges do grantees face , and how have they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges , and ( 3 ) to what extent does the department of education ( education ) monitor the financial and programmatic performance of title iii and v grantees , and use this information to target its technical assistance .
in 2004 and 2007 , we reported on education's administration of title iii and v programs and found that it had made limited progress in implementing initiatives to enhance monitoring of and technical assistance for grantees .
because these institutions have limited resources , they may need additional assistance to successfully implement their grant projects .
education's role in monitoring and providing assistance to title iii and v grantees is critical to ensuring that the substantial investment the federal government makes in these programs leads to improvements in institutional capacity and student outcomes .
however , unless education develops an approach to systematically collect and use the feedback , it may miss opportunities to further improve its oversight efforts .
education has not fully implemented its planned monitoring initiatives and lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds , increasing the potential for fraud , waste , or abuse .
such an approach would also ensure that more information is shared among grantees about common implementation challenges and successful projects to better leverage the considerable federal investment , and ensure that grantees have an opportunity to provide feedback on areas for program improvement .
