our work focused on the initial implementation efforts of the following seven departments and the agencies within those departments that have the most developed competitive sourcing programs: agriculture ; defense ; education ; health and human services ( hhs ) ; the interior ; the treasury ; and veterans affairs ( va ) .
to complement efforts already underway that address funding and human capital challenges and to help agencies realize the potential benefits of competitive sourcing and ensure greater transparency and accountability , we recommend that the director of omb take the following three actions: ensure greater consistency in the classification of positions as commercial or inherently governmental when positions contain a mix of commercial and inherently governmental tasks by reviewing current guidance and developing additional guidelines , as necessary , for agencies and omb examiners ; work with agencies to ensure they are more strategic in their sourcing decisions and are identifying broader functional areas and / or enterprisewide activities , as appropriate , for possible public - private competition ; and require agencies to develop competition plans that focus on achieving measurable efficiency and performance improvement outcomes .
the environment in which the federal government currently operates — with new security threats , demographic changes , rapidly evolving technologies , increased pressure for results , and growing fiscal imbalances — demands that agencies engage in a fundamental review of how they accomplish their missions .
but the use of public - private competition represents a major management change for agencies and has raised concerns about the fairness of the process and the potential impact on federal jobs .
therefore , after discussions with your staff , we agreed to ( 1 ) describe the progress agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program in response to the president's management agenda , ( 2 ) identify major challenges agencies are facing , and ( 3 ) identify strategies they are using to select activities for competition based on mission - related needs .
agencies increasingly rely on a range of technical and support services to meet mission objectives .
these four themes are ( 1 ) clear , well - articulated , and compelling missions ; ( 2 ) strategic use of partnerships ; ( 3 ) a focus on the needs of clients and customers ; and ( 4 ) strategic management of people .
successful implementation of this initiative requires results - oriented goals and strategies ; clear criteria and analysis to support agency decisions ; and adequate resources .
it is important for agencies to decide how best to acquire and deliver such services , including whether to obtain services in - house or through private sources .
one way to inform this decision is to use competitive sourcing , a strategy under which agencies open the government's commercial activities to competition among public and private sector sources .
this initiative seeks to expand competition between the public and private sectors to encourage innovation , increase efficiency , and to improve performance .
omb needs to work with agencies to ensure their long - range plans are strategically focused .
omb will also review agency plans to understand how the agency has selected activities and their potential for savings and performance improvements .
