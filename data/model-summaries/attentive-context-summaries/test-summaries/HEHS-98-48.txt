va implemented two key management changes to support its health care reform efforts .
second , va began phasing in a new national resource allocation method , the veterans equitable resource allocation ( vera ) system as part of its broader efforts to provide incentives for the networks and medical centers to improve operational efficiency and access .
it also discusses va's monitoring of the health care that its networks are providing .
first , it decentralized the management structure of its veterans health administration ( vha ) to coordinate the organization of hospitals , outpatient clinics , and other facilities into 22 veterans integrated service networks ( visn ) .
va receives approximately $17 billion annually for delivering health care services to veterans .
in the mid - 1990s , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) began to fundamentally change the way it delivers health care to veterans to increase the efficiency of its health care system and to improve access to medical services .
va has testified before your subcommittee that these reform efforts have unleashed unprecedented changes in its health care system .
adequate monitoring of the outcomes of these changes is essential to assure va's stakeholders that veterans are receiving health care that is timely and appropriate .
lack of adequate performance information will hinder va headquarters' ability to take corrective action if networks' program changes are inconsistent with va's organizational goals .
va is making unprecedented changes to its health care system .
applying lessons learned from the private sector's experiences with managed health care , va began emphasizing certain managed care practices , such as primary , outpatient , and preventive care , and de - emphasizing practices such as inpatient care .
va expected that this reform , along with an emphasis on primary care , would also improve veterans' access to care because existing resources could then be redirected to serve more patients .
other data we reviewed show similar efficiency and access improvements throughout va's health care system .
we focused our work on va's efforts to improve the efficiency of its health care system and improve veterans' access to health services .
va expected the visns to improve efficiency by reducing unnecessarily duplicative services and shifting services from costly inpatient care to less costly outpatient care .
this report , which expands upon preliminary information in our may 1997 statement for the record for a hearing held by your subcommittee , discusses examples of the efficiencies achieved and improvements in veterans' access to health care .
the transformation of the va health care system , however , is a work in progress .
as a result , va has achieved efficiencies by reducing personnel costs .
like other federal health programs , such as medicare and medicaid , that are adopting managed care practices to control program expenditures , va recognized that it could improve its health care system by adopting selected managed care practices .
networks and medical centers are rapidly introducing new approaches to delivering care and planning the introduction of other initiatives .
special care services , which include the most expensive services va delivers ( for example , nursing home care or care for veterans with spinal cord injuries ) , are especially important to monitor because the population receiving these services is particularly vulnerable .
