one of the majority's prerogatives is writing the house's rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber's rules on the day the new house convenes .
it is a feature of the house , but not of the senate , that it must adopt rules at the convening of each congress .
although each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous congress , each new house also adopts changes to those rules .
in the 1994 general election , republicans won a majority of seats in the house for the first time since the 83 rd congress ( 1953-1955 ) .
it elects its speaker , chairs its committees , holds majorities on its committees , selects its officers , and manages its legislative agenda .
the first purpose of the report is to identify the sources of the broad rewriting of house rules in the 104 th congress and additional changes in subsequent congresses .
the second part of the report organizes rules changes affecting committees and the house floor topically and changes affecting budgetary legislation , house administration , and ethics by congress , and briefly explains the changes in layman's terms .
it is also a feature of the house that it relies heavily on its formal rules , and formal means of temporarily changing them , rather than on the informal , ad hoc procedures so often used in the senate .
the changes made by the republican majority in the 104 th congress rules resolution and in subsequent rules resolutions adopted by republican majorities through the 109 th congress addressed nearly every aspect of the legislative process , budget process , committee organization , administrative operations , and ethical standards .
among the many subjects that the rules may cover , these changes can strengthen the ability of the majority to control the legislative process and the legislative agenda , and they can bestow rights on the minority party , minority interests , and individual members .
democratic caucus and republican conference rules and decisions also had an impact on how specific house rules ( such as rules on suspension of the rules and on committee assignment limits ) were implemented .
in drafting rules for the 104 th and subsequent congresses and in other exercises of the house's rulemaking authority , republicans could draw on their experience and on a variety of partisan and bipartisan plans and proposals .
republicans built their critique of democratic management of the house over many years .
the first part analyzes the sources of republican rules changes .
for each rule , it also contains the house parliamentarian's notes describing changes to the rule ( or its specific clauses ) and decisions of presiding officers and the house based upon the rule .
this report has two principal parts reflecting its two principal purposes .
this volume , printed in each congress to reflect adoption of a rules resolution , contains the current provisions of house rules .
these changes were included in the rules resolutions adopted at the beginning of the 104 th through 109 th congresses , special orders adopted in conjunction with the rules resolutions , and speakers' policy announcements made at the convening of each of these congresses .
