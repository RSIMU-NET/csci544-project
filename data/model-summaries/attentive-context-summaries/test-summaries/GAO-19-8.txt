education and the department of justice ( justice ) promote equitable access to education resources as part of their missions in two key ways: ( 1 ) conducting investigations of discrimination complaints ; ( 2 ) issuing guidance on ways to address potential disparities ; and ( 3 ) providing technical assistance .
however , the low rates of degree attainment for low - income students raises questions about whether the students who wish to pursue higher education have access to courses that support their admission to college .
to determine the extent to which schools offer courses to prepare students academically for college , we analyzed u.s. department of education ( education ) data on course offerings , among other things , on the nation's public schools .
you asked us to review the spectrum of college preparatory course offerings available in high - poverty schools and challenges students in these schools face preparing for college .
students from low - income families earn bachelor's degrees at rates that are significantly lower than their more affluent peers .
college initiatives to improve access and retention .
this is concerning because higher levels of education are associated with higher lifetime earnings , and a bachelor's degree , in particular , can be a powerful tool for lifting individuals out of poverty .
specifically , we analyzed data from education's school year 2015-16 , the most recent available , civil rights data collection ( crdc ) , which collects data on course offerings in schools , among other things , such as characteristics of students attending schools ( e.g. , race , sex , disability ) , school type ( e.g. , traditional , charter ) , and school size .
similarly , another study found that adults with a bachelor's degree or higher are more likely to report that they are at least doing okay financially than those with a high school degree or less .
specifically , living in poverty is linked with negative conditions for children at home , in schools , and in neighborhoods and communities , and can include substandard housing , homelessness , inadequate nutrition and food insecurity , inadequate home - based child care , increased health care costs , and unsafe neighborhoods .
poverty can adversely affect academic and other outcomes in profound ways .
not all students are interested in pursuing a 4-year college degree .
california state university ( csu ) â€“ los angeles , as well as other csu campuses , has a program to help improve access and retention of low - income and educationally disadvantaged students .
one study found that among individuals who started out in the lowest 20 percent income group , those earning a college degree were over four times more likely to move to the highest income group than those who did not finish college .
