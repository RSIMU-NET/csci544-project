during the first session of the 115th congress , congress faced numerous international trade and finance policy issues .
also significant are administration initiatives to potentially revise the two largest existing u.s. ftas , through the ongoing renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , and modification talks regarding the u.s. - south korea ( korus ) fta .
a major focus was examining and responding to the trump administration's evolving trade policy .
in engaging on these issues , congress may conduct oversight of the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , and potentially consider implementing legislation for a revised nafta , and oversight of modification of the korus fta ; consider new bilateral trade agreement negotiations , including with the uk or japan ; examine the status of trade negotiations launched under the previous administration , including the potential transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) with the european union ( eu ) , a potential plurilateral trade in services agreement ( tisa ) , and ongoing discussions at the wto , as well as the future implications of the tpp without u.s. participation ; conduct oversight and take possible legislative action concerning a range of other trade issues , including u.s. trade relations with china and other major economies , as well as u.s. export and import policies and programs ; and monitor developments in capital flows and global debt levels , the international financial institutions and u.s. funding levels , the evolution of the aiib , and other countries' exchange rate policies , among other international finance issues .
members of congress exert significant influence over the course of u.s. trade policy and its implementation through their legislative , appropriations , and oversight roles .
in particular , the administration has displayed a more critical view of u.s. trade agreements , made greater use of various u.s. trade laws with the potential to restrict u.s. imports , and placed increased emphasis on bilateral trade balances as a key metric of the health of u.s. trading relationships .
continued focus on the u.s. - china economic relationship , and economic sanctions against iran , cuba , north korea , russia , and other countries also have been of interest to congress .
these decisions , in addition to the evolving global landscape on trade agreements , including a recently - concluded , revised tpp ( now called the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans - pacific partnership ( cptpp ) ) among the 11 parties , without the united states , raise potentially significant legislative and policy issues for congress , including: ( 1 ) potential congressional consideration of legislation to implement a revised nafta , ( 2 ) the economic and strategic rationale for u.s. participation in multi - party and other ftas , ( 3 ) the extent to which past u.s. ftas should be modernized or revised and , if so , in what manner , ( 4 ) how much priority should be placed in u.s. trade policy on new fta and multilateral trade agreements , and ( 5 ) the effect of ftas not including the united states on u.s. economic and broader interests , and the appropriate u.s. response to the proliferation of agreements .
