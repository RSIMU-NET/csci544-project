the objectives of our report were to ( 1 ) describe the characteristics of financial institutions that received funding under the capital purchase program ( cpp ) , and ( 2 ) assess how the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , with the assistance of federal bank regulators , implemented cpp .
its objectives are to ( 1 ) describe the characteristics of financial institutions that received cpp funding , and ( 2 ) assess how treasury , with the assistance of federal bank regulators , implemented cpp .
as part of its consultation with regulators on their decisions to allow institutions to repay their cpp investments to treasury , and to improve monitoring of these decisions , we recommend that the secretary of the treasury direct ofs to periodically collect and review certain information from the bank regulators on the analysis and conclusions supporting their decisions on cpp repayment requests and provide feedback for the regulators' consideration on the extent to which regulators are evaluating similar institutions consistently .
from october 2008 through december 2009 , the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) invested over $200 billion in over 700 financial institutions as part of government efforts to stabilize u.s. financial markets and the economy .
these investments were made through the capital purchase program ( cpp ) , which was the initial and largest initiative under the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) .
reviews of regulators' approval recommendations helped ensure consistent evaluations and mitigate risk from treasury's limited guidance for assessing applicants' viability .
although regulators said that they consider similar factors when evaluating cpp firms' repayment requests , without collecting information on how and why regulators made their decisions , treasury cannot verify the degree to which regulators' decisions on requests to exit cpp actually were based on such factors .
the program was closed to new investments on december 31 , 2009 , after treasury had invested a total of $205 billion in 707 financial institutions over the life of the program .
we also recommend that the program office evaluate the information to identify trends or patterns that may indicate whether similar applicants were treated inconsistently across different regulators and take action , if necessary , to help ensure a more consistent treatment .
since then , treasury has continued to oversee its investments and collect dividend and interest payments .
institutions designated as problem banks have financial , operational , or managerial weaknesses that threaten their continued viability and include firms with either a 4 or 5 composite rating .
the regulators provided treasury's office of financial stability ( ofs ) with recommendations approving or denying applications .
some participants have repurchased their preferred shares or subordinated debt and left the program with the approval of their primary bank regulators .
institutions were evaluated to determine their long - term strength and viability , and weaker institutions were encouraged by their regulators to withdraw their applications .
treasury has not established mechanisms to monitor , review , or coordinate regulators' decisions on repayment requests because , in its view , it lacks the authority to do so and is limited to carrying out regulators' decisions regarding the institution making the request .
