 ( recommendation 2 ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of fra should work with railroads to engage state and local governments to ( a ) identify community - specific impacts of train operations , including longer trains , where streets and highways cross railroad rights - of - way and ( b ) develop potential solutions to reduce those impacts .
we are making the following two recommendations to fra: the administrator of fra should develop a strategy for sharing fra's research results with internal and external stakeholders and implement that strategy for its research on the safety impacts of very long trains .
the nation's freight railroad network is vital to the functioning of the economy .
in 2017 , the united states' freight rail system moved over 1.5- billion tons of goods across the country , including hazardous materials , bulk goods such as grain and coal , and consumer goods .
this report examines what is known about changes in freight train length over time , views of selected stakeholders on safety considerations for operating longer trains and the potential impact of these trains on communities , and the extent to which fra is assessing any safety risks of operating longer trains .
while freight - rail traffic has grown following the 2008 recession , train accidents have declined , according to the federal railroad administration's ( fra ) data , with train accidents per million - train - miles decreasing by about 14 percent between 2008 and 2017 .
as fra has stated , it expects that future growth in rail and highway traffic will increase incidences of blocked crossings and the risk of grade - crossing incidents .
fra does not have any other documented policies in place for how it will use or disseminate the results of its study .
without examining the potential impacts of longer trains on local communities , including on blocked grade crossings , fra may lose an opportunity to identify what , if any , additional actions should be taken to ensure the safety of longer trains and the communities through which they travel .
fra , however , is uniquely positioned to assess whether these concerns have merit .
as traffic continues to grow — including railroads' potential increased use of longer trains — having better information could be useful to fra and other stakeholders .
in recent years , railroad workers and communities have expressed concerns regarding the safety of railroads operating longer freight trains , some of which are nearly 3 miles long .
some recent accidents involving longer freight trains are under investigation by fra , the federal rail - safety - regulating agency , and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) , an independent federal agency that investigates serious transportation accidents , including those involving rail .
as these issues continue to evolve and fra works to identify locations where blocked crossings are reported , working with railroads and local communities to identify any potential impacts of longer trains on grade crossings would help fra to determine whether and how longer trains are affecting these communities and what could be done to address those impacts .
five of the seven railroads provided data on average train - length in feet over time ; however , only two railroads provided data for a period of at least 10 years .
