our testimony is based on our prior work and a review that we have underway for this subcommittee and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) airport access controls , ( 2 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , and ( 3 ) alternatives to current screening practices , including practices in selected other countries .
billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation .
faa's efforts to address these problems have been slow .
although it is not fully known at this time what actually occurred or which of the weaknesses in the nation's aviation security apparatus contributed to the horrendous events of last week , it is clear that serious weaknesses exist in our aviation security system and that their impact can be far more devastating than previously imagined .
faa is addressing these recommendations , but progress on one key effort — the certification of screening companies — is still not complete because the implementing regulation has not been issued .
we recommended that faa develop an integrated plan to focus its efforts , set priorities , and measure progress in improving screening .
we are here today to discuss the vulnerabilities that we have identified in the safeguards to protect passengers and prevent unauthorized access to or attacks on aircraft .
it is now nearly 2 ½ years since faa originally planned to implement the regulation .
weaknesses in the current system in which airlines are responsible for screening passengers and controlling access to secure areas have raised questions about whether alternative approaches should be considered .
controls for limiting access to secure areas , including aircraft , have not always worked as intended .
the department of transportation's inspector general has also documented numerous problems with airport access controls , and in one series of tests , the inspector general's staff successfully gained access to secure areas 68 percent of the time .
a principal cause of screeners' performance problems is the rapid turnover among screeners .
in work that we have under way for the subcommittee , we surveyed aviation stakeholders and aviation and terrorism experts and have identified four options for assigning screening responsibilities: continue with air carriers but with new requirements , assign responsibility to airports , or shift responsibility to the federal government , either through the creation of a new federal agency or the creation of a federal corporation .
the future of aviation security hinges in large part on overcoming this cycle of limited action that has too often characterized the response to aviation security concerns .
additionally , too little attention has been given to factors such as the sufficiency of the training given to screeners .
as we reported in may 2000 , our special agents used counterfeit law enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas at two airports , bypassing security checkpoints and walking unescorted to aircraft departure gates .
last week , faa and the air carriers implemented new controls that promise a greater sense of security .
yet , to further minimize the vulnerabilities in our aviation security system , more needs to be done .
