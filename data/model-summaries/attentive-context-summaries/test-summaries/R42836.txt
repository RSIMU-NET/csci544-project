various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country .
for example , new applications of energy extraction technologies have increased oil and gas production from shale formations in various regions of the united states .
it examines the relevant constitutional and statutory authority of the corps to operate federal water projects , including the water supply act of 1958 ( wsa ) and the flood control act of 1944 ( 1944 fca ) .
in particular , the demand for water supply to develop energy in the northern plains states has raised controversy over water use in the missouri river basin .
this dual exercise of authority over water resources has led to questions over the corps' proposed actions at its missouri river reservoirs .
although the federal government has fairly broad authority related to water resources management , water allocation has traditionally been a matter left to the states , which administer their own water rights systems .
it also analyzes state authority over water within state boundaries and discusses the relationship between federal and state authority , including examples of congressional actions that have addressed competing federal and state roles regarding water resources .
access to water for energy development purposes has created tension between federal and state interests when stakeholders seek access to freshwater from federal water projects .
the corps has broad constitutional authority for its water projects .
although the federal government has broad authority to regulate water , it historically has deferred to the states' authority regarding allocation of water resources within each state .
thus , a state's authority over its waters is "subject to the power of congress to control the waters for the purpose of commerce. .
accordingly , if congress authorizes the corps to impound water at one of its projects for purposes related to commerce , the federal authority over the water supersedes the state's authority for those purposes .
in recent years , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , which controls lake sakakawea and five other mainstem missouri river reservoirs , has identified surplus water in these reservoirs and considered how it would contract with industrial and municipal users interested in the temporary use of this water .
one method of extraction , known as hydraulic fracturing , typically injects a pressurized freshwater - based liquid mixture into wells to fracture shale formations containing the oil or gas .
on one hand , the corps' constitutional authority to manage its projects for a variety of authorized purposes is broad ; it has been delegated authority from congress to store water for m&i purposes ; and it has been authorized to charge for surplus water stored at the project .
the supreme court historically has held that the corps' authority derives from the commerce clause and the significant interest in promoting navigation throughout the nation's waterways .
this issue has been of particular interest at lake sakakawea , a reservoir created by the federal garrison dam along the missouri river in north dakota .
on the other hand , it may also be argued that the corps' constitutional authority over water stored at its projects extends only to the amount of water necessary to meet the purposes of that project and not to any surplus water .
