we examined the relationship between the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) and joint commission resources , inc. ( jcr ) as it relates to the independence of the joint commissions' hospital accreditation process from jcr's hospital consulting services .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the federal agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers medicare , has established conditions of participation that hospitals must meet to be eligible to participate in the medicare program .
in addition , even with appropriate policies and procedures in place , it will take ongoing monitoring and a concerted effort on the part of the leadership of both organizations to ensure that these policies and procedures are appropriately implemented by both their board and staff members .
in order to be eligible to receive payments from medicare — the federal program that provides health care benefits to over 42 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries — hospitals must meet certain criteria established by federal law .
any threat to the independence of the accreditation process could undermine its ability to ensure the safety and quality of services provided to medicare beneficiaries and the general public .
the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) , a nonprofit corporation , has developed its own accreditation standards that are intended to meet or exceed medicare's conditions of participation .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) how the joint commission and jcr are related to one another through their governance structure and operations , and ( 2 ) the significant steps both organizations have taken to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , obtained through their hospital accreditation and consulting activities , since the creation of jcr .
to provide information on the governance structure and operations of the two organizations , we reviewed multiple documents , including organizational charts reflecting the organizations' structure as of 2006 , a service agreement signed in 2001 and still in effect as of 2006 , internal revenue service tax documents from calendar years 2001 through 2004 , and agendas and minutes from board meetings of both organizations from 2003 through september 2006 .
however , the majority of these mechanisms , including the firewall and firewall - related policies , the compliance hotline , and the annual external review of the firewall , have either been developed or significantly revised within the past few years — primarily since 2003 .
the joint commission and jcr have taken steps to protect the joint commission's accreditation process from influence by jcr's consulting services by developing mechanisms to protect against the improper sharing of facility - specific information .
it indicated that the report accurately reflects its relationship with jcr , and emphasized that its highest priority is to preserve the integrity of the joint commission's accreditation process .
when developing policies regarding its relationship with jcr , the joint commission has been affected by the increased focus in both the public and private sectors on governance issues .
the next step is for management of both organizations to assure that these mechanisms are sufficient to protect the integrity of the accreditation process .
