this work has indicated that improved compliance with the bank secrecy act of 1970 ( bsa ) by financial institutions has forced many money launderers to find other means of disguising their illicit proceeds .
the subcommittee has been reviewing new trends in money laundering activities as well as the government's ability to confront them .
there have been both new legislation and recent changes to existing federal regulations that will affect currency transaction reporting for casinos .
in response to your request , we are reporting on the extent of legalized gaming in the united states , especially that taking place in casinos ; currency transaction reporting requirements for casinos ; whether the same reporting requirements apply to tribal casinos ; and the level of enforcement efforts to ensure that casinos are complying with currency transaction reporting requirements .
in your request letter , you expressed concern about the use of the nation's growing gaming industry to launder illicit profits .
the report also makes a recommendation to the secretary of the treasury regarding efforts to deter money laundering in casinos .
we have included information on these changes in this report .
our initial objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the extent of legalized gaming in the united states , ( 2 ) the currency transaction reporting requirements for casinos , ( 3 ) the currency transaction reporting requirements for tribal casinos , and ( 4 ) the level of enforcement efforts to ensure that casinos are complying with currency transaction reporting requirements .
as agreed with the subcommittee , our focus was on casinos with gagrs over $1 million .
law enforcement officials have estimated that between $100 billion and $300 billion in u.s. currency is laundered each year .
the new bsa regulations that require casinos to take a more active role in ensuring their own compliance with bsa , as well as other money laundering prevention strategies such as nevada's prohibited transactions , could be positive steps toward compliance given the limited irs resources for compliance reviews .
money laundering is the use or conversion of money gained from illegal activity , such as drug smuggling , as or to money that appears legitimate and whose source cannot be traced to the illegal activity .
to determine recent changes in federal regulations and legislation , we reviewed the money laundering suppression act of 1994 and recent amendments to bsa regulations ; in addition , we confirmed that treasury and nevada officials continue to have ongoing discussions regarding the differences between bsa and nevada's regulations .
to determine the extent of legalized gaming in the united states , we reviewed testimony , reports , and articles concerning the gaming industry , including its extent and growth .
to determine the currency transaction reporting requirements for casinos , including tribal casinos , we reviewed bsa , the bsa implementing regulations under 31 c.f.r .
transaction information filed by tribal casinos is generally not accessible to law enforcement because it is reported on transaction forms that record income tax information and thus are currently subject to disclosure restrictions .
irs' examination division is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with bsa reporting and recordkeeping requirements for all financial institutions under its jurisdiction , commonly referred to as “non - bank financial institutions.” this monitoring includes conducting periodic compliance reviews at over 100,000 nonbank financial institutions , including casinos .
