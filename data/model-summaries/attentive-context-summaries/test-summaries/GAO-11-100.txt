the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a separately organized agency within the department of energy ( doe ) , is working to re - establish the country's capability to produce tritium â€” a key radioactive isotope used to enhance the power of nuclear warheads and bombs .
nnsa also stated that adjustments to its budget requests and refinements to its acquisition strategy will continue as part of its efforts to accommodate changes to the nuclear weapons stockpile .
we are encouraged by nnsa's pledge to adjust its budget requests in response to changes in program needs and by other actions nnsa is taking to reduce its unexpended funding balances .
tva noted that it has been and continues to be dedicated to working with nnsa in evaluating and deciding among alternative approaches to help better assure that future tritium production will be a the necessary levels .
however , as our draft report notes , unexpended funding balances in excess of doe's threshold for unexpended funds increased every year since fiscal year 2006 with the exception of fiscal year 2009 and nnsa estimates the program will exceed doe's threshold by approximately $50 million by the end of fiscal year 2010 .
in our view , these increases in unexpended funding call into question the effectiveness of nnsa's monitoring of the program's financial management .
ensure nnsa's future budget requests account for the large unexpended balances in the tritium readiness program and better reflect the amount of funding the program is able to spend annually .
nnsa's inability to overcome the technical challenges and meet its original tritium production goals has raised serious questions about the agency's ability to provide a reliable source of tritium to maintain the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile in the future .
we also reviewed nnsa's strategic plans for the tritium readiness program , including program execution and implementation plans ; past and planned schedules for completing tpbar fabrication , transportation , irradiation , and extraction activities ; and the program's risk management plan .
nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium are established jointly by the department of defense ( dod ) and nnsa .
since that time , as the united states decreased the size of its nuclear arsenal , nnsa has been able to meet its tritium requirements by harvesting and recycling it from dismantled nuclear warheads .
this alternatives analysis should be coordinated closely with dod and take into account current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium .
however , because of tritium's short half - life , nnsa cannot meet its tritium needs in this manner indefinitely and is attempting to re - establish new tritium production .
in this context , in response to your request that we review the tritium readiness program , we ( 1 ) determined the extent to which nnsa has been able to overcome technical challenges producing tritium , ( 2 ) determined the extent to which nnsa is able to meet current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , and ( 3 ) assessed the management of nnsa's tritium readiness program .
because tritium has a relatively short half - life of 12 years and therefore decays at a rate of about 5.5 percent per year , tritium in existing weapons must be periodically replenished , and an assured source of tritium is necessary to maintain the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile .
