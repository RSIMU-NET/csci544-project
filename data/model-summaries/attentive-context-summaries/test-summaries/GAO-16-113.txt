the objectives of this review were to examine the extent to which: ( 1 ) sba enforces its regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source 8 ( a ) contracts to subsidiaries of the same anc ; ( 2 ) sba limits subsidiaries of the same anc from operating in the same primary line of business ; ( 3 ) information is known about compensation , revenues , and benefits distribution of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) sba has addressed challenges , if any , to its oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firm participating in the 8 ( a ) program since 2011 .
the 8 ( a ) business development program ( 8 program ) , administered by the small business administration ( sba ) , is one of the federal government's primary vehicles for developing socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses , including those firms owned by alaska native corporations ( anc. ) .
this report discusses the extent to which: ( 1 ) sba enforces its regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source 8 ( a ) contracts to subsidiaries of the same anc ; ( 2 ) sba limits subsidiaries of the same anc from operating in the same primary line of business ; ( 3 ) information is known about compensation , revenues , and benefits distribution of anc - owned firms ; and ( 4 ) sba has addressed challenges , if any , to its oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 ( a ) program since 2011 .
one of the key benefits of the program is the ability of participants to receive federal contract awards set aside solely for 8 ( a ) firms .
overall , sba has struggled to articulate and execute its oversight strategy over 5 years after updating its regulations .
government agencies obligated about $17 billion to just under 5,600 firms participating in sba's 8 ( a ) program in fiscal year 2014 .
for fiscal year 2014 , federal obligations under the program totaled about $4 billion for 344 8 ( a ) anc - owned firms and represented almost a quarter of all 8 ( a ) obligations made that year .
for instance , we found that its lack of updated program guidance on the 2011 regulations and limitations in information systems affected the agency's ability to execute proper oversight of internal controls for implementing the 8 ( a ) program for anc - owned firms .
moreover , without additional actions to ( 1 ) develop an effective and comprehensive internal control framework , such as ensuring that its alaska district office has complete and consistent documentation on firms in the program , ( 2 ) design policies to effectively enforce the separation of duties and supervisory or administrator approval when reviewing anc - owned firms' progress and related documentation at this office , ( 3 ) approach staffing of its alaska district office in a comprehensive way ; and ( 4 ) launch the proposed continuing eligibility review unit with the policies and procedures that include specific tasks and milestones , there is limited assurance that sba can achieve the objectives of the program and at the same time maintain a high level of oversight and accountability to help ensure overall program integrity .
