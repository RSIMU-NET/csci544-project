the objectives for this review were to examine ( 1 ) trends in the department of defense's ( dod ) use of noncompetitive awards ; ( 2 ) factors influencing dod's competition rate ; ( 3 ) the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive procedures provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards ; and ( 4 ) the impact of dod's new requirement on contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one offer was received .
to better inform dod's efforts to enhance competition , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following three actions: identify and track the specific factors that affect the competition rate , such as foreign military sales , and consider this information when setting annual competition goals for each dod component ; develop guidance that could enable dod components to apply lessons learned from past procurements to increase competition for the same good and services in the future ; and develop an action plan for dod components to collect reliable data on competitive procurements for which only one offer is received , so that the department can determine the effect of its new requirement on one - offer contracts .
accordingly , we examined ( 1 ) the trends in dod's use of noncompetitive awards ; ( 2 ) the factors affecting dod's competition rate ; ( 3 ) the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive procedures provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards ; and ( 4 ) the impact of dod's new requirement on contracts awarded using competitive procedures but for which only one - offer was received .
in fiscal year 2012 , the department of defense ( dod ) obligated $359 billion through contracts and task orders , of which 57 percent was competed .
lastly , due to unreliable data in fpds - ng , dod's ability to measure the effectiveness of its new one - offer requirement is limited .
without knowing its impact , dod risks continued investment in a requirement that may not address the most significant factors leading to one - offer awards .
the benefits of competition in acquiring goods and services from the private sector are well established .
to identify trends in dod's use of noncompetitive awards , we used the federal procurement data system - next generation ( fpds - ng ) to identify dod obligations under competitive and noncompetitive contracts in fiscal years 2008 through 2012 .
competitive contracts can help save taxpayer money , conserve scarce resources , improve contractor performance , curb fraud , and promote accountability for results .
recognizing the need to make more efficient use of resources , dod's 2010 “better buying power” initiative placed an emphasis on maximizing opportunities for competition in the acquisition of products and services .
dod described actions it plans to take the address the recommendations .
while federal statute and acquisition regulations generally require that contracts be awarded on the basis of full and open competition , they also permit federal agencies to award noncompetitive contracts in certain circumstances , for example , when only one vendor can supply the requirements or when a sole - source award is made under specified small business programs .
