following the creationof the intelligence oversight committees in the senate ( 1976 ) and in the house ( 1977 ) , congressconsidered charter legislation that included , among other proposals , one that would have created theposition of an nid to manage the ic .
there have been a variety of proposals concerning the nid ( 4 ) position .
boren and mccurdy failed to win adoption of their legislation in the face ofopposition by the department of defense ( dod ) and the congressional armed services committees .
their legislation also would have created a separatedirector of cia .
confronted by strong opposition to the overall legislation , which also included language governingcovert actions , the committees did not report the respective bills .
in 1992 , senator david boren and representative david mccurdy , respective chairmen of the senate select committee on intelligence ( ssci ) and house permanent select committee onintelligence ( hpsci ) , introduced legislation creating the nid position and giving the position theauthority to program and reprogram funds .
in december 2002 , the congressional joint inquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ( 5 ) , recommended that a new cabinetlevel senate - confirmed nid position be established , and that a separate director be named to managethe cia .
 ( 14 ) from the prospective of proponents , failure to establish an empowered nid with hiring , firing and budget authority will leave the ic with divided management of intelligence capabilities ; lack ofcommon standards and practices across the foreign - domestic intelligence divide ; structural barriersthat undermine the performance of joint intelligence work ; and a weak capacity to set priorities andmove resources .
some critics have voiced concern about the 9 / 11 commission's recommendations to locate the office of the nid in the executive office of the president .
 ( 20 ) they also expressconcern that congress will experience greater difficulty in conducting oversight of the ic becausethe proximity of the nid to the white house will more frequently raise the issue of executiveprivilege .
 ( 13 ) some proponents add what theycharacterize as a third essential authority - - the powerto set standards for the ic's information infrastructure and personnel .
 ( 6 ) .
a presidentially selected deputy would have managed the cia .
 ( 12 ) they also argue that an nid must be empowered with two authorities the dci now lacks: the authority to hire and remove ic agency heads in consultation with the defense secretary ( currently,the secretary of defense selects principal ic agency heads for the three combat support agencies - - nsa , nro , and nga - - with the concurrence of the dci ) ; and the authority to move funding andpersonnel within or across ic agencies at any time during the year of execution with congressionalapproval .
some critics contend that the 9 / 11 commission's concept of the ndi would shift too much influence over the ic to the defense department , because dod would retain most of its roles underthe commission's proposal and , they say , stand to gain influence .
they argue the ic's three largest agencies - - nsa , nro and nga - - are combat support agencies that collect and disseminate intelligence affecting tactical militaryoperations .
