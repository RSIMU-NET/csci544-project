in july 1997 , we reported on operational and safety trends in the rail industry over the past 20 years and how the federal railroad administration ( fra ) has revised its rail safety program to address these trends .
the increased concentration of larger railroads , as well as the service problems occurring in the western half of the united states , have heightened concern about the safety of freight railroads .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on rail safety as the subcommittee considers legislation to reauthorize rail safety programs .
currently , there are 10 class i railroads — the nation's largest railroads — amtrak and 9 freight railroads .
in summary , we found the following: the railroad industry has changed significantly since the staggers rail act of 1980 made it federal policy that railroads would rely , where possible , on competition and the demand for services rather than on regulation to establish reasonable rates .
these larger railroads have cut costs , increased the tonnage their trains carry , downsized their workforce , and eliminated , sold , or abandoned thousands of miles of unprofitable or little - used track .
rather than continuing to use violations and civil penalties as the primary means to obtain compliance with railroad safety regulations , fra decided to emphasize cooperative partnerships with other federal agencies , railroad management , labor unions , and the states .
because of data limitations , our report provided information on safety trends for the entire railroad industry — not just the largest railroads — and operational trends for class i freight railroads .
fra instituted an important shift in its safety program in 1993 to address safety problems in the rail industry .
while 1996 and preliminary 1997 data , the latest data available , show improvements in safety , it is too early to determine if fra's new approach will sustain a long - term decline in accidents and fatalities .
in addition , fra's new partnering efforts do not systematically respond to concerns about the level of workplace injuries for railroad employees and about the safety of railroad bridges .
from 1976 to 1998 , mergers and acquisitions have significantly reduced the number of class i freight railroads .
the partnering efforts generally focus on the nation's larger railroads and have resulted in fra inspectors' conducting fewer site - specific inspections of the railroad industry overall .
during this same period , overall railroad safety has improved .
despite this progress , each year about 1,000 people die as a result of grade - crossing accidents and trespassing , at least 9,000 railroad employees are injured , and thousands of people are evacuated from their homes because of hazardous materials released during train accidents .
reported accident and fatality rates are down 75 and 36 percent , respectively , from 1976 levels .
efforts to reduce injuries to workers must rely on the combined efforts of fra and the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) .
fra's efforts to increase cooperation with the railroad industry add new responsibilities for its 270 inspectors .
to successfully implement the plan , fra is working with other federal agencies , the states , and the railroads to strengthen education and research activities ; enhance federal , state , and local enforcement efforts ; and increase or preserve federal rail - highway crossing safety funds .
