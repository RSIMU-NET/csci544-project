direct the secretaries of the air force and the navy to ensure that their respective lead project officers have the technical and managerial expertise and resources to review nnsa's progress and technical challenges throughout the life extension program .
nuclear weapons are an essential part of the nation's defense strategy .
nuclear weapons are an essential part of the nation's defense strategy .
to implement this strategy , in january 1996 , the department of energy ( doe ) initiated the strategy , in january 1996 , the department of energy ( doe ) initiated the stockpile life extension program ( life extension program ) .
dod partially agreed with our recommendations .
however , it is too early to assess the impact these actions have had on the air force's oversight of the life extension program .
now stockpile life extension program ( life extension program ) .
dod agreed with our two recommendations directed at the department , but asked us to make modifications to the language of the recommendations to better target the responsible service or agency that has authority to implement them .
to improve dod's oversight over nnsa's life extension activities and ensure that refurbished weapons meet all military requirements , we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following three actions: direct stratcom and the secretary of the responsible service to comprehensively review military requirements for a weapons system prior to entering phase 6.2a of a life extension program .
to improve the management of the stockpile life extension program , we recommend that the administrator of nnsa direct the deputy administrator for defense programs to take the following six actions: develop a realistic schedule for the w76 warhead and future life extension programs that allows nnsa to ( 1 ) address technical challenges while meeting all military requirements and ( 2 ) build in time for unexpected technical challenges that may delay the program .
nnsa also coordinates its life extension activities with the department of defense ( dod ) to ensure that refurbished weapons meet all military performance requirements .
all of these management issues raise significant questions about nnsa's ability not only to complete life extension programs on time and on budget that meet all refurbishment objectives , but also its ability to manage the design and production of new weapons , such as the proposed reliable replacement warhead .
in addition , nnsa's failure to implement its risk mitigation strategy for the highest risk to the program and implement lessons learned from prior life extensions , like the w87 warhead , does not inspire confidence in its ability to achieve the program's goals on time and on budget .
to address dod concerns , in december 2007 , nnsa agreed to conduct additional tests .
second , nnsa will include funding needs for risk mitigation activities that address the highest risks to future life extension programs in budget reports to congress .
to implement this the existing nuclear weapons stockpile indefinitely .
we modified our recommendations by ( 1 ) including the department of the navy because it is responsible for reviewing nnsa's refurbishment activities for certain nuclear weapons , such as the w76 , and ( 2 ) specifying during which phase of the phase 6.x process dod should comprehensively review its military requirements and assess the cost and schedule implications for meeting each military requirement .
