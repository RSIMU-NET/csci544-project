the department of state ( state ) assessed more than 8,500 foreign service personnel performance files for the 2012 promotion process .
to improve and better document state's compliance with key safeguards governing the foreign service promotion process , we recommend that the secretary of state instruct the director general of the foreign service and director of the human resources office of performance evaluation to take steps to ensure that selection board , performance standards board , and reconstituted board reports are complete and fully document compliance with internal controls , including but not limited to signed oaths and recusal memos .
for example , more than half of the 41 boards made observations and recommendations concerning the following: completeness , accuracy , or accessibility of the official performance folder ; promotion criteria , policies , or related practices ; and technological issues affecting board operations .
nonetheless , the oig identified areas of concern and made recommendations to strengthen the process , which state agreed to implement .
subsequent to previous allegations of improprieties in the process , state's office of inspector general ( oig ) reviewed state's foreign service promotion process and concluded , in march 2010 , that it was fundamentally fair and trustworthy .
state concurred with our recommendation to ensure board reports are complete and fully documented .
to review state's process for ranking and promoting foreign service personnel , we reviewed relevant laws , regulations , and procedures governing state's promotion and grievance processes , and interviewed officials from state's bureau of human resources ( hr ) .
to examine the procedural changes state has made to its foreign service promotion process , we reviewed concerns identified by the oig and state's foreign service grievance board and whether they had been addressed .
in addition , more than a third of the 41 boards made observations and recommendations concerning the following: uncertainty over how to interpret some performance appraisal information ; and sufficiency or quality of promotion process guidance and training .
this report addresses actions taken by state since march 2010 to help ensure the foreign service promotion process operates with fairness and integrity .
to learn about state's procedural changes developed in response to the oig's recommendations , we reviewed state and oig documents showing actions taken by state to comply with the oig's recommendations .
