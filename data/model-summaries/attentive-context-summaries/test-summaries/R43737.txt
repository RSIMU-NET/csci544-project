under federal law , states and leas are required to provide all children with equal access to a public elementary and secondary education , regardless of their immigration status .
while much of the congressional interest initially focused directly on immigration policy , the implications for other areas , including education , are now arising as well .
upon arrival in the united states , unaccompanied alien children generally are initially served through programs operated by the department of health and human services' ( hhs's ) office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) .
rather , the first part of this report includes a discussion of three federal elementary and secondary education programs administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) : ( 1 ) title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , ( 2 ) english language acquisition grants ( title iii - a ) authorized by the esea , and ( 3 ) part b grants to states authorized by the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) with an emphasis on how these programs could currently serve unaccompanied alien children or possibly be modified to increase support for these children .
the number of children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian is raising a host of policy questions .
the first is the emergency immigrant education act ( eiea ) , which preceded the english language acquisition program .
the second is the temporary emergency impact aid for displaced students program , which was enacted following hurricanes katrina and rita to provide aid to states that enrolled elementary and secondary students who were displaced as a result of the storms .
this program has been of particular interest to congress because it provided aid on a short - term basis to schools and leas that experienced an unexpected influx of students .
while in these programs , children are provided with basic education services and activities and are not enrolled in local school systems .
in response to congressional interest in these issues , this report addresses possible sources of federal support for schools and local educational agencies that have enrolled unaccompanied alien children .
it is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of all programs that could potentially serve these children .
however , once an unaccompanied alien child is released to an appropriate sponsor ( e.g. , parent , other family member , or other adult ) , the child has the right to enroll in a local school , just like any other child living in that area , even while awaiting immigration proceedings .
the next section of the report provides an overview of the refugee school impact aid program administered by orr , which funds activities aimed at the effective integration and education of refugee children .
the last section of the report addresses the challenge of providing funds to leas and schools that are absorbing newly arriving unaccompanied children in light of the lack of local area data on the number of unaccompanied alien children that have been released from orr custody .
the second part of the report examines two programs that were previously administered by ed but are no longer funded .
