since september 11 , 2001 , tsa has focused much of its efforts and resources on meeting legislative mandates to strengthen commercial aviation security .
within the department of transportation ( dot ) , the federal transit administration ( fta ) and federal railroad administration ( fra ) have responsibilities for passenger and freight rail safety and security .
regarding passenger rail security , key department of homeland security ( dhs ) stakeholders with critical roles include the transportation security administration ( tsa ) , which is responsible for securing all modes of transportation , and the office for grants and training ( ogt ) , which provides grant funds to rail operators and conducts risk assessments for passenger rail agencies .
in particular , my testimony highlights three key areas: ( 1 ) the actions that dhs and its component agencies have taken to assess the risks posed by terrorism to the u.s. passenger rail system ; ( 2 ) the actions that tsa and other federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of the u.s. passenger rail system ; and ( 3 ) the security practices that domestic and selected foreign passenger rail operators have implemented to mitigate risks and enhance security .
however , tsa has recently placed additional focus on securing surface modes of transportation , particularly in the area of passenger rail security .
surface transportation , which includes passenger and freight rail , mass transit , highways , and pipelines , are inherently open and difficult to secure .
one of the critical challenges facing these federal agencies , and rail system operators they oversee or support , is finding ways to protect rail systems from potential terrorist attacks without compromising the accessibility and efficiency of rail travel .
in this regard , to help federal decision makers determine how to best allocate limited resources , we have advocated , the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( the 9 / 11 commission ) has recommended , and the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 provides that a risk management approach be employed to guide decision making related to homeland security resources .
the madrid commuter rail attacks in march 2004 , london rail bombings in july 2005 , and mumbai , india train bombings just last year , highlight the vulnerabilities of passenger rail and other surface transportation systems and made clear that even when security precautions are put into place , these systems remain vulnerable to attack .
while securing surface transportation systems is a daunting task — a shared responsibility requiring coordinated action on the part of federal , state , and local governments and the private sector — it is important nonetheless to take the necessary steps to identify and mitigate risks to these systems .
as we have reported previously , the sheer number of stakeholders involved in securing surface transportation modes , including passenger rail , can sometimes lead to communication challenges , duplication of effort , and confusion about roles and responsibilities .
until tsa completes this effort , the agency may be limited in its ability to prioritize passenger rail assets and help guide security investment decisions about protecting them .
within and among all modes of transportation , there is competition for resources , as federal , state , and local agencies and transportation operators seek to identify and invest in appropriate security measures to safeguard these systems while also investing in other capital and operational improvements .
