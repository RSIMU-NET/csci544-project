specifically , you asked that we ( 1 ) analyze the limited data available on actual results after dia opened for operations and ( 2 ) identify the risks associated with assessing dia's financial condition .
you asked us to consult with you on the financial viability of the denver international airport ( dia ) , which opened for operations on february 28 , 1995 .
finally , you asked us to comment on dia's ability to meet its financial obligations , including payments to its bondholders .
you also asked us to review estimated cash flows and dia's cash reserves .
opponents raised objections related to dia's construction and operating costs , levels of future passenger demand , and long - term financial viability .
other risks include the possibility of ( 1 ) unknown construction defects resulting in major unexpected costs or ( 2 ) adverse actions arising from a current securities and exchange commission investigation and / or lawsuits filed by bondholders against dia .
full funding requires that 2 months of operations and maintenance expenses be on deposit in the fund , a requirement of about $27 million .
this fund can be used to cover operations and maintenance expenses if net cash from operations is inadequate .
united airlines is thinly capitalized , with net equity of about $76 million and debt of about $12 billion , reported as of march 31 , 1995 .
the airport , which opened for business on february 28 , 1995 , experienced numerous construction delays and cost overruns .
also , because dia's revenues are primarily driven by passenger volume , increased ticket prices may be a concern if they result in significant passenger declines .
most airlines have reported substantial net losses since 1990 , with total losses of about $13 billion from 1990 through 1994 .
both dia and the federal aviation administration ( faa ) expect enplanement levels to increase over the next 5 years .
financial results of the airline industry , a key risk factor , have been volatile since deregulation in 1978 .
in addition , dia's future financial performance could be threatened by a number of factors specific to the airport's operations , most notably the overall volatility of the airline industry in general and any future deterioration in the financial health of its major tenant , united airlines .
although investigations to date have not disclosed major deficiencies that would result in significant repair costs , if undisclosed defects are present that eventually cause expensive repairs , dia's cost structure could be materially affected .
to review dia's revenues , we ( 1 ) sampled dia's daily revenue transactions for march through may 1995 and examined supporting documentation regarding collections of airline rents and landing fees , ( 2 ) tested supporting documentation for revenues from concessions such as parking , fees from rental car companies , food and beverage concessions , and retailers , ( 3 ) extracted data from reports on city of denver investment income and journal vouchers on receipts of passenger facility charges from airlines , ( 4 ) compared actual revenues for march through may 1995 to the monthly estimates of cash flows dia prepared for 1995 , ( 5 ) analyzed and studied for consistency dia's long - term estimates covering 1996 through 2000 for revenue and other financial information , and ( 6 ) reviewed the terms of lease agreements with airlines and cargo carriers , obtained and analyzed passenger data from airline landing reports for march through august 1995 , and became familiar with the rates and charges methodology dia used to set rental rates and landing fees for airlines .
