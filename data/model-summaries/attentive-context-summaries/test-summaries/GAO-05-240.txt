furthermore , as a part of this analysis , we recommend that epa assess the number of oil and gas sites impacted by the phase ii rule ; the costs to industry of compliance with the rule and whether these costs are solely attributable to the storm water rule ; and the environmental implications and benefits of the storm water rule , including , but not limited to , potential benefits for endangered species .
polluted storm water runoff can lead to u.s. surface water degradation .
this report provides information about ( 1 ) oil and gas construction activities for which permits have been obtained under phase i and ( 2 ) oil and gas construction activities that are likely to be affected by phase ii and its financial and environmental implications .
separate from epa's efforts , oil and gas industry representatives informed us of a department of energy ( doe ) study to evaluate the impact of the phase ii rule on the oil and gas industry .
if effects are likely , the agencies , including epa , must consult with the fish and wildlife service ( fws ) or the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to ensure that the activities , such as issuing permits , will not jeopardize a species' continued existence or adversely modify its designated critical habitat .
oil and gas industry representatives were most concerned about costs that stem from delays companies may face when identifying a construction activity's impact on endangered species .
in an effort to satisfy its responsibilities under the endangered species act , epa consulted with fws and nmfs to create language for its construction general permit that requires operators to self - certify that they have examined their project's potential effects on endangered species .
subsequently , on january 18 , 2005 , the agency proposed a further extension of the compliance date to june 12 , 2006 , to complete its review and take final action .
fish and wildlife service ( fws ) and national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) , which are the regulatory agencies for the endangered species act , could increase if a significantly larger number of sites initiated communications or consultation requests .
briefly , the procedures in the permit require companies to determine if federally listed threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats are present on or near the project area , determine if the construction activity's storm water discharges or related activities are likely to affect any threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat on or near the project area , determine if measures can be implemented to avoid adverse effects , and if adverse effects are likely , work with fws or nmfs to modify the project and / or take other actions to gain authorization for the activity .
so that epa may fully understand the implications of phase ii of its storm water rule prior to deciding whether the oil and gas industry should be subject to it , we recommend that epa complete its phase ii analysis before making any final decision .
however , as we performed audit work for this engagement , epa had not issued any analysis of the rule's impact ; nor could epa management representatives provide a specific estimate of when its analysis would be completed or when a final decision would be reached .
