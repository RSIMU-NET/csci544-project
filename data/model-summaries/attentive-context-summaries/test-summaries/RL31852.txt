under current tax law , firms may expense ( or deduct as a current rather than a capital expense ) up to $1 million of the total cost of new and used qualified assets they purchase and place in service in tax years beginning in 2018 under section 179 of the federal tax code .
it has the potential to stimulate business investment by reducing the cost of capital for favored investments and by increasing the cash flow of firms undertaking such investments .
many of the assets that qualify for the section 179 expensing allowance are also eligible for the section 168 ( k ) expensing allowance ( which is also known as bonus depreciation ) .
115-97 ( known informally as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ) made several notable changes in both tax provisions .
they also have the option under section 168 ( k ) of expensing the entire cost of qualified assets they acquire and place in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022 .
this report examines the current status , legislative history , and main economic effects ( including their efficacy as a tool for economic stimulus ) of the section 179 and bonus depreciation allowances .
115-97 also increased the section 168 ( k ) bonus depreciation allowance to 100% of the cost of eligible assets acquired and placed in service from september 28 , 2017 , through the end of 2022 and made certain changes in the property eligible for the allowance .
as a result , economists view the two allowances as significant investment tax subsidies , especially since firms are allowed to take advantage of both allowances in the same tax year .
specifically , the new tax law permanently increased the annual dollar limitation for expensing under section 179 to $1 million , raised the phaseout threshold to $2.5 million , indexed both amounts for inflation , and expanded the range of assets eligible for the allowance .
expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation .

specifically , they maintain that the allowances have the potential to promote an inefficient allocation of capital among domestic industries and investment opportunities , and to lessen the federal tax burden on upper - income business owners , who account substantial shares of noncorporate business profits and corporate stock ownership and dividends .

in their view , the disadvantages of the allowances may outweigh the advantages .
these effects correspond to three traditional criteria used by economists to evaluate actual or proposed tax policies: efficiency , equity , and simplicity .
the user cost ( or rental price ) of capital is one of the key influences on business investment decisions .
many lawmakers view the section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation allowances as effective policy tools for promoting the growth of small firms and stimulating the economy during periods of slow or negative growth .
or the company may have to rely on retained earnings since it has limited access to debt and equity markets .
the contribution of cash flow to business investment ( especially small business investment ) remains unclear .
at the same time , many economists acknowledge that expensing can reduce the cost of tax compliance , especially for smaller firms .
