 ( recommendation 3 ) .
medicaid section 1115 demonstrations , which allow states to test and evaluate new approaches for delivering medicaid services , have become a significant feature of the medicaid program , increasing both in number and cost over the years and affecting millions of beneficiaries .
for example , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that oversees the medicaid program , has approved states' proposals to extend medicaid coverage under demonstrations to populations or for services that would not otherwise be covered under medicaid .
in november 2016 , nearly three - quarters of states operated at least part of their medicaid program under section 1115 demonstrations , and , in fiscal year 2015 , federal demonstration expenditures amounted to $109 billion or about one - third of medicaid program expenditures that year .
cms has also allowed states to use medicaid funds to finance costs that would not otherwise be eligible for federal funds , such as incentive payments to providers to improve access to and quality of care .
because medicaid section 1115 demonstrations ( hereafter referred to as demonstrations ) are intended to test new approaches to providing coverage and delivering medicaid services , evaluations of the demonstrations are essential to determining whether the new approaches are having their intended effect .
evaluations are also critical to ensuring that information on the effects of demonstrations , such as on beneficiary access to care , quality of care , and costs of care is available to inform federal and state policy decisions about new approaches to coverage and care .
under section 1115 of the social security act , the secretary of health and human services may waive certain federal medicaid requirements and approve new types of expenditures that would not otherwise be eligible for federal medicaid matching funds for experimental , pilot , or demonstration projects that , in the secretary's judgment , are likely to promote medicaid objectives .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the administrator of cms should establish and implement a policy for publicly releasing findings from federal evaluations of demonstrations , including findings from rapid cycle , interim , and final reports ; and this policy should include standards for timely release .
the medicaid section 1115 demonstrations ( referred to as demonstrations ) in our eight selected states varied in terms of the number of years the demonstrations had been in effect and cost , among other things .
the limitations in state - led evaluations — including methodological weaknesses and gaps in results — have , in part , hindered cms's use of them to inform its policy decisions .
in addition , cms has initiated its own federal evaluations of selected medicaid demonstrations .
cms's efforts since 2014 to improve the usefulness of evaluations in informing state and federal medicaid policy decisions have promise .
cms has long required states to conduct evaluations of demonstrations .
despite these challenges , targeted and well - designed evaluations offer the potential to identify policies that improve outcomes for beneficiaries and reduce costs to medicaid .
from those , we selected eight states to achieve variation with regard to ( 1 ) total spending on the demonstrations , including as a percent of the state's total medicaid spending , ( 2 ) the number of years the state's most comprehensive demonstration had been in place , and ( 3 ) geography .
