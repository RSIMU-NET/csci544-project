specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) how the enterprises' multifamily loan activities , products , and loan performance have changed over time , ( 2 ) the enterprises' role in the multifamily housing financing marketplace and the extent to which they have met their affordable housing goals , and ( 3 ) how the enterprises' credit standards and delinquency rates compare with those of other mortgage capital sources and how they have managed credit risk associated with their multifamily housing activities .
most of the discussion about the future of the enterprises has focused on their role in supporting financing for single - family homes , but they have played a larger role in providing financing for multifamily properties ( those with five or more units ) since the financial crisis of 2007 .
congress established fannie mae and freddie mac in 1968 and 1989 , respectively , as for - profit , shareholder - owned corporations.primary mission that has been to stabilize and assist the u.s. secondary mortgage market and facilitate the flow of mortgage credit .
on september 6 , 2008 , the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) placed fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship out of concern that the deteriorating financial condition of the two government - sponsored enterprises ( the enterprises ) threatened the stability of financial markets.while the conservatorships can remain in place indefinitely as efforts are undertaken to stabilize the enterprises and restore confidence in financial markets , fhfa has said that the conservatorships were not intended to be permanent .
through 2008 , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) set the goals for each year ; fhfa currently does so .
fhfa also identified deficiencies with fannie mae's information systems in 2009 and 2010 .
congress and the executive branch will face difficult decisions on how to restructure the enterprises and promote housing opportunities while limiting risks to taxpayers and the stability of financial markets .
we interviewed officials from hud's federal housing administration ( fha ) , the department of agriculture's rural housing service ( rhs ) , the national council of state housing agencies ( ncsha ) , the national association of affordable housing lenders , the commercial real estate finance council , and the american council of life insurers ( acli ) to obtain information on the key credit standards generally used by institutions they represent and their loan performance .
in 2011 , fhfa found that fannie mae needed to improve its risk - management practices for multifamily loans .
in its 2010 annual report to congress , fhfa continued to report on deficiencies with freddie mac's asset - management function , including that it was poorly managed and lacked the necessary process and controls to identify , evaluate , and control problem assets .
