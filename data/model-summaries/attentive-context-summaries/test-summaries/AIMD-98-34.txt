with the passage of legislation such as the chief financial officers act , the government management reform act , and the government performance and results act , federal agency financial personnel are in the initial stages of establishing the systems and strengthening the accountability structures needed to prepare their first auditable financial statements and are increasingly expected to implement more businesslike accounting and management practices .
well qualified financial management personnel are essential to the federal government's ability to manage its affairs effectively and provide accurate and useful information to the congress and executive branch managers .
as the federal government strives to improve its financial management operations , it may be able to draw upon the expertise and experience of the private sector and state governments .
this information can help provide a frame of reference for federal departments and agencies to consider as part of their efforts to strengthen the qualifications of federal financial management personnel .
in contrast , financial management personnel with private corporations and state governments have considerable experience in operating the systems and practices necessary to produce audited consolidated financial statements to report on those activities for which their organizations are accountable to their stockholders and taxpayers , respectively .
consequently , you asked us to survey the qualifications of key financial management personnel at fortune 100 companies and state governments .
the final report in this series will compare the profile information on these personnel to that of their fortune 100 and state government counterparts .
in this regard , we are issuing a series of reports describing the background and training of key financial management personnel in the department of defense .
the cfo act spelled out an ambitious agenda for financial management reform , including expectations for the ( 1 ) deployment of modern systems to replace existing antiquated , often manual , processes , ( 2 ) development of better performance and cost measures , and ( 3 ) design of results - oriented reports on the government's financial condition and operating performance by integrating budget , accounting , and program information .
the objectives for this report were to identify ( 1 ) the background and training profiles of key financial management personnel working at large private sector corporations and state governments and ( 2 ) the qualification requirements applicable to personnel in these positions .
while these financial management improvement efforts may be new to many financial personnel in the federal government , similar requirements have been in place for personnel in the private sector and in state governments for many years .
the financial personnel in these organizations have also had extensive experience in developing and implementing meaningful financial performance measures .
the congress has taken various steps to help ensure that federal agencies improve their financial management .
the disciplined process required to generate reliable , accurate financial data has been in place in the private sector for over 60 years following the 1929 stock market crash , and in state governments since the early 1980s .
few financial management personnel were certified management accountants ( cma ) or certified internal auditors ( cia ) .
requirements for other certifications ( cma and cia ) were rare .
further , the requirements of the government performance and results act of 1993 call for federal managers to fundamentally shift their focus from a preoccupation with rigid adherence to prescribed processes to assessing the extent to which federal programs have achieved desired outcomes and results .
