the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) operates the nation's largest public power system , supplying electricity to about 8 million customers across a 7-state region .
concerned about tva's dual challenge of reducing emissions while managing increased demand on its power system , you asked us to: ( 1 ) determine how tva plans to meet future demands for electricity through 2005 while minimizing its emissions of so2 and nox ; ( 2 ) describe the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts ; and ( 3 ) compare the scope and impact of tva's demand - side management efforts to those of selected other utilities' efforts .
accordingly , we are recommending that the tva chairman ( 1 ) evaluate the structure and effectiveness of its current programs ; ( 2 ) review the longer - term potential applicability of other programs to its power system ; and ( 3 ) , as appropriate , implement demand - side management practices .
tva relied on its 11 coal - burning plants to supply about 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001 .
these plants account for almost all of tva's emissions of two key air pollutants — sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , which has been linked to reduced visibility , and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone .
tva directly serves 62 large federal and industrial customers and serves other commercial , industrial , and residential customers through a network of 158 power distributors .
in part to lessen the need for new capacity , tva and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through “demand - side management” programs , which are designed to reduce the amount of energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed .
when current customers use less electricity , the utility has to generate less power and thus may produce fewer emissions of air pollutants .
demand for tva's electricity will increase about 1.7 percent annually through 2010 , according to tva projections .
building new generating capacity can result in additional emissions , which raises environmental concerns .
to meet this demand , tva estimates that it will need to expand its current generating capacity of 30,365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually — nearly the equivalent of building an average - size power plant , or contracting for the power from one , every year .
for example , some utilities offer their customers incentives to purchase appliances and lighting that use less electricity .
to meet its customers' demand for electricity , tva generates electricity not only at its 11 coal - fired plants ( consisting of 59 generating units ) , but also three nuclear power plants ( five units ) , 29 hydroelectric dams ( 109 units ) , one pumped storage site ( four units ) , and five sites with combustion turbines ( 64 units ) .
tva estimates that demand for its electricity will increase about 1.7 percent annually through 2010 .
as that area has grown , in both population and economic activity , tva customers' use of electricity has grown and is expected to keep growing .
