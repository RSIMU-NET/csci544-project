thank you for inviting me to discuss the challenges and risks facing the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) .
we recognize the complexity and difficulty in establishing not only the cause of the columbia accident , but also in understanding the agency's environment in which management decisions are made .
since its inception , nasa has undertaken numerous programs that have greatly advanced scientific and technological knowledge .
you asked that we provide information concerning nasa , particularly the management of the space shuttle program .
but the agency is at a critical juncture , and major management improvements are needed .
as you are aware , nasa's activities span a broad range of complex and technical endeavors .
in january of this year , we identified four challenges facing nasa .
controlling international space station costs .
reducing space launch costs .
strengthening strategic human capital management .
we believe our body of work can help the board in this area .
weak contract management and financial controls pose risks across the agency .
improving contract management .
nasa is taking steps to address its workforce challenges .
recognizing the need to revitalize the shuttle program's workforce , nasa discontinued its downsizing plans in december 1999 and initiated efforts to hire new staff .
as nasa moves ahead in acquiring and implementing its new financial management system , nasa needs to ensure that its systems and processes provide the right data to oversee its programs and contractors — specifically , data to allow comparisons of actual costs to estimates , provide an early warning of cost overruns or other related difficulties , and monitor contract performance and make program requirement trade - off decisions .
while nasa has made noteworthy progress in strengthening its contract oversight , much work remains .
therefore , we have placed this area on our high - risk list .
nasa has addressed many of these acquisition - related weaknesses , but key tasks remain , including completing the design and implementation of a new integrated financial management system .
while nasa is taking comprehensive steps to address this problem across all mission areas , implementing a strategic approach to marshal , manage , and maintain human capital has been a significant challenge .
these include a scholarship - for - service program ; a streamlined hiring authority for certain scientific positions ; larger and more flexible recruitment , relocation , and retention bonuses ; noncompetitive conversions of term employees to permanent status ; a more flexible critical pay authority ; a more flexible limited - term appointment authority for the senior executive service ; and greater flexibility in determining annual leave accrual rate for new hires .
these include cost estimates , controls designed to provide early warnings of cost and schedule overruns , and risk mitigation plans .
much of nasa's success depends on the success of its contractors — who received more than 85 percent , or $13.3 billion , of nasa's funds in fiscal year 2002 .
in addition , nasa must employ proven best practices , including ( 1 ) aligning its selection of commercial components of the system with a nasa - wide blueprint , or “enterprise architecture ; ” ( 2 ) analyzing and understanding the dependencies among the commercial components before acquiring and implementing them ; ( 3 ) following an event - driven system acquisition strategy ; ( 4 ) employing effective acquisition management processes , such as those governing requirements management , risk management , and test management ; ( 5 ) ensuring that legacy system data are accurate to avoid loading and perpetuating data errors in the new system ; and ( 6 ) proactively positioning nasa for the business process changes embedded in the new system , for example , by providing adequate formal and on - the - job training .
