the focus of the latest national debate over high levels of immigration is largely on its economic effects , that is , whether immigration provides net economic benefits to society .
immigration has been a contentious issue since the nation's inception .
the current debate has been concerned with the impact of immigration on the public budget and the private economy .
during periods of substantial immigration , it has not been unusual for the native - born population to raise objections on many grounds â€” cultural , religious , ethnic , and economic .
the debate over immigration policy has been devoted more to the well - being of u.s. workers than to consumer welfare .
the report opens with a discussion of how to analyze the impact of immigrants on the pay and job opportunities of native - born workers .
in terms of budgetary effects , the question is whether immigrants receive more in public services than they pay in taxes .
immigrants also affect the private economy in their capacity as workers: if the admission of foreign - born workers lowers wages , which , in turn , results in more goods being produced at lower prices , then u.s. consumers would benefit ; however , if immigration results in lower wages , u.s. workers would be harmed .
some policymakers have proposed further strengthening the u.s. border with mexico to curtail the entrance of unauthorized aliens and improving enforcement of more stringent sanctions against employers who hire these predominantly low - skilled workers , based in part upon the belief that immigration does , in fact , have substantial adverse consequences for low - skilled native - born workers .
before the entrance of foreign - born workers to the u.s. labor market , the amount of labor that workers are willing to supply to employers is represented by the curve labeled s 1 in figure 1 .
the empirical issue is how best to measure the existence and magnitude of the potential wage and employment effects of immigration that the model describes .
yet , changing the composition of immigration may not be the most effective way to improve the plight of low - skilled native - born workers .
it then uses this framework to examine and interpret the empirical literature on the subject .
it also has been suggested that congress address the distributional issue some empirical studies have raised by changing the composition of legal immigration .
but , theory also suggests that immigration would make consumers ( including the above - mentioned native - born workers ) better off because it holds down wages and thereby holds down prices of goods and services .
if other factors ( e.g. , skill - biased technological change ) have played a greater role than the inflow of low - skilled foreign - born workers , then curtailing the immigration of this group may not much affect the wage and employment outcomes of low - skilled u.s. workers .
the model suggests that some native - born workers may be made worse off through lower wages or diminished job prospects because immigration increases the supply of labor available to the nation's employers .
the increase in the supply of labor due to the addition of foreign - born workers is represented by s 2 .
