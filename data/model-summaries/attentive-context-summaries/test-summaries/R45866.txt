the rules of the house of representatives have included provisions related to preserving order and decorum in the chamber since the 1 st congress ( 1789-1790 ) .
under current house rules , members may violate decorum if they engage in certain behaviors , such as using disorderly language .
members may be called to order by colleagues for the use of allegedly disorderly , or unparliamentary , language , which may include a formal demand that their words be taken down .
this demand initiates a series of procedures to determine whether the words are , in fact , unparliamentary and to decide whether a member who uses such language should be allowed to proceed in debate .
this report covers these procedures , which are provided for in the standing rules of the house as a mechanism to maintain decorum in debate .
the sections below present details about how and when a member might invoke the demand that words be taken down , the procedural steps that may follow the demand , and an overview of the rule's history in the house .
the report concludes with information about the practice of invoking this rule in the house in recent decades .
the standing rules of the house do not state explicitly what language is considered to be disorderly , although clause 1 ( b ) of rule xvii prohibits members from engaging in "personalities" in debate .
following the reading of the allegedly unparliamentary remarks , the speaker of the house ( or , if the words are spoken in a committee , the chair of the committee ) will determine whether the words are in order .
the standing rules of the house establish a parliamentary mechanismâreferred to as "words taken down"âwhereby a member may call another member to order for the use of disorderly language .
the rule took its current form when the house comprehensively recodified its rules in the 106 th congress , although the changes were largely technical .
 ( b ) the speaker shall decide the validity of a call to order .
it may also be invoked in the standing and select committees of the house .
twenty - seven , or more than half , of these rulings took place in the 1990s , with only nine rulings by the speaker since 2000 .
although the rules of the house have , since its inception , included provisions related to preserving order and decorum in the chamber , the formal call for a member's words to be taken down was not adopted as part of the standing rules of the house in the 1 st congress ( 1789-1790 ) .
according to clause 4 ( b ) of rule xvii , the demand for words to be taken down must be timely: it must generally occur before intervening business or debate .
house precedents catalog words and phrases previously deemed to be in order and those that were ruled out of order , or unparliamentary .
it is also common for the member whose words were ruled out of order to be allowed to proceed in order , usually by unanimous consent initiated by the speaker .
members whose words were ruled out of order were given permission to proceed in 17 of the 25 instances , either by unanimous consent or motion .
