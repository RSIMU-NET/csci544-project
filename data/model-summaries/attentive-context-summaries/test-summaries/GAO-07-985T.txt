my comments today will focus on ( 1 ) va's policies , procedures , and guidelines for evaluating and awarding ses member bonuses , including the composition and responsibility of va's performance review boards ( prb ) , which recommend ses bonuses ; ( 2 ) the number and amount of bonuses awarded for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 by va headquarters and field locations and compared to the amount of bonuses given to ses members at other major cabinet - level departments ; and ( 3 ) the office of personnel management's ( opm ) and the office of management and budget's ( omb ) roles in certifying va's and other agencies' ses performance appraisal system .
through its three primary components , in fiscal year 2006 , va operated one of the largest health care systems that provided services to about 5 million patients , paid cash disability benefits to more than 3.5 million veterans and their survivors , and operated 125 national cemeteries in the united states .
i am pleased to be here today to provide the subcommittee with information on the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) process for providing senior executive service ( ses ) performance awards ( bonuses ) .
va's mission is to serve america's veterans and their families .
we have also identified key practices of effective performance management for the ses , which include the linkage or “line of sight” between individual performance and organizational success , the importance of linking pay to individual and organizational performance , and the need to make meaningful distinctions in performance .
we analyzed va's policies and procedures related to the awarding of ses member bonuses for 2005 through 2007 that were included in va's 2005 and 2006 submissions and 2007 draft submission to opm concerning va's ses and senior - level employee performance appraisal system .
va has achieved provisional certification of its ses performance management system for 2004 through 2006 .
in 2006 , we identified certain principles for executive pay plans that should be considered to attract and retain the quality and quantity of executive leadership necessary to address 21st century challenges , including that they be sensitive to hiring and retention trends ; reflect responsibilities , knowledge , skills , and contributions ; and be competitive .
our review of va's requirements for ses performance plans as represented in both its 2006 submission and 2007 draft submission to opm shows that va made changes to the requirements for its performance plans to reflect greater emphasis on measurable results .
in our body of work on senior executive performance management , we have discussed how high - performing organizations understand that they need senior leaders who are accountable for results , drive continuous improvement , and stimulate and support efforts to integrate human capital approaches with organizational goals and related transformation issues .
information on opm's and omb's roles is based on our review of va's senior performance appraisal system certification submissions and related correspondence and our prior work reviewing opm's capacity to lead and implement reform .
we analyzed data provided to us by va on the amount and number of ses member bonuses for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 and comparable data from other cabinet - level departments as reported by opm for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 .
