growing recognition of the long - term fiscal challenges facing the nation has also led congress , the agencies , and others to focus on ensuring that federal wildland fire activities are appropriate and carried out in a cost - effective manner .
specifically , i will focus on ( 1 ) the progress the forest service and the interior agencies have made in managing wildland fire and ( 2 ) key actions we previously recommended and believe are still necessary to improve the agencies' management of wildland fire .
it also prompted a sustained effort , known as the national fire plan , on the part of federal agencies and congress to improve fire suppression capabilities , reduce fuels , restore fire - adapted ecosystems , and help communities better withstand wildland fire .
the nation's wildland fire problems have worsened dramatically over the past decade , threatening communities as well as important natural and cultural resources .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss wildland fire management by the federal wildland fire agencies — the forest service within the department of agriculture and four agencies within the department of the interior — including key actions that we believe the agencies should take to improve their management of wildland fires and help contain the rising costs of preparing for and responding to fires .
both the average acreage burned annually and federal appropriations for wildland fire management activities have more than doubled , with appropriations reaching more than $2.9 billion annually , on average , during fiscal years 2001 through 2007 .
uncharacteristic accumulations of vegetation that can fuel wildland fires , due in part to past fire suppression policies and land management practices , and severe regional weather and drought have led to higher - intensity fires and longer fire seasons .
a number of factors have contributed to these increases .
such data are critical to helping the agencies ( 1 ) identify the extent , severity , and location of wildland fire threats to the nation's communities and resources ; ( 2 ) predict fire intensity and rate of spread under particular weather conditions ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the effect that reducing fuels may have on future fire behavior .
to address these objectives , we reviewed previous gao reports and agency documents and interviewed agency officials in washington , d.c. ; at the national interagency fire center in boise , idaho ; and elsewhere .
congress , for example , could provide either a specified amount ( known as a definite appropriation ) or as much funding as the agencies need to fund emergency suppression ( known as an indefinite appropriation ) .
my testimony today summarizes our previous findings and recommendations related to wildland fire , and also includes preliminary information from our ongoing work examining the extent to which the agencies have improved their wildland fire programs in response to our previous work .
the federal land assistance , management , and enhancement act proposes establishing a wildland fire suppression reserve account ; the administration's budget overview for fiscal year 2010 also proposes a $282 million reserve account for the forest service and a $75 million reserve account for the interior to provide funding for firefighting when the appropriated suppression funds are exhausted .
