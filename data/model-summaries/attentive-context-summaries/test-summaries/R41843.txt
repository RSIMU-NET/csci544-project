their interest has been sparked by the debate over the south korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus fta ) , which would lower or eliminate u.s. tariffs and non - tariff barriers on most imports from south korea .
as a result of north korea's relative economic isolation , the undeveloped state of its export sector , and u.s. trade restrictions , the united states imports virtually no finished goods from north korea .
a number of groups and individuals have recently focused attention on u.s. rules governing imports from north korea .
some , particularly the agreement's opponents , argue that the agreement could lead to increased u.s. imports of goods or components made in north korea .
the korus fta will not enter into force unless congress approves implementation legislation , which obama administration officials have said they expect to send to the 112 th congress .
the korus fta might constrain the u.s. government's ability to impose restrictions on imports from north korea .
the ability of the united states to enforce its restrictions would then depend to a large extent upon the level of u.s. - south korea customs cooperation — which arguably would be enhanced by the korus fta — and the severity of the penalties charged for non - compliance with u.s. import restrictions .
the korus fta appears likely to have only a minimal impact on whether u.s. sanctions on north korean imports are put to the test .
over the course of the 2000s , north korea's significant export markets shrunk to two countries , south korea and china , which in 2010 appear to have accounted for over three - quarters of north korea's export shipments .
the agreement also contains provisions that aim to help preserve the united states' ability to maintain its restrictions on imports of north korean goods and components .
between 2000 and 2010 , cumulative u.s. bilateral imports of finished north korean goods totaled $335,700 , which is equivalent to a rounding error in annual u.s. trade flows with most countries .
the dprk's stated policy of self - reliance ( juche ) , its suspicion of foreign countries , and the collapse of its industrial base since the late 1980s have resulted in an extremely low level of commercial and financial relations with other nations in the world .
the first section of this report examines existing u.s. rules and practices governing imports from north korea .
the korus fta has insufficient "rules of origin" to determine the country of origin of imported products .
the third section addresses the issue of how , if at all , the korus fta would affect potential u.s. imports of north korean content , including whether the agreement could result in legal action against the u.s. government if it kept out imports of north korean content .
since 2005 , according to u.s. trade data , the only finished imports that have entered the united states from north korea have been $8,363 worth of stamps , which were imported in june 2010 .
the second section analyzes the two main portals through which north korea conducts its minimal economic interaction with the outside world: the kic and china .
