because of the susceptibility of the program to fraud and abuse , the congress enacted the health care fraud and abuse control ( hcfac ) program as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) , public law 104-91 .
hcfac , which is administered by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and the department of justice ( doj ) , established a national framework to coordinate federal , state , and local law enforcement efforts to detect , prevent , and prosecute health care fraud and abuse in the public and private sectors .
the medicare program is the nation's largest health insurer with almost 40 million beneficiaries and outlays of over $219 billion annually .
hipaa requires hhs and doj to issue a joint annual report no later than january 1 of each year to the congress for the preceding fiscal year on ( 1 ) amounts deposited to the federal hospital insurance trust fund pursuant to hipaa and the source of the amounts and ( 2 ) amounts appropriated from the trust fund for the hcfac program and the justification for the expenditure of such amounts .
accordingly , the objectives of our review were to identify and assess the propriety of amounts reported as ( 1 ) deposits to the trust fund , ( 2 ) appropriations from the trust fund for hcfac activities , ( 3 ) expenditures at doj for hcfac activities , ( 4 ) expenditures at hhs for hcfac activities , ( 5 ) expenditures for non - medicare anti â€“ fraud and abuse activities , and ( 6 ) savings to the trust fund , as well as other savings , resulting from expenditures from the trust fund for the hcfac program .
hhs and doj have issued five joint reports , which individually covered hcfac - related activities for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 .
to facilitate providing the congress and other decision makers with relevant information on program performance and results , we recommend that the attorney general and the secretary of hhs assess the feasibility of tracking cost savings and expenditures attributable to hcfac activities by the various federal programs affected .
therefore , it was impossible for us to meet our reporting deadline of january 1 , 2002 , and in all likelihood , we will also not be able to meet our 2004 commitment .
hipaa , as amended by the balanced budget act of 1997 , public law 105-33 , also requires that we submit reports no later than january 1 , 2002 , and 2004 , that identify certain collections , appropriations , expenditures , and savings related to hcfac and other aspects of the program as we consider appropriate .
the hhs and doj joint hcfac report for fiscal year 2001 , which was required to be issued in january 2002 but was not issued until april 2002 , contained information needed to perform this review .
to accomplish the first objective , identifying and assessing the propriety of amounts reported for deposits in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 as ( 1 ) penalties and multiple damages , ( 2 ) criminal fines , ( 3 ) civil monetary penalties , and ( 4 ) gifts and bequests , we did the following: reviewed the joint hhs and doj hcfac reports for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to identify amounts deposited to the trust fund .
