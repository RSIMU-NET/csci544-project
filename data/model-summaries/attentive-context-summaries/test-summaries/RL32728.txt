historically , electricity service has been defined as a natural monopoly , meaning that theindustry has ( 1 ) an inherent tendency toward declining long - term costs , ( 2 ) high thresholdinvestment , and ( 3 ) technological conditions that limit the number of potential entrants .
the public utility holding company act ( puhca ) ( 1 ) and the federal power act ( fpa ) of 1935 ( title i and title ii of the public utility act ) ( 2 ) established a regime ofregulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federalgovernment .
in addition,many regulators have considered unified control of generation , transmission , and distribution as themost efficient means of providing service .
the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will bepermitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among thevarious customer classes ( residential , commercial , and industrial ) .
at the least , a state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates , and oftenover investment and debt .
the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nation's electricitysupply and led to enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 ( purpa ) .
as a result , most people ( about 75% ) are currently servedby a vertically integrated , investor - owned utility .
federal regulation followed state regulation and ispremised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of statesto regulate interstate commerce .
despite this diversity , the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have notrestructured is the establishment of retail electric prices .
the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) has the principal functions at the federal level for the economic regulation of the electricityutility industry , including financial transactions , wholesale rate regulation , transactions involvingtransmission of unbundled retail electricity , interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity,and ensuring adequate and reliable service .
as the electric utility industry has evolved , however , there has been a growing belief that thehistoric classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and thatmarket forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure .
state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities , including wholesaleand retail rate - making .
under the fpa , federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates forelectric power flowing in interstate commerce .

 ) , the securities andexchange commission ( sec ) regulates utilities' corporate structure and business ventures underpuhca .
the mandatorypurchase requirement under the public utility regulatory policies act ( purpa ) is repealed .
moreover , recent changes in electric utilityregulation and improved technologies have allowed additional generating capacity to be providedby independent firms rather than utilities .
forexample , the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating facilities , primarilycooperatives and publicly owned utilities , has provided evidence that vertical integration has notbeen necessary for providing efficient electric service .
