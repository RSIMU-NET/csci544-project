the report identified these five general research categories as ( 1 ) instrumentation , metrology , and analytical methods ; ( 2 ) nanomaterials and human health ; ( 3 ) nanomaterials and the environment ; ( 4 ) health and environmental exposure assessment ; and ( 5 ) risk management methods .
as a result , the inventory of projects designed to address these risks is inaccurate and cannot ensure that agencies direct their future research investments appropriately .
we recommend that the director , ostp , in consultation with the director , nnco , and the director , omb , provide better guidance to agencies regarding how to report research that has a primary focus to understand or address environmental , health , and safety risks of nanotechnology .
in addition to the agencies mentioned above , we also included in our review three regulatory agencies that do not have research budgets — the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) to determine whether these three agencies conducted any research on their own relative to ehs risks of nanotechnology .
furthermore , agencies currently have limited guidance on how to report projects with more than one research focus across program component areas , when appropriate .
despite the general effectiveness of its collaboration efforts , the nehi working group has not yet completed an overarching strategy to help align the agencies' ehs research efforts .
however , for a technology that may become ubiquitous , it is essential to consider the potential risks of using nanotechnology in concert with its potential benefits .
in 2006 , an estimated $50 billion in products health care and agriculture .
the act establishes a national nanotechnology program to coordinate federal nanotechnology research and development .
the nni , through its nehi working group , has begun a process to identify and prioritize both the research needed to better understand potential ehs risks and the gaps between what research is underway and the highest - priority needs .
however , this information is not currently available because the totals reported by the nni include research that is more closely related to uses of nanotechnology , rather than the risks nanotechnology may pose .
nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the nanotechnology encompasses a wide range of innovations based on the understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers — the understanding and control of matter at the scale of nanometers — the equivalent of one - billionth of a meter .
in this context you asked us to report on ( 1 ) the extent to which selected research and regulatory agencies conducted research in fiscal year 2006 that primarily was focused on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; ( 2 ) the reasonableness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to identify and prioritize federal research on the potential ehs risks of nanotechnology ; and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of the processes that agencies and the nni use to coordinate their research .
