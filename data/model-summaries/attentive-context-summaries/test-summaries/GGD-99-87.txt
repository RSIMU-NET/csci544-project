our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) what state regulators were doing to oversee the year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry , ( 2 ) how the regulatory oversight of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness compared with the oversight of the banking and securities industries , ( 3 ) the current status of the insurance industry's year 2000 readiness , and ( 4 ) the nature and extent of year 2000 liability exposures that insurers face and the mitigation efforts taken to address such exposures .
this report responds to your request that we study the readiness of the insurance industry to meet the year 2000 date change .
the effectiveness of insurers' efforts to mitigate their exposures remains unclear as some mitigation measures face legal and marketplace challenges .
although many insurers have taken actions to reduce their potential liability exposures , the effectiveness of these mitigation efforts remains uncertain .
the insurance industry , with policy reserves of approximately $2.5 trillion , is an important component of the financial system .
ultimately , insurers' year 2000-related liability exposures will depend on decisions made to resolve key legal questions and numerous pending legislative initiatives .
the effectiveness of these efforts , however , remains uncertain because insurers face various potential marketplace and legal challenges .
other uncertainties remain over how several state and federal legislative initiatives will affect insurers' potential year 2000-related liability exposures .
uncertainties also remain over the outcomes of several state and federal legislative initiatives that were recently undertaken to address year 2000 liability exposure issues .
regarding year 2000 issues , naic has assumed a key role as facilitator of states' efforts to oversee the industry's readiness .
thus , a regulator of financial institutions could use this , or other similar guidance , as general criteria for assessing the state of preparedness of its regulated institutions .
many other state and federal legislative initiatives are currently being considered , some of which propose alternative dispute resolution methods to help resolve disputes involving year 2000-related mishaps .
although it has no regulatory function , naic is responsible for ( 1 ) serving as a clearinghouse for exchanges of information , ( 2 ) providing a structure for interstate cooperation in examinations of multistate insurers , ( 3 ) distributing model insurance laws and regulations for consideration by state legislatures and insurance departments , and ( 4 ) reviewing state insurance departments' regulatory activities as part of a national accreditation program .
these reserves are held in trust for policyholders , much like bank deposits are held for depositors .
uncertainties continue as numerous legislative initiatives addressing resolution methods and damage awards for year 2000-related disputes are still being debated .
one difference is that policy reserves are paid out when policyholders experience an insured loss .
while there are important similarities between insurance companies and other financial intermediaries , there are important differences as well .
some experts have expressed uncertainty over whether courts will uphold the year 2000 exclusions due to public policy concerns .
this role includes acting as a coordinator of information pertaining to state oversight efforts , the status of the industry's readiness , and state regulators' actions to become internally prepared for 2000 .
