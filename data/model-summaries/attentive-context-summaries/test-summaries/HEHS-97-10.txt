this is a four - fold increase since enactment of title ix of the education amendments of 1972 .
title ix prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity , including intercollegiate athletics , at colleges and universities ( hereafter referred to simply as “colleges” ) receiving federal financial assistance .
but many have pointed to the gap that still remains in overall opportunity between men's and women's programs .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the steps the department of education and ncaa have taken since 1992 to promote equity between men and women participating in intercollegiate athletics , ( 2 ) the steps states have taken to promote gender equity in athletic programs at colleges , and ( 3 ) what existing studies show about the progress made since 1992 in promoting gender equity in intercollegiate athletics .
some have noted this increase as a move toward “gender equity” in athletics — that is , progress toward a fair distribution of athletic opportunity and resources between men's and women's athletic programs .
for example , in 1992 , the national collegiate athletic association ( ncaa ) reported that although the numbers of male and female undergraduates enrolled at college campuses in 1991 were roughly the same , women constituted about 30 percent of all student athletes at the time , and women's programs received about 23 percent of the athletic operating budgets .
more than 100,000 american women now participate in intercollegiate athletics each year .
grants - in - aid ( scholarships ) .
number and type of sanctions imposed eight states responded to the question ; the remaining 43 states did not use any indicators .
the questionnaire requested data on the existence of state gender equity officials ; type of gender equity initiatives , if any ( that is , legislation , requirements , policy recommendations , or other actions ) ; methods used to promote gender equity ; indicators used to measure gender equity ; actual or estimated trends for each indicator ; compliance and guidance efforts associated with the equity in athletics disclosure act ; and conditions that help or hinder gender equity within the state .
all responses reflect statewide gender equity actions .
ocr both investigates discrimination complaints and conducts compliance reviews .
the remaining 18 schools have yet to determine how they will comply because they are still implementing their settlement agreements .
ocr also considers compliance reviews important to prevention but has conducted few of them in recent years .
although its strategic plan emphasizes the value of conducting ocr - initiated compliance reviews to maximize the effect of available resources , it conducted only two such reviews in 1995 and none in fiscal year 1996 , and it plans none in fiscal year 1997 .
federal regulations implementing title ix became effective in 1975 and specifically required gender equity in intercollegiate athletics .
ocr's title ix activities have focused recently more on policy development , technical assistance , and complaint investigations and less on assessing schools' compliance with title ix through compliance reviews .
the department's ocr is responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws as they relate to schools , including title ix .
