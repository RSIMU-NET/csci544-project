security - related implications are of concern in the lead - up to a presidential election .
on a given day the outgoing administration has the ability to change the policies of a nation and possibly affect the international security environment , yet the following day the president and the national security leadership team may be replaced by a new set of leaders who could have very different strategy and policy goals .
a prospective presidential transition period — ranging from candidate's campaign - related activities through placement of new administration personnel — is a unique time in american politics and holds the promise of opportunity as well as a real or perceived vulnerability to the nation's security interests .
these concerns are present when it is known there will be a change of administration or in cases where the sitting president is running for reelection against an opponent vying for the office .
for example , according to a 2008 presidential transition - related report provided to the department of homeland security ( dhs ) by the homeland security advisory committee ( hsac ) , "briefings , research , and recent history have provided an appreciation of the potential vulnerabilities during transition periods .
presidential transitions during times of global uncertainty , u.s. involvement in military operations , and risks to national security - related activities are not unique to the 2012-2013 presidential election period ( see appendix a ) .
unlike other man - made incidents that may occur with little warning , the presidential election period offers a broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the united states may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance to manipulate the electoral process or change the nation's foreign and domestic policies .
history shows that some state enemies purposefully select periods of government transition to undertake significant acts of violence with a desire to disrupt a peaceful transfer of power ( see appendix b ) .
other activities that the current and incoming administrations and congress may wish to consider undertaking during the presidential transition period include pursuing public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation , involving the national security representatives of presidential candidates in all transition - related discussions , establishing joint advisory councils responsible for addressing all transition - related risks , requiring the director of national intelligence ( dni ) to undertake efforts to support the nation's awareness of risks , reflecting the national security priorities of the newly elected administration in the upcoming budget , passing fiscal year appropriations without undue delay , quickly assigning newly elected and existing members of congress to committees focused on national security , holding hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective u.s. national security policies and goals , and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new president to determine the administration's national security - related priorities .
the transition - related actions or inactions of the outgoing and incoming administration may have a long - lasting affect on a new president's ability to effectively safeguard u.s. interests and may also affect the legacy of the outgoing president .
this political dynamic , coupled with the inherent uncertainty accompanying a presidential transfer of power , may provide an opportunity for those who wish to harm u.s. security interests .
