develop and implement useful performance measures that define fema' s progress in increasing stakeholders' awareness and use of the new maps , including improved mitigation efforts and increased participation rates in purchasing flood insurance .
during the 10 years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2001 , flooding caused over 900 deaths and resulted in approximately $55 billion in damages .
recognizing that fema is currently in the early stages of its map modernization effort , our objectives for this review were to answer the following questions: ( 1 ) how is map modernization intended to improve the accuracy and accessibility of the nation's flood maps ? .
since its inception 36 years ago , the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) has combined the development of flood maps to identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding with mitigation efforts to reduce or eliminate flood risks to people and property and the availability of insurance that property owners can purchase to protect themselves from flood losses .
floods inflict more damage and economic losses upon the united states than any other natural disaster .
fema has established performance measures for all four of its program objectives .
fema has established four primary objectives for implementing map modernization: ( 1 ) establish and maintain a premier data collection and delivery system , ( 2 ) expand outreach and better inform the user community , ( 3 ) build and maintain mutually beneficial partnerships , and ( 4 ) achieve effective program management .
 ( 3 ) to what extent does fema's strategy for managing the map modernization program support the achievement of these benefits and what , if any , limitations could affect the implementation of the strategy ? .
 ( 2 ) what are the expected benefits of more accurate and accessible flood maps ? .
without useful operational definitions for its planned surveys to measure map acceptance and use , fema cannot reasonably measure and demonstrate whether map modernization has achieved its intended benefits in such areas as community and individual flood mitigation efforts or increased flood insurance purchase rates .
with congressional support and funding , fema has embarked on a $1 billion , 5-year effort to update the nation's flood maps .
finally , in some cases , the performance measures established for the program and the contractor may not be sufficient to permit fema to measure whether map modernization is achieving its intended benefits .
to describe how map modernization is intended to improve the accuracy and accessibility of the nation's flood maps , we interviewed federal emergency management agency ( fema ) headquarters officials and agency officials in three of the regional offices: region iv in atlanta , georgia ; region viii in denver , colorado ; and region vi in denton , texas .
ensure that it has the staff capacity to effectively implement the nationwide mapping contract and the overall map modernization program .
through its cooperating technical partners ( ctp ) program , fema has developed partnerships with a variety of states and communities that have developed their own data and provided their own funds to help update local flood maps .
nonetheless , without developing such a measure ( or measures ) , fema will be less able to ensure that its map modernization program will have resulted in one of fema's primary intended benefits .
