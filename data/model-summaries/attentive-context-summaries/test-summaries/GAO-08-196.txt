with the federal land transaction facilitation act of 2000 ( fltfa ) set to expire in july 2010 , we were asked to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which the bureau of land management ( blm ) has generated revenue for the fltfa program , ( 2 ) identify challenges blm faces in conducting future sales , ( 3 ) determine the extent to which the agencies have spent funds under fltfa , and ( 4 ) identify challenges the agencies face in conducting future acquisitions .
the four major federal land management agencies — the u.s. department of the interior's bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service , and national park service , and the u.s. department of agriculture's forest service — administer approximately 628 million acres , or about 28 percent of the land area in the united states .
to improve the implementation of the fltfa mandate to raise funds to purchase inholdings , we recommend that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to develop goals for land sales , and develop a strategy for implementing these goals during the last 3 years of the program .
these public lands are mostly in the 11 western states and alaska , where the four agencies manage lands that constitute significant portions of the states' acreage , ranging from about 28 percent in washington state to about 81 percent in nevada .
blm , which manages approximately 256 million acres of federal land , is authorized to sell or exchange land identified in its land use plans ; 4 , the other three land management agencies have limited or no sales authority .
historically , many controversies have arisen over the agencies' management of these lands , including the selling of federal land and the purchasing of private land .
the other most commonly cited challenges were , in the order of frequency cited , ( 1 ) identifying a willing seller , ( 2 ) the availability of knowledgeable staff to conduct acquisitions , ( 3 ) the lack of funding to purchase land , ( 4 ) restrictions imposed by laws and regulations , and ( 5 ) public opposition to land acquisitions .
congress enacted the federal land transaction facilitation act of 2000 ( fltfa ) , in part , to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of federal land management by allowing the four land management agencies to acquire inholdings to promote the consolidation of ownership of public and private lands in a manner that would allow for better overall resource management .
as with sales , progress in acquiring priority land has been hampered by weak agency performance in developing an effective mechanism to identify potential land acquisitions and set priorities for inholdings and adjacent land with exceptional resources , which fltfa requires .
with fltfa expiring in july 2010 , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the extent to which blm has generated revenue for the fltfa program , ( 2 ) identify challenges blm faces in conducting future sales , ( 3 ) determine the extent to which agencies have spent funds under fltfa , and ( 4 ) identify challenges the agencies face in conducting future acquisitions .
