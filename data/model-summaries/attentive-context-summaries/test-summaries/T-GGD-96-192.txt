in its october 1995 report , smithsonian institution: better care needed for national air and space museum aircraft ( gao / ggd - 96-9 , october 19 , 1995 ) , gao found that nasm committed relatively few resources to aircraft restoration , compared to other museum activities .
at the request of senator kay bailey hutchison , gao last year reviewed the care of the aircraft collection of the smithsonian's national air and space museum ( nasm ) .
as currently structured , the smithsonian will have to raise at least $100 million in private funds for its construction .
to be successful , the smithsonian will have to carry through on its initiated actions to develop a more clearly defined mission , collection priorities , and plans for the care of aircraft .
gao made several recommendations to address the care of the collection .
further , it remains to be seen how successful the smithsonian will be in raising private funds for the dulles extension and how long this effort will take .
further , in september 1996 , the smithsonian board of regents approved a resolution encouraging the formation of partnerships with other museums that could care for smithsonian artifacts as a means of reducing storage problems .
however , even if nasm restored more aircraft , the museum lacked adequate storage facilities to protect them from deterioration .
nasm has consistently requested increased funding for collections management and for storage facilities repairs in recent years , but nasm must compete with other smithsonian museums for limited resources and had been unable to obtain needed funding .
nasm's storage facilities , located mainly in suitland , maryland , consisted of buildings lacking humidity controls or air - conditioning , some buildings had leaking roofs , and only some were heated .
it appears that the smithsonian is taking steps in the right direction to improve the care of aircraft in the nasm collection .
nasm officials cited plans for a new extension facility at dulles airport , virginia , as the solution .
as a result , the aircraft in storage were deteriorating , including previously restored aircraft .
in august 1996 , nasm's director said actions were underway that addressed the gao recommendations .
senator hutchison asked us to review whether nasm restored a sufficient number of aircraft to prevent deterioration of its collection .
also , nasm had plans to acquire 80 aircraft over the next 30 years , which would have exacerbated its storage problems .
to be successful , the smithsonian will have to carry through on its initiated actions to develop a more clearly defined mission , collection priorities , and plans for the care of aircraft .
further , it remains to be seen how successful the smithsonian will be in raising private funds for the dulles extension and how long this effort will take .
mr. chairman and members of the subcommittee: we are pleased to be here today to discuss the report that we issued last october to senator kay bailey hutchison on matters relating to aircraft restoration at the smithsonian institution's national air and space museum ( nasm ) .
but we also found that even if nasm increased its restoration efforts , the museum would not have enough space with environmental controls to properly store or display the restored aircraft .
