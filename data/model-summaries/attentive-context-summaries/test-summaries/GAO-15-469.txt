for years , gao has reported on problems in cost , schedule , and performance for major defense acquisition programs within the department of defense ( dod ) .
the views of current and former military service chiefs on the current acquisition process , and ( 2 ) key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our assessment of these issues .
this report examines: ( 1 ) senator inhofe's august 2014 request was in his role as ranking member of the senate armed services committee in the 113th congress .
this report reviews further related issues and concerns the military service chiefs have with the department of defense's ( dod ) acquisition process and outcomes it produces .
in 2014 , gao issued a report on dod's acquisition chain of command and found that the military service chiefs currently have several opportunities to contribute to the management and however , the extent to which oversight of defense acquisition programs.the chiefs are actively involved and influencing acquisition programs remained unclear .
in recent years , acquisition reform advocates have suggested that acquisition outcomes could be improved by expanding the role of military service chiefs with respect to managing and overseeing weapon system programs .
poor program outcomes can be traced to a culture in which the military services begin programs with unrealistic requirements , immature technologies , and overly optimistic cost and schedule estimates .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the views of current and former military service chiefs on the current acquisition process , and ( 2 ) key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our assessment of these issues .
we analyzed evidence and examples collected from our interviews with current and former dod leadership , and assessed them in relation to findings from acquisition reform studies and prior gao work on dod weapon systems and commercial best practices .
gao issued a report in 2014 on the military service chiefs' role in the acquisition chain of command .
to assess key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and our assessment of these issues , we drew upon our extensive body of work in defense acquisitions and best practices , and reviewed program execution information from all 78 ongoing major defense acquisition programs identified in annual selected acquisition reports .
you asked gao to conduct additional work on this topic and review what concerns , if any , the military service chiefs have with the department's acquisition process and outcomes it produces .
to help ensure that requirements are well defined and well understood before a program is approved to start system development , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the military service chiefs and service acquisition executives to work together to take the following two actions: assess whether sufficient systems engineering expertise is available during the requirements development process ; and develop a better way to make sure sufficient systems engineering is conducted and opportunities exist to better define requirements and assess resource trade - offs before a program starts .
we also sought the perspectives of other dod leadership , including the service acquisition executives .
in order to improve program outcomes , dod must focus its efforts on better integrating the requirements and acquisition processes , which can be achieved through better collaboration between these communities from the generation of requirements through system development , coupled with a greater emphasis on systems engineering and knowledge attainment early in a program's life cycle .
