this report addresses ( 1 ) the federal programs that provide transportation services for transportation - disadvantaged populations and the types of services they provide ; ( 2 ) federal , state , and local government spending for transportation services through these federal programs ; ( 3 ) the extent of coordination among state , local , and federal agencies in delivering transportation services for the transportation - disadvantaged , including actions taken by the coordinating council ; and ( 4 ) any obstacles that may impede effective coordination and potential options for overcoming such obstacles .
however , certain populations in the united states lack the ability to provide their own transportation or have difficulty accessing whatever conventional public transportation may be available .
our overall approach was to ( 1 ) review federal laws and regulations governing the use of federal funds for services for transportation - disadvantaged populations ; ( 2 ) analyze spending data where available ; ( 3 ) review federal and other governmental activities and the research literature related to the coordination of transportation services ; and ( 4 ) obtain the views of more than 100 officials from federal , state , and local government agencies , industry and client advocacy groups , and other experts involved with or affected by the coordination process on the obstacles and options for improving coordination .
many federal programs authorize use of funds to provide transportation for transportation - disadvantaged people so they can access government programs .
ensure that strategic and annual performance plans discuss their departments' transportation coordination efforts and incorporate long - term goals and performance measures that address the need for coordination among programs for the transportation - disadvantaged .
many within these populations face significant problems in accessing transportation .
programs that provide incidental transportation include health and medical programs , job - training programs , or programs for the aging .
the ability to access personal or public transportation is fundamental for people to connect with employment opportunities , health and medical services , educational services , and the community at large .
complete spending information is not available because many federal funding recipients are not required to distinguish transportation from other spending when reporting spending information to federal agencies .
efforts to improve services and achieve cost savings through coordination of transportation activities among agencies at all levels of government vary .
our scope of work included federal programs that provide transportation services to the transportation - disadvantaged .
we have also issued other reports raising concerns about service coordination .
these “transportation - disadvantaged” persons may have an age - related condition , a disability , or income constraints .
we clustered the wide range of identified obstacles into three categories related to ( 1 ) sharing vehicles and the low priority given to funding coordination activities ; ( 2 ) programmatic differences ; and ( 3 ) limited federal , state , and local leadership and commitment to undertake and sustain coordination efforts .
in some areas within the five states we visited , coordination among providers has resulted in significant benefits , such as improved customer service and lower unit costs .
while some states are not currently experiencing reductions in their transportation programs , many states are anticipating that budget deficits will continue into 2004 .
