in fiscal year 2012 , the department of defense ( dod ) provided health care to nearly 9.7 million servicemembers , retirees , and their families through its tricare program .
in this report we examine: ( 1 ) tma's acquisition process to award tricare's third generation mcscs ; ( 2 ) the extent to which issues were raised in the bid protests involving tricare's third generation mcscs , including the identification of any common themes ; and ( 3 ) lessons learned , if any , from the acquisition of tricare's third generation mcscs and how , if at all , dha plans to use these lessons in future contracting activities .
dod uses private sector contractors to develop and maintain the health care provider networks that make up tricare's purchased care system , which complements the health care provided by the u.s. military's health care system â€” a direct care system of military treatment facilities .
as of october 1 , 2013 , dod's defense health agency ( dha ) is responsible for awarding , administering , and overseeing tricare's managed care support contracts ( mcsc ) .
tricare is a regionally structured program that provides health care services and support to beneficiaries in three u.s. regions: north , south , and west .
to describe tma's acquisition process for awarding tricare's third generation mcscs , we reviewed relevant statutes and federal regulations , including the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) and defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) .obtained and reviewed dod and tricare policy documents as well as contract documentation specific to tricare's third generation mcsc acquisition process .
dod's health care costs have more than doubled from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to its fiscal year 2014 budget request of $49.4 billion .
according to tricare acquisition officials , preliminary lessons learned from the third generation acquisition process and resulting bid protests include ( 1 ) improvements in communication and documentation to increase transparency during the evaluation of the proposals and ( 2 ) increases to the length of the acquisition process to allow for additional time to evaluate proposals and for the transition from one mcsc to another .
the report raised concerns regarding the growth in dod's health care costs and identified health care contracts with private sector companies under its tricare program as an area for potential savings and efficiencies .
the evaluation factors , in descending order of importance , were: ( 1 ) technical approach , ( 2 ) past performance , and ( 3 ) price / cost .
communication: to more clearly communicate how tma would evaluate proposals , tma issued an amended rfp for the south and west regions and allowed offerors to submit proposal revisions .
gao was directed to review dod's process for awarding tricare contracts , including the mcscs , and the degree to which this process is transparent .
dod's fiscal year budget request of $49.4 billion includes funds for its defense health program , military medical personnel , military construction , as well as funds set aside for the medicare - eligible retiree health care fund .
congressional budget office reported that dod's health care costs are projected to reach $59 billion by 2016 and nearly $92 billion by 2030 .
