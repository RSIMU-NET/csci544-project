signed into law in december 2016 , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 ( ndaa ) required the departments of defense ( dod ) , health and human services ( hhs ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and agriculture ( usda ) to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy and associated implementation plan .
for our february 2020 report , we evaluated the early strategy implementation efforts of hhs , dod , usda , and dhs ; the departments of state , justice ( specifically the fbi ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) ; and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) .
these threats — whether naturally - occurring , intentional , or accidental — have the potential to cause loss of life and sustained damage to the economy , societal stability , and global security .
catastrophic biological threats highlight the inextricable link between security and public health concerns .
at the same time , the president issued the presidential memorandum on the support for national biodefense / national security presidential memorandum - 14 ( nspm - 14 ) , which details a governance structure and implementation process to achieve the strategy's goals .
in particular , hhs ( 1 ) has not documented guidance and methods for analyzing the data , including but not limited to methods and guidance for how to account for the contribution of nonfederal capabilities ; and ( 2 ) does not have a resource plan for staffing and sustaining ongoing efforts .
in our analyses and interviews , we found that parts of the process in the first year were underdeveloped , raising questions about ( 1 ) the plans to support change management practices and ensure that early - implementation limitations do not become institutionalized in future years' efforts ; ( 2 ) guidance and methods for meaningfully analyzing the data ; and ( 3 ) the clarity of decision - making processes , roles , and responsibilities .
this novel virus poses a public health and economic threat , and may eventually be declared a pandemic , as seen with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in 2003 .
we made four recommendations to hhs in our report , aimed at improving the strategy's implementation .
in september 2018 , the white house issued the national biodefense strategy ( strategy ) and characterized it as a new direction to protect the nation against biological threats , stating that its implementation would promote a more efficient , coordinated , and accountable biodefense enterprise .
for example , the unpredictable nature of naturally - occurring disease , such as the novel coronavirus ( covid - 19 ) , poses a threat to humans .
the vast and evolving biological threat landscape includes threats of naturally - occurring infectious diseases , bioterrorism , and safety and security lapses at facilities that house biological threat agents .
to address these issues , we recommended the secretary of hhs direct the biodefense coordination team to ( 1 ) clearly document guidance and methods for analyzing the data collected from the agencies , including ensuring that nonfederal resources and capabilities are accounted for in the analysis , and ( 2 ) establish a resource plan to staff , support , and sustain its ongoing efforts .
