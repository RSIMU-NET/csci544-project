social security covers about 96 percent of all u.s. workers ; the vast majority of the remaining 4 percent who are not covered are public employees .
to address concerns with how noncovered workers are treated compared with covered workers , social security has provisions in place to take noncovered employment into account when calculating social security benefits for public employees , but the provisions have been difficult to administer .
it has also been a source of confusion and frustration for the workers these provisions affect .
currently , social security has two provisions in place that attempt to ensure these workers' noncovered employment is taken into consideration when calculating their social security benefits: ( 1 ) the government pension offset ( gpo ) , which affects spouse and survivor benefits , and ( 2 ) the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) , which affects retired worker benefits .
alternatively , as part of social security reform , others have proposed extending mandatory coverage to all state and local government employees who are not currently covered ; under mandatory coverage , the need for these provisions would be phased out over time .
moreover , 9 in 10 of the public employees not covered by social security are state and local government workers .
although these noncovered workers do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings , they may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses' or their own earnings from other covered employment .
however , the social security administration ( ssa ) cannot effectively and fairly apply these provisions because it does not have access to complete and accurate information on noncovered earnings and receipt of noncovered pensions .
thus , some have proposed eliminating these provisions .
today , i will discuss social security's coverage of public employees , social security's current provisions affecting noncovered public employees , and proposals to modify those provisions or make coverage mandatory for all public employees .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the issues regarding social security coverage of public employees and the possible effects of reform .
however , congressional action is still needed to improve access to information on state and local government pensions .
in recent years , various social security reforms that would affect public employees have been proposed .
this situation poses difficult issues of fairness .
implementation of some of our recommendations has improved the availability and tracking of key information for federal retirees , and we have estimated that this tracking will save hundreds of millions of dollars .
both provisions reduce social security benefits for those who receive noncovered pension benefits .
some proposals specifically address the gpo and the wep and would either revise or eliminate them .
i hope i can help clarify and provide some perspective on the complex relationship between social security and public employees .
nevertheless , these employees can still be eligible for social security benefits based on their spouses' or their own earnings from covered employment .
to address the fairness issues that arise with noncovered public employees , the congress has enacted two provisions: ( 1 ) the government pension offset ( gpo ) regarding spouse and survivor benefits , and ( 2 ) the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) regarding retired worker benefits .
