this report responds to your request and provides our ( 1 ) assessment of the department of defense's ( dod ) efforts to manage the fund's cash and ( 2 ) recommendations to dod which , if properly implemented , will provide additional management oversight of the fund's cash operations .
one area of continuing concern has been dod's management of the fund's cash .
in the committee's report on the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization , you raised concerns about the management of the defense business operations fund's cash and directed that we review the fund's cash management practices .
since april 1991 , we have reported and testified on the challenges and problems confronting dod in the management of the fund .
an enterprise that collects and disburses about $75 billion annually must have the mechanisms in place to ensure that it fulfills its responsibilities to dod management , the congress , and the american taxpayers .
dod's fiscal year 1995 federal managers' financial integrity act ( fmfia ) report highlighted a number of serious weaknesses in dod's financial management operations and systems .
dod has experienced continual difficulties in effectively implementing and operating the fund .
successful implementation of the cfo act will be key to solving dod's long - standing financial management weaknesses .
to the extent that ( 1 ) the fund is not paid for work performed in a timely manner or ( 2 ) dod cannot produce accurate and timely information on the fund's collections and disbursements , unanticipated fluctuations or , worse yet , cash shortages will occur .
currently , dod's policy requires the fund to maintain cash levels to cover 7 to 10 days of operational costs ( $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion ) and 4 to 6 months of capital asset disbursements ( $.5 to $.9 billion ) .
however , the poor state of cash - related information dod managers have to work with severely inhibits their ability to manage the fund's cash .
unless a high priority is placed on correcting these problems , the status quo will be perpetuated , and the fund will continue to be limited in its ability to carry out its original objective of enhancing readiness capability through business operation efficiencies .
the ability to generate cash consistent with dod policy is dependent on ( 1 ) accurately setting prices to recover the full costs of producing goods and services , ( 2 ) accurately projecting workload , such as the number of aircraft to be repaired during the year , and ( 3 ) collecting funds in a timely manner from customers for work performed .
navy had the greatest share of the cash reduction ; its balance decreased from about $1.6 billion to $83 million .
this is evident by the fact that dod relies on advance billing of customers for work not yet performed to ensure that the fund has sufficient funds available to meet its day - to - day operating expenses .
dod's fiscal year 1995 fmfia report acknowledges inadequacies in the fund's accounting and reporting .
gao's high - risk report series also pointed out that dod has serious , long - standing problems in providing reliable financial and cost information to those responsible for carrying out and overseeing dod's missions and programs .
