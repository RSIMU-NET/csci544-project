we focused on identifying companies that ( 1 ) were publicly traded prior to the termination of their pension plan ( s ) , ( 2 ) had significant unfunded pension liabilities on a termination basis ( $100 million or more ) , ( 3 ) had a high unfunded liability per plan participant ratio ( $10,000 or more per participant ) , and ( 4 ) had more than 5,000 plan participants .
the pension benefit guaranty corporation's ( pbgc ) mission is to protect the pensions of almost 44 million american workers and retirees who participate in more than 29,000 defined benefit pension plans .
given the recent decline in global financial markets and increase in corporate bankruptcies , pbgc's deficit will likely continue to increase , with implications for pbgc's financial position .
in may 2009 , pbgc's acting director testified before the senate special committee on aging that through the first two quarters of 2009 , pbgc's estimated deficit had tripled to reach $33.5 billion , due largely to an increase in completed and probable plan terminations and a decrease in interest rates .
in 2003 , gao placed pbgc on its high - risk list due , in part , to the significant underfunding of large plans in struggling industries .
pbgc is responsible for the current and future pensions of about 1.3 million people even though their sponsor companies may no longer be in business .

since some companies terminated multiple pension plans over a period of time , for those companies our review may cover more than 5 years .
in 2006 , congress enacted the pension protection act ( ppa ) to address some identified deficiencies in funding requirements .
we reviewed securities and exchange commission ( sec ) filings and pbgc documents disclosing missed contributions and plan underfunding at the time of termination .
these plans are sponsored by a wide range of employers , including large companies with over 100,000 covered participants , and small ones which may have as few as a dozen participants .
to determine pay and other compensation received by executives in the years preceding their company's termination of an underfunded defined benefit pension plan , we first obtained a database from the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) identifying companies that had terminated underfunded pension plans from 1999 to 2008 .
to determine pay and other benefits received by selected executives , we first obtained data from pbgc to identify companies whose underfunded plans had been terminated in the past 10 years .
we limited our review to the time period beginning 5 years prior to a company's first pension plan termination and ending with the company's final pension plan termination .
the ceo received split - dollar life insurance benefits in some years in excess of $1 million .
