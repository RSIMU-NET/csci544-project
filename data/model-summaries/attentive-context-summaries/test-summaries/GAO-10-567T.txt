in particular , i will provide an update on the progress the bureau is making in addressing issues that prompted us to designate the 2010 census a high - risk area , including ( 1 ) the reliability of key it systems ; ( 2 ) a broad range of activities critical to an effective headcount , some of which were problematic in either earlier 2010 operations or in the 2000 census ; and ( 3 ) the quality of the bureau's cost estimates .
the broad range of activities i will discuss today include procedures for fingerprinting temporary employees ; the rollout of key marketing efforts aimed at improving the participation of hard - to - count populations and how american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) funds are being used as part of that effort ; the bureau's plans for mailing a second , follow - up questionnaire and the removal of late mail returns ; and the bureau's plans to enumerate people who are vulnerable to being missed by the census , including the homeless and those displaced by recent economic conditions and the hurricanes that slammed the gulf coast .
in short , the success of these operations will have a major impact on the ultimate cost and accuracy of the census .
with census day , april 1 , fast approaching , the nation has entered one of the most crucial time periods in the decade - long census life - cycle .
on the one hand , key it systems — most notably an automated system used to manage field data collection known as the paper - based operations control system ( pbocs ) and a personnel and payroll processing system called the decennial applicant personnel and payroll system ( dapps ) — were experiencing significant performance issues .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the u.s. census bureau's ( bureau ) readiness for the 2010 census .
as you know , in march 2008 , we designated the 2010 census a high - risk area because of cost overruns and weaknesses in the bureau's information technology ( it ) acquisition and contract management function .
in mid - march , the bureau delivered questionnaires to around 120 million households , and in the coming weeks , the bureau will launch additional operations aimed at counting people in migrant worker housing , boats , tent cities , homeless shelters , nursing homes , dormitories , prisons , and other diverse dwellings , as well as millions of households that fail to mail back their census questionnaires , all in an effort to ensure a complete and accurate enumeration .
at the same time , the unprecedented commitment of resources and total cost of the census — now estimated at around $14.7 billion — underscores the importance of identifying lessons learned from the 2010 headcount in order to reexamine the nation's approach to the 2020 census and future population tallies .
my testimony today is based on our ongoing and completed reviews of key census - taking operations .
indeed , to secure a successful headcount , the bureau needs to align thousands of activities , process millions of forms , hire around 1 million temporary employees , and partner with thousands of public and private sector entities across the country .
