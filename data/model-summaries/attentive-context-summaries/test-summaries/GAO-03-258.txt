by enacting a number of major management reforms , the congress has created a statutory framework , with the government performance and results act ( gpra ) as its centerpiece .
a central piece of that initiative is the office of management and budget's ( omb ) new diagnostic tool , the program performance assessment rating tool ( part ) .
during the past decade , the congress and the executive branch have sought to improve federal management and instill a greater focus on results .
a series of three reports described agencies' progress over a 4-year period in aligning performance plans ; budgets ; and , in the most recent report , financial statements .
improving the integration of budget and performance is a high priority initiative in the president's management agenda .
finally , we observed that describing the planned and actual use of resources in terms of measurable results was an essential long - term effort that would take time and adaptation on the part of all agencies .
omb expects to use part assessments in considering department and agency budget submissions for the fiscal year 2004 president's budget request to the congress .
part is designed to provide a consistent approach to reviewing program design , planning , and goals development as well as program management and results .
the objectives of this report on the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , and its two companion studies on the administration for children and families within the department of health and human services and the veterans health administration within the department of veterans affairs , are ( 1 ) to document what managers in these three agencies considered successful efforts at creating links between planning and performance information to influence resource choices and ( 2 ) the challenges they face in doing so .
one of gpra's major purposes is to encourage a closer and clearer link between planning , performance — that is , results , and the budget process .
we found that from fiscal years 1999 through 2002 , agencies made significant progress in showing a direct link between expected performance and requested program activity funding levels — either through structural changes or crosswalks — as the first step in defining the performance consequences of budgetary decisions .
in a number of different reports to the congress , we have examined different aspects of the resources - to - results link .
furthermore , we found that progress likely would be uneven and the pace of development affected by mission complexity and differences in operating environments across the government .
we also studied ways to guide agencies to better integrate performance information into the budget process .
each administration takes a slightly different approach to implementing results management .
however , we concluded that additional effort was needed to describe the relationship between performance expectations , requested funding , consumed resources , and performance results .
both our assessments of performance and budget account alignments and the framework of budget practices have led to the next phase of work and the subject of this report .
in this work , we developed a framework of budget practices that we believe can contribute to an agency's capacity to manage for results .
