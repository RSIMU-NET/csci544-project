the department of defense ( dod ) , in its december 2001 nuclear posture review , provided a conceptual framework for transforming u.s. strategic capabilities to address the new security risks the united states faces .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) whether dod has clearly defined and instilled a common understanding and approach to its global strike concept throughout the department , ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has assessed and developed capabilities needed for global strike , and ( 3 ) the extent to which dod has identified the funding requirements and developed an investment strategy for acquiring new global strike capabilities .
the review proposed a new triad that would bring together the capabilities of nuclear and conventional ( nonnuclear ) offensive strike forces , active and passive defenses , a revitalized defense infrastructure , and enhanced command and control , planning , and intelligence capabilities .
dod is also undertaking or has completed several analytical efforts to assess mid - and long - term options for prompt , long - range global strike and examining other conventional strike capability options , such as a new long - range bomber that would be available for global strike missions in less time - sensitive situations .
in a september 2007 classified report , we discussed dod efforts to develop a near - term solution to convert some of its trident submarine - launched missiles as a means to deliver an intercontinental prompt conventional strike capability .
as dod seeks to transform its forces and organization to better meet the demands of the new security environment , we have reported that the department is faced with identifying new warfighting capabilities it needs , including critical technologies , while at the same time striking an affordable and sustainable balance in its spending for current and future investments .
however , dod's 2006 quadrennial defense review highlighted the lack of a prompt , precise , long - range conventional strike capability for some time - critical situations as an important gap in u.s. global strike capabilities .
the synergy realized with the integration of these capabilities , according to dod officials , would provide the president and other senior decision makers with a wider range of military options against emerging threats while reducing u.s. reliance on the use of nuclear weapons .
several factors affect understanding and communication of the global strike concept among key stakeholders , including the extent to which dod has ( 1 ) defined global strike , ( 2 ) incorporated global strike into joint doctrine , ( 3 ) conducted outreach and communication activities with key stakeholders , and ( 4 ) involved stakeholders in joint exercises and other training involving global strike .
to determine the extent to which dod has identified the funding requirements and developed an investment strategy for acquiring new global strike capabilities , we reviewed documentation and interviewed dod officials on the department's use of its future years defense program ( fydp ) database and related supporting documentation to identify and manage possible programs that may contribute to global strike capabilities .
in transforming offensive strike capabilities for the new triad , dod plans to develop a portfolio of capabilities , referred to as global strike , that would provide the united states with an ability to rapidly plan and deliver limited duration and extended range precision strikes against highly valued assets , such as weapons of mass destruction production , storage , and delivery systems and adversary leadership power bases .
