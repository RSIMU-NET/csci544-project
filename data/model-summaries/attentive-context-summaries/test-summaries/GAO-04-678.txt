the department of defense ( dod ) is experiencing significant and increasing reliance on software and information systems for its weapon capabilities , while at the same time traditional dod prime contractors are subcontracting more of their software development to lower tier and sometimes nontraditional defense suppliers .
dod is also using more commercial - off - the - shelf ( cots ) software to reduce development costs and allow for frequent technology updates , which further increases the number of software developers with either direct or indirect access to weapon system software .
we have previously made recommendations to dod to adopt more effective software development practices and to increase oversight of software intensive systems to improve acquisition outcomes .
while dod attempts to better its software acquisition policies and implement new initiatives , it must take steps to ensure that security is an integral element in decision making and that program managers mitigate risks accordingly .
to determine how the department of defense ( dod ) measures the extent of foreign involvement in software development in weapon systems and how risks associated with using foreign suppliers for software development are measured and mitigated , we reviewed relevant dod guidance , policies , regulations , and procedures .
while these plans and initiatives may help to increase dod's focus on software security and may lead to the development and identification of several potential software security best practices , dod software assurance officials acknowledge that significant effort remains to adequately mitigate software risks to weapon systems .
dod also noted the need to enhance its risk management processes to factor in vulnerabilities analysis of proposed software products , security risks of suppliers' processes , and counterintelligence threat information .
for example , certification and accreditation processes , such as ditscap , should include verification that software development practices contain adequate security measures to address identified risks and threats .
at your request , we ( 1 ) examined dod's efforts to identify and address risks associated with foreign involvement in software development in weapon systems and ( 2 ) determined how weapon system program offices manage these risks in individual programs .
in support of dod guidance , air force , army , and navy regulations implement dod - wide acquisition policies .
dod partially concurred with our three recommendations based on the concern that they place too much responsibility for risk mitigation on program managers .
as dod's need for software increases , knowledge about foreign suppliers in software development is critical for identifying and mitigating risks .
the increased dependence on software capability , combined with an exposure to a greater variety of suppliers , results in more opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in defense software .
dod agreed that software security risks should be defined for dod weapon programs , but noted that program managers should not be solely responsible for defining security requirements , including those for identifying and managing software suppliers .
because of economic incentives and business relationships , these suppliers are using offshore locations and foreign companies to complete various software development and support tasks .
we recommend that the secretary of defense take the following three actions to address risks attributable to software vulnerabilities and threats: require program managers , working with software assurance experts , acquisition personnel , and other organizations as necessary , to specifically define software security requirements , including those for identifying and managing software suppliers .
