finally , if these recommendations are to lead to patient safety improvements , providers must recognize their value and take actions to implement them .
in this report , we describe the progress ahrq has made in ( 1 ) listing psos , including pso efforts to serve providers , and ( 2 ) implementing the npsd .
in addition , because participation — including submission of data on patient safety events — by psos and providers is voluntary , their actions may also contribute to the law's effectiveness in accomplishing its purpose .
because the agency for healthcare research and quality's ( ahrq ) efforts to list patient safety organizations and implement the network of patient safety databases are relatively new but some other patient safety reporting systems are already established , we identified examples of how selected established patient safety reporting systems encourage reporting of patient safety event information by providers and facilitate the development of improvements in patient safety .
to achieve these goals , the patient safety act directed the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to create a list of public or private organizations known as patient safety organizations ( pso ) .
research has shown that serious injuries or deaths resulting from medical care are both common and often preventable .
in a frequently cited report , the institute of medicine ( iom ) estimated in 1999 that preventable medical errors cause as many as 98,000 deaths a year among hospital patients in the united states .
partially in response to the iom report , congress passed the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 ( the patient safety act ) to encourage health care providers to voluntarily report information on patient safety events and to facilitate the development and adoption of interventions and solutions to improve patient safety .
final regulations to implement the act became effective on january 19 , 2009 .
in addition , because improvements to patient safety depend on the voluntary participation of providers and psos , it remains uncertain whether the goals of the patient safety act will be accomplished even after ahrq completes its implementation .
the iom report noted , however , that health care providers are often reluctant to report or disclose their medical errors and to participate in related learning efforts out of fear of incurring legal liability or professional sanctions .
whether the process results in specific recommendations for improving patient safety will depend on the volume and quality of the data submitted and on the quality of the analyses conducted by both psos and by ahrq .
as a result , we cannot assess whether , or to what extent , the law has been effective in encouraging providers to voluntarily report data on patient safety events and to facilitate the development and adoption of improvements in patient safety .
for example , providers will have to decide whether to work with a pso and the extent to which they will report patient safety data to both the pso and the npsd .
to support psos and providers in their efforts to develop and adopt improvements in patient safety , the patient safety act directed hhs to create a network of patient safety databases ( npsd ) .
