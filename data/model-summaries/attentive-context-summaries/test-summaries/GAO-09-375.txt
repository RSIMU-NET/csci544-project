key federal means - tested public benefits involved are: temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , medicaid , the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , and supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
 ( 3 ) to what extent are agencies implementing sponsor repayment , and what factors may hinder them ? .
to ensure that the availability of public benefits does not provide an incentive for immigration and that noncitizens residing in this country are self - reliant , congress significantly limited noncitizens' access to public benefits through the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 ( prwora ) and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) .
to obtain information on agency implementation of sponsor deeming and repayment , as well as the population affected , we reviewed available federal data on noncitizens , as well as available federal and state data on benefit applicants and recipients , to develop estimates of the sponsored noncitizen population and noncitizen applicants and recipients ; conducted a nationwide survey of states regarding temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , medicaid , and the supplemental nutritional assistance program ( snap ) ; visited five states and selected localities within each state and interviewed officials administering tanf , medicaid , and snap ; interviewed officials from all 10 regional offices of the social security administration ( ssa ) regarding relevant supplemental security income ( ssi ) policies , implementation processes and challenges , and the frequency that officials had encountered related cases ; interviewed officials from relevant federal agencies and reviewed pertinent federal laws , regulations , and agency guidance ; and interviewed researchers knowledgeable in immigrant and public benefit issues .
