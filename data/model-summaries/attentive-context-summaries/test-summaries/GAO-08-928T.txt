this statement provides information on two of the objectives in our 2003 report: ( 1 ) whether the judiciary's quantitative case - related workload measures were reasonably accurate measures of district judge and courts of appeals judges' case - related workload ; and ( 2 ) the reasonableness of any proposed methodologies to update the workload measures .
our 2003 report was based on the results of our review of documentation provided by the federal judicial center ( fjc ) and the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aousc ) on the history and development of the case - related workload measures and interviews with officials in each organization .
my statement today is based on work completed and reported in 2003 and is focused exclusively on these workload measures .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss our work on case - related workload measures for district court and courts of appeals judges .
if the conference determines that additional judgeships are needed , it transmits a request to congress identifying the number , type , ( courts of appeals , district court ) , and location of the judgeships it is requesting .
biennially , the judicial conference , the federal judiciary's principal policymaking body , assesses the judiciary's needs for additional judgeships .
however , the judicial conference's analysis begins with the quantitative case - related workload measures it has adopted for the district courts and courts of appeals â€” weighted case filings and adjusted case filings , respectively .
in assessing the need for additional judgeships , the judicial conference considers a variety of information , including responses to its biennial survey of individual courts , temporary increases or decreases in case filings and other factors specific to an individual court .
authorized judgeships are the total number of judgeships authorized by statute for each district court and court of appeals .
we have no views on the judicial conference's pending request for additional judgeships .
these two measures recognize , to different degrees , that the time demands on judges are largely a function of both the number and complexity of the cases on their dockets .
whether these measures are reasonably accurate rests in turn on the soundness of the methodology used to develop them .
the judicial conference relies on these quantitative workload measures to be reasonably accurate measures of judges' case - related workload .
some types of cases may demand relatively little time and others may require many hours of work .
in the past decade the judicial conference has considered a number of proposals for developing a revised case - related workload measure for the courts of appeals judges , but has been unable to reach a consensus on any approach .
these thresholds are 430 weighted case filings per authorized judgeship for district courts and 500 adjusted case filings per three - judge panel of authorized judgeships for courts of appeals ( courts of appeals judges generally hear cases in rotating panels of three judges each ) .
in this statement , we discuss those two objectives first for district courts then for courts of appeals .
the scope of our work did not include how the judicial conference used these case - related workload measures to develop any specific request for additional district and courts of appeals judgeships .
