in 1990 , we began a special effort to review and report on such activities , and yesterday we issued a series of reports providing the current status of the 20 high - risk areas we have been monitoring since our last major progress report 2 years ago .
landmark legislation passed by the congress in the 1990s has established broad management reforms , which , with successful implementation , will help resolve high - risk problems and provide greater accountability in many government programs and operations: the expanded chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 requires agencies to prepare financial statements that can pass the test of an independent audit and provide decisionmakers reliable financial information .
over the past 7 years , we have called attention to critical government operations that are high risk .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss major government programs and operations we have identified as high risk because of vulnerabilities to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
such actions have established a solid foundation to help ensure greater progress , but much remains to be done to fully implement the corrective actions needed to remove the high - risk designation from these areas .
to help improve this situation , we have made hundreds of recommendations to get at the heart of these problem areas , which have at their core a lack of fundamental accountability .
without additional attention to resolve problems in the 25 areas that are the current focus of our high - risk initiative , the government will continue to miss huge opportunities to save billions of dollars , make better investments to reap the benefits of information technology , improve performance and provide better service , and more effectively manage the cost of government programs .
the debt collection improvement act of 1996 strengthens federal agencies' debt collection practices and authorities .
continued oversight by the congress , such as this hearing by the subcommittee , will add essential impetus to ensuring progress as well .
effective and sustained follow - through by agency managers is essential to make further headway and achieve greater benefits .
the 1993 government performance and results act requires agencies to measure performance and focus on results .
these new areas have been added because they are serious , growing problems and provide opportunities to achieve significant savings and better service to the public .
today , we will highlight the legislative and agency actions that have resulted in progress toward fixing these problems .
in addition , we will discuss five new areas that we have just designated as high risk .
the 1995 paperwork reduction act and the 1996 clinger - cohen act provide a basis for agencies to make wiser investments in information technology .
the congress has also acted to address several problems affecting these high - risk areas through oversight hearings and specific legislative initiatives .
full and effective implementation of legislative mandates , our suggestions , and corrective measures by agencies , however , has not yet been achieved because the high - risk areas involve long - standing problems that are difficult to correct .
first , dod's lingering financial management problems are among the most severe in government .
