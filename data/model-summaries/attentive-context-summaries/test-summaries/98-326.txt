this is an outline of two federal statutes: the electronic communications privacy act ( ecpa ) and the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) .
congress crafted both to preserve the ability of government officials to secure information critical to the nation's well - being and to ensure individual privacy .
the courts play an essential role in both .
both evolved out of the shadow of the supreme court's fourth amendment jurisprudence .
fisa authorizes the collection of information about the activities of foreign powers and their agents , whether those activities are criminal or not .
fisa has no such concern .
it modeled parts of fisa after features in ecpa .
ecpa protects individual privacy from the intrusions of other individuals .
there are differences , however .
ecpa's only concern is crime .
prominent among its enactments are: the usa patriot act ; the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2002 ; the 21 st century department of justice appropriations authorization act ; the department of homeland security act ; the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act ; and the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 amendments act of 2008 ( 2008 fisa amendments act ) .
although early american law proscribed common law eavesdropping , the crime was little prosecuted and by the late nineteenth century had "nearly faded from the legal horizon. .
after the court held that the president's inherent powers were insufficient to excuse warrantless electronic eavesdropping on purely domestic threats to national security , congress considered it prudent to augment the foreign intelligence gathering authority of the united states with the foreign intelligence security act of 1978 ( fisa ) .
congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute as a temporary measure to prevent disclosure of government secrets during world war i .
later , it proscribed intercepting and divulging private radio messages in the radio act of 1927 , but did not immediately reestablish a federal wiretap prohibition .
as used in this subchapter: ( a ) "foreign power" means â€” ( 1 ) a foreign government or any component thereof , whether or not recognized by the united states ; ( 2 ) a faction of a foreign nation or nations , not substantially composed of united states persons ; ( 3 ) an entity that is openly acknowledged by a foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign government or governments ; ( 4 ) a group engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor ; ( 5 ) a foreign - based political organization , not substantially composed of united states persons ; ( 6 ) an entity that is directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments ; or ( 7 ) an entity not substantially composed of united states persons that is engaged in the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
in title iii , ecpa begins the proposition that unless provided otherwise , it is a federal crime to engage in wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping ; to possess wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping equipment ; to use or disclosure of information obtained through illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping ; or to disclosure of information secured through court - ordered wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping , in order to obstruct justice .
