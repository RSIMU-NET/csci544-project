however , despite some improvements in the federal government's management of its personnel in recent years , strategic human capital management — and more specifically , the need for the office of personnel management ( opm ) and agencies to address skills gaps in mission critical occupations — continues to be a gao high risk area .
our work has shown that a careful consideration of federal pay is essential to fiscal stewardship and is necessary to support the recruitment and retention of a talented , agile , and high - performing federal workforce .
for example , of the 34 areas on our 2017 high - risk list ( excluding strategic human capital management ) , skills gaps played a role in making 15 areas high - risk , and included information technology management , and acquisitions , and veterans' health care , among others .
it is congress's policy that pay for federal workers in the general schedule ( gs ) , the pay system covering the majority of federal workers , be in line with pay for comparable nonfederal workers .
in 2014 , we recommended that opm ( 1 ) work with stakeholders to examine ways to modernize the classification system , ( 2 ) develop a strategy to track and prioritize occupations for review and updates , and ( 3 ) develop cost - effective methods to ensure agencies are classifying correctly .
in my remarks today , i will discuss ( 1 ) lessons learned in creating a more market - driven , results - oriented approach to federal pay , and ( 2 ) opportunities in addition to pay and benefits that opm and agencies could use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps .
my testimony is based on our large body of work on federal human capital management issued primarily between june 2012 and march 2017 .
indeed , more effective use of hiring flexibilities , adopting leading human capital management practices , and strengthening the capacity of agencies' human resource offices could significantly improve executive branch personnel management , and thus help agencies to better carry out their missions in an era of highly constrained resources .
high - performing organizations have found that the full life - cycle of human capital management activities — including workforce planning , recruitment , on - boarding , compensation , engagement , succession planning , and retirement programs — need to be fully aligned and focused on the cost - effective achievement of an organization's mission .
as we noted in our 2017 high - risk update , agencies can drive improvements to their high risk areas — including strategic human capital management — through such steps as: sustained leadership commitment , including developing long - term priorities and goals , and providing continuing oversight and accountability ; ensuring agencies have adequate capacity to address their personnel issues , including collaborating with other agencies and stakeholders as appropriate ; identifying root causes of problems and developing action plans to address them , including establishing goals and performance measures ; monitoring actions by , for example , tracking performance measures and progress against goals ; and demonstrating progress by showing issues are being effectively managed and root causes are being addressed .
