as congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include strengthened enforcement measures , a significant expansion of guest workers , and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration , some question whether the department of homeland security ( dhs ) can handle the increased immigration workload .
there are at least three elements to consider when assessing dhs effectiveness in immigration policy: ( 1 ) the immigration laws and regulations , ( 2 ) the management and administration of the agencies charged with implementation of the immigration laws and regulations , and ( 3 ) the funding resources and staffing to carry out these laws and regulations .
currently , three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions: customs and border protection ( cbp ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and u.s .
in response to growing concerns that the immigration responsibilities and other important duties of dhs were not functioning effectively , dhs secretary michael chertoff announced the second stage review ( 2sr ) to base work on priorities driven by risk .
citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) .
in 2004 , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) reported that many of the management problems that plagued the former immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) have carried over to the three dhs immigration agencies .
over the years , congress has considered all three elements to address perceived , as well as reported , problems in immigration policy .
the report opens with a brief history of the federal responsibility for immigration and the legislative debate that led to the transfer of most immigration functions to dhs .
"strengthen[ing] border security and interior enforcement and reform[ing] immigration processes" is on the six - point agenda driving secretary chertoff's plans to improve dhs management .
as figure 1 illustrates , these three elements drive the effectiveness of immigration policy .
it analyzes the division of immigration responsibilities in dhs and sets the stage for the current debate over how these functions are organized .
late in 2004 , the heritage foundation released a report that reached the following conclusion: " ... in consolidating responsibility for border , immigration , and transportation security , dhs actually increased the number of involved agencies to eight and created additional problems that now need solving. .
this report focuses on the management and administration element .
it follows with an organizational chart depicting current immigration functions in dhs .
an analysis of available immigration workload data offers some perspectives on the work of the three agencies over time .
the major immigration duties of the various dhs agencies are summarized and secretary chertoff's "second stage review" is explained .
the report concludes with a summary of key concerns , overarching views , and emerging policy questions .
as congress considers whether comprehensive immigration reform is needed and whether the current configuration of immigration functions in dhs would effectively implement such reform , a series of questions about dhs management emerges .
the underlying question remains whether a sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhs's efficacy in managing immigration policy .
for many years , the ins collected data measuring its workload , known as the performance analysis system ( pas ) .
