this third report examines ( 1 ) the status of sblf ; ( 2 ) identified reasons for variation in growth of qualified small business lending at sblf banks ; and ( 3 ) actions treasury has taken to evaluate sblf participant lending patterns .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the status of the small business lending fund ( sblf ) ; ( 2 ) identify reasons for variation in growth of qualified small business lending at sblf banks ; and ( 3 ) actions the department of the treasury ( treasury ) has taken to evaluate sblf participant lending patterns .
in response to concerns about challenges faced by small businesses in recent years , congress enacted the small business jobs act of 2010 , which authorized the secretary of the department of the treasury ( treasury ) to make up to $30 billion of capital available and offered incentives to financial institutions to increase small business lending .
among other things , the law aimed to stimulate job growth by establishing the small business lending fund ( sblf ) to encourage financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion to increase their lending to small businesses with up to $50 million in annual revenues .
of this $4 billion , $3.9 billion went to 281 banks and $104 million to 51 community development loan funds ( cdlf ) .
to examine the process for exiting the program and participants' reasons for exiting , we collected documents and interviewed officials from treasury and three bank regulatory agencies: the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( federal reserve ) , and the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) .
to examine program status , including participants' lending , and dividend and interest payments , we reviewed treasury data as of june 30 , 2013 , and treasury's july and october 2013 lending growth reports .
in 2011 , 935 financial institutions applied to the program for a combined funding request of $11.7 billion .
in such an evaluation , treasury should ensure that the analytical approaches identified by its contractor will isolate the role of sblf from other factors that could affect small business lending to show the net impact of the program .
by september 2011 , treasury had approved $4 billion for 332 institutions through treasury purchases of preferred stock or debt instruments .
in our first and second reports , we reviewed the implementation of sblf and made recommendations to improve the program's management oversight , program evaluation , and performance reporting .
however , these techniques can improve confidence in whether or not observed results are attributable to sblf .
treasury has continued to develop and refine its approach to assessing the performance of sblf and measuring the extent to which sblf participants have increased small business lending .
treasury has taken steps to assess sblf program performance ( participants' lending patterns ) by including a peer - group analysis in the lending growth reports and collecting additional performance information through annual surveys of program participants .
the 2010 small business jobs act mandates us to conduct an annual audit of the sblf program .
