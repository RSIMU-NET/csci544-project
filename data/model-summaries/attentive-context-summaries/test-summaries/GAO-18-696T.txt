thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the department of defense ( dod ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) interagency program office and the office's role regarding va's electronic health record modernization ( ehrm ) program .
such initiatives include modernizing va's electronic health information system â€” the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) .
in developing this testimony , we relied on our previous reports and testimonies related to the interagency program office , as well as va's and dod's electronic health record system programs and modernization efforts .
the use of information technology ( it ) is crucial to helping the departments effectively serve the nation's veterans and , each year , the departments spend billions of dollars on information systems and assets .
the testimony also discusses the roles this office has played in va's and dod's efforts to increase interoperability and electronic health record capabilities , and any challenges the office has faced in doing so .
both va and dod have long recognized the importance of advancing the use of shared health information systems and capabilities to make patient information more readily available to their health care providers , reduce medical errors , and streamline administrative functions .
we also subsequently produced reports that have discussed the interagency program office in relation to va's efforts to develop a lifetime electronic health record capability for servicemembers and veterans , develop a joint electronic record capability with dod , and promote increased electronic health record system interoperability .
to expedite the departments' efforts to exchange electronic health care information , congress included in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , provisions that required va and dod to jointly develop and implement electronic health record systems or capabilities and to accelerate the exchange of health care information .
as you know , these departments operate two of the nation's largest health care systems , which provide coverage to millions of veterans and active duty service members and their beneficiaries .
over many years , however , the departments have experienced challenges in managing a number of critical initiatives related to modernizing major systems .
in particular , what role , if any , that the office is to have in va's acquisition of the same electronic health record system that dod is currently acquiring is uncertain .
in addition , the act included a provision that gao report on the progress that va and dod have made in achieving the goal of fully interoperable personal health care information .
these have included initiatives to share viewable data in existing ( legacy ) systems ; link and share computable data between the departments' updated health data repositories ; develop a virtual lifetime electronic health record to enable private sector interoperability ; implement it capabilities for the first joint federal health care center ; and jointly develop a single integrated system .
we also incorporated information on the departments' actions in response to recommendations we made in our previous reports .
the office was given the function of implementing , by september 30 , 2009 , electronic health record systems or capabilities that would allow for full interoperability of personal health care information between the departments .
