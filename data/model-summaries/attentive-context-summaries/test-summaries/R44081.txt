committees have existed within the house and senate since the first congress .
communications to and within congress have evolved over the years .
initially , committees were ad - hoc — temporarily convened to address specific pieces of legislation and disbanded after reporting to the house or senate .
the system of permanent , standing committees was reinforced through changes made in the 1946 and 1970 legislative reorganization acts that further defined and refined committee jurisdiction .
by the early 1800s , both the house and senate "developed a system of permanent , or standing , committees" that were organized around topics instead of an individual piece of legislation .
for example , existing law and chamber regulations on the use of communication media such as the franking privilege have proven difficult to adapt to the new electronic technologies .
despite the advantage of having a direct avenue of communication open between the committee and these groups , electronic communications have raised some concerns .
these technologies have arguably served to enhance the ability of committees to share information directly with stakeholder groups , including other members , federal agencies , and individual private citizens .
political scientist stephen frantzich once described congress as "the vortex of three discrete communications flows: it is the target , sender , and subject matter of communication. .
the communication strategies of congressional committees have changed with the development of these online social networking services .
this includes how social media is altering how members organize and manage their personal and committee offices and impacting the ability of members to gather support for political and policy goals .
the idea that representatives , senators , and committees could communicate in real time with constituents was unfathomable .
technology available today was unheard of 20 years ago .
after providing an overview and background of social media platforms , the report analyzes patterns of committee use of twitter and facebook during a 4½ - month period in 2013 and discusses three potential implications of social media for committees in congress: increased direct interaction with the public , real - time interaction with advocacy groups , and outreach of public constituencies .
further , when representatives and senators wanted to solicit constituent opinions , those opinions "arrived only sporadically , and members had to augment fragmented information with creative intuition to assess constituent desires and possible reactions. .
many committees now use email , official websites , blogs , youtube channels , twitter , and facebook pages to communicate — technologies that were either nonexistent or not widely available until recently .
perhaps most importantly , social media may transform the very nature of representation in the united states .
as with any new technology , the number of committees using twitter and facebook and the patterns of use may change rapidly .
this report examines how congressional committees are using social media .
what follows is a brief discussion of three potential implications of social media for committees in congress: increased direct interaction with the public , real - time interaction with advocacy groups , and outreach of public constituencies .
these advances are altering how members organize and manage their personal and committee offices and impacting the ability of members to gather support for political and policy goals .
