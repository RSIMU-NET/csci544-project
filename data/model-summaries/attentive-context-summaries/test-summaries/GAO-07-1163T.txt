 ( 2 ) what issues could affect the overall cost of nextgen ? .
we appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on the future funding of the federal aviation administration ( faa ) .
among these sources are the current excise taxes , including fuel taxes ; certification and registration fees ; and flight surcharges .
 ( 3 ) what are the implications of selected provisions of proposals to fund aviation activities ? .
the president's budget proposes to spend $4.6 billion over the next 5 years for nextgen , including both capital costs and research and development costs .
the transformation to nextgen will involve the acquisition of numerous systems to support precision satellite navigation ; digital , networked communications ; integrated weather information ; and layered , adaptive security .
in 2003 , recognizing the need for a new and different type of air traffic control system to deal with the expected growth , congress authorized the creation of jpdo to lead a collaborative effort of federal and nonfederal aviation stakeholders to conceptualize and plan the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
as you know , the current authorization for faa , the airport and airway trust fund ( trust fund ) , and most of the excise taxes that provide revenue for the trust fund will expire at the end of this fiscal year .
as requested , my statement today will address the following questions: ( 1 ) to what extent can the current funding structure support faa's activities , including nextgen ? .
my remarks are based on recent gao reports and testimonies on faa's current funding structure , nextgen , and funding options that might address concerns about faa's current funding structure .
according to an analysis of future demand and system capacity that was conducted by the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) , the estimated cost to the u.s. economy of failing to meet future airspace demands could be $22 billion annually by 2023 .
as you know , faa operates one of the safest air transportation systems in the world , but this system is under growing strain as the demand for air travel increases .
several proposals , including two reauthorization bills — h.r .
according to faa , over 740 million passengers flew in fiscal year 2006 , and 1 billion passengers per year are expected to fly in 2015 .
2881 and s. 1300 — specify various revenue sources to fund faa , including nextgen .
the consensus is that the current air traffic control system cannot be expanded to meet this expected growth .
to accommodate this increased traffic , instrument flight rule operations — the most significant source of demand on the air traffic control system — are projected to rise by 36 percent , from roughly 45,000 per day to 61,000 per day over the same decade .
faa also predicts that 10,000 corporate aircraft , including traditional business jets , turboprops , and very light jets , will be added to the fleet between 2007 and 2017 .
finally , the extent to which faa employs public - private partnerships or leasing arrangements as part of its acquisition strategy for nextgen could affect the system's overall cost .
