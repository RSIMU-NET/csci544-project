specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) beneficiaries' potential financial liability under medicare's current benefit structure and cost - sharing requirements , ( 2 ) the cost of medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage , and ( 3 ) concerns that medigap's so - called “first dollar” coverage undermines the cost control incentives of medicare's cost - sharing requirements .
medicare provides valuable and extensive coverage for beneficiaries' health care needs .
most beneficiaries have additional supplemental coverage that helps to fill medicare's coverage gaps and pay some out - of - pocket expenses .
nevertheless , recent discussions have underscored the significant gaps that leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out - of - pocket costs .
however , concerns exist that supplemental coverage can be expensive and may undermine the legitimate role of cost sharing in a health insurance plan — to encourage cost - effective use of services .
i am pleased to be here today as you consider the need to modernize and strengthen the medicare program and review the role of supplemental “medigap” policies that many seniors buy to help improve their medicare coverage .
the other sources — employer - sponsored policies , medicare+choice plans , and medicaid programs — are not as widely available to all beneficiaries .
to assist the subcommittee as it considers proposals to improve coverage for beneficiaries and the financial health of the medicare program , my remarks today focus on the design of medicare's benefit package and the role of private supplemental coverage .
privately purchased medigap is an important source of this supplemental coverage because it is widely available to beneficiaries .
in summary , medicare's benefits package and cost - sharing requirements leave beneficiaries liable for high out - of - pocket costs .
at the same time , medicare's cost - sharing requirements are poorly targeted and fail to promote prudent use of services .
in addition , medigap first - dollar coverage eliminates the effect medicare's cost - sharing requirements could have to promote prudent use of services .
medigap policies that many medicare beneficiaries purchase help to fill in some of medicare's gaps but are themselves problematic .
as currently structured , medicare provides no limit on out - of - pocket spending and no coverage for most outpatient prescription drugs — a component of medical care that is of growing importance in treatment and rapidly increasing in cost .
while these policies pay for some or all medicare cost - sharing requirements , they do not fully protect beneficiaries from potentially significant out - of - pocket costs .
my comments are based on our prior and ongoing work on medicare and medigap as well as other published research .
the danger is that some services may be overused — ultimately increasing costs for beneficiaries and the medicare program .
in particular , some medigap policies offer prescription drug coverage , however , this coverage can be inadequate because beneficiaries still pay most of the cost and the maximum medigap benefit is capped .
premiums paid for medigap policies averaged $1,300 in 1999 , with 20 percent going to administrative costs .
