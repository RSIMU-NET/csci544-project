the objectives of this study were to determine: ( 1 ) what are the incidence and amount of retirement savings being withdrawn early ; ( 2 ) what is known about the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early ; and ( 3 ) what strategies or policies , if any , might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings .
this report examines: ( 1 ) the incidence and amount of retirement savings being withdrawn early ; ( 2 ) what is known about the factors that might lead individuals to access their retirement savings early ; and ( 3 ) what strategies or policies , if any , might reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals of retirement savings .
federal law encourages u.s. workers to save for retirement by authorizing tax incentives for the predominant forms of retirement savings in the united states â€” employer - sponsored defined contribution ( dc ) plans like 401 ( k ) plans and individual retirement accounts ( ira ) .
 ( recommendation 1 ) .
federal law also allows workers to access assets in employer - sponsored 401 ( k ) plans before retirement under certain circumstances , such as financial hardship .
you asked us to examine various aspects of early withdrawals of retirement savings from both iras and 401 ( k ) plans .
to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from individual retirement accounts ( ira ) and 401 ( k ) plans , we analyzed the most recent nationally representative data available in three relevant federal data sources , focusing our analysis on individuals in their prime working years ( ages 25 to 55 ) , when possible .
in 2017 , dc plans and iras reportedly held investments worth nearly $17 trillion dollars .
second , to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from 401 ( k ) plans , we analyzed the most recently available data on individuals collected in 2013 for the 2014 panel of the u.s. census bureau's survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) , along with its social security administration ( ssa ) supplement .
while such withdrawals occur for various reasons and can help workers facing financial difficulties , they can also affect a worker's long - term retirement security by reducing account assets and subjecting withdrawn amounts to additional taxation .
without clear data on the incidence of these loan offsets , which plan sponsors are generally required to include , ( but not itemize ) on the form 5500 , the overall extent of unrepaid plan loans in 401 ( k ) plans cannot be known .
to examine the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from iras and 401 ( k ) plans , we analyzed the most recent nationally representative data available from three relevant federal sources focusing on individuals ages 25 to 55 , when possible .
they noted that any of these proposed strategies , if implemented , could ( 1 ) increase the costs of administering iras and plans , ( 2 ) require changes to federal law or regulations , and ( 3 ) involve tradeoffs between providing access to retirement savings and preserving savings for retirement .
