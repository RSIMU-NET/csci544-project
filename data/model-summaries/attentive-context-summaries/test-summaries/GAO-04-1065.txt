two broad groups of u.s. - flag carriers compete for these food aid shipments: 1. those that participate in the maritime security fleet ( msf ) ( generally liners that carry containers on scheduled routes ) and receive a $2.1 million annual subsidy from the federal government and 2. those that do not ( generally carriers of bulk and bagged cargo that operate on a charter basis ) .
to answer these questions , we gathered and analyzed food aid shipment data for fiscal years 1999 to 2003 from the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of agriculture ( usda ) , and the maritime administration ( marad ) , as well as msf and cargo preference vessel data from marad and military contingency participation data from marad and the department of defense ( dod ) .
since no analysis had been conducted on the effects of such a change , the maritime security program was authorized without this provision , and we were directed to study the impact of placing a limitation on msf transportation of bagged food aid preference cargo .
food aid shipments must generally be transported on u.s. - flag ships under the requirements set by the cargo preference program .
how are the cargo preference and maritime security programs designed to meet their objectives and who participates in them ? .
how would establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation on msf vessels be expected to affect msf , other u.s. - flag ships , the cargo preference food aid program , and the ports servicing these ships ? .
what are the nature and extent of msf and non - msf carrier participation and competition in the food aid program ? .
as discussed with representatives of the house and senate committees on armed services and the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation , we have focused on answering the following questions: 1 .
in a legislative mandate in section 3535 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 ( p.l .
however , food aid agencies could face higher costs if the limits resulted in fewer and more expensive options for some shipments , and these agencies have emphasized their concerns that additional constraints on food aid shipments could impede their ability to provide food aid to meet critical humanitarian needs .
dod strongly supports both the cargo preference and maritime security programs .
during the debate on renewing the maritime security program and msf , the non - msf carriers complained that the msf subsidy put them at a competitive disadvantage , particularly for bagged food aid cargo .
as discussed with committee representatives , we have focused on answering the following questions: ( 1 ) how the cargo preference and maritime security programs are designed to meet their objectives and who participates in them ; ( 2 ) what the nature and extent are of msf and non - msf carrier participation in the food aid program ; ( 3 ) how establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation on msf vessels would be expected to affect the msf , other u.s. - flag ships , the cargo preference food aid program , and the ports servicing these ships .
