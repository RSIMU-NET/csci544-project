our prior work has highlighted problems with the cost , management , and oversight of the coast guard's acquisition portfolio that have led to delivery delays and other operational challenges .
the coast guard is managing a multi - billion dollar acquisition portfolio as it seeks to modernize its aging assets , including ships , planes , and information technology .
since 2001 , we have reviewed the coast guard's acquisition programs and reported to congress on the risks and uncertainties in its acquisition portfolio .
we reviewed ( 1 ) how selected assets are performing operationally and to what extent they are achieving desired performance levels in testing ; ( 2 ) the current cost of the coast guard's acquisition portfolio as well as plans to fund its assets ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the coast guard is experiencing capability gaps , if any , given known affordability issues .
overall , we concluded that the coast guard had made strides in its efforts to improve its acquisition management capabilities , and the department of homeland security ( dhs ) agreed with our recommendations to conduct a portfolio review and to identify the executive oversight council as the body to oversee the coast guard's portfolio management approach .
the plan should also consider trade - offs if the fiscal resources needed to execute the plan are not consistent with annual budgets .
for example , in a report issued in september 2012 , we found that the cost and schedule of the coast guard's acquisition portfolio remains unknown because of outdated baselines and uncertainty surrounding affordability .
a long term plan of this nature is particularly critical in light of the looming offshore patrol cutter procurement , which is currently estimated to account for about two - thirds of the acquisition budget .
we also found that opportunities exist to address affordability through the requirements process .
clarify the performance data that should be used to assess whether or not minimum performance criteria have been met , prior to full - rate production , to determine whether a performance breach has occurred .
to ensure that the coast guard's c4isr system meets mission needs , we recommend that the commandant of the coast guard take the following action: assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of the c4isr system by fully integrating this assessment into other assets' operational test plans or by testing the c4isr program on its own .
a pressing concern the coast guard faces is that the growing affordability gap for its major acquisitions will be exacerbated by impending requirements and capability needs .
thus , its ability to meet future needs is uncertain .
to assess what , if any , capability gaps exist given the coast guard's affordability issues , we reviewed funding needs , mission needs , future plans , and performance data and reviewed the coast guard's fiscal year 2014 and 2015 budgets .
we reviewed the coast guard's estimates of its overall fleet performance in key areas and also reviewed any current or potential performance gaps .
these capability gaps may persist as funding replacement assets will remain difficult at current funding levels .
to help the coast guard improve the long - term outlook of its portfolio , we recommend that the commandant of the coast guard take the following action: develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the identified assets .
