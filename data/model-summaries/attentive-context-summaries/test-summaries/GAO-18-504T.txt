today i will provide information from our ongoing and prior work , focusing on ( 1 ) snap e&t programs , including program participants , design , and fns oversight , and ( 2 ) fns's efforts to address program integrity , including improper payments and snap recipient and retailer fraud .
fns is responsible for authorizing and monitoring retailers from which recipients may purchase food , and states are responsible for determining applicant eligibility and investigating possible program violations by recipients .
jointly administered by usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) and the states , snap helps low - income households obtain a better diet by providing them with benefits to purchase food from authorized retailers .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our work on the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) â€” the largest federally - funded nutrition assistance program .
specifically , for our discussion of snap e&t programs , we analyzed data on snap e&t expenditures and participation collected by fns from the states for fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2016 , the most recent data available .
we also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations ; reviewed guidance and research from fns ; interviewed fns officials , as well as select state and local snap e&t staff from five states ; and reviewed our prior work on snap e&t programs .
in fiscal year 2017 , snap provided approximately $63 billion in benefits to about 42 million individuals in over 20 million households .
the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 ( known as the 2008 farm bill ) gave usda authority to impose higher monetary penalties , and the authority to impose both a monetary penalty and program disqualification on retailers found to have violated relevant law or regulations ( which includes those found to have trafficked ) .
to address the areas discussed in this testimony statement , we drew on our ongoing work on snap e&t programs , recipient fraud , retailer trafficking , as well as our prior work on improper payments .
in response to requests from the chairman and other members of this committee , we currently have work underway on snap e&t programs , as well as on snap recipient and retailer fraud .
the federal government pays the full cost of snap benefits and shares the costs and responsibility of administering the program and ensuring program integrity with the states .
in addition , we analyzed published fns quality control data on snap recipients and work registrants for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2016 .
we currently have ongoing work to assess the steps fns and states have taken to address our recommendations related to recipient and retailer fraud and other program vulnerabilities .
as we have reported in our prior work , both fns and states face challenges in addressing recipient and retailer fraud .
we also drew on our 2006 work on retailer trafficking , in which we reviewed fns reports on trafficking estimates ; visited fns field offices ; analyzed fns retailer data ; and interviewed federal officials , among others .
