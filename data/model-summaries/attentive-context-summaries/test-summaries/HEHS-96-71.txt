given the size of the eu market and the recent regulatory changes , advocates of reforming the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) have suggested that the new european drug approval process may provide some alternative approaches for improving the timeliness of fda's drug approvals .
to assist your committee in considering various fda reform proposals , you asked that we ( 1 ) determine how the eu now reviews and approves new drug applications ( nda ) and ( 2 ) explain why the emea was established , how it operates , and how it is financed .
the movement toward uniting individual european countries into a single marketplace has made the european union ( eu ) the largest pharmaceutical market in the world .
as part of its ongoing effort to establish a single european market for pharmaceuticals , the eu recently modified its drug approval procedures and created a new agency — the european medicines evaluation agency ( emea ) — to provide a faster and more efficient drug approval process that would benefit consumers and industry .
with a population of about 370 million , the eu represents a consumer base that is one - third larger than that of the united states .
moreover , the eu leads the world in the consumption of pharmaceutical products , using $82.7 billion worth of pharmaceutical products in 1992 , while the united states used about $54.8 billion .
to gather this information , we reviewed background documents , legislation , and status reports on the eu drug approval process and interviewed senior officials at the emea and the commission of the european communities , which oversees the emea's activities .
because this report uses european terms that may not be familiar to u.s. readers , we have defined these terms in a glossary at the end of this report .
we also interviewed representatives from two european - based pharmaceutical companies and two pharmaceutical trade associations , as well as several academics knowledgeable in european pharmaceutical policies .
regulatory and industry officials believe that this concern will be somewhat mitigated by the new procedures' use of two rapporteurs .
however , according to a senior commission official , the commission is likely to retain its oversight control by funding at least 20 percent of the emea budget in the future .
these procedures modify the former multistate and concertation procedures by ( 1 ) defining specific review steps and establishing time limits for review processes and ( 2 ) requiring member states to accept as binding , decisions that are issued by the commission .
however , these initial efforts were not successful because the commission did not require member states to accept drug approval decisions made by the commission or other member states .
as part of this effort , the commission has attempted to consolidate and harmonize many of the pharmaceutical regulations that have existed among the member states .
the central regulatory body in the eu that ( 1 ) drafts legislation in the form of directives and regulations designed to foster a single market in europe and ( 2 ) enforces eu rules .
pharmaceutical companies are now required to use the centralized procedure for biotechnology products and have the option to use it for other innovative products .
