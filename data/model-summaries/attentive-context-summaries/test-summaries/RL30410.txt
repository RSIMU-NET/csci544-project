many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty .
almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy .
in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment .
in striking down the admissions process at the university of texas school of law , the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit in hopwood v. texas concluded that any use of race in the admissions process was forbidden by the constitution .
justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is "a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education," noting that "[t]he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body. .
smith v. university of washington was the first federal appeals court to rely on justice powell's decision as binding precedent on the issue .
reverberations of the 1996 hopwood opinion are apparent in several subsequent cases , which voided race - conscious policies maintained by institutions of higher education , as well as public elementary and secondary schools .
restoring a degree of clarity to the law , the supreme court concluded its 2002 term with rulings in the michigan cases .
some judges avoided resolving the precedential effect of justice powell's opinion by deciding the case on other grounds not dependent on the constitutional status of student diversity as a compelling state interest .
a circuit court conflict was created when the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit relied on bakke to uphold an affirmative action admissions policy to the university of washington law school that made extensive use of race - based factors .
meanwhile , in 2014's schuette v. coalition to defend affirmative action , the court upheld michigan's proposal 2 , which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education .
the report then reviews major rulings involving challenges to the use of race - conscious admissions , and concludes with a discussion of the implications for the future of affirmative action law .
the judicial divide over bakke 's legacy was vividly underscored by a pair of separate trial court decisions , one upholding for diversity reasons the race - based undergraduate admissions policy of the university of michigan , the other voiding a special minority law school admissions program at the same institution .
but , in johnson v. board of regents , the eleventh circuit court of appeals sided with hopwood by rejecting diversity as constitutional justification for a numerical "racial bonus" awarded minority freshman applicants to the university of georgia .
to resolve this question , the court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools .
