recently , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) reached settlements with barclays , in which the british bank admitted submitting false responses to the survey used to calculate libor and the euro interbank offer rate ( euribor ) to manipulate the indexes .
american policymakers have a number of concerns , including the possibility that american banks that participate in the libor survey may also have attempted to manipulate the index , the effect that changes in libor can have on borrowers and lenders whose contracts reference libor to determine the interest rate of a loan , and the reliance of policymakers on libor as one of the indicators of the stability of the financial system .
this report answers several common questions regarding the london interbank offer rate ( libor ) , an index representing prevailing interest rates in london money markets .
libor is an index that measures the cost of funds to large global banks operating in london financial markets or with london - based counterparties .
the u.s. banks on the dollar panel include bank of america , citibank , and jpmorgan chase , although all of the listed banks have significant u.s. activities .
for brevity and ease of exposition , this report focuses on libor , although the manipulation and policy issues regarding euribor are similar .
the federal reserve bank of new york ( frbny ) reportedly raised concerns with barclays about its libor responses .
the settlement documents signed by barclays with the cftc and doj include employee emails that can be divided into three categories documenting manipulation: ( 1 ) changing the survey response for the benefit of barclays' derivatives trade positions , ( 2 ) changing the survey response to protect barclays' reputation , and ( 3 ) attempting to induce other banks to change their survey responses .
or , banks could use the federal funds rate as a benchmark , but that rate is subject to changes for policy reasons , not just market conditions .
it is possible for a single bank on the panel to affect the dollar libor if the bank's response would have been within the middle of the responses , or if it can change which responses are the middle responses .
one estimate by staff of the federal reserve bank of cleveland found that 45% of prime adjustable rate mortgages ( arms ) and 80% of subprime arms used libor as the benchmark .
differences in the type of borrower or the maturity of the loan may make other benchmarks less suitable for some purposes .
for the dollar libor , the highest 4 and lowest 4 responses of the 18 banks on the panel are thrown out , and the middle 10 are averaged .
because libor is meant to represent the cost of borrowing dollars by the largest banks in global financial markets , other lenders may choose libor if they believe that their own cost of funds is likely to follow a similar pattern over time .
alternatives to libor for private contracts exist , but may have shortcomings .
