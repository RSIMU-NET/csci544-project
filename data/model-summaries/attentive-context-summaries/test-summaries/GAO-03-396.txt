since the mid - 1990s , gao has highlighted the need for the department of state and other agencies to establish a systematic process for determining their overseas staffing levels .
in august 2001 , the president's management agenda directed all agencies to “rightsize” their overseas presence to the minimum necessary to meet u.s. foreign policy goals .
shortly after the 1998 bombings of two u.s. embassies in east africa , two high level independent groups called for the reassessment of staffing levels at u.s. embassies and consulates .
to support the long - standing need for a successful rightsizing initiative , in 2002 we developed a framework that identifies critical elements of embassy operations — physical security , mission priorities and requirements , and cost — and also includes rightsizing options for consideration .
our july 2002 report recommended that the office of management and budget ( omb ) use our framework to support the administration's rightsizing initiatives , starting with its assessments of staffing levels and rightsizing options at posts in europe and eurasia .
the questions provide a basis for decision makers to systematically link the elements of security , mission , and cost to embassy staffing levels and requirements .
the framework also includes questions on rightsizing options , including relocating staff to the united states or to regional centers , and competitively sourcing certain functions .
after responding to the questions , decision makers should then be in a position to determine whether rightsizing actions are needed to add , reduce , or change the staff mix at an embassy , and to consider rightsizing options .
this report presents the results of our work at three u.s. embassies we visited in west africa — the medium - sized post in dakar , senegal ; and two small embassies in banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania .
in response to omb's concerns , you requested that we determine whether the questions could be applied at u.s. embassies in developing countries .
to accomplish this objective , we applied the questions to each post in west africa by reviewing embassy planning and requirements documents and by interviewing embassy managers and officials in the department of state's bureau of african affairs regarding each embassy's security , mission , cost , and rightsizing options .
we also discussed security issues at those posts with officials in state's bureau of diplomatic security .
 ( see app .
the objective of our work at these embassies was to determine whether our rightsizing framework is applicable at u.s. embassies in developing countries .
however , because the questions were developed primarily based on our work at the u.s. embassy in paris , omb was not confident that the questions could be uniformly applied at all posts worldwide .
each element contains a set of corresponding questions for rightsizing the overseas workforce .
ii for the rightsizing framework and corresponding questions. ) .
however , the mission planning process neither specifically addresses embassy rightsizing as a policy or critical management issue nor calls for assessments of related security and cost issues affecting all agencies operating at overseas posts .
in addition , we met with officials in state's bureau of east asian and pacific affairs and the bureau of near eastern affairs to discuss the potential applicability of the framework at posts in other developing countries .
