i will provide a perspective on ( 1 ) fema's approach to mitigating flood - related losses through the flood insurance program and other grant programs , ( 2 ) the effect of repetitive loss properties on the flood insurance program , and ( 3 ) recent actions taken or proposed to address the impact of repetitive loss properties on the program by fema and the congress .
during the 10 years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2001 , flooding resulted in about $55 billion in damages and about 900 deaths .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is the primary federal agency responsible for assisting state and local governments , private entities , and individuals to prepare for , mitigate , respond to , and recover from natural disasters , including floods .
floods have been , and continue to be , the most destructive natural hazard in terms of economic loss to the nation , as well as the cause of hundreds of deaths in communities across the nation .
however , in the past , we have identified a number of concerns about the program's financial viability , including how repetitive loss properties have contributed to the program's long - term losses .
recent actions have been taken or proposed by the administration and members of congress to address the challenge posed by repetitive loss properties .
fema's national flood insurance program has served as a key component of the agency's efforts to minimize or mitigate the damage and financial impact of floods on the public , as well as to limit federal expenditures needed after floods occur .
the program has been credited by the administration with saving $1 billion annually by improving floodplain management and setting building standards — such as one to elevate structures — that have minimized flood damages .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to discuss the national flood insurance program and the effect on the program of repetitive loss properties — properties with two or more losses greater than $1,000 in a 10-year period .
during that period , the federal government paid about $7.7 billion in federal flood insurance claims financed primarily through policyholder premiums paid into the national flood insurance fund .
fema has taken a multifaceted approach to mitigating flood - related losses .
through the flood insurance program , fema identifies and maps flood prone communities and makes insurance available to property owners in communities that agree to adopt and enforce building standards to mitigate the impact of floods .
such outcome - based measures could allow fema to assess the impact of savings to the national flood insurance program resulting from its mitigation of repetitive loss properties .
these actions have the potential to reduce future program losses and improve the financial condition of the program .
fema also provides funding for mitigation planning activities and projects before and after floods occur through various mitigation grant programs .
while repetitive loss properties represent only about 1 percent of the current 4.4 million properties insured by the program , they have accounted for about 38 percent of all program claim costs historically and are projected by fema to cost about $200 million annually .
