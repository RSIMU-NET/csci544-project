two of the major goals of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( p.l .
107-110 ; nclb ) , are to improve the quality of k - 12 teaching and raise the academic achievement of students who fail to meet grade - level proficiency standards .
the arra appropriated $4.35 billion to the u.s. department of education ( ed ) for the rttt program .
since that time , appropriations legislation has continued to fund the rttt program in fy2011 ( approximately $700 million ) and fy2012 ( approximately $549 million ) .
in setting these goals , congress recognized that reaching the second goal depends greatly on meeting the first ; that is , quality teaching is critical to student success .
111-5 ) and , in particular , enactment of the race to the top ( rttt ) program .
attempts to improve teacher performance led to federal and state efforts to incentivize improved performance through alternative compensation systems .
the most recent congressional action in this area came with the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .
109-149 , congress authorized the federal teacher incentive fund ( tif ) program , which provides grants to support teacher performance pay efforts .
eligibility for funds is dependent on four broad areas of school reform outlined by ed: adopting standards and assessments that prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy ; building data systems that measure student growth and success , and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction ; recruiting , developing , rewarding , and retaining effective teachers and principals , especially where they are needed most ; and turning around the lowest - achieving schools .
two of the four school reform areas specifically address teacher improvement and teacher effectiveness .
in addition , there are various programs at all levels ( national , state , and local ) aimed at reforming teacher compensation systems .
meanwhile , policy makers have grown increasingly interested in the output of teachers' work ; that is , their performance in the classroom and the effectiveness of their instruction .
by articulating these reform areas , ed has provided an incentive to states to become more systematic about using student data to inform teacher instruction and to measure teacher effectiveness .
in november 2009 , ed released a final rule of priorities , requirements , definitions , and selection criteria for the rttt , which provided details on how states are expected to address the four school reform areas .
although there are other methods for assessing teacher effectiveness , in the last decade , vam has garnered increasing attention in education research and policy due to its promise as a more objective method of evaluation .
considerable interest has arisen pertaining to the feasibility of using vam on a larger scale â€” for instance , to meet rttt program eligibility requirements concerning the evaluation of teacher performance .
the latter point is elaborated on in the discussion that follows pertaining to the definition of effectiveness ( i.e. , "effective teacher" ) included in ed's rttt final rule .
