the nation's more than 17,000 school districts are responsible for maintaining the safety and security of approximately 49 million public school students .
events such as the recent shootings by armed intruders in schools across the nation , natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 , the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and potential pandemics have heightened awareness of the need for school districts to be prepared to address a range of emergencies within and outside of school buildings .
when discussing the federal government , i am primarily referring to the three agencies included in our report — the departments of homeland security ( dhs ) , education ( education ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) .
my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the role of the federal and state governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to school districts for emergency management planning , ( 2 ) what school districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies , and , briefly , ( 3 ) the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for emergencies and communicating and coordinating with first responders , parents , and students .
the federal government's role in emergency management is principally to support state and local activities and develop the federal capabilities to respond effectively when state and local governments require federal assistance .
“emergency management” refers to the range of efforts involved in building the capacity to prevent , protect against , respond to , and recover from an incident .
some federal support comes in the form of guidance and recommendations .
because the federal government serves as a partner to all states , it is uniquely positioned to observe and evaluate the range of emergency management activities across states and local governments , including school districts , and disseminate information on recommended practices and successful strategies .
we also administered two surveys , one to state education agencies and one to state administering agencies ( the state agencies to which dhs disburses emergency management funding ) in all 50 states and the district of columbia .
additionally , school districts are generally not training with their first responders ( i.e. , law enforcement , fire , and emergency medical services ) and community partners ( such as the local head of government and local public health agency ) , which are both federally recommended practices .
to determine the role of the federal and state governments , planning requirements for school districts and schools , and the types of resources provided to districts , we conducted interviews with officials representing dhs , education , and hhs and reviewed relevant federal laws .
my testimony today is drawn from ongoing work we have conducted for this committee and other congressional requesters on emergency management in school districts .
therefore , some states receiving this funding may be uncertain as to whether such funding can be allocated to school districts or schools ; and as a result , school districts may not have the opportunity to benefit from this funding .
in summary , federal and state governments support emergency management in school districts with a range of resources and most school districts have developed emergency management plans despite facing challenges ; however not all of these plans incorporate recommended practices .
