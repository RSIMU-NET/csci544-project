in the 1970s , the number of requests for tribal recognition by the department of the interior ( department ) increased exponentially in the wake of the decisions in united states v. washington , which recognized tribal treaty fishing rights in the pacific northwest , and joint tribal council of passamaquoddy v. morton , which recognized a tribal land claim on the east coast .
in the 19 th century and first half of the 20 th century , the federal government made determinations about which groups of indians were tribes on an ad hoc basis when negotiating treaties and determining which groups of indians could reorganize their governments under the indian reorganization act .
a positive determination under the regulations means that the group has inherent sovereign authority independent of the state in which it is located and independent of the united states , although it remains a domestic dependent nation .
one scholar on tribal acknowledgment explains the significance of tribal recognition as follows: an administrative determination that a group is a tribe ( i.e. , that it merits federal acknowledgment or recognition ) establishes a government - to - government relationship between it and the united states .
faced with many requests for tribal recognition , in 1978 , the department adopted a uniform process and uniform criteria for considering whether a group should be acknowledged as an indian tribe .
a tribe , consequently , has sovereign immunity and may exercise jurisdiction over its territory and establish tribal courts , administer funds under the indian self - determination and education assistance act , establish gaming facilities under the indian gaming regulatory act , bring a land claim under the indian trade and non - intercourse act , exercise treaty hunting and fishing rights , and obtain other federal benefits and exercise their own sovereign authority , except as limited by federal law .
for example , possession of liquor is prohibited in indian country absent publication of a certified liquor ordinance , and the sale of land is limited .
if a petitioner satisfied criterion ( e ) , ofa would then consider criteria ( a ) ( tribal existence ) , ( d ) ( governing document ) , ( f ) ( membership ) , and ( g ) ( congressional prohibition or termination ) .
accordingly , the proposed rule would change part 83 in an effort "to make the process and criteria more transparent , promote consistent implementation , and increase timeliness and efficiency , while maintaining the integrity of the process. .
thus , a determination that a group is or is not a tribe is a decision with significant impacts on the group itself , federal and state governments , other indian tribes , and non - indians .
current criteria 87.3 ( b ) and ( c ) require proof of community and proof of political authority from historical times to the present .
in may 2014 , interior proposed a new rule for part 83 that would comprehensively change the acknowledgment process .
first , the proposed rule would change criterion ( a ) from identification as an indian entity from 1900 to the present to a narrative explaining , and proof of , tribal existence at some point in 1900 or before .
