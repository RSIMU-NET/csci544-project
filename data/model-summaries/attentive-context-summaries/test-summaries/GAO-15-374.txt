the system , which is expected to enhance the intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , targeting , and strike capabilities of the navy's aircraft carrier fleet , is comprised of three segments: ( 1 ) air system , ( 2 ) aircraft carrier , and ( 3 ) control system and connectivity .
the navy expects to have invested at least $3 billion through fiscal year 2020 in the development of the unmanned carrier - launched airborne surveillance and strike ( uclass ) system .
program , and ( 2 ) the extent to which the navy has the knowledge about resources it needs to develop the uclass system .
at a minimum this report should include: an updated cost estimate ; a schedule for holding a milestone b review and establishing an acquisition program baseline before initiating system development ; plans for new preliminary design reviews and technology maturation if more demanding requirements are validated ; and what consideration is being given to adopting an evolutionary acquisition approach .
we reviewed department of defense ( dod ) acquisition policy including dod instruction 5000.02 and recent better buying power memorandums .
113-66 , ยง 213 ( d ) ( 2013 ) .
to assess the extent to which the navy has the knowledge about resources it needs to develop the uclass system , we applied best practice standards developed by gao for using key product knowledge to support program investment decisions , and identified and reviewed relevant legislation such as the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 .
in august 2013 , the navy awarded contracts worth $15 million each to four competing contractors to develop and deliver preliminary designs for the air system .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision that gao review the status of the uclass acquisition program annually .
on behalf of dod , the navy partially agreed with our recommendation .
the contractors delivered their preliminary designs , and the navy completed its assessment of their maturity in may 2014 .
congress has raised concerns about whether uclass will be armed and survivable enough to support u.s. power projection in areas in which access and freedom to operate are challenged .
the next anticipated steps for the uclass program will be to solicit proposals and award the contract for development , design , fabrication , test , and delivery of the air system .
in addition , congress has heard testimony from former dod and navy officials expressing concerns about the ability of uclass to help counter the defenses of adversaries trying to deny u.s. access .
congress , dod , and the navy continue to debate the primary role of the uclass system .
once the jroc has validated uclass requirements , and in order to ensure that the navy has a sound and executable business case and establishes an acquisition program baseline before awarding a development contract and committing significant resources , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy to provide a report to the congressional defense committees and the secretary of defense demonstrating that the navy has the resources available and a strategy to deliver those required uclass capabilities .
unsettled requirements will hinder the navy's ability to develop and present a business case with realistic cost and schedule estimates , and establish an acquisition program baseline .
