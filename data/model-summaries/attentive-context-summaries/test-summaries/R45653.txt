through its investigative powers , congress gathers information it considers necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary .
this "power of inquiry" is essential to the legislative function and derives directly , though implicitly , from the constitution's vesting of legislative power in the congress .
the information that congress seeks , whether to inform itself for lawmaking purposes or to conduct oversight , often lies in the executive branch's possession .
the use or threatened use of these powers in a way that would impose burdens on an agency can encourage compliance with subpoenas ( or make it more likely that requested information will be provided without need to issue a subpoena ) and solidify congress's position when trying to negotiate a compromise during an investigative dispute with the executive branch .
congress has only rarely resorted to either criminal contempt or civil enforcement to combat non - compliance with subpoenas .
this process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands .
congress exercises substantial power over the executive branch by controlling agency authority , funding , and , in the case of the senate , confirmation of executive officers .
besides leveraging its general legislative powers , congress currently relies on two formal legal mechanisms to enforce subpoenas: criminal contempt of congress and civil enforcement of subpoenas in the federal courts .
nor will this report address whether , under the circumstances , it was appropriate for congress to exercise its contempt power .
that said , the prevailing enforcement mechanisms of criminal contempt of congress and civil enforcement , both of which rely on the assistance and participation of the other branches of government , have certain drawbacks that arguably limit their effectiveness in ensuring timely compliance with congressional subpoenas by executive branch officials .
in three of the four instances , the house also looked to the federal courts for civil enforcement of the outstanding subpoena .
rather , this report will examine the legal enforcement of congressional subpoenas in a contemporary and historical context and discuss legal issues associated with alternative subpoena - enforcement frameworks that congress may consider to obtain information from the executive branch .
four times since 2008 , the house of representatives has held an executive branch official ( or former official ) in criminal contempt of congress for denying a committee information subpoenaed during an ongoing investigation .
the house's decision to resort to criminal contempt of congress and civil enforcement in these cases was not without controversy , as in each instance the executive official asserted that a constitutional privilege limited congress's right to the information sought .
congress's ability to issue and enforce its own subpoenas is essential to the legislative function and an "indispensable ingredient of lawmaking. .
in most circumstances involving the executive branch , committees can obtain the information they seek through voluntary requests or after issuing ( but not yet seeking enforcement of ) a subpoena .
recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate â€” at least in the relatively rare instance that enforcement is necessary to respond to a current or former executive branch official who has refused to comply with a subpoena .
