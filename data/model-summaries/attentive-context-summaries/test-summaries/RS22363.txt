107 - 252 ) established the federal election assistance commission ( eac ) and gave it the responsibility to develop and update a set of voluntary voting system guidelines ( vvsg ) .
the help america vote act of 2002 ( hava , p.l .
it established the technical guidelines development committee ( tgdc ) , chaired by the director of the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , to develop recommended guidelines for consideration by the eac .
hava's accessibility requirements went into effect in january 2006 , and many states have adopted new security requirements for voting systems , including paper - audit - trail requirements , in the wake of controversies that emerged subsequent to the passage of hava ( see crs report rl33190 , the direct recording electronic voting machine ( dre ) controversy: faqs and misperceptions ) .
the vvsg are a set of technical standards for voting systems that use computers to assist in recording or counting votes .
the 2005 vvsg provide a set of specifications and requirements to be used in the development of computer - assisted voting systems and their certification - testing by independent laboratories .
systems covered include most used in the united states â€” not only dres ( direct recording electronic systems ) such as touchscreen voting machines , but also optical scan and punch card systems .
funding has also been an issue .
some also believe that the added provisions are inadequate to meet accessibility , alternative language , and security needs and that broader and more stringent requirements are required .
the decision to limit the scope of revision resulted from a desire to meet urgent needs while creating a version that could be used in preparation for the 2006 election cycle .
it went into effect in december 2007 .
major revision focused on usability , accessibility for persons with disabilities , and security ; those sections were completely rewritten .
that absence has raised concerns about adequate state implementation of the requirement .
a draft of the completely rewritten second version was made available for public comment on october 31 , 2007 , at http: / / www.eac.gov / vvsg .
others believe that the limited changes in the 2005 vvsg are more likely to be implementable in the short term .
the vss , which remained in effect until the end of 2007 , were developed in response to concerns raised in the 1970s and 1980s about the then largely unregulated voting technology industry .
hava also provided an administrative structure under the eac for promulgating the guidelines and certifying systems , and also directed nist to assist in the certification process .
enacted in october 2002 , hava provided a statutory basis for the vss , which the act renamed guidelines , to distinguish them from the act's voting system requirements , which it called standards .
the vvsg replaced the federal voluntary vss originally developed under the auspices of the federal election commission ( fec ) .
the first version of the vvsg was approved in 2005 and is therefore called the 2005 vvsg in this report .
the 2005 version of the guidelines partially revised the vss , and some observers believe that the revisions should have been more comprehensive to address perceived shortcomings of the vss .
