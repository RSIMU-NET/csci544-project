to strengthen gsa mas program pricing and management , we recommend that the administrator of the general services administration take the following eight actions: in coordination with the gsa inspector general , target the use of pre - award audits to cover more contracts that meet the audit threshold ; fully implement the process that has been initiated to ensure that vendors that meet the pre - negotiation clearance panel threshold receive a panel review ; when considering the mas advisory panel recommendations to clarify the price objective and eliminate the price reduction clause , ensure that any alternative means to negotiate and determine best prices are validated and in place before eliminating these pricing provisions , collect transactional data on mas orders and prices paid , possibly through the expanded use of existing electronic tools or through a pilot data collection initiative for selected mas schedules and make the information available to mas contract negotiators and customer agencies , establish more consistent performance measures across the mas program , including measures for pricing ; take steps to increase the mas customer survey response rate by using a methodologically sound means to identify bona fide program users and employing survey techniques that produce meaningful and actionable information that can lead to program improvements ; clarify and strengthen the mas program office's charter and authority so that it has clear roles and responsibilities to consistently implement guidance , policies , and best practices across gsa's acquisition centers including policies and practices related to the above recommendations ; and report gsa's plans to address these recommendations to the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy .
these include the multiple award schedule ( mas ) program contracts ( also known as the federal supply schedule ) , multiagency contracts ( mac ) , and governmentwide acquisition contracts ( gwac ) .
as this spending has increased , there has been renewed focus on maximizing efficiencies in the procurement process to achieve cost savings .
to provide better transparency and a coordinated approach in awarding macs and enterprisewide contracts , we recommend that the director of the office of management and budget direct the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy to take the following five actions in conjunction with the agencies' senior procurement executives: survey departments and agencies to update the 2006 office of federal procurement policy interagency contracting data collection initiative to identify the universe of macs and enterprisewide contracts in use throughout federal departments and agencies and assess their utility for maximizing procurement resources across agencies ; ensure that departments and agencies use the survey data to accurately record these contracts in fpds - ng ; establish a policy and procedural framework in conjunction with agencies for establishing , approving , and reporting on new macs and enterprisewide contracts on an ongoing basis ; the framework should stress the need for a consistent approach to leveraging the government's buying power across departments and agencies while continuing to use their statutory authorities for buying goods and services ; assess the feasibility of establishing and maintaining a centralized database , which could provide sufficient information on gwacs , macs , and enterprisewide contracts , for contracting officers to conduct market research and make informed decisions on the availability of existing contracts to meet the agencies' requirements ; and as part of developing the pending far rule to implement the 2009 national defense authorization act , ensure that departments and agencies complete a comprehensive business case analysis as described by the sara panel , and include a requirement to address potential duplication with existing contracts , before new macs and enterprisewide contracts are established .
