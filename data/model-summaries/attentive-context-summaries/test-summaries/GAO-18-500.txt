while manufacturing , marketing , or other cost differences may contribute to gender - related price differences , some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may play a role .
gender - related price differences can occur when manufacturers differentiate their products to appeal separately to female and male consumers , such as with clothing , personal care products , toys , and other consumer goods .

we selected a random sample of gender - related consumer complaints from three databases managed by the bureau of consumer financial protection ( bcfp ) , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , and the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , respectively , and counted the number of complaints alleging a perceived gender - related price difference .
in addition , businesses may offer different prices to female and male consumers for services , such as dry cleaning or haircuts , to account for different costs , different consumer preferences , or other factors associated with providing services to different genders .
you asked us to review gender - related price differences for goods and services sold in the u.s. marketplace .
we used a multivariate regression model to estimate the effect of gender ( to which a product is targeted to ) on the price of that product while controlling for other factors that may also affect the product's price .
in addition , we interviewed agency officials from bcfp , ftc , hud , and the department of justice ( doj ) , as well as industry experts and academics , on gender - related price differences .
moreover , if female and male consumers pay different prices for similar products that they purchase frequently , such as personal care products , this could result in substantial differences in expenditures by gender over time .
to learn about the potential extent of consumer concerns about price differences that could be based solely on gender or sex , we analyzed federal data on consumer complaints and investigations .
