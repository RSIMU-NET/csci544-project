the information in this statement is based primarily on our march 1996 report entitled , drug control: u.s. heroin program encounters many obstacles in southeast asia , which was initiated at the request of this subcommittee.the statement covers ( 1 ) the extent and nature of the heroin threat to the united states , ( 2 ) impediments to successful heroin control efforts in southeast asia , and ( 3 ) the efforts of the united nations drug control program ( undcp ) in burma .
i am pleased to be able to provide this statement for the record on the results of our review of the production and trafficking of heroin from southeast asia to the united states and current efforts to stop it .
according to recent u.s. government reports , the u.s. heroin addict population , which had remained stable at about 500,000 persons for nearly two decades , has risen and is now about 600,000 or higher .
the lack of law enforcement cooperation between the united states and china continues to impede interdiction of key heroin - trafficking routes .
u.s. policy restricts direct counternarcotics assistance until the burmese government improves its human rights stance and recognizes the democratic process .
however , we found that the projects have not significantly reduced opium production because ( 1 ) the scope of the projects has been too small , ( 2 ) the burmese government has not provided sufficient support to ensure project success , and ( 3 ) inadequate planning has reduced project effectiveness .
the impact of u.s. regional interdiction efforts to date has been limited by the ability of traffickers to shift their routes into countries with inadequate law enforcement capability and by poor law enforcement cooperation between the united states and china .
the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) estimates that americans now consume 10 to 15 metric tons of heroin annually , an increase from the estimated 5 tons consumed during the mid - 1980s .
the bulk of the remaining cultivation and production occurred in the southwest asia region ( primarily afghanistan ) , accounting for about 20 percent of worldwide opium poppy cultivation and over 35 percent of opium production .
the united states does not have a significant counternarcotics program in burma because of u.s. concerns over human rights violations by the burmese government and the unwillingness of the burmese government to yield control of the country to a democratically elected government .
however , the united states faces the following significant obstacles in implementing this approach: since 1988 , the united states has not provided direct counternarcotics assistance to burma because of its record of human rights abuses and its refusal to yield control of the country to a democratically elected government .
cultivation in the region comprised of mexico and south america accounted for only about 5 percent of worldwide opium poppy cultivation and 3 percent of opium production .
although the u.s. international heroin strategy was signed by the president in november 1995 , guidelines to u.s. counternarcotics agencies for implementing the strategy are still under review .
the burmese government commitment to controlling opium production and trafficking within its borders is questionable .
in addition , there is a reported increase in the number of multiple - drug users who are using both heroin and crack cocaine .
