the current fiscal environment , including concern over the federal deficit , has heightened congressional interest in the costs of disasters , leading to proposals to offset some portion of disaster assistance spending by implementing new budgetary mechanisms .
in general , when a request is submitted , representatives from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) meet with the state and compile a preliminary damage assessment ( pda ) .
when a state is overwhelmed by an emergency or major disaster , the governor may request assistance from the federal government .
congressional concern over the rising number of declarations is primarily focused on their associated costs because once declared , the majority of disaster relief costs ( at least 75% ) are shifted from the state to the federal government .
the president has the authority to make the declaration or deny the request .
for example , are incidents increasing or is the federal government being more generous in its interpretation of disaster or emergency criteria ? .
under the stafford act , the primary federal agency responsible for coordinating the federal response is fema , located within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) .
related criticisms and questions have been voiced concerning the declarations process .
addressing the issue may be conceptualized as two approaches: ( 1 ) limiting the number of declarations and ( 2 ) limiting the amount of spending that can occur after a declaration has been made .
the average number of major disaster declarations issued per year in the 1960s ( the first full decade for declarations ) was roughly 18.6 .
the increase in declarations has led some critics to argue that thresholds for issuing major disaster declarations are set too low , allowing too many "marginal incidents" to receive a declaration .
if the increase in the number of declarations is a concern for the federal costs that accompany them ( or for other reasons which have been discussed in this report ) , congress may choose to address the issue .
today the principal authority governing federal assistance for emergencies and major disasters in the united states is the robert t. stafford relief and emergency assistance act ( p.l .
the federal government's openness in describing factors considered for declarations may have led some state officials to believe they have met the factors under consideration and are entitled to support .
in comparison to when disaster declarations were first introduced in 1953 , the average number of declarations issued per year has increased .
fema then makes a recommendation to the president concerning whether a declaration should be issued .
over the years , the disaster relief act has undergone a series of reforms and amendments , but the president's authority to issue declarations has been retained .
calendar year 2011 was the busiest year on record with 97 major disaster declarations .
many of the policy options described in this report would shift a greater share of disaster - related costs to states and localities .
if the increase is tied to state policies then mechanisms such as the use of loans or other incentives could be implemented to help decrease the number of state requests for assistance .
this report discusses a wide range of factors that might be contributing to the increase in declarations and provides policy options that might reduce the number of declarations and some of their associated costs .
