the surge of central american children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and who lack proper immigration documents is raising complex and competing sets of humanitarian concerns and immigration control issues .
by contrast , two statutes and a legal settlement ( as well as the ina ) most directly affect u.s. policy for the treatment and administrative processing of unaccompanied children: the flores settlement agreement of 1997 ; the homeland security act of 2002 ( hsa ; p.l .
