to ensure that comparable screening and monitoring services are available to all responders , we are recommending that the secretary of hhs expeditiously take two actions: ( 1 ) ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for federal responders and ( 2 ) ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for nonfederal responders residing outside of the nyc metropolitan area .
tens of thousands of people served as responders in the aftermath of the world trade center ( wtc ) disaster , including new york city fire department ( fdny ) personnel , federal government personnel , and other government and private - sector workers and volunteers from new york and elsewhere .
more than 5 years after the destruction of the wtc buildings , concerns remain about the physical and mental health effects of the disaster , the long - term nature of some of these health effects , and the availability of health care services for those affected .
specifically , in this report we assess the status of ( 1 ) services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , ( 2 ) niosh's efforts to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc metropolitan area , and ( 3 ) niosh's awards to grantees for treatment services , as well as efforts to estimate the cost of serving responders .
hhs continues to fund and coordinate the wtc health programs and has key federal responsibility for ensuring the availability of services to responders .
following the wtc attack , federal funding was provided to government agencies and private organizations to establish programs for screening , monitoring , or treating responders for illnesses and conditions related to the wtc disaster ; these programs are referred to in this report as the wtc health programs .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) funded the programs as separate efforts serving different categories of responders — for example , firefighters , other workers and volunteers , or federal responders — and has responsibility for coordinating program efforts .
we also reported that the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) , a component of hhs's centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) responsible for administering most of the wtc health programs for responders , had begun to take steps to provide access to screening , monitoring , and treatment services for nonfederal responders who reside outside the new york city ( nyc ) metropolitan area .
however , these efforts are not complete , and the stop - and - start history of the department's efforts to serve these groups does not provide assurance that the latest efforts to extend screening and monitoring services to these responders will be successful and will be sustained over time .
hhs commented that overall , our report is an accurate and appropriate account of its activities and accomplishments concerning health services for responders to the wtc disaster .
therefore , it is important for hhs to make a concerted effort , without further delay , to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the attack on the world trade center , regardless of who their employer is or where they reside .
