the department of labor's unemployment insurance ( ui ) program paid about $30 billion in benefits in calendar year 2001 to workers who lost their jobs .
in recent years , reports from labor's office of inspector general ( oig ) and others have identified numerous aspects of the ui program that may be vulnerable to overpayments and fraud .
in light of the dramatic increase in the number of unemployed workers filing for ui benefits in the past year and the program's potential exposure to fraud and overpayments , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent and type of overpayments in the ui program , including those that may be attributable to fraud or abuse ; and ( 2 ) the factors that contribute to overpayments in the ui program , as well as actions taken by labor to ensure program integrity .
the ui program is a federal - state partnership designed to partially replace the lost earnings of individuals who become unemployed through no fault of their own and to stabilize the economy in times of economic recession .
overpayments include payments that should not have been made or were made for incorrect amounts .
the health of each state's trust fund depends , in part , on the amount of taxes collected from employers ; current economic conditions , such as the level of unemployment ; and the ability of the state to control its benefit payments by accurately determining individuals' eligibility for ui benefits in a timely manner .
use the annual administrative funding process or other funding mechanisms to develop incentives and sanctions that will encourage state compliance with payment accuracy performance measures .
key to this is sustaining its efforts to expand state access to ssa's online database for verifying the accuracy of ssns and developing more efficient automated means to help states verify claimants' employment status and any income they may be receiving in other states .
also , labor already possesses systems such as wris that , with some modification , could potentially help states verify claimants' eligibility information in other states more efficiently .
in particular , the report acknowledges the fact that some types of overpayments are more difficult for states to detect and prevent than others , and therefore present additional challenges for states in ensuring payment accuracy .
inaccurate or untimely eligibility information may contribute to overpayments and fraud and place unnecessary burdens on a state's trust fund .
labor questioned our assessment that it has not fully utilized its quality assurance data to improve state operations .
we also reviewed overpayment data from labor's benefit accuracy measurement ( bam ) and benefit payment control ( bpc ) systems .
states are also unlikely to voluntarily increase their overpayment recovery efforts .
while implementing changes to existing systems would likely entail some additional administrative costs for labor and the states , the results of this review and our prior work in other programs suggests that the savings that result from enhanced payment accuracy procedures ( such as online access to important data sources ) and increased attention to preventing and detecting overpayments could outweigh these costs .
finally , labor has given limited attention to overpayment collections .
