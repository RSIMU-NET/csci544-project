this lack of consensus is the result of the confluence of factors and events that occurred during the nearly 70 years from when the glass - steagall act was enacted until its partial repeal by the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) in 1999 .
these factors include statutory changes to both the four glass - steagall act provisions and other laws that indirectly impacted the permissible securities activities of commercial banks ; evolving interpretations of the glass - steagall act by both federal administrative agencies and the courts ; and changes in financial markets and economic conditions .
the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) was congress's primary legislative prescription to prevent a similar financial crisis in the future .
it did , however , include some arguably glass - steagall - like provisions , which were designed to , among other things , address perceived inadequacies of the financial regulatory system at the time of the great recession so as to promote financial stability going forward ; reduce various speculative activities of banks ; and reduce the likelihood that the u.s. government would have to provide taxpayer support to avert or minimize a future financial crisis .
in this context , commercial banking refers to the activities engaged in by depository institutions , which this report also will refer to as "banks" or "commercial banks. .
congress effected a separation of commercial and investment banking through four sections of the banking act of 1933 — sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32 — that were designed "to prevent the undue diversion of funds into speculative operations...." these four statutory provisions are commonly referred to as the glass - steagall act .
some believe that a more effective way of accomplishing these policy objectives would be to fully reinstate the glass - steagall act .
however , the exposure of a securities firm to price volatility primarily depends on the degree to which the securities firm has traded for its own account ( proprietary trading ) or otherwise contractually committed to the securities , rather than merely serving as the middleman for customers ( whether buyers or issuers of securities ) .
in contrast , investment banking refers to activities engaged in by securities dealers and brokerage firms , which this report also refers to as "investment banks" or "securities firms. .
the phrase "glass - steagall" generally refers to the separation of commercial banking from investment banking .
in fact , multiple bills have been introduced in the 114 th congress with that stated purpose .
the dodd - frank act neither reinstated the sections of the glass - steagall act that were repealed by glba nor substantially modified the ability of depository institutions to affiliate with securities firms .
on the other hand , some policymakers argue that glass - steagall issues were not significant causes of the crisis , and that the glass - steagall act would have made responding to the crisis more difficult if it had remained in place .
others argue that the glass - steagall act is ill - suited for the current financial system and that the recent financial crisis would have occurred even if glba had never partially repealed the glass - steagall act .
