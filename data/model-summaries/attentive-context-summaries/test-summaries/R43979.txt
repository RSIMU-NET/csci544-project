according to form 18 , a complaint for patent infringement needed to include four statements that assert jurisdiction , patent ownership , patent infringement by the defendant , and a demand for relief .
both the innovation act and patent act would also explicitly eliminate the federal rules of civil procedure's form 18 .
similarly , both bills also exempt from the proposed heightened pleading requirements any civil action that includes a claim for relief arising under section 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) of the current patent act relating to certain drug claims .
