ltss can be provided in institutional or home - and community - based settings and comprise a broad range of health care , personal care , and supportive services to help individuals with limited ability for self - care maintain their quality of life .
to improve available data about the direct care workforce , we recommend that the acting administrator of the health resources and services administration take steps to produce projections of direct care workforce supply and demand and develop methods to address data limitations in order to do so .
these concerns are heightened by the large increase expected in the number of people ages 65 and older , who are projected to comprise one - fifth of the u.s. population by 2030 .
for example , the congressional commission on long - term care reported in 2013 that a number of states have experienced shortages and high attrition of direct care workers but lack data to help them assess the size of the problem .
hrsa , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for ensuring that americans have access to a skilled health workforce .
while policymakers and other stakeholders are aware of the challenges in recruiting and retaining direct care workers , their ability to develop relevant , targeted policies addressing these challenges has been hampered by gaps in data .
high reported attrition rates and persistent challenges recruiting and retaining direct care workers , however , have fueled long - standing concerns by experts and policymakers about the capacity of this workforce to meet ltss demands .
the commission recommended that an appropriate federal agency , such as the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , initiate a process to collect detailed data about the direct care workforce and launch comprehensive data collection efforts .
unless hrsa takes actions to overcome data limitations in order to make projections of supply and demand , the ability of policymakers and other stakeholders to develop appropriate workforce strategies to ensure a sufficient number of qualified direct care workers will continue to be hampered .
the study also recommended that states collect a minimum dataset about their direct care workforces that includes three elements: ( 1 ) the number of direct care workers ; ( 2 ) workers' compensation ( wages and benefits ) ; and ( 3 ) workforce stability measures ( attrition and vacancy rates ) .
within hrsa , the national center for health workforce analysis helps build a body of knowledge about the health workforce by projecting the supply of and demand for u.s. health workers and developing methods to inform health workforce decisions .
1. available federal and selected state data about the direct care 2. actions hrsa has taken to develop information , project supply and demand , and overcome data limitations related to the direct care workforce .
given the concerns about the ability of the direct care workforce to meet current and future demands for ltss and the reported lack of data needed to estimate the size and characteristics of this workforce , you asked us for current information about direct care workers who provide ltss , such as their wages , hours , and attrition rates .
while existing federal data sources provide a broad picture of the direct care workforce , gaps exist , such as the lack of information on independent providers and attrition .
