therefore , this estimate may not cover the full cost of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems .
this report examines ( 1 ) potential safety impacts of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs for commercial motor carriers and their drivers , and ( 2 ) factors that could affect the feasibility and cost of establishing a system for self - reporting equipment problems and repairs .
one of the challenges in assessing the safety impact of a potential system for self - reporting equipment problems is its hypothetical nature .
to perform this work , we reviewed relevant regulations , information on other existing systems for self - reporting safety - related information , ( fmcsa's national consumer complaint database and the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) aviation safety action program ) , and our past work on fmcsa's compliance , safety , accountability ( csa ) program .
large trucks and buses transport billions of tons of freight and travel hundreds of billions of miles every year on our nation's highways .
the office of management and ( omb ) and the department of transportation ( dot ) provide guidance on estimating a program's societal impact , such as its health and safety benefits , through a benefit - cost analysis .
the federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) sets requirements in regulations for the operating condition of vehicles operated by commercial motor carriers ( “carriers” ) .
to examine the potential safety impacts of this hypothetical self - reporting system , we identified existing guidance ( office of management and budget and department of transportation ) on estimating the benefits of a new government program .
while we cannot estimate costs for the type of self - reporting system described in this report with any degree of confidence , fmcsa broadly estimated that a self - reporting system would cost between $5 and $10 million to establish and operate for the first year .
for a new program designed to affect safety , identifying the base case and the potential benefits of the new program generally requires data on past events related to the type of bad outcomes ( i.e. , injuries and deaths ) that the new program is expected to reduce .
in 2014 , we reported on the effectiveness of sms and found that fmcsa faces challenges in reliably assessing safety risks for the majority of carriers .
fmcsa officials said this estimate did not use other dot self - reporting systems as a benchmark nor did it explicitly include training , testing , or data storage — some of the factors that gao's cost - estimating guide identifies as key to establishing and maintaining a new electronic system .
if a driver identifies some aspect of his or her vehicle's equipment that is out of compliance with these regulations — for instance brakes that do not adequately stop and hold the vehicle — the carrier ( or its agent , e.g. , the driver or a repair facility ) is responsible for repairing the problem before the vehicle is on the road .
to enforce compliance with fmcsa regulations , fmcsa partners with states' law enforcement agencies and others to perform roadside inspections of commercial motor vehicles .
