in response , congress and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries .
t he constitution gives no direct role to congress in conducting federal law enforcement .
this report first analyzes the use of special prosecutors and independent counsels that were authorized under now - expired provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 , as well as the use of special counsels that are currently authorized by doj regulations .
because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself , however , there have often been calls for prosecutors with independence from the executive branch .
these responses have attempted , in different ways , to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials .
while congress enjoys the legislative power under article i of the constitution , which includes substantial authority to investigate the executive branch pursuant to its oversight function , criminal investigations and prosecutions are generally considered core executive functions entrusted with the executive branch un der article ii .
several bills introduced in the 116 th congress ( including s. 71 and h.r .
for instance , the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the since - expired independent counsel statute in the 1988 case of morrison v. olson , but has not applied the reasoning of morrison in subsequent cases raising related issues .
197 , which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115 th congress , s. 1735 and s. 1741 ) statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal , echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute's provisions .
the constitutional status of a statutory framework analogous to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate .
whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in morrison .
a glossary of terms at the beginning of the report briefly defines these italicized terms ( see table 1 ) .
the report continues with an examination of various legal questions relevant to these efforts .
more broadly , designing a statutory framework for criminal investigations and prosecutions with independence from the executive branch raises questions about how this can be achieved consistent with the requirements of the constitution .
as a threshold matter , some have challenged the appointment of a special counsel under the current regulations as unconstitutional under the appointments clause .
in part to counter perceptions that executive officials suspected of criminal wrongdoing may be subject to different standards than individuals outside the government , independent investigations have sometimes been used to determine whether officials have violated the law .
the court has , however , recognized that congress may in certain situations restrict the president's power of removal over certain discrete offices .
the powers of appointment and removal are key to understanding congress's authority to create independent investigative offices and define their contours .
the government has used a range of options to conduct these types of inquiries: special prosecutors , independent counsels , and special counsels .
congress enacted the ethics in government act of 1978 out of a broad intent "to preserve and promote the integrity of public officials and institutions. .
