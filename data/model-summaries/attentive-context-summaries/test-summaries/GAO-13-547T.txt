my statement today is based on these reports and addresses ( 1 ) opportunities for dhs to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; save tax dollars ; and enhance revenue , and ( 2 ) opportunities for dhs to strengthen its management functions .
since beginning operations in 2003 , dhs has become the third - largest federal department , with more than 224,000 employees and an annual budget of about $60 billion .
over the past 10 years , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on opportunities for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to eliminate fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; enhance revenue ; and improve management functions at the department .
dhs has implemented more than 60 percent of these recommendations and has actions under way to address others .
further , failure to effectively address dhs's management and mission risks could have serious consequences for u.s. national and economic security .
since 2003 , we have made approximately 1,800 recommendations to dhs across more than 1,300 reports and congressional testimonies designed to strengthen program management , performance - measurement efforts , and management processes , and enhance coordination and information sharing , among other things .
however , the department has more to do to ensure that it conducts its missions efficiently and effectively while simultaneously preparing to address future challenges that face the department and the nation .
reducing or eliminating fragmentation , overlap , or duplication could potentially save billions of tax dollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and effective services .
moreover , in february 2013 , we reported on dhs's efforts to address the high - risk area of strengthening the department of homeland security management functions .
we first designated this area as high - risk in 2003 because dhs had to consolidate 22 agencies — several with major management challenges — into one department .
since 2011 , we have identified 162 areas across the federal government where congress or executive branch agencies , including dhs , could take action to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication or achieve cost savings to address the rapidly building fiscal pressures facing our nation.we reported that fragmentation among government programs or activities can be a harbinger of potential overlap or duplication .
on april 9 , 2013 , we issued our third report in response to the statutory requirement that we identify and report annually on federal programs , agencies , offices and initiatives that have duplicative goals or activities .
for these past reports , among other things , we analyzed dhs documents , reviewed and updated our past reports issued since dhs began its operations in march 2003 , and , interviewed dhs officials .
dhs has indeed made significant strides in protecting the homeland , but has yet to reach its full potential .
we recommended that dhs modify acquisition policy to better reflect key program and portfolio management practices and ensure acquisition programs fully comply with dhs acquisition policy .
further , dhs has taken steps to strengthen its management functions and integrate them across the department ; however , continued progress is needed to mitigate the risks that management weaknesses pose to mission accomplishment and the efficient and effective use of the department's resources .
