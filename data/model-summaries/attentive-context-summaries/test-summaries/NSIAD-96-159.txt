to improve the nation's surface transportation system over a 6-year period ending in fiscal year 1997 , the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( [istea] , public law 102-240 , dec. 18 , 1991 ) authorized $155 billion .
although istea primarily authorized highway construction and improvements , it also emphasized how intermodal connections can enhance the nation's transportation infrastructure .
we reviewed ( 1 ) the department of transportation's ( dot ) efforts to track how states use istea funds for facilitating intermodal transportation and the nature and extent of istea funds used by states for intermodal freight projects , ( 2 ) how some local and regional areas that handle a large volume of freight have considered intermodal freight transportation issues as part of their planning process , and ( 3 ) what kind of impediments some areas face in improving intermodal freight transportation .
in preparation for reauthorization of istea , you asked us to review several intermodal freight transportation issues .
intermodal connections link the various transportation modes — highways , rail , air , and maritime facilities .
according to the national commission on intermodal transportation's 1994 report , these connections are typically the weakest links in the nation's transportation system .
these include operational problems at intermodal facilities ( compatibility among freight tracking systems ) ; regulatory and institutional barriers ( the lack of standardized transportation regulations ) ; and financial constraints ( inadequate funding for intermodal improvements ) .
economists and transportation planners believe that productivity and efficiency gains can be achieved by improving intermodal connections .
to obtain information for this report , we ( 1 ) reviewed istea and its legislative history ; ( 2 ) interviewed dot headquarters and regional officials ; ( 3 ) interviewed state , local , and private sector officials ; ( 4 ) interviewed representatives of major transportation organizations ; ( 5 ) reviewed dot data from fiscal years 1992 to 1995 showing the funding status of istea - authorized priority intermodal projects ; and ( 6 ) reviewed volumes of dot data highlighting projects funded with the two categories of istea money that dot officials believed states would most likely use to fund intermodal freight projects .
in addition , we developed information on intermodal freight transportation trends .
based on our review of department of transportation ( dot ) data and interviews with public and private sector officials , we attempted to identify intermodal freight projects financed with the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) funds not specifically targeted for priority projects ( see table i.1 ) .
dot officials gave us the following reasons why they have not developed the data base: ( 1 ) dot has a limited role in managing how funds are allocated because states are given primary responsibility for allocating funds according to broad program categories ; ( 2 ) the term “intermodal” is subject to interpretation , and projects may not be identified consistently among states ; and ( 3 ) intermodal projects may be financed from multiple sources , including federal , state , and local funds , and it may be difficult to identify istea funds used for this purpose .
states have provided dot with detailed information about the use of istea funds on a project - by - project basis ; this information has been entered into dot's computer information system .
