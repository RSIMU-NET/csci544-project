congressional support for the legislation was motivated , in part , by concerns that the united states had not given wash programs sufficient priority and that these efforts needed to be better aligned with u.s. foreign aid programs , particularly global health efforts .
these programs are monitored and reported by the department of state and implemented primarily by usaid and the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) .
