the department of defense ( dod ) is faced with a variety of challenges as it seeks to maximize the return on its roughly $70 billion annual investment in weapon system research and development .
our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) how the department of defense ( dod ) has used prototyping prior to system development on major defense acquisition programs , and ( 2 ) what steps dod has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities conducted outside of major defense acquisition programs .
this report assesses ( 1 ) how dod has used prototyping prior to system development on major defense acquisition programs , and ( 2 ) what steps dod has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities conducted outside of major defense acquisition programs .
at risk of having its dominance disrupted , dod has been looking for innovative ways to sustain and advance its military superiority .
congress has enacted legislation with numerous prototyping - related provisions .
a major defense acquisition program ( mdap ) is a program that is designated as such or is estimated by dod to require an eventual total expenditure for research , development , test , and evaluation ( rdt&e ) of more than $480 million , or for procurement of more than $2.79 billion , in fiscal year 2014 constant dollars , for all increments .
it can also help ensure that new , innovative , and disruptive technologies are available for inclusion into potential future weapons and demonstrate the value of new technologies or systems .
over the past few years , dod has acknowledged the importance of prototyping to maintain the u.s. military's capability to rapidly address emerging threats and provide technological surprise , as it has in the past through capabilities including stealth and precision weapons .
prototyping — the development and testing of a model or system design that uses available or emerging technologies — can be employed in weapon system acquisition programs to reduce risk by maturing technologies and to improve understanding of a potential system's likely design , feasibility , cost , and schedule before making major funding commitments .
to determine how dod has used prototyping in mdaps , we examined 22 mdaps that entered system development between december 2009 — which is when dod implemented new prototyping requirements enacted by congress in the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( wsara ) — and february 2016 .
house report 114-102 accompanying a bill for the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2016 included a provision that we review how dod's research and development funds are used and whether this approach effectively supports activities such as prototyping .
while it is generally acknowledged that u.s. weapon systems are the best in the world , there is concern within dod and elsewhere that american dominance in key warfighting domains is eroding as potential adversaries modernize their weapon system capabilities at a rapid rate .
expand the community of interest working groups to include budget activity 6.4-funded prototyping and innovation initiatives in their science and technology planning and coordination processes or employ a similar coordination mechanism for budget activity 6.4- funded prototyping and innovation initiatives .
dod has taken several steps to adopt aspects of private sector innovation practices and has developed mechanisms to coordinate and review its science and technology investments , but without a more strategic , inclusive , and deliberate approach overall , its new prototyping and experimentation initiatives might not generate the levels and types of innovation the department is seeking .
