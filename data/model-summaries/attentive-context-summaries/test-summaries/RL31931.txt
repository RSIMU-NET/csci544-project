in 1992 , the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases .
since then , the bush administration has focused u.s. climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions .
over the past 16 years , a variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states , including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions , improved appliance efficiency , and incentives for developing renewable energy sources .
this focus was particularly evident in the administration's 2006 climate action report ( car ) submitted under the provisions of the unfccc .
further , in june 2008 , the senate considered legislation ( s. 3036 ) to enact an economy - wide cap - and - trade system to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions .
a cap - and - trade system is the favored approach of the incoming administration , and similar legislation may have a better chance of passage in the 111 th congress .
current major regulatory programs that monitor or reduce greenhouse gas emissions are identified , along with their estimated effect on greenhouse gas emissions .
in 2001 , president george w. bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc , which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
climate change is viewed as a global issue , but proposed responses generally require action at the national level .
this report provides background on the evolution of u.s. climate change policy from ratification of the unfccc to the george w. bush administration's rejection of the kyoto protocol programs , to the present .
the energy independence and security act ( eisa ) of 2007 directly addresses some climate change issues , but still generally focuses on energy supply and consumption .
it should be noted that reductions from these programs combined represent about 3% of year 2000 greenhouse gas emissions , and total u.s. emissions have continued to grow: emissions increased approximately 3% between 2000 and 2005 ; emissions have grown approximately 17% since 1990 .
the list of federal regulatory programs discussed here is primarily drawn from activities listed by the george w. bush administration in its most recent ( 2006 ) submission to unfccc .
in this sense , they could be considered the results of a "no regrets" policy in which climate change effects resulting from related air quality and energy policies are included in the decision - making process on new or modified rules .
finally , energy legislation enacted in the 109 th and 110 th congresses that could directly or indirectly reduce greenhouse gases is discussed .
these regulatory programs were generally implemented to achieve energy or environmental goals other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , but produced a concomitant emissions reduction .
in its 2007 decision in massachusetts v. epa , the supreme court found that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the clean air act .
this will be a pivotal challenge to the 111 th congress's and the incoming administration's anticipated efforts to enact legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
