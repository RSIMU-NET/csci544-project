and it is through the budget process that congress and the president reach agreement about the areas in which the federal government will be involved and in what way .
the budget determines the fiscal policy stance of the government — that is , the relationship between spending and revenues .
budgeting is the process by which we as a nation resolve the large number of often conflicting objectives that citizens seek to achieve through government action .
my testimony today outlines some elements that could facilitate debate and contribute to efforts to place the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path .
our increased awareness of the dangers presented by the long - term fiscal outlook leads to a focus on enforcement provisions within the budget process that can facilitate the debate and contribute to efforts to put the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path .
while concerns about the strength of the economy may argue for phasing in policy changes over time , the longer action to change the government's long - term fiscal path is delayed , the greater the risk that the eventual changes will be more disruptive and more destabilizing .
it is a pleasure to be here today as you consider the role and design of appropriate budget enforcement mechanisms in changing the government's fiscal path .
we have all heard the statement “the process is not the problem ; the problem is the problem,” which in this case is the federal government's unsustainable fiscal path .
but at the same time we want a process that presents congress and the american people with a framework to understand the significant choices and the information necessary to make the best - informed decisions about federal tax and spending policy .
since our first simulations in 1992 , we have continued to report on the nature and drivers of the long - term imbalance and on mechanisms to help address the challenge .
as the committee knows , we have been raising concerns about the long - term trajectory of the budget for nearly two decades .
starting on the path to sustainability now offers many advantages .
our first long - term simulation of the federal budget path was issued in 1992 for members of the finance and budget committees .
focusing on the long term does not mean ignoring the near term .
because these decisions are so important , we expect a great deal from our budget and budget process .
carefully designed mechanisms , however , can enforce agreements that have already been made and ensure compliance .
this is not easy .
we want the budget to be clear and understandable .
as in 1992 , our latest simulations continue to show that the federal budget is structurally unbalanced and on an unsustainable path .
a process should 1. provide information about the long - term effect of decisions , both macro — linking fiscal policy to the long - term economic outlook — and micro — providing recognition of the long - term spending implications of government commitments 2. provide information and be structured to focus on important trade - offs such as the trade - off between investment and consumption spending .
