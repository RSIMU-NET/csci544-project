on april 20 , 2010 , the deepwater horizon oil drilling rig was reportedly nearing completion of a deepwater oil well ( owned by bp ) when an uncontained release of hydrocarbons ( oil and natural gas ) caused explosions and fire , resulting in 11 crew member fatalities .
the incident produced the largest oil spill that has occurred in u.s. waters , eclipsing the magnitude of the 1989 exxon valdez spill after four to five days .
based on the most recent estimate from the federal government's flow rate technical group , the deepwater well ultimately released more than 200 million gallons ( or 4.9 million barrels ) of crude oil ( see "well flow rate estimates" below ) .
the uncertainty range of this estimate ( + / - 10% ) is equivalent to two exxon valdez - size spills in either direction .
the fate of the oil may be of interest to policymakers for other reasons , including oversight of oil spill response performance and assessment of the government's capability to monitor oil spills in the environment .
the spill spanned approximately 84 days , and following several attempts , responders gained control of the oil discharge on july 15 , 2010 .
some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil's fate .
because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders .
multiple challenges hinder this objective: the complexity of the gulf system ; resources required to collect data ; and varied interpretations over the results and observations .
the impact of the 2010 gulf spill is still being assessed and will likely continue to be assessed for years to come .
for the purposes of this report , the term fate refers to the oil itself , not its actual or potential impacts on the gulf ecosystems or organisms .
where is the remaining oil and what is its physical and chemical state ? .
these perceptions may be influenced by multiple factors , including oil spill assessments and their methods , the group that prepared the assessment ( and perceived biases of the group ) , and the manner in which the assessment is presented .
on august 4 , 2010 , the national incident command ( the spill response leadership team of the federal government ) made public an estimate of the oil spill budget for the deepwater horizon incident .
it is debatable whether the fate of the remaining oil will ever be established conclusively .
one of the more comprehensive of these studies was released december 17 , 2010 , by the unified command's operational scientific advisory team ( osat ) .
if policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment , attention to oil spill's consequences and associated impacts may wane .
researchers are continuing to study various components of the gulf , specifically damages to natural resources .
according to the federal government's geoplatform database , august 20 , 2010 , was the first day since the spill's start in which no oil was observed on the ocean's surface .
