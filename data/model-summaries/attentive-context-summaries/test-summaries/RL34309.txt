congress uses data from the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) , the national incident - based reporting system ( nibrs ) , and the national crime victimization survey ( ncvs ) to inform policy decisions and develop appropriate responses to crime .
this report reviews ( 1 ) the history of the ucr , the nibrs , and the ncvs ; ( 2 ) the methods each program uses to collect crime data ; and ( 3 ) the limitations of the data collected by each program .
for example , in the 103 rd congress , the community oriented policing services ( cops ) program was created to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with grants to help them hire , rehire , and redeploy law enforcement officers to engage in community policing .
such crime data have been used to shape policy in a variety of ways .
in addition , the house and the senate appropriations committees increased funding for the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) to hire additional agents to investigate violent crime .
for example , the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant ( jag ) program formula uses ucr data to allocate federal funds to state and local governments for criminal justice programs .
moreover , both the house and senate appropriations committees recommended increased funding for state and local law enforcement to support efforts to fight and prevent crime .
1700 ) that would increase authorized funding for and expand the scope of the cops program .
in addition to shaping policy , congress has used crime data to develop formula allocations for certain grant programs .
in the 110 th congress , two bills have been introduced ( s. 368 and h.r .
because of the importance of crime data in both shaping policy and allocating federal funding , it is important to understand how each program collects data and the limitations of the data .
the house report that accompanied the house commerce , justice , and science appropriations bill stated that the committee was concerned about the recent increase in the violent crime rate .
the committees felt it was important for the fbi to help state and local law enforcement investigate violent crime in light of the recent increase in the violent crime rate .
the aforementioned legislation and congressional action were based on crime data collected by the ucr and the ncvs .
congress cited both ucr and ncvs crime statistics when articulating the need for more community policing officers .
the impetus for the legislation was a recent increase in the violent crime rate as reported by the ucr .
the report then compares the similarities and differences of ucr and ncvs data .
it concludes by reviewing issues related to the nibrs and the ncvs .
the ncvs has four major objectives: ( 1 ) developing detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime , ( 2 ) estimating the number and types of crimes not reported to police , ( 3 ) providing uniform measures of selected types of crimes , and ( 4 ) permitting comparisons over time and population types ( e.g. , urban , suburban , and rural ) .
these issues include ( 1 ) barriers to implementing the nibrs nationwide , ( 2 ) potential increases in the crime rate because of transitioning to the nibrs , and ( 3 ) cuts in the ncvs sample size and the effects associated with the decrease in sample size .
