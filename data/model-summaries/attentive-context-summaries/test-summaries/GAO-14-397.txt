to help ensure that the intelligence analysis activities and resources throughout the enterprise align to an integrated set of strategic departmental intelligence priorities , we recommend that the under secretary for intelligence and analysis , homeland security take the following two actions: establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities in the homeland security intelligence priorities framework that can be used to guide annual enterprise planning efforts , including intelligence analysis and resource management and ensure that once strategic departmental intelligence priorities are established , the framework is used to inform the planned analytic activities of the dhs intelligence enterprise , as articulated in the program of analysis .
by not monitoring and evaluating the effect of these actions , i&a cannot be confident that it is making progress in improving its ability to build and maintain the workforce it needs to effectively and efficiently analyze possible threats to the homeland .
furthermore , i&a lacks the information essential to know whether additional changes are needed to its workforce improvement activities and the strategies that underlie those activities .
to assist in the deterrence , prevention , preemption of , or response to , terrorist attacks against the united states , the under secretary is to , as appropriate , disseminate dhs - analyzed information within the department ; to other federal , state , and local agencies , and to private sector entities , with responsibilities relating to homeland security .
