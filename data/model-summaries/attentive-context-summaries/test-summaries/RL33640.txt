during the cold war , the u.s. nuclear arsenal contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons , including short - range missiles and artillery for use on the battlefield , medium - range missiles and aircraft that could strike targets beyond the theater of battle , short - and medium - range systems based on surface ships , long - range missiles based on u.s. territory and submarines , and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states .
the report not only reaffirms the basic contours of the current u.s. force structure and the ongoing modernization programs , it also calls for the development of a new low - yield warhead for deployment on trident ii ( d - 5 ) missiles .
while some programs have been open to scrutiny , congress has continued to support funding for most aspects of the ongoing modernization programs .
it then offers details about each category of delivery vehicle — land - based intercontinental ballistic missiles ( icbms ) , submarine launched ballistic missiles ( slbms ) , and heavy bombers — focusing on their current deployments and ongoing and planned modernization programs .
the trump administration emphasized its continuing support for the u.s. nuclear arsenal in its nuclear posture review , which was released on february 2 , 2018 .
the long - range missiles and heavy bombers are known as strategic nuclear delivery vehicles .
the short - and medium - range systems are considered nonstrategic nuclear weapons and have been referred to as battlefield , tactical , and theater nuclear weapons .
this report reviews the ongoing programs that will affect the expected size and shape of the u.s. strategic nuclear force structure .
yet , nuclear weapons continue to play a key role in u.s. national security strategy , and the united states does not , at this time , plan to either eliminate its nuclear weapons or abandon the strategy of nuclear deterrence that has served as a core concept in u.s. national security strategy for more than 60 years .
and , even though the president pledged to reduce the roles and numbers of u.s. nuclear forces , the 2010 nuclear posture review noted that "the fundamental role of u.s. nuclear weapons , which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist , is to deter nuclear attack on the united states , our allies , and partners. .
most members of congress have supported the general contours of u.s. nuclear posture .
while senator james inhofe , who will likely chair the senate armed services committee , has offered strong support for the nuclear modernization programs , representative adam smith , who is likely to chair the house armed services committee , has noted that "the current $1.5 trillion plan to build new nuclear weapons and upgrade our nuclear weapons complex is unrealistic and unaffordable. .
nevertheless , questions about the costs of these programs , and the trade - offs they might require within the defense budget , have surfaced in recent years , particularly following the passage of the budget control act in 2011 .
under the terms of the 2002 strategic offensive reduction treaty ( known as the moscow treaty ) between the united states and russia , this number was to decline to no more than 2,200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads by the end of 2012 .
