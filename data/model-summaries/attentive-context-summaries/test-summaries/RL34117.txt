beginning in the late 1970s , congress deregulated the railroad industry by giving railroads more flexibility to set rates and negotiate confidential contracts with their customers .
an important policy question for congress is whether more competition will lead to a more robust and efficient railroad system or undermine it by discouraging investment in rail infrastructure .
captive rail shippers often cannot ship their product economically by truck because of its bulk or the long distance of their shipments , and lack viable access to a navigable waterway to ship by barge .
over the last decade , as major railroads have consolidated and have achieved higher profitability , some members of congress have questioned whether the present regime needs to be revised to protect the interests of rail customers who are poorly positioned to benefit from competition among freight transportation providers â€” a group often referred to as "captive shippers. .
the legal structure under which the rail industry now operates was put in place at a time when railroads were in financial peril .
the surface transportation board ( stb or board ) recently began a review of its policies regarding these two issues , and they are addressed in legislation supported by captive shippers .
captive rail shippers are a small minority of all rail customers , and the argument between them and the railroads is long - standing .
organizations representing captive shippers have called upon congress to reimpose regulation upon certain aspects of railroad operations in order to protect shippers' interests .
however , the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the division of revenue between shippers and railroads .
after reviewing shipper and railroad points of view , the last section of the report discusses the implications of injecting more rail - to - rail competition into the industry .
this report provides background on the current railroad regulatory regime .
they typically claim that the railroad serving them acts like a monopoly , charging excessive rates and providing inadequate service .
it then explains "bottlenecks" and "terminal switching arrangements," two of the main points of contention between railroads and their captive customers .
in the 111 th congress , the surface transportation board reauthorization act of 2009 ( s. 2889 ) , reported by the senate commerce committee , and bills reported by the senate and house judiciary committees ( s. 146 and h.r .
the last major changes to u.s. law concerning the economic regulation of railroads were the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976 ( the so - called "4r act," p.l .
s. 49 , the railroad antitrust enforcement act of 2011 , has been ordered to be reported by the senate judiciary committee .
in the senate , these bills have been reintroduced in the 112 th congress as s. 49 and s. 158 .
congress faces consideration of whether addressing the problems of captive shippers would be detrimental or beneficial to maintaining a strong and vibrant railroad system .
233 , which was also referred to the house transportation and infrastructure committee ) would have changed current railroad practices to allow "captive shippers" more access to competing railroads by addressing , among other provisions , "bottlenecks" and "terminal switching arrangements. .
