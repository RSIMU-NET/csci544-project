our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs's 2006 filing season performance in processing paper and electronically filed tax returns and providing telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance relative to 2006 goals and prior years' performance ; ( 2 ) identify potential cost savings or other improvements ; and ( 3 ) report on the status of irs's taxpayer assistance blueprint ( tab ) , which is intended to be the long - term strategy for cost effectively delivering services that meet taxpayer needs .
another challenge is continuing progress on the business systems modernization ( bsm ) program , irs's ongoing effort to replace its aged computer systems .
in past reports and testimonies we said that irs has made significant progress improving taxpayer service since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( rra 98 ) .
in fiscal year 2006 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) spent approximately $4.1 billion or 38 percent of its $10.8 billion budget on processing income tax returns and providing taxpayer assistance , with most of this occurring during the annual tax filing season .
for example , the president's proposed fiscal year 2007 budget for irs would cut staffing by over 2 percent .
we testified on irs's interim 2006 performance in a hearing held by your subcommittee on oversight , house committee on ways and means , on april 6 , 2006 .
our assessment is based on the reported results and analysis of key irs performance measures , observations of irs's operations , interviews with irs officials , information from representatives of the paid tax preparer community , and analyses by the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) .
during the 2006 filing season , taxpayers filed an estimated 131 million individual income tax returns and received almost $218 billion in refunds .
earlier this year we testified that proposed reduced funding levels could affect the pace of modernization and ultimately of improving service and enforcement .
at the same time , irs has ambitious goals of maintaining or improving filing season services , while also maintaining or increasing enforcement activities in order to improve voluntary compliance by 2009 .
irs's filing season performance is a key indicator of how well irs is serving taxpayers and helping them fulfill their tax responsibilities .
however , we also described challenges to continued progress .
in light of these challenges and the tax filing season's cost and importance to taxpayers , you asked us to assess irs's 2006 filing season performance .
to assess irs's 2006 filing season performance in the key filing season activities — paper and electronic processing , plus telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance — compared to goals and past performance , and report on the status of the tab , we reviewed and analyzed irs reports , testimonies , budget submissions , and other documents and data , including workload data and data related to irs's current suite of balanced performance measures and annual goals ; analyzed staffing data for paper and electronic processing , telephone assistance , and walk - in assistance ; tested for statistically significant differences between annual performance measures based on sample data ; observed operations at irs's atlanta and cincinnati paper processing centers , the atlanta call site and joint operations center , and 4 of irs's 400 walk - in locations ; reviewed legislation , policies , and procedures ; reviewed information from organizations that evaluate internet performance ; reviewed related tigta reports and interviewed tigta officials about irs's performance and initiatives ; reviewed prior gao reports and followed up on our recommendations made in prior filing season and related reports ; interviewed irs officials about current operations , performance relative to 2006 performance goals and prior filing season performance , trends , and significant factors and initiatives that affected or were intended to improve performance ; and interviewed representatives of the few larger private and nonprofit organizations that prepare tax returns including h&r block and trade organizations that represent both individual paid tax preparers and tax preparation companies including the american institute of certified public accountants .
