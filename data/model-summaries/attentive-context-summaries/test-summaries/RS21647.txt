the fcc has no clearly articulated long - term or annual goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement , and it is not analyzing the data it collects .
the jfpa required the fcc to adopt rules concerning unsolicited fax advertising as well as issue an annual report on its enforcement activities .
with respect to strengths and weaknesses in the fcc's procedures , the gao determined that an emphasis on customer service , an effort to document consumers' complaints , and an attempt to target enforcement resources efficiently were strengths in fcc's procedures ; however , inefficient data management , resulting in time - consuming manual data entry , data errors , and — most importantly — the exclusion of the majority of complaints from decisions about investigations and enforcement , continue to be weaknesses .
the jfpa contains the following specific provisions relating to fax advertising .
finally , the gao stated that fcc faces management challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities .
the gao also stated that fcc officials cited competing demands , resource constraints , and the rising sophistication of violators in hiding their identities as hindrances to enforcement .
