other facets include the people who implement and use the technology and the processes that govern its implementation , among which are the standards used to define the characteristics and performance of the technology .
as requested , my testimony today will focus on electronic voting systems , and in doing so i will address ( 1 ) the role of these systems within the larger election process , ( 2 ) attributes that can be used to examine these systems' capabilities , ( 3 ) the importance of both system design and implementation to the performance of these systems , and ( 4 ) the challenges confronting local jurisdictions in using any type of voting equipment , particularly electronic voting systems .
in light of concerns associated with the voting systems used in the 2000 election , we produced a series of reports , issued in 2001 , in which we examined virtually every aspect of the election process , including types of voting technology .
as we reported in 2001 , the particular technology used to cast and count votes is a critical part of this process , but it is only one facet of a multifaceted election process .
in addition , we interviewed commissioners of the newly appointed election assistance commission ( eac ) regarding its efforts to date and its plans , and we attended eac and other commission hearings on electronic voting systems .
for federal elections , the congress has constitutional authority over both congressional and presidential elections .
states are responsible for the administration of both their own elections and federal elections , but the congress has enacted laws in several major areas of the voting process , including the timing of federal elections , voter registration , and absentee voting requirements .
accordingly , we recognized that no voting technology , however well designed , can be a magic bullet that will solve all the problems that can arise in the election process .
we recommended that the secretaries of defense and state improve ( 1 ) the clarity and completeness of service guidance , ( 2 ) voter education and outreach programs , ( 3 ) oversight and evaluation of voting assistance efforts , and ( 4 ) sharing of best practices .
we augmented this work with reviews of more recent studies of electronic voting systems and other relevant documents .
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing on electronic voting systems .
at the same time , we also recognized that if not properly managed , this one facet of the election process can significantly undermine the integrity of the whole .
jurisdictions must be able to ensure that the technology will provide benefits over its useful life that are commensurate with life - cycle costs ( acquisition as well as operations and maintenance ) and that these collective costs are affordable and sustainable .
our follow - up work was performed from february 2004 to may 2004 in washington , d.c. all the work on which this testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
these challenges are not dissimilar to those faced by any organization seeking to leverage modern technology to support mission operations .
the departments of defense and state agreed with our overall findings and recommendations , and as of may 2004 , the recommendations had largely been implemented .
