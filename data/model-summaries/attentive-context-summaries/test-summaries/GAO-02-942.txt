to help address long - standing problems related to ocr's untimely processing of complaints , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture establish time requirements for all stages of the complaint process and monitor ocr's progress in meeting these requirements ; and develop an action plan to address ongoing problems with obtaining and retaining staff with needed skills , establish performance measures to ensure accountability , and monitor ocr's progress in implementing the plan .
the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) administers a direct loan program that , among other things , provides loans to farmers who are unable to obtain private commercial credit to buy and operate farms .
in light of these concerns , you asked us to ( 1 ) compare the processing times and approval rates for direct loans for hispanic farmers with those for non - hispanic farmers , ( 2 ) describe usda's policies for staying foreclosures and how these policies have been implemented , and ( 3 ) assess usda's progress in addressing previously identified problems associated with untimely processing of discrimination complaints and human capital issues within usda's office of civil rights .
additional progress has been hindered because ocr has yet to address underlying , severe human capital problems .
to help address problems related to fsa foreclosures , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture develop and promulgate a policy statement that lays out the factors usda considers in issuing stays of foreclosure in class action lawsuits ; maintain historic information , by race , on foreclosures completed by direct fsa and ocr to improve communications to ensure that foreclosure actions are not taken against borrowers with pending complaints .
to help guard against such charges , fsa needs to improve its monitoring and accountability mechanisms and make its systems and decision processes more consistent and transparent .
furthermore , usda has faced charges that its office of civil rights ( ocr ) has not conducted proper and timely investigations of complaints of discrimination .
to help resolve issues surrounding charges of discrimination in fsa's direct loan program , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture establish criteria for determining when discrepancies between minority and non - minority loan processing times and approval rates warrant further inquiry ; and require state offices to implement recommendations made as a result of fsa field reviews or explain in writing their rationale for not doing so .
in each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , fsa processed about 20,000 loan applications and approved over 16,000 direct loans to farmers .
despite implementing many improvements recommended by usda's inspector general and task forces , ocr has only made modest progress in its timely processing of complaints .
furthermore , if usda does not improve its process of reconciling its lists of complainants , it runs the risk of violating its policy of not taking foreclosure actions against farmers with pending discrimination complaints .
some members of this group have since raised concerns that , contrary to past class actions where usda stayed ( or suspended ) foreclosure actions , usda is foreclosing against hispanic farmers while this lawsuit is still pending .
ocr has made only modest progress in improving its timely processing of complaints because it has yet to address severe , underlying human capital problems .
