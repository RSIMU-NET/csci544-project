in 2011 , representatives of various federal agencies , labor unions , and management organizations were brought together by the national council on federal labor - management relations ( lmr council ) , in conjunction with the chief human capital officers council ( chco council ) , to identify ways to reform and improve employee performance management in the federal government .
in our past work we have noted how current budget and long - term fiscal pressures , combined with a potential wave of employee retirements , could produce gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge that could impair the ability of federal agencies to carry out their complex and evolving missions .
