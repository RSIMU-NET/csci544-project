this report examines ( 1 ) hud oversight of mtw agencies , including agency reporting and compliance with demonstration requirements ; ( 2 ) any association between mtw flexibilities and program outcomes , including public housing occupancy rates and voucher unit utilization rates ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which hud monitored effects of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies on tenants .
in fiscal year 2017 , mtw agencies received funding of about $4.3 billion , which represented more than 17 percent of hud's public housing and housing choice voucher ( voucher ) programs .
the moving to work ( mtw ) demonstration , administered by the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , was established in 1996 to provide statutory and regulatory flexibility to participating public housing agencies .
the mtw demonstration is intended to give participating agencies ( mtw agencies ) the flexibility to design and test innovative strategies ( activities ) for providing and administering housing assistance using funding they receive for their public housing and voucher programs , including making changes to hud's rent calculation and adopting work - requirement and time - limit policies for tenants .
 ( recommendation 11 ) .
however , we found that hud's oversight — review of annual reports and compliance assessments — has not been timely and hud has not fully documented its process for assessing compliance , due to limited staffing and competing priorities .
mtw agencies also are able to combine the funding they are awarded annually from hud's public housing and voucher programs into a single agency - wide funding source .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) oversight of agencies participating in the moving to work ( mtw ) demonstration , including agency reporting and compliance with demonstration requirements ; ( 2 ) any association between mtw flexibilities and program outcomes , including public housing occupancy rates and voucher unit utilization rates ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which hud monitored effects of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies on tenants .
in addition , hud has not clearly documented its process for assessing compliance with the five requirements .
to assess the extent to which hud followed its procedures , we reviewed hud's documentation of compliance assessments from 2013 through 2016 ( the only years for which hud completed such assessments ) .
while agencies were already required to submit annual plans and reports , hud revised its reporting requirements for mtw agencies in may 2013 in response to our recommendations .
of approximately 3,900 public housing agencies , 39 were participating in the mtw demonstration as of september 2017 .
hud acknowledged in its response to the recommendation that its workforce planning efforts will continue in 2018 .
however , researchers and organizations that advocate on behalf of residents , including legal aid groups , have raised questions about the expansion because of the lack of information about the demonstration's effects on tenants .
hud said our draft report did not discuss two other factors ( beyond insufficient staff ) that affected oversight of the mtw demonstration: ( 1 ) 2013 was the first year hud assessed each agency's compliance with the five demonstration requirements , and ( 2 ) from 2013 to 2015 , hud was in protracted and complex negotiations with the existing mtw agencies to determine the terms of the extension of their mtw participation .
