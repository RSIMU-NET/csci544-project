specifically , this report addresses ( 1 ) dod's approach for fuel demand management , including at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan ; ( 2 ) the extent to which dod has initiatives to promote fuel efficiency at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan and efforts to coordinate and collaborate on such initiatives ; and ( 3 ) dod's efforts to measure the results of its fuel demand management initiatives and establish a baseline measure of fuel consumption in afghanistan .
dod has made progress in establishing visibility and accountability for fuel demand management since our 2009 report by making organizational changes and issuing an operational energy strategy ( operational energy strategy ) and related operational energy strategy implementation plan ( implementation plan ) to provide direction for dod's overall fuel demand management efforts , including efforts at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan .
the department of defense ( dod ) depends heavily on petroleum - based fuel to sustain its forward - deployed locations around the world â€” particularly at remote locations that are not connected to local power grids and must rely on fuel - consuming generators for heating , cooling , lighting , and other base support activities .
in addition , global oil supply routes flow through unstable regions , which can pose supply vulnerabilities , and sharp rises in fuel prices have increased dod's operating costs at a time when the department faces mandated reductions to defense spending .
at a time when the federal government faces increasing fiscal challenges and competition across the government for discretionary funds , these efforts by dod could help maximize the benefits of its energy efficiency investments for forward - deployed locations and better position the department for future missions .
dod's operational energy strategy established three overarching operational energy goals to: ( 1 ) reduce demand for energy in military operations , ( 2 ) expand and secure energy supplies , and ( 3 ) build energy security into the future force , and dod has begun to take steps to establish metrics to measure progress toward these goals .
to further enhance dod's approach for managing fuel demand , including at forward deployed locations such as those in afghanistan , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs , in consultation with the joint staff , combatant commanders , and military service components , to finalize and implement a systematic approach that includes establishing a mechanism to identify and track fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded , or are in the research and development phase to ensure information concerning these efforts is effectively shared across the services .
in 2009 , we reported that each of the services had efforts planned or underway to reduce fuel demand , but these efforts were not well coordinated and dod lacked an effective approach for implementing its fuel demand management initiatives and maintaining sustained attention to fuel demand management at its forward - deployed locations .
to help reduce its demand for fuel in military activities abroad , the services expect to spend approximately $4 billion over the next 5 years on operational energy initiatives .
in 2011 , dod consumed almost 5 billion gallons of fuel in military operations worldwide , at a cost of approximately $17.3 billion .
