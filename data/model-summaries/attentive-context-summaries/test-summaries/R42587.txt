the public , private , and tribal forests of the united states are crisscrossed by thousands of miles of logging roads .
how , under the federal clean water act ( cwa ) , should logging road runoff be addressed ? .
when it rains or snow melts , the runoff from those roads can be environmentally harmful , depositing large amounts of sediment and other pollutants into streams and rivers .
the ninth circuit decision had prompted immediate reaction in congress , which enacted legislation barring epa from requiring discharge permits for logging road runoff until september 30 , 2013 , and now has enacted permanent legislation to that effect ( the 2013 farm bill , h.r .
in decker v. northwest environmental defense center , the court held that epa had permissibly construed a prior version of its industrial stormwater rule to exempt stormwater runoff from logging roads that is channeled — that is , collected in ditches , culverts , or other channels — from the discharge permit scheme in the clean water act ( cwa ) .
on march 20 , 2013 , the supreme court answered a key aspect of that question .
congress enacted the modern version of the cwa in 1972 , adding regulatory teeth to a statute first enacted in 1948 .
the provision leaves epa authority to take measures regarding silviculture activities if future circumstances demonstrate the need to do so , for example , pursuant to cwa section 402 ( p ) ( 6 ) ( see " epa's response " above ) .

that court had held that when water running off logging roads is channeled , cwa regulations require that a discharge permit be obtained .
second , the court found the claim not to have been mooted by epa's november 2012 amendment to the rule .
most of epa's statutes bar petitions for review of the agency's regulations when filed more than a certain number of days ( 60 , 90 , or 120 ) after the regulation is promulgated , unless based on grounds arising after the deadline .
as described previously , section 402 ( p ) ( 6 ) allows for a broad range of regulatory and non - regulatory approaches as to which stormwater discharges , if any , should be designated and do not require the use of npdes permits .
it also states that discharges from silvicultural activities are not exempted from permitting requirements under cwa section 404 ( the act's dredge and fill permit program ) , existing permitting requirements under section 402 , or from any other federal law .
the statute allows epa to authorize qualified states to administer the npdes program ; 46 states have been so authorized .
