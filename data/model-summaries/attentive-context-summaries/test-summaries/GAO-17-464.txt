our objectives were to determine to what extent: ( 1 ) gsa's plans and guidance to agencies for transitioning to eis incorporate lessons learned from prior transitions , and ( 2 ) selected agencies are following established planning practices for their transitions .
 ( recommendation 25 ) .
the general services administration ( gsa ) is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and solutions that they need to meet mission requirements .
as federal agencies have evolved in their use of telecommunications , so too have gsa's contracts to help support their needs .
the delays led to an increase of $66.4 million in costs to gsa and an estimated $329 million in lost savings .
currently , these telecommunications contracts not only support agencies' basic telephone needs , but also provide an acquisition vehicle for wireless and satellite services , as well as managed network services and information technology ( it ) security services .
 ( recommendation 24 ) the secretary of transportation should ensure that the department's chief information officer fully demonstrates that dot's transition goals and measures align with its mission ; completely identifies transition risks related to information security , critical systems , and continuity of operations ; and fully identifies mission - critical priorities in the transition timeline .
specifically , our objectives were to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) gsa's plans and guidance to federal agencies for transitioning to eis incorporate lessons learned from prior transitions and ( 2 ) selected agencies are following established planning practices for their transitions .
in preparation for the end of its current telecommunications contracts in 2020 , gsa developed a successor program , known as enterprise infrastructure solutions ( eis ) .
in fiscal year 2015 alone , federal agencies spent about $1.6 billion on services acquired through the contracts under gsa's current telecommunications program , known as networx .
the last two gsa government - wide telecommunications contract transitions experienced significant delays that led to hundreds of millions of dollars in increased costs and missed savings .
 ( recommendation 21 ) the secretary of transportation should ensure that the department's chief information officer identifies the agency's future telecommunications needs , areas for optimization , and costs and benefits of new technology ; and completes efforts to align dot's approach with its long - term plans and enterprise architecture .
the transition that began in 1998 experienced delays that hindered the timely achievement of program goals and resulted in an estimated $74 million in missed savings .
gsa's role in the transition includes providing guidance and technical assistance to agencies .
 ( recommendation 22 ) the secretary of transportation should ensure that the department's chief information officer identifies roles and responsibilities related to the management of assets and human capital and legal expertise for the transition ; develops a transition communications plan ; and fully uses configuration and change - management processes in dot's transition .
for example , developing a transition plan consists of ( 1 ) identifying and documenting objectives and measures of success ; ( 2 ) determining risks that could affect success ; and ( 3 ) defining transition preparation tasks and developing a timeline for these tasks .
