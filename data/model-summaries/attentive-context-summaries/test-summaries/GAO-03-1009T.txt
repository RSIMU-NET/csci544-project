to put this in perspective , in fiscal year 2003 , state was appropriated about $6 billion for the administration of foreign affairs and usaid received approximately $12 billion in total program funding .
i will focus on our observations regarding state's management in the following five areas: ( 1 ) unneeded real estate ; ( 2 ) embassy construction ; ( 3 ) overseas presence and staffing , including rightsizing ; ( 4 ) information technology ; and ( 5 ) strategic planning .
in carrying out its mission of forming , representing , and implementing u.s. foreign policy , state faces complex challenges , some of which have intensified since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , including the provision of secure facilities overseas .
i will also discuss key areas where usaid has faced challenges , including ( 1 ) human capital management and workforce planning , ( 2 ) program evaluation and performance measurement , ( 3 ) information technology , and ( 4 ) financial management .
over the last several years , funding for state's operations has increased , particularly for security upgrades at embassies and consulates around the world and for a major hiring program to meet u.s. foreign policy needs .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the department of state's and the u.s. agency for international development's ( usaid ) stewardship of their resources and areas within their budgets where applying strong management practices has the potential to produce efficiencies that could result in cost savings .
usaid has also received significant funding increases for foreign assistance programs , in afghanistan and iraq in particular , as well as for hiv / aids relief programs .
in addition , gao and others have identified management challenges and operational deficiencies at usaid that affect the agency's ability to implement its programs .
over the years , gao , state's office of the inspector general ( oig ) , and various commissions and studies have identified numerous management weaknesses at state .
ongoing attention to resource management issues at both state and usaid will be needed to ensure that the department and the agency take advantage of opportunities for more efficient operations and achieve budget savings wherever possible .
to obtain its goal , however , usaid needs to continue efforts to resolve its internal control weaknesses and ensure that planned upgrades to its financial systems are in compliance with federal financial system requirements .
however , resources are not unlimited , and sound management practices can affect the utilization of large sums of money .
usaid has made progress in correcting some of its systems and internal control deficiencies and is in the process of revising its plan to remedy financial management weaknesses as required by the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 .
my statement today is based on our work at state and usaid over the last several years .
poor coordination among the key u.s. agencies has been a long - standing management problem , and cooperation with other foreign donors has been limited .
although the agency has made a serious effort to develop improved performance measures , it continues to report numerical outputs that do not gauge the impact of its programs .
