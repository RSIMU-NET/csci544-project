since 1979 , egypt has received about $60 billion in military and economic assistance overall with about $34 billion in the form of foreign military financing ( fmf ) grants and loans that enable egypt to purchase u.s. - manufactured military goods and services .
specifically , we ( 1 ) describe the types and amounts of fmf assistance provided to egypt , ( 2 ) assess the financing arrangements used to provide fmf assistance to egypt , and ( 3 ) evaluate how the united states assesses fmf assistance to egypt and its contribution to the advancement of u.s. foreign policy and security goals .
according to department of state ( state ) and department of defense ( dod ) officials , fmf funds also contribute to the u.s. goal of maintaining regional stability and supporting egypt as a partner in the middle east .
this should include establishing benchmarks and targets for these and other goals .
these defense articles and services are to modernize egypt's armed forces and enhance egypt's military interoperability with the united states .
to fund this program , approximately $1.3 billion has been appropriated annually and disbursed through a cash flow financing arrangement that allows egypt to spread the payments over several years .
specific goals include ( 1 ) modernizing and training egypt's military ; ( 2 ) facilitating egypt's participation as a coalition partner ; ( 3 ) providing force protection to the u.s. military in the region ; and ( 4 ) helping guarantee u.s. access to the suez canal and overflight routes .
to describe the types and amounts of foreign military financing ( fmf ) assistance to egypt , we examined government and private sector documents , databases , and reports ; we also interviewed u.s. government officials .
specifically , the united states uses fmf funds set aside for egypt to purchase military equipment , services , and training from u.s. contractors on egypt's behalf .
we agree that expedited transit in the suez canal ; support for humanitarian efforts in darfur , sudan , and elsewhere ; and continuing offers to train iraqi security forces are important benefits that the united states derives from its strategic relationship with egypt .
this would include identifying risks , planning a course of action for mitigating those risks , and developing mechanisms to anticipate , identify , and react to change ; and conduct periodic program - level evaluations of the fmf program to egypt .
after signing the camp david peace accords , egypt emerged as the second largest recipient of u.s. military aid in the world .
at your request , we reviewed selected aspects of the fmf program for egypt including the composition and funding of the program and the u.s. government's assessment of its contributions .
recently , congressional committees have sought to alter the balance of economic and military assistance provided to egypt and to review the results of the assistance .
specifically , we recommend that the agencies define the current and desired levels of modernization and interoperability the united states would like to achieve .
specifically , we interviewed u.s. department of defense ( dod ) , and defense security cooperation agency ( dsca ) officials .
