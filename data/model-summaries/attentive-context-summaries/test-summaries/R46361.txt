this report provides an overview of the fy2020 defense appropriations act ( p.l .
subsequent sections of the report summarize the act's treatment of major components of the trump administration's budget request , including selected weapons acquisition programs and other provisions .
the following overview tracks the legislative history of the fy2020 defense appropriations act and summarizes the budgetary and strategic context within which it was being debated .
this included $718.3 billion ( 95.8% of the total ) for the military activities of the department of defense ( dod ) .
for fy2020 , the trump administration requested a total of $750.0 billion in discretionary budget authority for national defense - related activities .
the trump administration's december 2017 national security strategy ( nss ) and the 11-page unclassified summary of the january 2018 national defense strategy ( nds ) explicitly reorient u.s. national security strategy ( including defense strategy ) toward a primary focus on great power competition with china and russia and on countering their military capabilities .
the act established binding annual limits ( or caps ) to reduce discretionary federal spending through fy2021 by $1.0 trillion .
congress repeatedly has enacted legislation to raise the annual spending caps .
but the administration's fy2020 request also included $165 billion designated as oco funding ( and thus exempt from the cap ) of which $98 billion was intended for base budget purposes .
also not included in the fy2020 defense bill is $7.8 billion in accrual payments to fund the tricare for life program of medical insurance for military retirees , funding for which is appropriated automatically each year , as a matter of permanent law ( 10 u.s.c .
some states are also collaborating with non - state proxies ( including , but not limited to , militias , criminal networks , corporations , and hackers ) and deliberately blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict and between civilian and military activities .
this marks a change from the focus of u.s. national security policy for nearly the past three decades and a renewed emphasis on competition between nuclear - armed powers , which had been the cornerstone of u.s. strategy for more than four decades after the end of world war ii .
the balance of the national defense budget request is for defense - related activities of the energy department and other agencies .
the caps do not apply to funding designated by congress and the president as emergency spending or spending on oco .
the president's fy2020 budget request for dod reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 national defense strategy ( nds ) , which called for "increased and sustained investment" to counter evolving threats from china and russia .
to avert a nearly 11% reduction in defense spending , the administration's fy2020 base budget request conformed to the then - binding defense cap .
this bill does not include funding for military construction and family housing , which is provided by the appropriations bill that funds those activities , the department of veterans affairs , and certain other agencies .
