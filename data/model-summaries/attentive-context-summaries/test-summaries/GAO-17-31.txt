specifically , this report examines: ( 1 ) the approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing wioa provisions related to career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning , and ( 2 ) the related planning challenges , if any , these states have encountered and how they have addressed them .
these programs , administered primarily by the departments of labor ( dol ) and education ( education ) , provide a combination of education and training services that help job seekers obtain employment and advance in the labor market .
we examined 1 ) the approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) provisions related to career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning , and 2 ) the related planning challenges , if any , these states have encountered and how they have addressed them .
enacted in july 2014 , the workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) brought changes to the programs that serve as a foundation for the nation's employment and job training system .
to address both objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; conducted case studies in five states ; and interviewed federal department of labor ( dol ) and department of education ( education ) officials .
to conduct case studies , we selected five states ( california , colorado , kentucky , ohio , and pennsylvania ) , which were among those identified by national associations as 1 ) having substantial experience developing and implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , or regional planning prior to wioa , and / or 2 ) making significant changes to implement any of these strategies under wioa .
states were required to submit their first state plans under wioa to dol and education by april 1 , 2016 , in order to be considered timely .
associations could recommend states in any of the following six categories: experienced with career pathways strategies ; experienced with sector partnership strategies ; experienced with regional planning strategies ; making significant changes to implement career pathways strategies ; making significant changes to implement sector partnership making significant changes to implement regional planning strategies .
in addition , a kentucky official said the state is also using a private grant to fund regional efforts to develop career pathways and sector partnership strategies and ensure that they help job seekers obtain credentials that are valued by employers .
such services include job search assistance , career counseling , occupational skills training , classroom training , and on - the - job training .
in light of these developments , you asked us to review states' planning approaches for addressing new wioa requirements .
in addition , wioa requires that states develop career pathways strategies to help job seekers obtain employment or education , sector partnership strategies to engage employers in the workforce system , and regional planning strategies to coordinate local services .
to address both objectives , we reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance .
california is also using discretionary funding to support the workforce accelerator fund initiative , which aims to better align existing programs to accelerate employment outcomes for populations with barriers to employment .
