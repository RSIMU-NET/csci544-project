besides providing data on various indicators that irs uses to measure its filing season performance , we discuss five areas that have been problematic in past filing seasons: ( 1 ) the ability of taxpayers seeking answers to questions to reach irs via the telephone , hereafter referred to as telephone accessibility ; ( 2 ) the number of returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method ; ( 3 ) irs' efforts to deal with returns that have missing or incorrect social security numbers ( ssn ) ; ( 4 ) the use of banks , known as lockboxes , to process certain tax payments ; and ( 5 ) performance of the imaging system irs uses to process certain tax returns .
this report responds to your request that we assess the internal revenue service's ( irs ) performance during the 1997 tax filing season .
in march 1997 , we testified before the oversight subcommittee on the interim results of our work .
i for information on our test methodology ) ; analyzed irs data on alternative filing methods , including irs surveys of telefile users and nonusers ; visited two lockbox banks , one in atlanta and one in st. louis , to review remittance processing procedures ; interviewed staff from fms , which is responsible for negotiating and administering lockbox contracts , about the use of lockboxes to process form 1040 tax payments and analyzed cost / benefit data related to lockbox processing ; interviewed officials from irs' taxpayer advocate's office about the impact of various filing season activities on taxpayers ; analyzed activity data for irs' internet world - wide web site and forms distribution centers ; and reviewed relevant irs internal audit reports .
to achieve our objective , we interviewed irs national office officials and irs officials in the atlanta , cincinnati , fresno , and kansas city service centers responsible for the various activities we assessed ; analyzed filing season related data from various management information systems , including irs' management information system for top level executives ; analyzed irs data relating to its telephone assistance and conducted a test of irs' telephone accessibility during the last 2 weeks of the filing season ( see app .
our objective was to assess irs' performance during the 1997 filing season , with particular emphasis on those areas that were identified as problematic in our reviews of past filing seasons .
despite the improvement , however , accessibility is still low .
irs uses various indicators to measure its filing season performance .
to check whether accessibility had increased , we conducted an independent test to measure taxpayer access to irs' telephone system from march 31 through april 15 , 1997 .
those indicators relate to workload , like the number of returns processed ; timeliness , like the number of days needed to process and issue refunds ; and quality , like the accuracy of irs' answers to taxpayers' questions and the accuracy with which irs processes individual income tax returns and refunds .
despite the significant increase in 1997 , telephone accessibility is still too low .
it achieved significant increases in telephone accessibility and alternative filings , and it implemented a major change in dealing with missing or incorrect ssns , all without any noticeable major problems .
