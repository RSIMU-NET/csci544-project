across the federal government , agencies have financial management system modernization efforts under way and the success of these efforts will depend on omb's and agencies' efforts to ensure that disciplined processes are effectively used to help reduce the risk of system implementation failures .
the federal government's ability to efficiently and effectively manage and oversee its day - to - day operations and programs relies heavily on the ability of agency financial management systems to produce complete , reliable , timely , and consistent financial information for use by executive branch agencies and congress .
although modernization of these systems is expensive , these efforts represent a critical element in facilitating agencies' ability to institute strong financial management as called for by the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 , federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ( ffmia ) , and other financial management reform legislation .
in addition , despite its critical role in overseeing agency financial management systems modernization efforts , omb has not yet fully addressed our oversight - related recommendations , including assessing whether agencies have incorporated disciplined processes into their modernization efforts , fully using its management watch list and high risk list to more effectively oversee projects , and reporting to congress .
consistent and diligent omb commitment toward oversight , including efforts to incorporate appropriate spending data , will be critical to the overall success of efforts to modernize federal financial management systems .
as agreed to with your office , this report provides the results of the first phase of our work , including our efforts to determine ( 1 ) omb's progress toward addressing our prior recommendations related to the fmlob initiative and other challenges that impede its implementation and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of omb's monitoring of fmlob and financial management system modernization projects , including their costs .
agencies continue to spend billions of dollars on maintaining , developing , and implementing financial management systems throughout the federal government .
over a number of years , we have reported that modernizing federal financial management systems has been a challenge at many federal agencies due , in part , to the past practices of each federal agency attempting to implement its own systems which have all too often resulted in failure , have been delayed , and cost too much .
specifically , we recommended that omb place a high priority on fully integrating into its approach four key concepts: ( 1 ) developing a concept of operations that articulates the interrelationships among financial management systems and how the shared service provider concept fits into the overall federal financial management framework , ( 2 ) defining standard business processes to promote consistency within and across agencies , ( 3 ) developing a strategy for ensuring that agencies' financial management systems are migrated to a limited number of service providers , and ( 4 ) defining and effectively implementing applicable disciplined processes necessary to properly manage financial management system implementation projects .
to assist oversight efforts specifically related to federal financial management systems , we recommend that the director of omb take actions to facilitate complete and accurate reporting of actual and planned spending related to financial management system modernization projects , including the financial portion of mixed systems that significantly support financial management functions , and make necessary changes in existing guidance to meet these needs .
