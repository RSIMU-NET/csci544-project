for example , a business chapter 7 bankruptcy case with assets of $50,000 to $499,999 is expected to take about twice as much judge time as a nonbusiness chapter 7 case with assets of $50,000 to $499,999 .
my statement today is based on the results of our 2003 review of documentation provided by the federal judicial center ( fjc ) and the administrative office of the u.s. courts ( aousc ) and interviews with officials in each organization as well as selected updates conducted in june 2009 .
we assessed whether weighted case filings were a reasonable means of measuring bankruptcy judges' case - related workload and assessed the methodology of proposals to update the current case weights .
weighted filings are a statistical measure of the estimated average amount of judge time that specific types of bankruptcy cases are expected to take .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our 2003 review and assessment of bankruptcy court weighted case filings , the workload measure the judicial conference first considers in assessing the need for additional bankruptcy judges .
changes in the intervening years in such factors as case characteristics , case management practices , or new statutory and procedural requirements , such as the implementation of the 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act ( the bankruptcy reform act ) , may have affected whether the case weights continue to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related judge workload .
some of these changes may have increased the time demands on bankruptcy judges and others may have reduced time demands .
my statement today also briefly discusses the judiciary's ongoing study to update the current bankruptcy case weights .
the original case weights are now about 18 years old and were based on time data that are now about 21 years old .
we did not evaluate how effective these measures may be in ensuring data accuracy .
the judicial conference's committee on the administration of the bankruptcy system has approved a revision of the current weights , a study currently underway , whose methodological design is essentially identical to that used to develop the current case weights â€” a methodology we concluded in 2003 was reasonable .
some types of cases may take more judge time than others .
in assessing the need for new bankruptcy judgeships , the judicial conference relies on the weighted case filings to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related bankruptcy judge workload .
on the basis of the documentation provided for our review and discussions with fjc and aousc officials , we concluded that weighted case filings , as approved by the judicial conference in 1991 and amended in 1996 , were likely to be a reasonably accurate means of measuring the case - related workload of bankruptcy judges .
whether weighted case filings are a reasonably accurate workload measure rests in turn on the soundness of the methodology used to develop the case weights .
in summary , my statement includes the following major points: the time demands on bankruptcy judges are largely a function of the number and complexity of the cases on their dockets .
aousc said that its staff took a number of steps to ensure that individual cases were assigned to the appropriate case weight category .
