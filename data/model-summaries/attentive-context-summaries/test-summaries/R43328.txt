as the largest single payer of ltss in the united states , medicaid ltss spending in 2015 ( combined federal and state ) totaled $149.4 billion and accounted for 42.5% of all ltss expenditures ( $351.8 billion ) .
medicaid plays a key role in covering long - term services and supports ( ltss ) to eligible aged and disabled individuals .
an estimated 4.1 million medicaid beneficiaries ( or 5.9% ) of the 68.5 million total enrolled medicaid population received ltss in fy2013 .
in 2015 , medicaid ltss accounted for 31% of all medicaid spending despite the fact that ltss recipients represent a relatively small share of the total medicaid population .
however , states have a range of options that allow ltss coverage of home and community - based services ( hcbs ) for medicaid beneficiaries based on need , and that allow states to target such coverage to particular groups of individuals ( i.e. , older adults and individuals with physical disabilities , or individuals with a specific disease or condition such as hiv / aids ) .
in more recent decades , federal medicaid statutory authority has expanded to assist states in increasing and diversifying their medicaid ltss coverage to include optional hcbs .
for example , the addition of the section 1915 ( c ) hcbs waiver to medicaid law in 1981 and subsequent statutory amendments that created new medicaid state plan benefit options have allowed states to further the provision of hcbs .
ltss are also a substantial portion of spending within the medicaid program relative to those served .
moreover , the share of medicaid ltss spending for hcbs has nearly tripled over time , from 18% of medicaid ltss spending in fy1995 to over half ( 53% ) of total medicaid ltss spending in fy2014 .
the original 1965 medicaid law established that eligible medicaid beneficiaries are entitled to nursing facility care .
about half of states that reported activities to expand hcbs plan to implement or expand the financing and delivery of medicaid ltss through managed care arrangements ( 19 states in fy2016 and 18 states in fy2017 ) .
federal law requires that state medicaid programs cover certain ltss for eligible beneficiaries , such as nursing facility care .
one important issue for medicaid ltss coverage is its perceived bias in favor of institutional care .
subsequent legislative and administrative activities to expand medicaid hcbs , in part , were prompted by the u.s. supreme court decision in olmstead v. l.c .
medicaid funds ltss for eligible beneficiaries in both institutional settings and home and community - based settings , though the portfolio of services offered differs substantially by state .
 , which held that the institutionalization of people who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) .
these flexibilities under medicaid law have led to widespread variation in state medicaid ltss benefit packages offered to elderly and disabled individuals .
specifically , the aca established or extended several medicaid state plan options ( section 1915 ( i ) hcbs state plan option and section 1915 ( k ) community first choice state plan option ) .
a discussion of aca's changes to medicaid law with respect to medicaid ltss coverage options is also provided .
