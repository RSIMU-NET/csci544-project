in 1976 , the indian health care improvement act sought to raise the health status of native americans through increased funding and personnel for the indian health service ( ihs ) .
we examined ( 1 ) the extent to which primary care services were available to native americans , ( 2 ) the extent to which ancillary and specialty services were available to native americans , ( 3 ) the underlying factors associated with variations in service availability among ihs - funded facilities , and ( 4 ) strategies used by ihs - funded facilities to increase the availability of services .
for some facilities in one of those areas , especially those in urban areas , it was difficult to retain billing staff needed to obtain reimbursements , because they could not match the private sector pay scale .
this agency , located within the department of health and human services , arranges the provision of health care services for native americans across 12 federally designated areas that cover all or part of 35 states .
for fiscal year 2005 , the congress appropriated approximately $2.6 billion for health care services to be made available through ihs , which included primary care services ( medical , dental , and vision ) ; ancillary services , including laboratory , diagnostic imaging , and pharmacy services ; and specialty care , including services provided by cardiologists , surgeons , and other physician specialists .
native americans — american indians and alaska natives — have historically had poorer health than the u.s. general population , as evidenced by their higher incidence of certain medical conditions and their shorter average life spans .
there remain concerns about the extent to which health care services are available — that is , both offered and accessible — to native americans served by ihs .
our prior work identified issues regarding the availability of services for native americans , particularly services to meet the need for substance abuse treatment .
we used a two - tiered approach to selecting facilities for site visits , which included selecting 3 of the 12 indian health service ( ihs ) areas and then selecting 13 facilities within those 3 areas .
primary care , ancillary , and specialty services are offered through a combination of direct care , which is provided on site at ihs - funded facilities , and care purchased from other public and private providers — referred to here as “contract care.” ihs - funded facilities have varied in the health care services they have provided for native americans , and in some cases this has adversely affected the ability of native americans to obtain needed services .
for example , to improve efforts to obtain reimbursements , four facilities had staff available to help patients apply for eligibility or reimbursement from other programs for which they were eligible .
our site visits included interviews with officials at 13 ihs - funded facilities ( 4 hospitals , 8 health centers , and 1 health station ) , 8 of which were federally operated and 5 of which were tribally operated .
the effectiveness of another strategy was limited by the willingness of outside providers to negotiate contracts with the facility .
others negotiated with state medicaid offices in order to be able to bill for services ( see table 7 for a description of how facilities implemented the six strategies ) .
