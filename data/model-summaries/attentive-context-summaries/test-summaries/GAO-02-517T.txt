we appreciate this opportunity to testify on the office of pipeline safety's ( ops ) oversight of the safety of our nation's pipeline infrastructure .
these challenges include ( 1 ) developing performance measures for the integrity management approach , ( 2 ) ensuring sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators' integrity management programs , ( 3 ) providing consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and ( 4 ) issuing requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines .
as a result , ops has the lowest implementation rate of any transportation agency for recommendations from the national transportation safety board ( the safety board ) .
we are here today to discuss ( 1 ) ops' progress in implementing integrity management and other initiatives , ( 2 ) ops' progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , and ( 3 ) issues that are critical to the future success of ops' initiatives to improve the safety and oversight of the pipeline industry .
historically , ops has been slow to take action to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry and implement critical pipeline safety improvements .
in recent years , ops has initiated several actions to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry , including requiring “integrity management” programs for individual operators to assess their pipelines for risks , take action to mitigate the risks , and develop program performance measures .
ops oversees the safety of 2.2 million miles of pipelines that transport potentially dangerous materials , such as oil and natural gas .
this lack of responsiveness has prompted congress to repeatedly mandate basic elements of a pipeline safety program , such as requirements to periodically inspect pipelines .
our statement is based on reports we issued in may 2000 and september 2001 , as well as ongoing work for mr. dingell of this subcommittee .
ops has moved forward with its new risk - based regulatory approach — integrity management — that requires operators to develop programs that focus on the greatest risks to their pipelines .
ops has also made progress on other initiatives that are intended to improve the agency's oversight of the pipeline industry .
ops has since improved its responsiveness to the safety board's recommendations and taken action on eight statutory requirements .
according to ops officials , the agency plans to collect data that will allow it to link its compliance actions with improvements in safety .
ops faces major challenges in implementing its initiatives and in fulfilling the safety board's recommendations and statutory requirements .
ops hopes to implement most of its initiatives to improve data in 2002 .
ops subsequently changed its enforcement policy to make better use of its full range of enforcement tools , including increasing the number and severity of fines .
ops has made progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , but still has not implemented some significant recommendations and requirements .
allowing more states to oversee a broader range of interstate pipeline safety activities .
these initiatives include: revising forms and procedures to collect more complete and accurate data , which will enable ops to better assess the causes of incidents and focus on the greatest risks to pipelines .
