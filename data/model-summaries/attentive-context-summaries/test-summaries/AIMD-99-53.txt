this plan focuses on correcting many of the long - standing problems with indian trust operations , which include inadequate accounting and information management systems ; backlogs in asset appraisals , ownership determination , and record keeping ; and poor internal controls .
this report responds to your request that we evaluate the department of interior's high - level implementation plan ( high level plan ) for improving its management of the indian trust funds and resources under its control .
as discussed with your office , we agreed to assess whether interior has reasonable assurance that ( 1 ) the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing these long - standing problems , and ( 2 ) its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs .
management of the indian trust funds and assets has long been characterized by inadequate accounting and information systems ; untrained and inexperienced staff ; backlogs in appraisals , ownership determinations , and recordkeeping ; the lack of a master lease file and an accounts receivable system ; inadequate written policies and procedures ; and poor internal controls .
the objectives of our review were to assess whether interior has reasonable assurance that ( 1 ) the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing long - standing problems with interior's indian trust responsibilities and ( 2 ) its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs .
about $60 million of this amount is to be spent on developing and improving information systems , $54 million on data cleanup , $17 million on records management , $8 million on training , and $8 million on all other activities .
to determine whether interior has reasonable assurance that its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs , we reviewed the clinger - cohen act of 1996 ; federal policy governing acquisition efforts including office of management and budget guidance and federal information processing standards ; and other current literature to determine the statutory and administrative requirements and best practices that should be used in acquiring software - intensive services such as the asset and land records service ; reviewed interior documents relating to this acquisition , including the request for information , vendor responses , and the request for proposals .
the secretary of the interior is responsible for administering the government's trust responsibilities to tribes and indians , including managing about $3 billion in indian trust funds and administering about 54 million acres of indian land .
to determine whether interior has reasonable assurance that the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing interior's long - standing problems with its indian trust responsibilities , we reviewed the clinger - cohen act of 1996 and current technical literature as a basis for assessing the information technology aspects of the high - level plan ; reviewed the process that was used to develop the plan ; reviewed the strategic plan that was produced by interior's special trustee for american indians ; met with senior interior officials responsible for developing the plan , including interior's chief information officer , chief financial officer , deputy special trustee , and the interior contractor who assisted in the development of the plan ; and analyzed the high level plan for internal consistency and compliance with generally accepted best practices .
