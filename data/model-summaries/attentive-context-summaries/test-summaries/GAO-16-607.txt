onrr should provide additional guidance on how to report royalty - free and royalty - bearing flaring and consider creating a separate category for royalty - bearing flaring ; how to report certain unreported or underreported emissions , such as emissions from storage tanks and gas vented during well completions ; and how to differentiate between combusted and noncombusted lease use volumes reported on the ogor , which could assist interior in measuring its progress toward greenhouse gas reduction goals .
further , improved reporting from operators could also help interior better track its efforts to curb greenhouse gases from federal leases and its new goals for methane reduction .
to help improve reporting of emissions data on the ogor , the secretary of the interior should direct blm or onrr , as appropriate , to take the following four actions: blm should provide additional guidance on how to estimate natural gas emissions from federal oil and gas leases .
in fiscal year 2015 , oil and gas companies produced more than 3.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and more than 171 million barrels of oil from onshore oil and gas leases on federal lands managed by the department of the interior's ( interior ) bureau of land management ( blm ) , according to data provided by interior .
since operators of federal leases may be subject to state regulations and policies regarding natural gas emissions , we reviewed the regulatory activity in five states with high federal oil and gas production and emissions .
interior provided written comments , in which it concurred with two of the six recommendations in the draft report , partly concurred with two others , and did not concur with the remaining two recommendations .
blm is responsible for managing and accounting for approximately 700 million subsurface onshore acres and production from nearly 100,000 federal onshore oil and gas wells .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which interior can account for natural gas emissions from onshore federal leases and ( 2 ) how selected blm field offices have managed requests to vent or flare natural gas on onshore leases .
on january 22 , 2016 , blm announced its proposed methane and waste reduction regulations that would update its existing guidance on venting , flaring , and lease use gas .
since interior has historically focused on royalty - bearing oil and gas production and has limited guidance on how to report natural gas emissions , it cannot yet consistently account for these emissions on federal leases .
interior's office of natural resources revenue ( onrr ) collects these royalties , which its data show totaled nearly $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2015 .
interior did not concur with two recommendations included in the draft report , which would have blm apply its existing guidance on venting and flaring and issue interim guidance on the circumstances under which long - term flaring would be subject to royalties , respectively .
we are making four recommendations to the secretary of the interior .
according to interior , production from these wells accounts for 11 percent of the nation's natural gas supply and 5 percent of its oil supply .
blm's proposed regulations are part of an interagency effort known as the president's climate action plan's strategy to reduce methane emissions — which sets a goal to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025 and calls upon blm to “lead by example” on public lands .
