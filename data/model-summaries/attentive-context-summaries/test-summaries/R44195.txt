to be sure , ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources , such as individual senators ; committees and other senate working groups ; legislative staff ; party and chamber leaders ; executive branch agencies and the white house ; states and localities ; members of the media ; citizens ; and interest groups .
any or all of these individuals or entities may participate in drafting legislation , but only a senator may formally introduce legislation in the senate .
support for a measure may also hinge on how its costs are paid for .
to become law , a bill or joint resolution must pass both houses of congress in identical form ( including the same text and bill number ) and be signed by the president .
measures that are limited in scope but have broad bipartisan appeal may be passed ( or "cleared" ) by unanimous consent with minimal floor time expended .
some common considerations taken into account when drafting a bill include the following: what problem does the bill seek to address ? .
with few limits on senate debate , reaching a final vote on legislation often requires a supermajority of 60 senators to bring debate to a close , so some amount of bipartisan cooperation usually is needed to secure final passage .
the senate's clearance system ( or "hotline" ) can facilitate swift action on noncontroversial proposals , but this pathway can be blocked by even a single objection .
senators may agree about the merits of a bill but disagree with how its provisions are funded .
an abundance of information is available to senators in the form of reports , studies , and presentations offered by a wide range of individuals , groups , and organizations , including crs .
understanding the source of a problem is necessary in order to properly address it .
for instance , if a proposal adds to the federal deficit , it may be subject to a point of order on the chamber floor for violating congressional budget rules ( many of which are codified in the congressional budget act of 1974 ) .
senate rules tend to favor deliberation over decision , so building a coalition of support for a proposal can take time .
a measure with many cosponsors , especially if they include committee and party leaders , could encourage the relevant committee chair to take some action on the legislation , such as hold hearings on it .
an early introduction will give the senate more time to examine the measure's provisions .
comprehensive legislation is likely to require a great deal of time to work through , both in committee and on the floor .
the senate places a number of restrictions on legislation with budgetary consequences .
is the measure best introduced at the beginning , in the middle , or toward the end of a congress ? .
senators may also prefer that their bill be referred to a committee on which they serve in order to ensure continued involvement at the committee stage of proceedings .
cosponsorship conveys a senator's support for a measure , so bills that attract many cosponsors could be seen as enjoying broad support within the chamber .
