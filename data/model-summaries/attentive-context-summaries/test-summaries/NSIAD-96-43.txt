under the new national military strategy , the department of defense ( dod ) must be capable of rapidly deploying armed forces to respond to contingency and humanitarian operations around the world .
since dod is increasingly relying on the c - 5 aircraft as its primary airlifter , we assessed the reliability and mission capability of the aircraft and dod's current plan for modifying the c - 5 .
military strategic airlift aircraft provide the capability to fly the critical , early arriving troops and cargo for overseas deployments .
this review was requested by the honorable earl hutto , former chairman , subcommittee on readiness , house committee on armed services .
we are addressing this report to you as the current chairman of the house subcommittee on military readiness .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the air force to ( 1 ) conduct a readiness evaluation to determine how c - 5 peacetime mission capability can be improved and the costs of such improvements and ( 2 ) assess the impact of proposed aircraft modifications on c - 5 mission capability and then reprioritize the proposals according to the results of the assessment .
the air force's air mobility command ( amc ) has 104 c - 5 , 199 c - 141 , and 16 c - 17 strategic airlift aircraft in its fleet .
dod has not been providing adequate funding to meet the original schedule for proposed c - 5 improvements .
amc stated in its 1995 air mobility master plan that not completing scheduled improvements would degrade capability and increase operating costs .
dod bases many of its conclusions about a more capable c - 5 aircraft on studies of buying additional quantities of a new c - 5d aircraft , which has not yet been developed .
air force officials expect raising the spares support level will add about $4.6 million to annual c - 5 spares costs .
amc established a c - 5 modernization plan to increase mission capability rates and reduce personnel requirements and life - cycle costs .
for example , two major upgrades to improve the c - 5's reliability , the malfunction detection analysis and recording system and the main landing gear actuator , were first identified in fiscal year 1985 and scheduled to be completed by fiscal year 1994 .
however , funding delays have stretched these modifications by 4 years to fiscal year 1998 .
amc has established a goal that the total not mission capable supply ( tnmcs ) rate should not exceed 7 percent for its operational c - 5 fleet .
afotec also found that these changes would increase annual program funding by $11 million to $12 million over and above funds already committed for various improvements , initiatives , and spare parts .
according to our 1992 report , one of the major factors contributing to the c - 141's recent severe problems was inadequate funding to implement necessary modifications .
the c - 5's mission capability rates could increase if the air force were to conduct a readiness evaluation similar to the operational readiness assessment conducted for b - 1b bomber aircraft .
the following is our comment on the department of defense's ( dod ) letter dated october 23 , 1995 .
