this was a result of concerns that lower pork demand and production could reduce demand for other commodities , including u.s. feed grains and protein meals ( like soybeans ) , as well as other farm inputs .
initially , as domestic pork sales fell in response to the spread of the h1n1 flu , futures prices for corn , soybeans , and wheat declined sharply .
the u.s. produce sector also expressed concerns about possible restrictions on fresh produce trade with mexico and the processing of agricultural guest labor workers from mexico because of the 2009 h1n1 outbreak , but these fears so far have not materialized .
in its may 2009 outlook report , usda revised its second - quarter hog prices downward to reflect lower prices in april due to the negative effects of h1n1 flu virus .
there were also fears that reduced demand for pork would have adverse ripple effects throughout the hog sector , resulting in production changes as producers respond to lower prices .
in part because of the surplus situation , in may 2008 and march 2009 , usda announced that it would purchase $50 million and $25 million , respectively , in pork products for federal food and nutrition assistance programs .
for example , grains prices have moved higher since their initial drop following early reports of the outbreak .
the h1n1 outbreak compounded this already worsening situation , and newly imposed trade restrictions in u.s. export markets , particularly in russia and china , only further strained demand for u.s. pork products .
in june 2009 , ustr reported updated estimates by the university of missouri , indicating that the u.s. pork industry could face losses of about $270 million in income in the second quarter of 2009 alone , based on market conditions in the first few days since the virus was identified .
in other livestock markets , wholesale beef and cattle futures prices were initially higher following reports of the outbreak .
specifically , nppc asked usda to implement a purchase program for $50 million of pork products to help boost cash hog prices ; to work with u.s. trading partners to remove all restrictions on exports of u.s. pork and pork products ; to develop a comprehensive surveillance program for early detection of swine diseases ; and to work to keep open the border between the united states and canada to allow for movement of hogs .
early estimates by analysts at the university of missouri estimated that the u.s. pork industry could see losses of up to $400 million in the months following initial reports of the outbreak , given expected lower market prices .
however , as time has passed and the general economic downturn in the u.s. hog industry has deepened , it has become difficult to separate out the economic effects of h1n1 from generally unfavorable market conditions in the u.s. hog sector .
pork producers in the united states began to see a downturn in u.s. pork markets in late 2007 .
more recent estimates , however , indicate that the economic effect of the h1n1 virus has not been as negative as some analysts had predicted .
initial reports of the aggregate economic effects of h1n1 on the farming sector — especially on u.s. hog producers — were grim .
