the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) is responsible for overseeing the establishment and operation of these marketplaces , including a federally facilitated marketplace in states that do not choose to operate their own .
in addition , the marketplaces must be able to determine eligibility for other health coverage programs , such as medicaid or the state children's health insurance program ( chip ) .
recognizing states' marketplace efforts , you requested that we review cms's and states' actions related to implementing the marketplaces .
however , we found that in the first few enrollment periods , all states faced difficulties with the rollout and operation of their marketplace it , and a number of states that struggled with the implementation of their marketplaces are now using the federal platform .

cms assisted selected states with their effort to financially sustain the development and operations of their marketplaces ( including supporting it systems ) by reviewing sustainability plans ; reviewing annual independent financial audit reports ; and conducting sustainability risk assessments .
to make the state selections , we considered four factors for the plan year 2016 enrollment period: total enrollment , total federal marketplace grant dollars , a previous gao review , and whether or not the state transitioned its marketplace to the federal platform .
these marketplaces began facilitating enrollment on october 1 , 2013 , as required by a regulation implementing ppaca .
