this appendix discusses in detail our methodology for addressing three research questions: ( 1 ) how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states work to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care ; ( 2 ) what is known about the results of their efforts , and ( 3 ) the extent to which the department of health and human services ( hhs ) helps states support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care .
to help states effectively address ongoing challenges related to ensuring the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care , the secretary of hhs should consider cost - effective ways to convene state child welfare , medicaid , and other stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing within and across states on psychotropic medication oversight .
hhs also provided additional information on their efforts to date to help states address medical and mental health care for children in foster care .
while hhs has made efforts to help support states in their oversight activities , additional support from hhs to convene state child welfare and medicaid agencies and other stakeholders could create opportunities for state agencies to learn from one another's experience , collaboratively develop solutions to mitigate common challenges , strengthen oversight practices for psychotropic medications , and more effectively ensure appropriate treatments for children in foster care .
our selection criteria included ( 1 ) a high percentage of children in foster care in the state when compared nationwide in fiscal year 2014 ; ( 2 ) variation in medicaid and child welfare systems ; ( 3 ) recommendations from national organizations ; and ( 4 ) geographic diversity .
these agencies , along with hhs's substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) — which undertakes efforts to improve substance abuse and mental health treatment , prevention , and related services for individuals — provide support to states in their efforts to ensure child well - being .
this report examines: 1. how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states work to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care ; 2. what is known in selected states about the results of their efforts to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for these children ; and 3. the extent to which hhs helps states support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care .
hhs also oversees the medicaid program through the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , in accordance with federal laws , regulations , and guidance .
at the federal level , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) monitors state implementation of relevant federal programs , including those that provide federal assistance to support state child welfare and foster care programs , through the administration for children and families ( acf ) .
multiple studies have shown that children in foster care may have more mental health conditions than those in the general population , and prior gao reports have looked at the rate at which these children are prescribed psychotropic medications , which affect mood , thought , or behavior .
additional efforts from hhs to include relevant stakeholders in collaborations to address continuing challenges can better position states in their work to improve practices to oversee medication use and effectively ensure appropriate treatments for the foster care population .
