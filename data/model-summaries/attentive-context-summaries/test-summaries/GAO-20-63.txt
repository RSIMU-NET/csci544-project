 ( recommendation 5 ) .
our report examined: ( 1 ) the extent to which the department of energy's ( doe ) office of environmental management ( em ) has managed cleanup of the three gaseous diffusion plants ( gdp ) compared with relevant program management leading practices and the status of the cleanup effort ; ( 2 ) what em has spent on cleanup at the three gdps and the extent to which em's cost estimates for completing gdp cleanup are reliable ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the decontamination and decommissioning ( d&d ) fund is sufficient to cover em's estimated cleanup costs of the gdps and challenges , if any , that could affect the sufficiency of the d&d fund .
completing cleanup at the department of energy's ( doe ) three former uranium enrichment sites will cost billions of dollars and span decades .
this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which doe's em has managed the cleanup of the three gdps compared with relevant program management leading practices and the status of the cleanup effort ; ( 2 ) what em has spent on cleanup at the three gdps and the extent to which em's cost estimates for completing gdp cleanup are reliable ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the d&d fund is sufficient to cover em's estimated cleanup costs of the gdps and challenges , if any , that could affect the sufficiency of the fund .
 ( recommendation 3 ) the secretary of energy should direct the assistant secretary of the office of environmental management to work — in conjunction with epa and kentucky and tennessee state regulators — with an independent , third - party facilitator to help resolve disagreements over cleanup priorities , cleanup remedies , and cost estimation assumptions .
we are making five recommendations to doe: the secretary of energy should direct the assistant secretary of the office of environmental management to take steps to manage the three gdps as an integrated program and follow relevant program management leading practices ( developing a gdp - wide program management plan ; an integrated master schedule ; and a reliable , integrated , comprehensive life - cycle cost estimate. ) .
to inform all three objectives , we reviewed the energy policy act of 1992 , as amended ; doe triennial reports to congress on gdp cleanup efforts ; and prior reports issued by us , doe's office of inspector general ( both performance audits and financial statement audits on the d&d fund ) , and the national academies of sciences , engineering , and medicine ( national academies ) .
 ( recommendation 4 ) the secretary of energy should regularly report on the status of the d&d fund and cleanup efforts at the three gdps with current information that contains details on challenges in reaching agreement with regulators and a clear scope of work .
cleanup activities include assessing , treating , and disposing of contamination ; decontaminating and decommissioning ( d&d ) buildings and facilities ; and cleaning up soil , surface water , and groundwater , which are considered remediation activities .
