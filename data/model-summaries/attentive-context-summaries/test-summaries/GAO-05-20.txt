ffmia requires the cfo act agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with ( 1 ) federal financial management systems requirements , ( 2 ) applicable federal accounting standards , and ( 3 ) the u.s. government standard general ledger ( sgl ) at the transaction level .
to address this long - standing weakness of the federal government , the chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 designates executive branch officials with responsibility for the modernization of financial management systems , so that the systematic measurement of performance ; the development of cost information ; and the integration of program , budget , and financial information for management reporting can be achieved .
this report , our eighth , discusses ( 1 ) the auditors' assessments of agency systems' compliance with ffmia for fiscal year 2003 and the financial management systems problems that continue to affect systems' ffmia compliance and ( 2 ) the challenges agencies have faced when implementing financial systems to help move toward ffmia compliance .
many federal agencies still lack the ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and effectively manage day - to - day operations and provide an acceptable level of accountability to taxpayers .
the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ( ffmia ) builds on the foundation laid by the cfo act by reflecting the need for agencies to have systems that can generate reliable , useful , and timely information with which to make fully informed decisions and to ensure accountability on an ongoing basis .
the act also requires auditors to state in their audit reports whether the agencies' financial management systems substantially comply with the act's requirements .
furthermore , we are required to report annually on the implementation of the act .
we conducted our work from april through august 2004 in the washington , d.c. , area in accordance with u.s. generally accepted government auditing standards .
agencies face significant challenges implementing these standards .
as the federal government moves forward with agency implementations of new financial management systems and for systems implemented to satisfy governmentwide initiatives , adherence to proven disciplined processes to minimize risks and improve management of these implementations is critical .
beginning in 1990 , the congress has passed a series of management reform legislation to improve the general and financial management of the federal government .
as shown in figure 2 , the combination of reforms ushered in by the ( 1 ) cfo act of 1990 , ( 2 ) government performance and results act of 1993 , ( 3 ) government management reform act of 1994 , ( 4 ) ffmia , ( 5 ) clinger - cohen act of 1996 , and ( 6 ) accountability of tax dollars act of 2002 , if successfully implemented , provides a solid basis for improving accountability of government programs and operations as well as routinely producing valuable cost and operating performance information .
for dhs to develop a strong financial management infrastructure , it will need to address these and many other financial management issues .
the three drivers are the ( 1 ) president's management agenda ( pma ) , ( 2 ) congressional and other oversight , and ( 3 ) the joint financial management improvement program ( jfmip ) .
