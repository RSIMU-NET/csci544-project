during recent congresses many bills have been introduced that would provide funding to states aiming to facilitate improvements in the quality of , and access to , early childhood education ( ece ) programs .
the importance of early learning for children's healthy development and positive outcomes in school and the workforce has become a subject of increasing interest to the public , members of congress , and the adm inistration .
increased congressional interest in early childhood care and education issues has been driven , in part , by research on the role of ece programs in raising academic achievement and other desired student outcomes .
the effectiveness of ece programs is usually measured by assessing children's cognitive functioning , school readiness , and / or social behavior .
results have generally shown that quality early childhood care and education help improve outcomes , particularly for disadvantaged students .
in addition , there is a growing body of research exploring the cost - effectiveness of investments in high quality preschool .
the national institute for early education research ( nieer ) estimated the average lifetime benefits of universally available preschool for all three - and four - year - olds to be considerably larger than the costs for two years of prekindergarten .
nieer based its estimates on data from studies of two high quality preschool programs serving low - income children â€” the chicago child parent center ( ccpc ) and the perry preschool program .
there is no formal , federally mandated system of preschool , and states and localities make their own decisions about whether or not to offer such programs .
one group that has established benchmarks for use in assessing program quality , nieer , found that only six states met all 10 of their benchmarks for quality in sy2014-2015 .
currently , access to high - quality preschool programs varies throughout the united states .
acronyms used in this report appendix c. differences between pdg programs on december 10 , 2015 , the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) was comprehensively reauthorized by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l .
in part , this fragmentation has led to a lack of comprehensive national data on the supply and quality of existing preschool initiatives and the rules that govern them .
in sy2014-2015 , approximately 29% of four - year - olds and 5% of three - year - olds were enrolled in state - funded preschool nationally .
in the absence of a cohesive public preschool system , a fragmented landscape of private and public providers has emerged , with funding coming from a combination of private , state , local , and federal sources , and with program eligibility and quality varying widely .
follow - up of the children who participated in the ccpc at age 20 found they were less likely to be held back in school , to have needed remedial help , or to have been arrested .
states are required to indicate in their application how they will meet the following requirements: ( 1 ) begin serving eligible children within one year of receiving the grant , ( 2 ) subgrant at least 95% of funding for the implementation of high - quality preschool programs in two or more high - need areas , and ( 3 ) use no more than 5% of funding for improving preschool infrastructure .
