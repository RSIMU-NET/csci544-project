this report describes: ( 1 ) dod obligations to dod - sponsored ffrdcs from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 ; ( 2 ) factors that led dod to use s&a centers for research ; ( 3 ) how dod uses and assesses the outcomes of s&a center research ; and ( 4 ) dod and s&a center policies and practices related to conflicts of interest .
to aid in its efforts to develop innovative solutions to immediate and diverse threats to national security , the department of defense ( dod ) utilizes 10 federally funded research and development centers ( ffrdc ) .
five of these ffrdcs are study and analysis ( s&a ) centers that deliver independent and objective analysis and advice to dod in support of policy development .
as described in the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , ffrdcs meet special , long - term research or development needs of sponsoring agencies ( i.e. , the agencies responsible for the overall use of the ffrdc ) in areas integral to their missions that cannot be met as effectively by existing in - house or non - ffrdc contractor resources .
to determine how dod uses and assesses the outcomes of s&a center research , we reviewed dod guidance related to the review of ffrdcs ( including dod's 2011 ffrdc management plan and dod instruction 5000.77 ) .
the senate report accompanying a bill for the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 included a provision for us to review dod's use of ffrdcs .
for the purposes of reporting on dod obligations to dod - sponsored ffrdcs , we included dod's 10 ffrdcs ; for subsequent objectives , we focused our review on dod's five s&a centers , which commonly deliver studies and analyses in the form of research reports .
to determine how much dod obligated to dod - sponsored ffrdcs from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , we collected information and data on fiscal years 2013 through 2018 obligations to the 10 ffrdcs .
these steps include , but are not limited to , having procedures in place to screen employees for potential conflicts of interest ; requiring disclosure of financial and other interests that might affect the employee's objectivity ; establishing policies and procedures to protect proprietary , privileged , and sensitive information from disclosure ; and reporting any conflicts of interest to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer's representative and the primary sponsor as soon as it is identified .
in another instance , a rand employee was initially staffed to a project related to an area of work a spouse worked on commercially , and rand mitigated the potential conflict by recusing the employee from the project .
each of the five s&a centers we reviewed has corporate - wide conflict of interest policies and practices which incorporate various key elements of the dod instruction .
to identify the factors that led dod to use s&a centers for research , we reviewed relevant far provisions related to ffrdcs as well as the dod instruction and guidance for working with ffrdcs .
dod sponsors ffrdcs by establishing contracts or other agreements with entities to operate , manage , and / or administer the ffrdcs .
