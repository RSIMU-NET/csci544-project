 ( recommendation 1 ) .
when designed effectively , performance measures help decision makers ( 1 ) determine the contributions that training makes to improve results , ( 2 ) identify potential gaps in performance , and ( 3 ) determine where to focus resources to improve results .
since its inception , tsa has frequently adapted its standard operating procedures ( sop ) to address new and evolving threats to aviation security .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) has been tasked with screening airline passengers and their carry - on and checked baggage for prohibited and other potentially dangerous items that could pose a threat to aircraft and passengers .
this report: ( 1 ) describes the reasons why tsa established tso basic training ; ( 2 ) discusses factors otd considers when updating the tso basic training curriculum ; and ( 3 ) assesses the extent to which tsa evaluates its tso basic training program .
with regard to performance goals , tsa plans to establish broad goals that include successful screening and improved morale , among others .
with regard to developing performance measures that can be used to assess program outcomes , tsa intends to leverage existing mechanisms through its kirkpatrick model evaluations to measure program success .
in 2015 and 2017 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) inspector general identified vulnerabilities in tsa checkpoint screening , after agents carried metallic ( inoperable handguns ) and nonmetallic ( simulated explosive ) test items concealed on their body through tsa passenger security checkpoints and into the sterile areas of airports .
the screening of airport passengers and their property is a critical component in securing our nation's commercial aviation system .
in 2016 , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) established the tso basic training program at the tsa academy , located at the federal law enforcement training centers in glynco , georgia .
dhs agreed with our recommendation that tsa establish specific goals for the tso basic training program and develop performance measures that can be used to assess if the program is achieving desired outcomes .
by taking these steps , tsa will be better positioned to determine if the program is improving trainees' skills , knowledge , and abilities and whether additional skill development , or other training modifications , may be needed .
specifically , the administrator of tsa should establish specific goals for the tso basic training program and develop performance measures that can be used to assess if the program is achieving desired outcomes and help ensure accountability for training results on a regular basis .
according to tsa , in fiscal year 2017 , more than 771 million passengers were screened at 440 airports across the united states .
while tsa reported potential benefits of tso basic training in its business case and implemented the kirkpatrick model to assess training , it has not yet identified specific goals that the tso basic training program is expected to achieve , nor has it developed performance measures to evaluate progress toward goals .
although tsa has implemented a framework to assess participant reactions to the training and their knowledge of course content , it has not yet established goals for the tso basic training program or measures to gauge effectiveness of the training tsos receive to determine the extent to which they can fulfill their crucial role in ensuring passenger safety .
