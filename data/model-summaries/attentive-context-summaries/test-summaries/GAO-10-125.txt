reentry , the return of juvenile offenders from residential facilities back into their communities , aims to reduce recidivism by using programs that promote the effective reintegration of juvenile offenders and assist them in acquiring the life skills needed to succeed and become law - abiding citizens .
although the juvenile arrest rate is near its lowest point in two decades , critical problems affecting states' juvenile justice systems remain , such as recidivism — the act of committing new offenses after having been arrested or convicted of a crime — and substance abuse — a pattern of use of illegal , prescription , or nonprescription drugs leading to significant impairment in functioning .
according to the department of justice ( doj ) , approximately 100,000 juvenile offenders are held in residential facilities in the united states on a given day , and most of these juveniles will likely leave these facilities and return home to their communities each year .
in addition , in a 2008 annual survey of members conducted by the federal advisory council on juvenile justice , reentry of offenders into communities and schools ( 28 states ) and substance abuse ( 21 states ) were two of the top three programmatic issues most frequently reported as affecting these states' juvenile justice systems .
respondents also cited the need for federal agencies and state governments to collaborate on conducting research and evaluations to provide a better explanation of ( 1 ) practices that have been evaluated and have been shown to be effective , ( 2 ) the need for more training from federal agencies on how to conduct evaluations , and ( 3 ) increased funding to establish evaluation procedures ( 23 states ) .
related to research and policy , the most common issue state officials cited was the need to identify effective practices for juvenile programs ( 23 states ) followed by the need to enhance the states' capacities to conduct juvenile research and collect data about juvenile programs ( 20 states ) .
further , doj has estimated that 62 percent of juveniles in residential facilities self - reported having had at least one prior commitment in the juvenile justice system .
for example , from fiscal years 2007 through 2009 , congress provided ojjdp almost $1.1 billion to use for grants to states , localities , and organizations for a variety of juvenile justice programs .
in support of its mission , the office also disseminates information to states and communities related to a number of juvenile justice issues , including effective reentry and substance abuse programs , and funds research and evaluations of juvenile justice programs .
to what extent does ojjdp have efforts under way to disseminate information about effective juvenile justice programs and assess the utility of the information it is providing through these efforts ? .
the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) is doj's office charged with providing national leadership , coordination , and resources to help prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization .
to help ensure the effective use of grant funds for juvenile reentry and juvenile substance abuse programs , you asked us to review the available research as well as ojjdp's efforts to provide information about effective programs to the juvenile justice field , that is , program practitioners and communities .
