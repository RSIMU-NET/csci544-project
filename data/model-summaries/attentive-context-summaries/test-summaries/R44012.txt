tax expenditures , like direct spending , are one of the ways that the federal government plays a role in shaping the economy .
in some ways , tax expenditures resemble direct spending .
they both have similar budgetary effects and provide incentives that alter the allocation of resources .
tax expenditures — revenue losses associated with targeted provisions outside the normal tax code — are a long - standing feature of the u.s. income tax code .
tax expenditures are a common target when base - broadening tax reform is pursued — like with the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l .
also , unlike direct spending programs , the revenue loss associated with most tax expenditures is only limited by eligibility — much like mandatory spending programs .
a consequence of the limited oversight placed on tax expenditures is that activities may be supported by tax expenditures that have insufficient political support for funding through a direct spending program .
tax expenditures , however , do not regularly receive the same level of scrutiny as direct spending programs .
as congressional interest in tax reform intensifies , it is likely that tax expenditures will once again receive scrutiny as an avenue for broadening the tax base .
section 3 ( 3 ) of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 ( budget act ) defines tax expenditures as … those revenue losses attributable to provisions of the federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion , exemption , or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit , a preferential rate of tax , or a deferral of tax liability .
common goals of tax expenditures include promoting the accurate measurement of income , altering the distribution of fiscal benefits and burdens to address differences in ability - to - pay , and promoting socially desirable activities .

instead , listing tax expenditures increases the transparency of the tax system and allows congress to examine all federal programs relating to the same policy goals .
it is important to note that listing a provision as a tax expenditure in no way implies any judgment about its desirability or effectiveness , whether by itself or relative to non - tax provisions that could address the same policy concern .
the eitc , child tax credit , and the exclusions of social security and medicare benefits are examples of tax expenditures that target benefits to lower - income individuals and change the distribution of after - tax income .
these changes are driven by the growth in the exclusion of employer contributions for health care ( health ) , growth in deferred taxes on active income of controlled - foreign corporations ( international affairs ) , and the enactment of the child tax credit ( education ) .
tax expenditures can be categorized into the same set of budget functions as discretionary and mandatory spending and may be used to achieve similar policy outcomes .
