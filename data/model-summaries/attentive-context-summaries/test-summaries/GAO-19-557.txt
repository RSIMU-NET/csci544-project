over two - thirds of the 39 million beneficiaries enrolled in medicare's traditional fee - for - service program in 2017 had two or more serious health conditions , such as diabetes and heart disease .
the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( 2018 bba ) defines longitudinal comprehensive care planning ( lccp ) as a service that includes the following five components: a conversation with a beneficiary diagnosed with a serious or life - shared decision - making through an interdisciplinary team that includes a physician , registered nurse , and social worker ; development of a longitudinal comprehensive care plan ( care plan ) that is discussed with the beneficiary that addresses the progression of the disease and treatment options ; a care plan that addresses the beneficiary's goals , values , and a care plan that discusses the availability of other resources or social supports that may help mitigate the beneficiary's health risks .
the 2018 bba included a provision that we examine medicare physician fee schedule billing codes established by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) — the agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that administers the medicare program — that may be used for care planning services provided to beneficiaries diagnosed with a serious or life - threatening illness or illnesses .
providers have historically billed medicare for care planning and coordination services using one or more of the over 8,000 billing codes in the program's physician fee schedule .
the often complex nature of these types of conditions and the treatments for them generally necessitate care planning and coordination among providers in different medical specialties .
to examine existing medicare physician fee schedule billing codes that providers may use to bill for lccp - type services , we reviewed relevant information from cms and the american medical association ( ama ) and interviewed key stakeholders .
we report spending and utilization trends in the aggregate as well as by provider specialty ( for example , internal medicine or family practice ) , and by setting ( for example , facility settings such as hospitals and hospices , and nonfacility settings such as physicians' offices ) .
for example , a beneficiary with diabetes and heart disease may be simultaneously under the care of a primary care physician , an endocrinologist , a cardiologist , and a podiatrist , highlighting the need for planning and coordination of care to ensure that services are not being duplicated and that all providers involved in the patient's care share important clinical information and have clear expectations about their roles in the patient's care .
to determine trends in medicare spending on lccp - type services , we analyzed medicare part b claims data from 2013 through 2017 for the specific billing codes we identified as covering lccp - type services .
we examined trends in spending and utilization on these services , including the number of beneficiaries receiving these services and the number of providers billing for these services .
however , certain physician specialties ( largely those specializing in primary care ) have raised longstanding concerns that e / m codes do not adequately account for the amount of time they spend in planning and coordinating care for beneficiaries with complex medical needs .
