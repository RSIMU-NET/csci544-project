in response to ongoing concerns with ides performance , this report provides information on ( 1 ) the extent to which dod and va are meeting ides performance goals , and ( 2 ) steps dod and va are taking to improve ides performance .
this could include issuing guidance to facilities or developing best practices on preventing and correcting data entry errors ; and developing reporting capabilities in vta to alert facilities to potential issues with their data .
in conducting our review of the integrated disability evaluation system ( ides ) , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which the departments of defense ( dod ) and veterans affairs ( va ) are meeting ides performance goals , and ( 2 ) steps dod and va are taking to improve ides performance .
in response to concerns that wounded , ill , or injured servicemembers had to undergo two complex disability evaluations — first by the department of defense ( dod ) then by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) — dod and va jointly designed a new integrated disability evaluation process to expedite the delivery of benefits to servicemembers .
in november 2007 , dod and va began pilot testing the integrated disability evaluation system ( ides ) at three military treatment facilities in the washington , d.c. area , and expanded the number of sites over time .
2 ) to improve dod's ability to measure servicemembers' satisfaction with the ides process , we recommend that the secretary of defense develop alternative approaches for collecting more meaningful and representative information in a cost effective manner .
past gao work highlighted challenges dod and va experienced while piloting the ides and recommended a number of improvements .
dod has also begun rethinking its approach to determining servicemember satisfaction with ides .
as of october 1 , 2011 , ides had replaced the military services' existing — or “legacy” — disability evaluation systems for almost all new disability cases .
we assessed the reliability of these data and analyzed them to look for changes in performance over time ; factors that may help or hinder performance ; and relationships between servicemember satisfaction and case outcomes and timeliness .
for instance , we reported in december 2010 that insufficient staff and logistical challenges contributed to delays in completing ides cases and recommended the agencies take steps to ensure adequate staffing levels and develop a systematic process for monitoring caseloads .
meanwhile , the dod - led business process review should identify and ultimately eliminate any redundant or inefficient information systems for tracking cases as well as for other ides purposes .
servicemembers who are injured in war or as the result of accidents and illnesses may face a difficult transition as they leave the military and become veterans .
finally , providing local facilities the capability to track and generate reports on the status of their cases is long overdue and may empower local staff to better address challenges .
3 ) to ensure that ides management decisions continue to be based upon reliable and accurate data , we recommend that the secretaries of defense and veterans affairs work together to develop a strategy to continuously monitor and remedy issues with vta timeliness information .
