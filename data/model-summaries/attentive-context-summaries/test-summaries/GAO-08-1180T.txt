for example , ( 1 ) its risk assessment was not comprehensive , ( 2 ) specific guidance was missing from policies and procedures , ( 3 ) the network security plan was incomplete , ( 4 ) system testing had shortcomings , ( 5 ) remedial action plans were incomplete and corrective actions were not always timely , and ( 6 ) the network contingency plan was incomplete and inadequately tested .
however , lanl has vulnerabilities in several critical areas , including ( 1 ) identifying and authenticating users of the network , ( 2 ) encrypting sensitive information , ( 3 ) monitoring and auditing compliance with security policies , ( 4 ) controlling and documenting changes to a computer system's hardware and software , and ( 5 ) restricting physical access to computing resources .
lanl , located in los alamos , new mexico , has a multibillion dollar annual budget and is one of three national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) laboratories responsible for designing and developing a safe , secure , and reliable nuclear weapons deterrent .
our testimony today discusses ( 1 ) physical security at lanl , ( 2 ) preliminary observations from ongoing work on physical security at livermore , and ( 3 ) cyber security at lanl .
to help strengthen information security controls over lanl's unclassified network , we made a series of recommendations to the secretary of energy and the administrator of nnsa , 11 of which focus on improving lanl's information security program and determining resource requirements for the unclassified network .
for example , we recommended that the secretary of energy and the nnsa administrator require the director of lanl to , among other things , ( 1 ) ensure that the risk assessment for the unclassified network evaluates all known vulnerabilities and is revised periodically and ( 2 ) strengthen policies with a view toward further reducing , as appropriate , foreign nationals' access to the unclassified network , particularly those from countries identified as sensitive by doe .
in addition , external security evaluations had repeatedly identified concerns about the adequacy of lanl's assessments of its own security performance .
a successful physical or cyber attack on nnsa sites containing nuclear weapons , the material used in nuclear weapons , or information pertaining to the people who design and maintain the u.s. nuclear deterrent could have devastating consequences for the site , its surrounding communities , and the nation's security .
in fiscal year 2007 , lanl budgeted nearly $200 million to provide the laboratory with physical and cyber security to protect the sensitive and classified assets on which laboratory employees rely to conduct their work .
furthermore , nnsa does not consistently document resource allocation decisions and identify how funding shortfalls affect critical cyber security issues .
strong federal oversight will help ensure that these improvements are sustained .
although lanl cyber security officials told us that funding has been inadequate to address some of their security concerns , nnsa officials raised questions about the basis for lanl's funding request for cyber security .
lanl has implemented measures to enhance its cyber security , but weaknesses remain in protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of information on its unclassified network .
