the indian health service ( ihs ) , part of the public health service ( phs ) of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , funds health services to about 1.8 million indians , members of the nation's 562 federally recognized american indian and alaska native ( ai / an ) tribes in ihs service delivery areas .
it also shows ihs appropriations for recent years and discusses its current statutory authorities and legislative issues , including the reauthorization of appropriations in the indian health care improvement act ( ihcia ) and several other policy issues .
the federal government considers its provision of these health services to be based on its trust responsibility for indian tribes , a responsibility derived from federal statutes , treaties , court decisions , executive actions , and the constitution ( which assigns authority over indian relations to congress ) .
health services are available to eligible residents of reservations , of non - reservation areas of those counties that overlap or abut reservations , and of some urban areas with a significant ai / an population .
eligible indians receive free ihs health services regardless of their ability to pay ( except in certain urban programs , or when a tribe chooses to charge for services ) .
the supreme court has rejected the idea ( absent congressional statement to the contrary ) that ihs is under an obligation to provide any specific health program to indians .
this report provides an overview of the indian health service and how it provides for the health care problems and needs of ai / an .
congress , however , has only a moral obligation , not a legal one , to provide indian health care .
foremost is the reauthorization of the ihcia ( and related amendments to the social security act ( ssa ) ) .
no ihcia reauthorization bill has been introduced in the 111 th congress as of the date of this report , although medicaid - related provisions concerning cost - sharing , property exclusions , and consultation have been included in current draft economic - stimulus legislation .
the federal government's delivery of health services to indians , and funding of tribal and urban indian health programs , has developed over more than a century .
congress has continued to appropriate funds for its programs .
they would expand the roles of tribes , tribal organizations ( tos ) , and urban indian organizations ( uios ) in management and decision - making ; organize behavioral health services ( alcohol and substance abuse , social services , and mental health programs ) into a "comprehensive continuum" of prevention and treatment programs ; create a construction priority system for ihs - funded health facilities ; authorize long - term and hospice care ; exempt indians from medicaid and schip premiums and copayments ; allow urban indian health programs ( uihps ) to get reimbursements from medicare and other third parties ; and establish a commission on how to improve indian health care delivery .
negotiations among indian health proponents , hhs agencies , other departments , the administration , and congressional committees and offices have led to numerous changes in the bills from one congress to the next .
