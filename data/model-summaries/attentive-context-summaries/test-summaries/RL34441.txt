this crs report analyzes the security implications of taiwan's presidential election of march 22 , 2008 , including the implications for u.s. assessments , security interests , and options for policymakers in congress and the bush administration .
for details on u.s. arms sales , taiwan's missile program , a possible withdrawal of missiles by the people's liberation army ( pla ) , taiwan's defense budgets , etc .
this analysis draws in part from direct information gained through a visit to taiwan to observe the election and to discuss views with a number of interlocutors , including those advising or aligned with president chen shui - bian and president - elect ma ying - jeou .
this crs report will discuss the results of taiwan's presidential election and symbolic yet sensitive referendums on u.n. membership , outlook for taiwan's policies , implications for u.s. security interests in taiwan , and options for u.s. policymakers presented with a window of opportunity .
the issue is what options might be pursued by u.s. policymakers in congress and the bush administration to advance u.s. interests .
an alternative would be for the united states to continue its existing policy of resisting policy initiatives through the presidential inauguration on may 20 , 2008 ( until current president chen shui - bian leaves office ) .
alternatively , a window of opportunity is presented for the first time in years to advance u.s. security interests in taiwan's self - defense , democracy , economy ( as the united states' 9 th largest trading partner ) , and role as a responsible global citizen ( for example , in weapons nonproliferation ) .
there are a number of alternative futures for taiwan in the near and longer terms , including scenarios that are conducive to stability and policymaking , and scenarios that would challenge consensus - building and effective governance in taiwan , with implications for u.s. security interests in stability and deterrence .

a third approach to take ( either before or after ma's inauguration ) with comprehensive or certain options would strengthen u.s. - taiwan relations in military , political , or economic security .
kmt stays unified ; dpp rebuilds ; and stable two - party democracy is sustained .
kmt splits into factions ( ly out of control ) ; dpp re - organizes as strong challenge .
the united states could wait until the kmt resolves internal debates and clarifies its national security policy , including decisions on military programs , organization , personnel , leadership , and spending .
in one view , there is opportunity to turn u.s. attention from managing the cross - strait situation to urgent problems that require the prc's improved cooperation , such as dealing with nuclear proliferation in north korea and iran , the crisis in darfur in sudan , repression in burma , the crackdown in tibet , etc .
