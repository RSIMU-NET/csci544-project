our objectives were to assess ( 1 ) the progress made to develop , review , and approve facility and vessel security plans by july 1 , 2004 ; ( 2 ) the coast guard's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that facility and vessel security plans are implemented ; and ( 3 ) the accuracy of the coast guard's estimates of costs for complying with mtsa security planning and implementation requirements .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the nation's 361 ports have increasingly been viewed as potential targets for future attacks for many reasons .
for example , security experts remain concerned about the potential for using the maritime transportation system as a conduit for smuggling weapons of mass destruction or other dangerous materials into the country .
the maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) contains much of the federal government's approach to addressing these security vulnerabilities .
these stakeholders include law enforcement and other government agencies at every level ( federal , state , and local ) ; vessel owners and operators ; railroads ; port authorities ; factories and other businesses ; and people who work in port areas or live nearby .
further , cargo and cruise ships present potentially desirable terrorist targets , given the potential for loss of life , ecological destruction , or disruption of commerce .
one of its central maritime transportation security provisions is a requirement that security plans be developed and implemented for specific facilities ( such as factories , cargo terminals , and power plants ) ; certain individual cargo and passenger vessels ; and entire ports .
enacted in november 2002 and largely administered by the united states coast guard , an agency within the department of homeland security , mtsa is designed , in part , to help protect the nation's ports and waterways from terrorist attacks through a wide range of security improvements .
this aggressive timeline for both developing and implementing security plans reflects the seriousness of the port security issue .
and ports often are not only gateways for the movement of goods , but also industrial hubs and close to population centers , presenting additional opportunities for terrorists bent on urban destruction .
progress has been made , though the extent to which all facilities and vessels will have adequate plans ready to implement as of july 1 , 2004 , is still unclear .
the coast guard estimated that the security improvements imposed by these requirements would likely cost port stakeholders $7.3 billion over 10 years — most of it borne by facility and vessel owners and operators .
specifically , assessing the progress made to develop , review , and approve the security plans for facilities and vessels by july 1 , 2004. assessing the u.s. coast guard's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that all necessary port security improvements are implemented .
although perspectives may vary , the specter of further terrorist incidents has led to widespread agreement that port security should be strengthened — and soon .
coordinating a security response for this myriad of potential targets is a daunting proposition , in part because so many different stakeholders are involved .
the basic aim of such plans is to address potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to kill people , cause environmental damage , or disrupt transportation systems and the economy , by developing measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities .
