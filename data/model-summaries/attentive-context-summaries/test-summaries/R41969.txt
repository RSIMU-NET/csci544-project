the global economy has undergone dramatic changes over the past 60 years .
this report addresses these concerns in two parts by ( 1 ) describing and analyzing trends that are transforming the global economy , and ( 2 ) highlighting varied policy challenges raised by the new global economy for congressional consideration .
with important responsibilities for the formulation of u.s. international trade and financial policies , congress has an interest in understanding how these shifts of wealth and power are affecting u.s. economic interests .
international institutions , such as the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , the world bank , the world trade organization ( wto ) , and the international monetary fund ( imf ) ; private research institutions , such as the brookings institution and the carnegie endowment for international peace ; and private sector research entities , such as goldman sachs and pricewaterhouse coopers , have all issued analyses of the changing global economy .
in the early 1950s , the world economy was essentially divided between developed or industrialized countries in the "north" and developing or non - industrialized countries in the "south. .
developed countries , excluding japan , at that time accounted for 90% of world manufacturing output and 90% of world exports of manufactured goods .
their share of global trade has increased significantly , with trade and investment between developing countries ( south - south trade and investment ) becoming an important new force in the global economy .
spurred by the information technology ( it ) revolution , trade liberalization and other economic reforms , the entry of an estimated 2 billion people into the labor force as a result of the breakdown of the soviet bloc and the opening of china , and the freer movement of capital and technology from developed countries to developing countries , the size of the global economy doubled over the decade preceding the 2008-2009 global financial crisis , increasing from $31 trillion in 1999 to $62 trillion in 2008 .
if current trends persist , the shifts in wealth and power could become more pronounced over the next several decades .
in addition to altering global gdp rankings , the changes in the global economy have affected the centers of economic growth , the location of manufacturing , and international trade patterns .
the global economy has been reshaped over the past two decades .
while the evolution of the g - 20 as a key forum for international economic policy coordination mechanisms is considered by many as a major step toward increasing the responsibility of the rising powers for the smooth functioning of the world economy , the g20 also raises questions about representation and legitimacy .
these include concerns about the adequacy of the regulatory system for integrating developing countries into international financial arrangements , rules for direct investment , the role and operation of sovereign wealth funds , and the future of the dollar as world's primary reserve currency .
in addition to a large imbalance in the structure of production and exports , there was a dramatic imbalance in living standards and political power as well .
discussion and analysis of these trends has intensified over the past few years .
