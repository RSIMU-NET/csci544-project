the u.s. coast guard is the agency charged by law with overseeing the safety of vessels and maritime operations .
for at least four decades , congress has been concerned about the coast guard's ability to maintain an adequate staff of experienced marine safety personnel with technical knowledge of vessel construction and accident investigation .
in the hamm alert maritime safety act of 2018 ( p.l .
115-265 , â§210 ) , congress directed the coast guard to brief congressional committees of jurisdiction on its efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff , the staff responsible for ensuring that vessels are meeting safety standards .
recent incidents , particularly the 2015 sinking of the u.s. - flag cargo ship el faro with the loss of 33 lives during a hurricane near the bahamas , have revived questions about the coast guard's persistent difficulty with hiring and training a marine safety workforce .
the safety inspections of the vessel were found to have been inadequate .
in the frank lobiondo coast guard authorization act of 2018 ( p.l .
115-282 , â§501 ) congress requested a report from the coast guard detailing the courses and other training a marine inspector must complete to be considered qualified , including any courses that have been dropped from the training curriculum in recent years .
this report examines the staffing challenges the coast guard faces in assuring marine safety at a time when its responsibilities in this area are increasing significantly .
adding to the coast guard's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals , whose siting , operations , and security are partly or entirely under coast guard jurisdiction , as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel .
it also considers proposals to realign marine safety functions within the federal government .
however , congress has shown reluctance to eliminate any of the coast guard's missions .
congress has been increasing the agency's role in fishing vessel safety as well , putting additional demands on the safety workforce .
some members of congress , dissatisfied with the army corps of engineers' performance in the provision of navigation channel infrastructure , have proposed transferring that function to the department of transportation .
for instance , the federal aviation administration has been criticized for increasing its reliance on private - sector inspectors paid by industry rather than enhancing its in - house inspection workforce .
about 60% of the 217 ships in the dry - cargo u.s. - flag commercial fleet and 53% of u.s. - flag offshore supply vessels ( which service oil rigs ) are older than 20 years ; the el faro had been in service for 40 years .
the trump administration also has proposed this transfer as part of a larger reorganization plan involving multiple agencies .
the coast guard repeatedly has made statements in recent decades laying out its plans to improve the quality of its inspection workforce .
the coast guard engages in two distinct activities with respect to marine safety: vessel inspection .
similarly , the department of transportation's pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration , which regulates pipeline safety , has found that experienced inspectors are often hired away as safety compliance officers by pipeline companies .
