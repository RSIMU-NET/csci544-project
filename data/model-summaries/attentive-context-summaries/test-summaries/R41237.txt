securing the borders of the united states has long been a contentious political issue .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ( and subsequent attempts on u.s. soil ) , the significant domestic population of unauthorized aliens , and recent concerns over drug - trafficking - related violence in mexico and the potential for spillover into the united states have all continued to fuel this debate .
although the united states is often described as "a country of immigrants" and a "melting pot," highlighting the relative openness of its borders , the borders have also served as a line of protection against external security threats .
in the past decade , with the reorganization of homeland security and the national security focus on terrorism , several congresses , administrations , and the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( commonly known as the 9 / 11 commission ) have put forth proposals for how to secure the u.s. border .
since at least the 1980s , the border has played a central role in the debate over how to provide domestic security in the united states .
with globalization producing increasing transnational threats to the united states , the pressure to use the border as a protection mechanism has grown .
and ( 3 ) are there more effective alternatives to achieve border protection ? .
market competitiveness and demands for efficiency create a push for more open borders to unencumber the flows of capital and labor .
for congressional policymakers , the current state of border protection presents at least three questions: ( 1 ) what does the current border protection framework consist of ? .
the five strategic commonalities to achieve these goals consist of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) leadership , deployment of layered security , maximizing domain awareness , promotion of a shared agency culture , and expansion of the border through international and domestic partnerships .
policymakers have also had to cope with a tension between border protection issues and free market ideals .
however , while the recent publication of the quadrennial homeland security review ( qhsr ) lays the foundation for a cross - agency border protection strategy , some question whether a comprehensive strategy has been sufficiently mapped out .
such threats can take many shapes , but in recent years they have mainly included illegal immigration , smuggling and trafficking , and terrorism .
moreover , despite the fact that over $100 billion has been appropriated to border protection functions since the formation of dhs , it remains unclear whether border protection measures are being deployed that will ultimately provide for a comprehensive , strategically effective border protection effort without significantly disrupting the border region economy .
security concerns , however , frequently impede the movement of goods and labor as they are screened to determine if they pose risks to the united states .
 ( 2 ) is it working ? .
what has emerged from these efforts has been a generally agreed upon framework of mission and goals .
moreover , such questions provide an opportunity for legislators to re - evaluate the policies that have been pursued in providing border protection , especially as these policies might impact other elements of the u.s. border , such as markets and communities .
