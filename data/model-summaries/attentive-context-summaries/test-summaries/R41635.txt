broad efforts are underway to expand the use of renewable energy technologies to increase domestic energy production , improve u.s. energy security , create new industries and new jobs , and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
according to the u.s. energy information administration , renewable energy technologies provided 3.6% of u.s. electricity generation in 2009 .
congress extended the program for one year , through 2011 , in the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l .
in february of 2009 , congress passed new legislation that provides renewable energy projects with an alternative option for realizing the value of federal tax benefits: a grant in lieu of tax credits ( section 1603 of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l .
since weak tax - equity markets were a motivating factor in adopting the section 1603 grant program in 2009 , understanding trends in tax - equity markets may help congress evaluate whether the policy motivations that led to the adoption of the section 1603 grant program under arra remain relevant .
the section 1603 grant program was established in response to weak tax - equity markets .
although u.s. renewable electricity markets have grown in size and scope in recent years , the cost of renewable electricity generation continues to be typically higher than conventional generation sources ( e.g. , coal , natural gas , existing nuclear ) .
of the 144 million megawatt hours of electricity generated from renewable sources , wind provided 51.4% , wood and wood - derived fuels provided 24.8% , other forms of biomass provided 12.8% , geothermal accounted for 10.4% , and solar thermal / photovoltaic provided 0.6% .
the section 1603 grant program was initially enacted on a temporary basis , and was scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 .
this report provides a detailed overview of tax - equity markets during the recent financial crisis , as well as information on the current status of tax - equity markets .
federal tax policy has served to reduce this cost gap by providing various tax incentives for renewable energy .
the first part of this report focuses on how different renewable energy market sectors have responded since the grant option was made available .
investors may carry unused tax credits forward to offset future tax liability , or , alternatively , partner with a third - party tax - equity investor capable of providing cash in exchange for tax benefits .
understanding how different renewable energy markets have responded to the grant option may provide some insight regarding the potential implications for the renewable energy market of letting the section 1603 grant program expire as scheduled at the end of 2011 .
compared to direct tax incentives , however , the section 1603 grant program may be an improvement in terms of economic efficiency .
one key motivation for creating the section 1603 grant program was the perceived lack of tax equity capacity available for renewable electricity generation projects following the financial crisis in 2007 .
in recent years , the size of tax benefits available for renewable energy investors has sometimes exceeded the investor's tax liability .
as another option , existing tax incentives could be modified to provide some of the added benefits associated with the section 1603 grant program .
