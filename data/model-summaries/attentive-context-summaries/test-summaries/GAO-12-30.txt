on august 14 , 2008 , congress passed the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) to strengthen cpsc's authority to enforce safety standards and provide greater public access to product safety information .
in this report , we examine ( 1 ) the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , ( 2 ) the extent to which the information required for submitting a report of harm is sufficient to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review a manufacturer's claim that a report of harm contains materially inaccurate information ( mii ) , and ( 3 ) the length of time cpsc takes to review and resolve manufacturers' claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm .
a large number of consumer product recalls in 2007-2008 has led to heightened scrutiny of consumer product safety regulation , and congress has considered the accessibility to the public of consumer complaints submitted to the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) .
we assessed the reliability of these data by ( 1 ) performing electronic testing , ( 2 ) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them , and ( 3 ) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and related management controls .
the reporting objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , ( 2 ) the extent to which the information required for submitting a report of harm is sufficient to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review a manufacturer's claim that a report of harm contains materially inaccurate information , and ( 3 ) the length of time cpsc takes to review and resolve manufacturers' claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm .
additionally , we obtained and analyzed electronic data from cpsc's safety information database to identify ( a ) what type of individuals and entities are submitting reports of harm , ( b ) what information is captured in the database , ( c ) the type of product identification information included in reports , ( d ) reports that include claims of material inaccuracy and the outcomes for these claims , ( e ) the length of time manufacturers take to respond to a report of harm , and ( f ) the length of time cpsc takes to resolve a claim of material inaccuracy .
we found that 5,464 reports of harm were submitted to saferproducts.gov by the five categories of submitters eligible to file a report of harm â€” ( 1 ) consumers ; ( 2 ) local , state , or federal government agencies ; ( 3 ) health care professionals ; ( 4 ) child service providers ; and ( 5 ) public safety entities .
to effectively implement the recent amendments to cpsia , we recommend that cpsc enhance the analytic methods it uses to identify product information in a report of harm , such as by verifying whether the model field in its data contains a number ( versus a text response , which would not meet the statutory requirement ) or by searching for model numbers or serial numbers that may be listed in other fields .
