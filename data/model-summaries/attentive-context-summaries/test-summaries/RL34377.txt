during the past six decades , congress on four occasions has approved legislation designed to regulate lobbyist contact with members of congress .
in 1995 , congress passed , and the president signed into law , the lobbying disclosure act , which repealed the 1946 act and created a detailed system of reporting thresholds .
the initial provisions , which were contained in the legislative reorganization act of 1946 , required that lobbyists register with the house of representatives and the senate and dis close certain receipts and expenditures .
it also creates a more effective and equitable system for administering and enforcing the disclosure requirements .
finally , in 2007 , congress amended the 1995 act to further enhance disclosure and reporting requirements for lobbyists and lobbying firms .
the lobbying disclosure act ( lda ) of 1995 provided specific thresholds and definitions of lobbyists , lobbying activities , and lobbying contacts , compared to the 1946 act .
in reporting the lda , the house judiciary committee summarized the need for new lobbying provisions: the act is designed to strengthen public confidence in government by replacing the existing patchwork of lobbying disclosure laws with a single , uniform statute which covers the activities of all professional lobbyists .
in 1998 , technical amendments to the 1995 law were passed .
the most recent amendments to the lda , the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 ( hloga ) , mandated additional and more frequent disclosures .
the technical amendments made to the lda in 1998 clarified the definition of covered executive branch officials , more clearly defined what constitutes a lobbying contact , and provided that organizations , whose lobbying activities are limited by their internal revenue code ( irc ) non - profit status , could use their tax estimates to report lobbying activities .
the offices of the clerk and the secretary have sought to interpret the lda with respect to these problems in accordance with the original intent of the law , but it is necessary and appropriate to conform the language of the law to intent , and that is the motivation behind the introduction of s. 758 .
in reporting the 1998 technical amendments , the senate committee on governmental affairs explained the need for change: once the lda was implemented by the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate , several minor problems with the language of the statute materialized .
the act streamlines disclosure requirements to ensure that meaningful information is provided and requires all professional lobbyists to register and file regular , semiannual reports identifying their clients , the issues on which they lobby , and the amount of their compensation .
the guidance document is only meant as an interpretation of the law , and is not enforceable as law .
pursuant to the 1946 act , the 1995 lda , as amended by the 1998 act , and the hloga , the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate have had joint responsibility for implementing systems to register lobbyists .
in addition to collecting registration and disclosure documents from lobbyists the clerk and the secretary are required to 1. provide guidance and assistance on the registration and reporting requirements of this act and develop common standards , rules , and procedures for compliance with this act ; 2. review , and , where necessary , verify and inquire to ensure the accuracy , completeness , and timeliness of registration and reports ; 3. develop filing , coding , and cross - indexing systems to carry out the purpose of this act , including â€” a. a publicly available list of all registered lobbyists , lobbying firms , and their clients ; and b. computerized systems designed to minimize the burden of filing and maximize public access to materials filed under this act ; 4. make available for public inspection and copying at reasonable times the registrations and reports filed under this act ; 5. retain registrations for a period of at least 6 years after they are terminated and reports for a period of at least 6 years after they are filed ; 6. compile and summarize , with respect to each semi - annual period , the information contained in registrations and reports filed with respect to such period in a clear and complete manner ; 7. notify any lobbyist or lobbying firm in writing that may be in noncompliance with this act ; and 8. notify the united states attorney for the district of columbia that a lobbyist or lobbying firm may be in noncompliance with this act , if the registrant has been notified in writing and has failed to provide an appropriate response within 60 days after notice was given under paragraph ( 7 ) .
