our review focused on the operations of the canadian wheat board and the trade remedies applicable to the activities of state trading enterprises .
as you requested , we have reviewed issues involving canadian grain exports to the united states .
state trading enterprises ( ste ) have existed for some time and have been considered legitimate trading entities by the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) since 1947 .
as you requested , we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issue date , unless you publicly announce its contents earlier .
we also reviewed the dispute settlement mechanisms within the cfta , the 1994 north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , and the wto .
we reviewed the following: ( 1 ) cwb operations , government assistance to the cwb and the canadian farmer , and ongoing changes to the environment in which the cwb operates ; ( 2 ) the availability of data to ascertain cwb pricing practices , and efforts to increase the amount of data available ; and ( 3 ) the nature of trade remedies available to address the operations of stes , and the frequency with which these remedies have been applied to stes .
to identify efforts to increase the amount of data available we evaluated whether the wto has made progress in increasing the amount of information available on the cwb and other stes as well as wto members' compliance with ste reporting requirements .
u.s. concerns that the cwb has an unfair pricing advantage have led to efforts to increase the transparency of cwb pricing practices .
neither cfta nor the use of trade remedies has resolved u.s. producer concerns about u.s. access to the canadian wheat market , cwb practices , and increasing canadian wheat imports into the united states .
so far , the united states has had limited success in achieving this objective .
thus far , the united states' and other countries' efforts to expand ste reporting requirements on pricing have had limited success .
canadian wheat and barley producers have historically received transportation subsidies that reduced shipping costs .
the cwb faces structural changes due to recently completed legislative reforms , and other changes in the canadian grain marketing system are underway ; however , it is unclear how these changes will affect the way that the cwb conducts its business .
some aspects of cwb pricing are better known than others .
canadian wheat and barley producers have historically received transportation subsidies that reduced shipping costs .
also , u.s. food use of durum has risen 125 percent over the past 2 decades ; thus , as the demand for durum wheat has increased , so too have u.s. imports of this wheat from canada .
canadian access to u.s. elevators , on the other hand , is relatively less impeded .
the united states wants to ( 1 ) deviate from the panel decision by applying a broader definition of “acquisition price” ; ( 2 ) expand the audit to cover not only durum but also spring wheat and barley ; and ( 3 ) include in the audit canadian grain export prices to countries other than the united states .
