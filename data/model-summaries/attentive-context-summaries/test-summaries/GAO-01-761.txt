as agreed , using the selected key outcomes for usda as a framework , we ( 1 ) assessed the progress usda has made in accomplishing these outcomes and the strategies the agency has in place to achieve them ; and ( 2 ) compared usda's fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the agency's previous year performance report and plan for these outcomes .
as you requested , we reviewed the u. s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( gpra ) to assess the agency's progress in achieving selected key outcomes that you identified as important mission areas for the agency .
to improve usda's performance reporting and planning , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture ( 1 ) set priorities for improving the timeliness of the data that usda is using for measuring its performance ; ( 2 ) improve usda's performance report by including more consistent discussions of data verification and validation ; ( 3 ) better match the department's goals and outcomes with its capabilities for expanding and maintaining global market opportunities ; ( 4 ) include performance goals and measures for strategic human capital management issues and information security issues in the departmental performance plan ; ( 5 ) make reducing food stamp trafficking an annual performance goal in usda's plan ; and ( 6 ) address and include the office of inspector general's major management challenges in future performance plans .
these selected key outcomes are ensuring an adequate and reasonably priced food supply ; opening , expanding , and maintaining global market opportunities for reducing hunger and ensuring food for the hungry ; ensuring a safe and wholesome food supply ; and reducing food stamp fraud and error .
