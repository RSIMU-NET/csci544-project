the u.s. coast guard , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , is the principal federal agency responsible for maritime safety , security , and environmental stewardship .
in recent years , the coast guard has begun to deploy new assets , such as national security cutters and fast response cutters , and has taken actions to assess what assets it needs to carry out its missions and how to best allocate its current assets .
following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the coast guard was charged with expanded security - related mission responsibilities .
the coast guard continues to face decisions about what assets it needs and how to best allocate those assets to meet its mission responsibilities .
it is primarily based on our may 2016 report on the coast guard's allocation of assets ; as well as prior reports on the coast guard's acquisition of assets , in addition , my statement includes selected updates from may 2016 on the coast guard's efforts to reassess and update its mission needs , and fiscal year 2015 asset resource hour data .
we have reported extensively on the coast guard's challenges in managing its multi - billion dollar major acquisition portfolio , intended to acquire assets and capabilities to conduct its various missions .
the impact of balancing a broad array of coast guard missions , in conjunction with constrained budgets in recent years , have underscored the need for the coast guard to ensure it has the proper mix of assets and can effectively allocate them to achieve its mission responsibilities .
in addition , in may 2016 , we reported on the challenges that the coast guard faces in strategically allocating its assets to meet its strategic goals .
we have also reported that the coast guard has experienced delays in acquiring some of its planned assets and some of the coast guard's new assets that have been deployed have faced operational challenges .
in addition to the 20-year fleet modernization plan , we have made several recommendations in recent years for the coast guard to improve its recapitalization business case by , among other things , identifying the cost , capabilities , and quantity and mix of assets needed ; as well as the trade - offs necessary to meet fiscal constraints .
nevertheless , because of changes in the assumptions underlying the 2005 mission needs statement baseline , it may not accurately reflect the coast guard's current needs , specifically ( 1 ) the planned fleet mix of aircraft and vessels has changed , and ( 2 ) the planned operational capacities of these new assets have , in some cases , been revised downward .
it is to determine the most cost - effective method of executing mission needs by addressing ( 1 ) gaps identified in the mission need statement , ( 2 ) the funding requirements proposed in the 5-year capital investment plan , and ( 3 ) options for reasonable combinations of alternative capabilities of aircraft and vessels , to include icebreaking resources and fleet mix .
furthermore , to ensure that assets are deployed consistent with coast guard mission priorities , the coast guard should follow through with implementing our prior recommendations to improve its annual resource allocation process .
