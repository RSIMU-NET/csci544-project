sourcing policy refers , generally , to determining which sector — public ( government ) or private — will perform an agency's function ( s ) .
efforts to address this issue , and related questions , have been the subject of the federal government's sourcing policy since at least the 1950s .
both federal employees and contractor employees have valid roles to play in performing the work of the federal government .
this combined workforce is known as a blended workforce .
sourcing policy is not so much a product of coordinated planning and implementation as it is an amalgamation of statutory provisions , policy letters , administrative directives , and guidance issued by various presidential administrations .
sourcing policy encompasses two major strains .
sourcing policy has been at the root of contentious debates , which may complicate the somewhat murky picture .
determining which sector will perform which functions , including determining when federal employee performance is , or should be , required can be challenging , however .
this brief overview of the report is provided to assist in navigating the subject of sourcing policy .
notably , the federal government's short - term and long - term responses to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , involved a significant growth in service contracting .
delving into the history of sourcing policy is necessary for understanding the strain that emerged in the 1950s , and for providing context for the strain that emerged during president barack obama's administration .
the federal government invaded afghanistan and then iraq ; added a new department tasked with safeguarding the homeland ; and embarked upon a raft of new initiatives and programs involving , for example , intelligence , transportation security , and cybersecurity .
the juxtaposition of the bush administration's competitive sourcing initiative and the obama administration's multi - sector workforce management effort aids in understanding different , yet potentially complementary , facets of sourcing policy .
the following section examines the two strains of sourcing policy: competitive sourcing and multi - sector workforce management .
the current circular ( or revision ) was released in may 2003 .
the latter strain has not necessarily displaced , or replaced , the former strain , though it might not always be clear to outside observers what actions agencies are taking , or are expected to take .
the strain that emerged first , with the issuance of three bureau of the budget ( bob ) bulletins in the 1950s , emphasizes governmental reliance on the private sector for the provision of goods and services .
thus , the second strain of sourcing policy that has emerged focuses on ensuring that the federal government has the best , or most appropriate , mix of federal employees and contractor employees .
generally , the term introduced by the administration of president george w. bush — competitive sourcing — is associated with this strain of sourcing policy .
policy issues that may be of interest to the 112 th congress are also discussed .
the complexity might be due , at least in part , to the ad hoc fashion in which sourcing policy has evolved and the mix of government documents involved .
determining who should do the work of the federal government became more challenging as , for example , certain practices were called into question ( e.g. , using companies to conduct passenger screening at airports ) ; controversy swirled around some events that involved private security contractors ( e.g. , private security guards reportedly shot iraqi civilians in 2007 ) ; and concerns surfaced that , in the rush to expand its capabilities , the federal government was at risk of having contractor employees perform inherently governmental work .
