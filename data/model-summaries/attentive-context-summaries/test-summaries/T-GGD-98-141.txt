in response to the april 19 , 1995 , bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city , the president directed the department of justice ( doj ) to assess the vulnerability of federal office buildings , particularly to acts of terrorism and other forms of violence .
a doj - directed interagency working group issued a report in june 1995 recommending specific minimum security standards for federal buildings and criteria , guidance , and timetables for evaluating the security needs of federal buildings and estimating the cost of needed upgrades .
the president directed executive departments and agencies to upgrade the security of their facilities to the extent feasible based on the doj report's recommendations , and he gave the general services administration ( gsa ) this responsibility for the buildings it controls .
in july 1995 , gsa initiated a multimillion - dollar security enhancement program for its 8,300 buildings .
available for the building security program ; and develop outcome - oriented program goals , measures , and evaluations so that it can better manage the program and work toward mitigating security threats in its buildings .
gsa's computer - based upgrade tracking system showed that about 7,000 upgrades were completed between october 1 , 1995 , and march 31 , 1998 , and based on data from gsa's accounting system , we estimated that gsa obligated roughly $353 million from the federal buildings fund ( fbf ) for these upgrades .
using the criteria , guidance , and timetables recommended in the doj report , gsa has made progress in assessing risks , setting priorities , and completing thousands of upgrades in its buildings , particularly the high - risk ones .
however , because of erroneous and incomplete data in these systems , we were unable to reliably determine the exact status or costs of the program .
specifically , we were to determine ( 1 ) what criteria gsa used to assess security risks and prioritize security upgrades for its buildings , ( 2 ) the implementation and operational status of gsa's security upgrade program and the costs gsa has incurred by both funding source and type of security upgrade , and ( 3 ) whether any problems have hindered gsa's implementation of the security upgrade program .
these included ( 1 ) funding source uncertainties ; ( 2 ) mistakes made to meet deadlines by a downsized staff , as well as a sense of urgency to rapidly complete as many security upgrades as possible ; and ( 3 ) unreliable upgrade cost estimates .
specifically , you asked that we determine ( 1 ) what criteria gsa used to assess security risks and prioritize security upgrades for its buildings , ( 2 ) the implementation and operational status of gsa's security upgrade program and the costs gsa has incurred by both funding source and type of security upgrade ( such as x - ray machines and security guards ) , and ( 3 ) whether any problems have hindered gsa's implementation of the security upgrade program .
in addition to the unreliable nature of the data in the upgrade tracking and accounting systems , several other problems have hindered and slowed gsa's implementation of the security upgrade program .
