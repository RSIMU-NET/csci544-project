a variety of offices at the federal level respond to complaints , grievances , and concerns from the public about government programs , services , and operations .
despite their differences , they exhibit a common purpose — to represent the public in such matters — which is reflected in the classic ombudsman: that is , a high - ranking official who may be situated outside the executive and possessing independent resources and powers .
this notion , which has developed over more than a century , has its modern genesis in sweden and its evolution largely in european parliamentary regimes .

still other entities may be proactive ; that is , they seek out certain clientele groups to notify them about relevant government services , assist them in gaining access to these , and ensure that such services are delivered properly and fully .
these entities , which differ in important respects , are variously referred to as complaint - handling , advocacy , public counsel , coordinative , and ombudsman offices .
the law also required the creation of an office of government information services ( ogis ) in the national archives and records administration ; it is to review executive - branch agency compliance with foia policies , recommend foia policy changes to congress and the president , offer mediation services between foia requesters and administrative agencies , and issue advisory opinions if mediation has not resolved a dispute .
