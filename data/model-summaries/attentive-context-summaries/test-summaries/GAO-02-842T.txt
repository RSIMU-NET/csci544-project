over the past decade , the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , through its accreditation program , has made considerable progress in achieving greater uniformity among state insurance regulators in carrying out their financial solvency oversight responsibilities .
we are pleased to discuss our observations to date of ongoing efforts to develop and implement more uniform regulatory processes within the insurance industry .
more recently , competitive pressures stemming from further consolidation of industries in the financial services sector and enactment of the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) has kept attention focused on regulatory reforms in the insurance industry .
of particular interest are those processes related to licensing individual producers ( agents and brokers ) who sell insurance , approving new insurance products that insurers wish to market , and licensing companies to sell insurance .
we have long held the view that state insurance regulation can be enhanced through greater uniformity .
in the past , we have encouraged insurance regulators to implement more uniform regulatory standards , usually in the context of financial oversight .
state regulators are also trying to streamline regulatory processes to help bring new insurance products to market more quickly .
many insurance industry participants advocate more uniform standards as a way to help streamline regulatory processes in an effort to make conducting business on a multistate or nationwide basis easier .
naic has undertaken several initiatives designed to streamline these regulatory processes .
chief among these has been the development and implementation of the system for electronic rate and form filing ( serff ) .
as requested , this statement focuses on three initiatives , highlighting their status to date , the issues encountered , and their prospects for success .
naic's speed to market initiative has focused both on developing a more centralized filing and approval process for some types of life and health insurance products and on improving existing state - based approval processes for other types of products .
other speed to market improvement efforts are directed toward existing state - based systems .
these initiatives are commonly referred to as: producer licensing reciprocity and uniformity , speed to market , and national treatment of companies .
naic and state regulators largely abandoned initial efforts to create a more centralized insurer licensing and oversight process in favor of improvements to existing state - based licensing processes .
naic's producer licensing reciprocity and uniformity initiative aims to streamline the licensing process for producers that desire to sell insurance in one or more states in addition to their state of residence .
the primary accomplishment of these improvement efforts to date has been the implementation of a common insurer license application form , the uniform certificate of authority application ( ucaa ) .
glba calls for a majority of states to either adopt uniform producer licensing laws or reciprocate with other states in the licensing process by november 2002 .
naic is now attempting to overcome this problem by developing an interstate compact , a legal mechanism under which states would cede product review and approval authority for certain types of insurance products to a regulatory commission , allowing it to eliminate deviations the individual states are unwilling to remove on their own .
