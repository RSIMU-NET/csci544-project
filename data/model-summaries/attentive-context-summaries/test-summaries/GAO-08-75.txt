in fiscal year 2005 the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) completed about 17,700 disability reevaluations .
specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) the operational controls va uses to ensure the effectiveness of the disability reevaluation process and ( 2 ) the management information va collects and uses to manage the disability reevaluation process .
in fiscal year 2006 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) paid about $26.5 billion in cash benefits to approximately 2.7 million veterans to compensate them for disabling medical conditions connected to injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during active military service .
to help ensure that veterans are properly compensated for these service - connected disabilities , va is required to perform disability reevaluations for specific disabilities .
va also performs disability reevaluations whenever it determines there is a need to verify either the continued existence or current severity of veterans' disabilities .
to develop the information for this report , we analyzed veterans benefits administration ( vba ) workload and timeliness data on disability reevaluations .
vba should develop a plan to collect and analyze data on the results of disability reevaluations .
vba plans on improving some of its control mechanisms through its new claims management system , vetsnet .
to the extent necessary , this information could be used to refine guidance on the selection and timing of future disability reevaluations .
ii ) , va generally agreed with our conclusions and concurred with our recommendations .
vba maintains a quality assurance review program known as the systematic technical accuracy review ( star ) program .
during this same time period , vba completed about 629,000 disability compensation claims .
va should modify its electronic claims processing system to ensure that a diary date is automatically generated by the system for all disabilities where a reevaluation is required by va's schedule for rating disabilities .
for example , reevaluations represented about 2 percent of the total number of disability claims decisions completed in fiscal year 2005 .
vba plans on improving its ability to track cancellations using vetsnet .
vba is improving some of its operational controls over reevaluations .
for example , in january 2002 , as a temporary effort to free up staff for processing its backlog of disability compensation and pension claims , vba postponed most of their currently scheduled reevaluations for 2 years .
vba should include cancelled reevaluations in its quality assurance reviews and should evaluate the feasibility of periodically sampling a larger number of completed disability reevaluations for quality assurance review .
by not tracking this information , va does not have a clear sense of the extent to which reevaluations are being cancelled ( as noted ) or whether some reevaluations are simply never started .
in addition , without data on the results of reevaluations , vba cannot ensure that it is prioritizing its resources to reevaluate those veterans whose disabilities are likely to change , and that it is reevaluating those disabilities at the appropriate point in time .
according to vba officials , when vetsnet is fully implemented for disability compensation claims in may 2008 , vba will be able to track the number and reasons for cancelled disability reevaluations .
inadequate management controls could result in some veterans being under - compensated for conditions that have worsened or over - compensated for conditions that have improved .
