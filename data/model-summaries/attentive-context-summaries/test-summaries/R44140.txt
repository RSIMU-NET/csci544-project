1487 ) and the north american energy infrastructure act ( s. 1228 ) .
this report focusses on the presidential permit review processes for cross - border energy infrastructure as implemented by these agencies: the department of state for pipelines and similar facilities that transport liquids such as petroleum , petroleum products , and other hazardous liquids ; the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) for natural gas pipelines and associated facilities ; and the department of energy ( doe ) for electricity transmission lines and associated facilities .
for decades , executive permission in the form of a presidential permit has been required for the construction , connection , operation , and maintenance of certain facilities that cross the united states' borders with canada and mexico .
most notable was the keystone xl pipeline approval act ( s. 1 ) , which was passed in congress but vetoed by president obama .
however , questions remain about the manner in which this authority is exercised among the agencies to which it has been delegated .
in particular , some members of congress and affected stakeholders seek greater clarity about how presidential permit applications are reviewed for various kinds of cross - border energy projects , including the degree to which there may be differences or similarities among the various agency approaches to evaluating environmental impacts of proposed projects and in determining whether they serve the national or public interest .
the constitutional basis for the president's cross - border permitting authority was examined in a prior crs report .
other legislative proposals in the 114 th congress included the american energy renaissance act of 2015 ( s. 791 and h.r .
with few exceptions , requests for presidential permits for cross - border pipelines or electric transmission lines have involved projects extending a relatively short distance into a u.s. border state before connecting to some existing facility ( e.g. , a refinery in texas or a power plant in arizona ) .
given the issues that arose in the wake of transcanada's application for the keystone xl pipeline , congress may again propose legislation intended to expedite approval of future applications for presidential permits .
in particular , there has been significant national attention on the department of state's process for considering transcanada's permit application for its proposed keystone xl pipeline .
in response to perceived delays in the review of the keystone xl permit application , several legislative proposals in the 114 th congress sought to change some specific or general aspects of the presidential permit process .
in operation since 2010 , both projects transport oil sands crude from alberta , canada , deep into the united states via pipelines that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states .
however , in the last decade , two long cross - border pipeline projects have been approved â€” transcanada's keystone and enbridge energy's alberta clipper .
this report compares practices among these three agencies with respect to how they define a proposed project's scope ( which dictates the array of associated impacts they will review ) , conduct environmental reviews , and make final decisions on permit applications .
it also includes a discussion of recent efforts by congress to change those permitting processes .
