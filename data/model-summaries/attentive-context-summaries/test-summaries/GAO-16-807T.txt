while the department has made progress in these efforts , it has also faced significant information technology challenges that contributed to our designation of va health care as a high risk area .
thank you for inviting me to testify at today's hearing on the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) electronic health record system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — and the department's progress toward achieving interoperability with the department of defense ( dod ) .
for almost two decades , va has been working with dod to advance electronic health record interoperability between their systems , in an attempt to achieve the seamless sharing of health care data and make patient data more readily available to health care providers , reduce medical errors , and streamline administrative functions .
in addition , we have reported on actions that va has taken with regard to modernizing its electronic health record system .
since 2001 , we have issued a number of reports that addressed va's progress , in conjunction with dod , toward achieving interoperable electronic health records between their separate systems , as well as its project with dod to jointly develop a shared electronic health record system .
also , for much of this same time period , va has been planning and taking steps toward the modernization of its electronic health record system , with the intent of ensuring that the department can effectively deliver care for the millions of veterans and others that it serves .
as va has proceeded with its program to modernize vista ( known as vista evolution ) , the department has developed a number of plans to support its efforts .
the ipo is responsible for monitoring and reporting on va's and dod's progress in achieving interoperability and coordinating with the departments to ensure that these efforts enhance health care services .
in addition , va's unsuccessful efforts over many years to modernize its vista system raise concern about how the department can continue to justify the development and operation of an electronic health record system that is separate from dod's system , even though the departments have common system needs .
specifically , in developing this testimony , we relied on our previous reports , as well as information that we obtained and reviewed on va's actions in response to our previous recommendations .
among other actions , provisions in the act directed each department to ( 1 ) ensure that all health care data contained in their systems ( va's vista and dod's armed forces health longitudinal technology application , referred to as ahlta ) complied with national standards and were computable in real time by october 1 , 2014 ; and ( 2 ) deploy modernized electronic health record software to support clinicians while ensuring full standards - based interoperability by december 31 , 2016 .
as such , va's approach to addressing its electronic health record system needs remains uncertain .
in addition to the initiatives mentioned in table 1 , va has worked in conjunction with dod to respond to provisions in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , which required the departments to jointly develop and implement fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities in 2009 .
