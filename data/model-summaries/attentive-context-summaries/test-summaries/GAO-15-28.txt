the impacts and costs of certain weather disasters — such as floods , drought , and hurricanes — will increase in significance as previously rare events become more common and intense due to climate change , according to the united states global change research program's may 2014 national climate assessment .
this report examines ( 1 ) how federal and private exposure to losses has changed since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance and how climate change may affect insured and uninsured losses ; ( 2 ) how public insurers are preparing for climate change and associated challenges , if any ; and ( 3 ) how selected private insurers and reinsurers are preparing for climate change and associated challenges , if any .
while the magnitude and extent of future climate change effects are uncertain , climate change presents a significant financial risk to the federal government in many areas .
to determine how federal and private sector exposure to losses has changed since our 2007 report on flood and crop insurance and how climate change has or may affect insured and uninsured losses , we analyzed federal and private sector exposure data from 2007 through 2013 .
to promote greater resilience to climate change effects in u.s. agriculture , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture direct rma to consider working with agricultural experts to recommend or incorporate resilient agricultural practices into their expert guidance for growers , so that good farming practices take into account long - term agricultural resilience to climate change .
in 2007 , we found that climate change could increase federal insurers' financial risk and recommended that the secretaries of agriculture and homeland security analyze the potential long - term fiscal implications of climate change for crop insurance and flood insurance , respectively , and report their findings to congress .
nfip has been on our high - risk list since march 2006 because of concerns about its long - term financial solvency and related operational issues .
further , as we reported in 2014 , the federal government's crop insurance costs have increased in recent years , with appropriations more than doubling from $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $7.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 as program expansion and rising crop prices have led to increasing subsidy values and higher claims payments .
in the public sector , federal insurance programs include the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) , administered by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the u.s. department of homeland security , which makes flood insurance available to residential property owners and businesses , and the federal crop insurance program , administered by the risk management agency ( rma ) within the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , which protects farmers against financial losses caused by drought , floods , and other natural disasters , among other things .
as of june 2014 , fema's disaster relief fund had spent $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2014 , with an unspent balance of over $11.3 billion .
consequently , crop insurance may continue to cover losses resulting from practices that increase vulnerability to climate change .
as a result of these risks and the nation's fiscal condition , in february 2013 , we added limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks to our list of areas at high risk to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement , or most in need of transformation .
