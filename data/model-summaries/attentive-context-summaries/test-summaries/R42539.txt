oversight issues include whether the department of defense ( dod ) is properly taking adversary precision strike weapons into account in its own plans and programs .
use of guided rockets , artillery , mortars and other missiles ( g - ramm ) against a u.s. expeditionary force's forward operating bases ( fobs ) .
congress's decisions regarding combating the proliferation of precision strike in its oversight role could be wide - ranging , substantially affecting a variety of key factors , including capabilities and funding requirements ; service force levels and missions ; technology proliferation strategy ; forward - deployed basing considerations ; level of support given to allies ; strength of u.s. influence around the globe ; and the defense industrial base .
authorization and appropriations issues include whether congress should approve , reject , or modify proposed dod programs for responding to those weapons .
u.s. naval forces being restricted from protecting the world's waterways by anti - access / area denial measures , such as those under development in china , which could directly affect the u.s. ability to support key allies and greatly affect international trade and commerce .
some analysts state that "the united states took an early lead in exploiting the promise of precision - strike systems and the use of precision weaponry has given the united states a battlefield edge for twenty years .
precision strike systems utilize projectiles , bombs , missiles , torpedoes , and other weapons that can actively correct for initial - aiming or subsequent errors by homing on their targets or aim - points after being fired , released , or launched .
this report provides background information and considers issues for congress related to the worldwide proliferation of "precision strike" capabilities .
the fact that this ability of the united states to project power could also diminish , possibly leaving u.s. forces — and eventually the united states itself — increasingly vulnerable to precision weapons in the hands of its adversaries , will raise a number of serious considerations for members of congress .
such proliferation could lead to events such as the following: u.s. ground forces having to fight without the inherent safety of air superiority / supremacy , leaving them vulnerable to attack by enemy air forces for the first time in nearly 70 years .
the proliferation of precision strike creates potential issues for congress .
as precision - strike capabilities spread , will the united states see its edge erode ? .
finally , should congress legislate requirements for dod to develop precision strike countermeasures and then provide funding for that research and development ? .
however , these weapons are now spreading: other countries , and non - state actors , are acquiring them and developing countermeasures against them. .
the following is a short list of possible further questions for congress to consider: 1 .
how does the united states maintain the freedom of movement , trade routes , and global commerce that are key to the united states and world economies , as well as to u.s. national security ? .
guided weapons , including the v - 1 cruise missile and v - 2 ballistic missile , but also the fritz x air - to - surface weapon , were first used in combat by germany during world war ii .
