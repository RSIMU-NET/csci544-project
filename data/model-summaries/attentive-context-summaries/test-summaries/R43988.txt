investor - state dispute settlement ( isds ) provisions in international investment agreements ( iia ) enable an aggrieved investor , with an investment located in the territory of a foreign host government , to bring a claim against that government for breach of an investment agreement before an international arbitration panel .
the primary forum for investment arbitration is the international centre for settlement of investment disputes ( icsid ) , which is affiliated with the world bank .
ongoing trade negotiations among the united states and several pacific rim countries regarding the proposed trans pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement — and between the united states and the european union with respect to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) agreement — have rekindled debate over the value of including isds provisions in bits and trade agreements .
the united states has negotiated a number of bilateral investment treaties ( bit ) and free trade agreements ( fta ) that contain isds arbitration procedures for resolving investors' claims that a host country has violated substantive obligations intended to protect foreign investors and investments from discriminatory , unfair , or arbitrary treatment by the host government .
the centre was established by the 1965 convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states ( icsid convention ) .
other observers have raised questions about the extent to which isds may affect a government's ability to regulate in the public interest .
under most iias , the investor and respondent country may agree that the tribunal will conduct the proceedings according to certain procedural rules , such as the icsid rules of procedure for arbitration proceedings ; the united nations commission on international trade law ( uncitral ) arbitration rules ; or the icsid additional facility rules for disputes in which either the investor's home country or the host country , but not both , is a member of icsid .
some commentators have argued that isds arbitration procedures , along with substantive protections for investors and investments in iias , facilitate foreign direct investment ( fdi ) by depoliticizing investment disputes and providing stability and predictability to investors seeking to conduct business in a foreign nation .
bits , and the korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus ) , which has the most recent congressionally approved fta investment chapter , to show the types of provisions u.s. diplomats may seek to include in the tpp and t - tip .
although an investor submitting a claim under a u.s. iia must typically consent to the mandatory procedural rules contained therein , the parties to an investment dispute generally may jointly choose the forum as well as many of the procedural rules under which the tribunal conducts the arbitration .
among other things , it discusses who may bring a claim under an iia ; how arbitrators conduct such proceedings ; the remedies available to the disputing parties ; and how tribunals have interpreted certain substantive obligations contained in u.s. iias .
in addition to jurisdictional issues , isds proceedings have raised questions about the rules governing: ( 1 ) the independence and impartiality of arbitrators , including rules addressing their selection and disqualification ; ( 2 ) the transparency of arbitral proceedings , including access to documents and hearings ; ( 3 ) early dismissal of frivolous claims ; and ( 4 ) participation of third parties as amicus curiae ( "friends of the court" ) .
