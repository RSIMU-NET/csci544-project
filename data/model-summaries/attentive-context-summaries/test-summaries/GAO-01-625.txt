to help unaids achieve progress toward its mission and to help demonstrate this progress , we recommend that the secretary of state direct u.s. representatives on the cosponsors' executive boards to request the respective cosponsor: to accelerate its efforts to integrate hiv / aids into the work of its agency , and to hold country - level staff accountable for ( 1 ) participation in theme groups and ( 2 ) the results of theme groups' efforts to help host countries combat hiv / aids .
in this report , we ( 1 ) assess unaids' progress , especially at the country level , toward increasing the coordination and commitment of the u.n. and global community ; ( 2 ) assess unaids' progress in providing technical support and information and in developing a monitoring and evaluation plan to measure results ; and ( 3 ) identify factors that may have affected unaids' progress .
the secretary of state and the administrator , usaid , request that the unaids secretariat and cosponsors improve unaids' monitoring and evaluation efforts in order to determine the results of its overall efforts and measure progress , especially at the country level .
in january 1999 , unaids launched the international partnership against aids in africa to enhance national and international efforts against the epidemic in africa .
despite efforts by the international community to reduce the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) , aids is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world and the primary cause of death in sub - saharan africa .
in 2000 , the united states classified hiv / aids as a threat to national security , and the congress approved approximately $466 million for international hiv / aids efforts in 2001 .
according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids ( unaids ) , more than 36 million people are living with the virus worldwide , and more than 21 million have died since 1980 .
five years after its creation , the secretariat has yet to implement a monitoring and evaluation plan that would enable unaids to determine the important results of its overall efforts and measure progress toward achieving its objectives .
however , while unaids' cosponsors have recently intensified their commitment and efforts to integrate hiv / aids into their strategies and programs , their slow response has made it more difficult for unaids to achieve its mission .
this is particularly important because unaids' donors have indicated that future funding increases for unaids may depend on its effectiveness in showing results at the country level .
furthermore , given the scale of the pandemic , hiv / aids has grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and developmental crisis .
unaids , funded in part by the united states , is one important international effort against hiv / aids .
we found that u.n. cosponsors had not increased funding to integrate hiv / aids into their programs as expected and that unaids had not been effective in coordinating the u.n. response at the country level or in helping developing countries respond to the worldwide epidemic .
our report affirms that unaids has contributed to increased commitments and funding for aids efforts by the u.n. and national and international entities .
