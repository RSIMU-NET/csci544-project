this report presents the status of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) plans for conducting the taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) for tax year 1994 .
it also identifies the potential effects of these plans on measuring taxpayer compliance .
this report was prepared , not at the request of the committee , but as part of our continuing efforts to provide information and analysis to improve tax administration .
tcmp results play an important role in tax policy and administration decisions .
irs uses the data for measuring compliance levels , estimating the tax gap ( i.e. , the difference between the amount of income tax owed and the amount voluntarily paid ) , identifying compliance issues , developing formulas for objectively selecting returns to audit , and allocating audit resources .
congress and federal and state agencies use tcmp data for policy analysis , revenue estimating , and research .
because of tcmp's importance , we have been monitoring irs' plans to develop and implement the 1994 tcmp .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the status of irs' 1994 tcmp planning effort and ( 2 ) identify the potential effects of this plan on measuring taxpayer compliance .
in its 1994 tcmp plans , irs has gone a long way in improving its collection of compliance data .
we reported that tcmp was not too costly because past tcmp results had been used to more efficiently allocate billions of dollars in enforcement resources and to recommend tax law changes that generated billions of dollars of revenue a year .
congress' joint committee on taxation also opposed irs' proposed changes to tcmp , arguing that the changes were unlikely to provide data with the same quality and usefulness as those data found in prior tcmp surveys .
while the concept of such computerization is commendable , the computer system has not yet been developed and tested .
to mitigate these concerns , the former commissioner of internal revenue asked irs staff to redesign tcmp , reducing the sample size by over half and limiting the scope of the audits .
finally , we identified ways in which irs could make tcmp results more timely .
irs officials recognize that these activities are necessary to completely implement the improvements .
however , irs has already missed its september 1994 milestone for defining tcmp data requirements .
after the last tcmp survey for tax year 1988 , irs concluded that tcmp was too costly , too burdensome , and too time consuming .
however , these data may not be sufficient for developing compliance strategies .
this classification issue has plagued irs for decades .
tcmp audits actually reduce overall burden on taxpayers to the extent that they reduce the number of compliant taxpayers that are selected for other irs audits .
however , irs officials believe that the benefits from identifying more noncompliance will more than offset the cost associated with increased audit time .
until this is done , it will not be possible for auditors to be trained in its use .
in april 1993 , we reported on the importance of tcmp , indicating that the proposed changes to the size and scope of tcmp appeared unjustified and would undercut its benefits .
