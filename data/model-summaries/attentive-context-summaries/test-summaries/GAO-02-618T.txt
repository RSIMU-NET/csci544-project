mr. chairman and members of the committee: i appreciate the opportunity to testify on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) efforts to identify and deal with abusive tax schemes that primarily are used by individual taxpayers .
my statement today , based on work we have done at the committee's request , focuses on what is known about the extent of abusive tax schemes involving individual taxpayers , the status of irs's efforts to combat such schemes , and challenges irs faces in moving forward .
during hearings before this committee last april , several witnesses testified about the increased promotion and use of various types of abusive tax schemes and scams , including constitutional trusts , offshore trusts , and tax credits for slave descendants .
irs caught about $5 billion in improper tax avoidance or tax credit and refund claims , but estimated that another $20 billion to $40 billion had not been identified and addressed .
not all of these schemes were new , but in part due to the ease of marketing schemes cheaply through the internet , schemes were flourishing .
thus , irs's efforts to pursue abusive tax schemes are key to ensuring that such schemes do not undermine the federal tax system .
use of such schemes can pose a threat to the integrity and fairness of our tax system by adversely affecting voluntary compliance if honest taxpayers believe that significant numbers of individuals are not paying their fair share of the tax burden .
irs has recognized these challenges and is beginning to work on solutions and options .
to date , however , irs has not developed a means to track the resources , in particular staffing , devoted to combating abusive schemes or developed goals and measures that congress and irs can use to assess its progress .
the sheer number of possible abusive tax schemes that likely will require face - to - face audits could outstrip irs's available resources .
furthermore , identifying and handling these cases will require a better - coordinated effort on irs's part .
in part because no one individual or office could provide an agencywide perspective on irs's strategy , goals , objectives , performance measures , or program results , it is difficult to provide a clear picture of all that is underway and being accomplished in irs's efforts to address abusive tax schemes .
limited data also suggest that irs's enhanced focus has led to some increased success in convicting those promoting and taking advantage of abusive schemes , in publicizing these results , and in uncovering previously hidden major offshore compliance problems .
available information suggests , however , that irs has created new offices , reemphasized and reorganized certain prior efforts , and planned to assign or already assigned at least 200 additional staff to its efforts .
as of february 2002 , irs estimated that in tax year 2000 about 740,000 taxpayers had used abusive schemes .
nevertheless , irs officials believe that the number and dollar consequence of schemes has grown in recent years .
recent developments suggest that the number of individuals involved in one type of abusive tax scheme involving offshore accounts may be greater than what irs estimated just 2 months ago , and thus , potential lost revenues may be higher .
