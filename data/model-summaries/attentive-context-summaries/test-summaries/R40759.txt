lrp is used extensively by the united nations world food program ( wfp ) and has been proposed as a cost - effective , time - saving tool that the united states could use to meet emergency food needs .
local and regional procurement ( lrp ) of food aid refers to the purchase of commodities for emergency food aid by donors in countries with food needs or in another country within the region .
food aid budget submissions in fy2006 through fy2009 included a proposal with suggested legislative language to authorize the administrator of the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) to allocate up to 25% of the funds available for u.s. food aid ( title ii of p.l .
the previous administration's 2008 farm bill proposal for food aid also called for authorizing the use of p.l .
congressional and other critics of the local purchase proposal maintain that allowing non - u.s. commodities to be purchased would result in undermining the coalition of commodity producers , agribusinesses , private voluntary organizations ( pvos ) , and shippers that participate in the food aid program and in reducing u.s. food aid .
480 , or the food for peace act ) to local or regional purchase .
however , the president's fy2010 foreign affairs budget proposed , among other food - security - related items , that $300 million of international disaster assistance ( ida ) funds be used for lrp , cash transfers , and cash vouchers to meet emergency food needs .
further , savings achieved in transportation and distribution costs could be made available for additional commodity purchases , thereby increasing the overall level of the u.s. response .
the budget justification for this authority was that it would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the u.s. response to overseas food aid needs by eliminating the need to transport the commodities by ocean carriers .
could lrp contribute to agricultural development ( increased production , productivity , development of markets ) of low - income farmers in developing countries ? .
house and senate agriculture appropriators did not include this proposal in the annual funding bills .
instead , the 2008 farm bill ( p.l .
110-246 ) included a pilot project for lrp ( discussed below ) .
this proposal also was not adopted .
some of the issues that have been raised about lrp include the following: could the united states respond to emergency food needs at lower cost and in a more timely manner if commodities were purchased in locations closer to where they were needed ? .
could lrp adversely affect agricultural development and make poor consumers more food insecure ? .
the fiscal 2010 budget proposal for p.l .
480 title ii funds for lrp .
are there risks that could be associated with lrp that would make it a less - effective response to emergency food needs than provision of u.s. commodities ? .
480 title ii does not mention using title ii funding for lrp .
three recent reports — by the government accountability office ( gao ) , michigan state university ( msu ) , and the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) — examine issues with respect to lrp .
