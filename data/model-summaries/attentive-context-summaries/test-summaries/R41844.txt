barring major changes by congress in the form of increased appropriations from the fund or a redirection of its receipts , the fund's balance is expected to continue to increase .
the reclamation fund was established in 1902 as a special fund within the united states treasury to aid the development of irrigation on the arid lands of western states .
it originated as a revolving fund supported by the proceeds of the sale of land and water in the western united states .

over time it , has been amended to receive proceeds from a number of disparate sources , including power generation and mineral leasing .

such a change could take one or more forms , each of which may have an associated budget scoring impact .
in contrast to the aforementioned water settlements fund , some of this funding would be redirected to projects over the next 10 years .
