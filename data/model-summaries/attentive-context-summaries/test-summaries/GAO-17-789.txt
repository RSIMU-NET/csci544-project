the objectives of this report are to determine the extent to which ( 1 ) the navy and marine corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls , ( 2 ) the navy's and marine corps' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaborative practices , and ( 3 ) the marine corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into its operational training .
these key practices include ( 1 ) defining and articulating a common outcome ; ( 2 ) establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies ; ( 3 ) identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources ; ( 4 ) agreeing on roles and responsibilities ; ( 5 ) establishing compatible policies , procedures , systems , and other means to operate across agency boundaries ; ( 6 ) developing mechanisms to monitor , evaluate , and report on results ; and ( 7 ) reinforcing agency accountability for collaborative efforts through plans and reports , among others .
to achieve desired goals and align efforts to maximize training opportunities for amphibious operations , we recommend the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy , in coordination with the chief of naval operations and commandant of the marine corps , to clarify the organizations responsible and time frames to define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration , and use those outcomes to develop a joint strategy ; more fully establish compatible policies , procedures , and systems ; better leverage training resources ; and establish mechanisms to monitor results .
to more effectively and efficiently integrate virtual training devices into operational training , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the commandant of the marine corps to develop guidance for the development and use of virtual training devices that includes developing requirements for virtual training devices that consider and document training tasks and objectives , required proficiency , and available training time ; setting target usage rates and collecting usage data ; and conducting effectiveness analysis of virtual training devices that defines a consistent process for performing the analysis , including the selection of the devices to be evaluated , guidelines on conducting the analysis , and the data that should be collected and assessed .
according to the department of defense ( dod ) , the future security environment will require forces to train across the full range of military operations â€” including types of operations that have not been prioritized in recent years , such as amphibious operations .
in its comments , dod concurred with all three recommendations .
this first critical step will enable them to fully incorporate other leading collaboration practices aimed at a common purpose , such as developing a joint strategy ; more fully establishing compatible policies , procedures , and systems ; better leveraging resources ; and establishing mechanisms to monitor results that are needed to achieve service - level goals for naval integration and to align efforts to maximize training opportunities for amphibious operations .
developing guidance for the development and use of virtual training devices would help close these gaps , which is critical as virtual training will become increasingly important to the development of the capability of marines , including the capability for conducting amphibious operations , among other mission areas .
