in response to the disclosure of various national security agency ( nsa ) surveillance and data collection programs , a number of legislative changes to the government's intelligence operations authority have been suggested .
many of these proposals include amendments to the practices and procedures of the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) , and the fisa court of review , which reviews rulings of the fisc .
currently , the government's applications for surveillance orders to the fisc are classified , as are most fisa opinions themselves .
a number of proposals seek to increase government transparency by requiring public disclosure of fisa opinions .
these proposals might be understood to raise separation of powers issues , namely , the scope of the executive branch's control over national security information .
requiring the public disclosure of fisa opinions concerns many policy questions involving national security ; this report , however , is limited to the legal implications of such a requirement .
this report will first address current fisc procedures regarding disclosure , and will continue by analyzing the legal implications of mandating executive branch release of fisa opinions .
at least one group has proposed that all fisa decisions should be published in their entirety ; other proposals would allow the government to conduct a declassification review of the material first , substituting a summary of material when appropriate .
on the other hand , at least according to the public record , the fisa court of review has sat only twice ; and both times the court released its opinion with sensitive information redacted .
congress and the president thus share power over access to national security information .
while traditional federal courts also review classified information in camera , their final opinions are rarely kept confidential .
this analysis will include an examination of judicial doctrine and statutory practice regarding control of national security information , concluding that neither branch enjoys exclusive power over the matter ; rather , authority is shared between congress and the executive branch .
according to the fisc , traditional "courts operate primarily in public , with secrecy the exception ; the fisc operates primarily in secret , with public access the exception. .
congress enjoys power to regulate access to classified information ; however , the president generally makes the specific determination about what particular information is classified .
fisa opinions , in contrast , are not released publicly except in special circumstances .
the central issue is the extent to which congress may regulate control over access to national security information , including mandating that the executive branch disclose specific materials â€” a question not definitively resolved by the courts .
under the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) , the fisc reviews government applications to , inter alia , conduct surveillance and engage in data collection for foreign intelligence purposes .
fisa opinions and orders , most of which contain at least some sensitive facts pertaining to national security , are a mixture of legal reasoning and sensitive national security information .
in the latter , the executive branch could conceivably alter its strategy of what information to include in applications to the fisc , thus alleviating concerns about compelling the release of classified information ; although such an effect might raise separate constitutional questions of its own .
