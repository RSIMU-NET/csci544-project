to obtain more information about the quality of national data on child fatalities and near fatalities from maltreatment , the chairman , house ways and means committee , asked us to examine ( 1 ) the extent to which hhs collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment , ( 2 ) the challenges states face in collecting and reporting information on child fatalities from maltreatment to hhs , and ( 3 ) the assistance hhs provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child fatalities from maltreatment .
estimate the costs and benefits of collecting national data on near fatalities and take appropriate follow - up actions .
according to estimates by the national child abuse and neglect data system ( ncands ) , 1,770 children in the united states died from physical abuse or other forms of maltreatment in fiscal year 2009 .
the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is the principal federal agency that provides oversight of state child welfare systems , which are intended , in part , to protect children who have been maltreated and help prevent maltreatment .
infants and toddlers are the most vulnerable to such abuse and neglect .
to better understand the scope of child maltreatment , including child fatalities , and inform efforts to address and prevent it , the 1988 amendments to the child abuse prevention and treatment act ( capta ) required hhs to establish a national data collection and analysis program for child maltreatment data .
as of fiscal year 2009 , all states reported at least some data on child maltreatment to ncands .
the most recent report , for fiscal year 2009 , presents national data about child abuse and neglect known to child welfare agencies in the united states .
use stronger mechanisms to routinely share analyses and expertise with its partners on the circumstances of child maltreatment deaths , including insights that could be used for developing prevention strategies .
collecting complete and consistent information is important for understanding the magnitude of the problem and for targeting efforts to help prevent future child deaths and near deaths from maltreatment .
these efforts could include identifying and sharing states' best practices , particularly those that foster cross - agency coordination and help address differences in state definitions and interpretation of maltreatment and / or privacy and confidentiality concerns .
every year , children in the united states die after being physically abused , severely neglected , or otherwise maltreated , frequently at the hands of their parents or others who are entrusted with their care .
yet such cooperative efforts are a work in progress , and assistance from hhs to help states collect and report more comprehensive child fatality data is important .
in its comments , hhs agreed with our recommendations to improve the comprehensiveness , quality , and use of national data on child fatalities from maltreatment .
to improve the comprehensiveness , quality , and use of national data on child fatalities from maltreatment , the secretary of hhs should take the following four actions 1 .
some experts believe that more children have died from maltreatment than are captured in these estimates .
hhs responded to this mandate by establishing and maintaining ncands , which is a voluntary data - reporting system .
