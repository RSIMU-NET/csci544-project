incomplete or inaccurate real estate appraisals resulting in property overvaluations could expose the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) — which insured about 3.7 million single - family mortgage loans with a total value of about $425 billion in fiscal years 2001 to 2003 — to greater financial risks .
to address these objectives , we reviewed the activities of hud's headquarters and its four homeownership centers ( hocs ) in atlanta , georgia ; denver , colorado ; philadelphia , pennsylvania ; and santa ana , california .
specifically , this report examines ( 1 ) how hud ensures that appraisers it approves to perform appraisals under its single - family mortgage insurance programs are qualified to be placed on the appraiser roster ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hud uses a risk - based approach when monitoring the appraisers participating in its single - family mortgage insurance programs ; and ( 3 ) hud's efforts to take enforcement actions against appraisers it identifies as not complying with its requirements .
effectively overseeing the appraisers who prepare appraisals for its single - family mortgage insurance programs has historically been a challenge for hud .
to reduce the financial risks assumed by hud and to further enhance its oversight of appraisers participating in hud's single - family mortgage insurance programs , we recommend that the secretary of hud direct the assistant secretary for housing - federal housing commissioner to institute reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the appraiser roster to ensure that applicants' conformance to eligibility criteria is verified ; consider a requirement to include , when targeting appraisers for review , those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period in order to ensure that these appraisers have corrected their relevant deficiencies ; maintain the historical information , particularly early loan default information , used to target appraisers for review in order to ensure that the hocs target and review appraisers based on the criteria in hud guidance ; and implement a cost - effective field review contractor oversight process that includes on - site monitoring .
however , certain weaknesses in implementing these initiatives limit their ability to ( 1 ) lower hud's risk of insuring properties that are overvalued and ( 2 ) minimize potential losses to fha's mortgage insurance fund .
while we agree that hud has made significant improvements , our objectives concern hud's appraiser oversight as it currently exists , regardless of past weaknesses .
we have also reported in the past that due in part to poor appraiser oversight , hud's single - family mortgage insurance programs remained a high - risk area for the department .
finally , hud disagreed with our conclusion that weaknesses in implementing its appraiser oversight initiatives limit the department's ability to ( 1 ) lower its risk of insuring properties that are overvalued and ( 2 ) minimize potential losses to fha's mortgage insurance fund .
we did not estimate the impact that hud's appraiser oversight has on the financial health of fha's mortgage insurance fund .
furthermore , hud's inspector general noted in its most recent semiannual report to congress that its audits and investigations continue to reveal fraud and abuse in hud's single - family mortgage insurance programs .
