on march 16 , 2010 , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) released connecting america: the national broadband plan .
mandated by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l .
111-5 ) , the fcc's national broadband plan ( nbp ) is a 360-page document composed of 17 chapters containing over 200 specific recommendations directed to the fcc , the executive branch ( both to individual agencies and to the administration as a whole ) , congress , and nonfederal and nongovernmental entities .
accordingly , the nbp identified significant gaps in broadband availability and adoption in the united states , and in order to address those gaps and other challenges , the nbp set six specific goals to be achieved by the year 2020 .
the arra mandated that the nbp should "seek to ensure that all people of the united states have access to broadband capability. .
6: to ensure that america leads in the clean energy economy , every american should be able to use broadband to track and manage their real - time energy consumption .
this report does not address the appropriateness of those goals or the ongoing debate over the best ways to reach those goals .
currently , the 113 th congress and the fcc are initiating , developing , and / or overseeing a number of telecommunications policies and programs including universal service reform and a number of spectrum and wireless policy initiatives .
2: the united states should lead the world in mobile innovation , with the fastest and most extensive wireless networks of any nation .
5: to ensure the safety of the american people , every first responder should have access to a nationwide , wireless , interoperable broadband public safety network .
3: every american should have affordable access to robust broadband service , and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose .
these goals are as follows: goal no .
4: every american community should have affordable access to at least 1 gigabit per second broadband service to anchor institutions such as schools , hospitals , and government buildings .
rather , this report — with three years having passed since release of the nbp — looks at each of these goals and examines available data and activities which might indicate the nation's progress towards meeting them .
given that those policies and programs are intended to help the nation reach many of the goals set by the nbp , the extent to which the nbp goals are met will likely be a part of the ongoing debate over many of these issues .
issues include congressional oversight of the fcc's efforts to establish the connect america fund and its mobility and remote areas component funds as part of universal service fund reform ; congressional oversight of the fcc's efforts to expand the lifeline program by allowing subsidies to low - income americans to be used for broadband , and to modify the rural health care and schools and libraries ( e - rate ) programs , also part of universal service fund reform ; congressional and fcc consideration of spectrum policies intended to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband ; congressional oversight of the development , construction , and implementation of firstnet , a nationwide broadband network designed to meet public safety communications needs ; congressional oversight of arra broadband grant and loan programs and reauthorization of broadband loan programs in the 2013 farm bill ; and congressional consideration of possibly revising the current regulatory framework established by the 1996 telecommunications act ( and its underlying statute , the communications act of 1934 ) in response to the convergence of telecommunications providers and markets and the transition to an internet protocol ( ip ) based network .
