as agreed , our objectives for this review were to ( 1 ) describe usda's current plans and ongoing efforts , including estimated costs , to modernize it for its service centers and ( 2 ) identify any significant risks in these plans and ongoing efforts .
this report responds to your request for information on the department of agriculture's ( usda ) effort to modernize information technology ( it ) at its field service centers , which is being implemented as part of the department's service center implementation initiative .
the purpose of this initiative is to provide “one - stop” service to customers of the farm service , natural resources , and rural development agencies by collocating field offices and modernizing the business processes and it used within these offices .
these included usda's service center business process reengineering business case , service center business need and technical alternative evaluation study , service centers modernization strategy , business integration center project plan , service centers strategic plan , service center it procurement plan , and common computing environment implementation strategy .
usda's effort to modernize business processes and it for its service centers is expected to be the biggest , most costly and complex it modernization effort in its history , with estimated costs ultimately exceeding $3 billion .
to obtain information on usda's current plans and ongoing efforts to modernize it for its service centers , we analyzed relevant plans and studies for the department's service center it modernization , including usda's service center business process reengineering business case and supporting documentation on the business process reengineering and geospatial data projects ; the service center business need and technical alternative evaluation study ; the service centers strategic plan ; the service centers modernization strategy ; business integration center project plan ; the service center it procurement plan ; and the service center common computing environment implementation strategy .
we interviewed senior office of the chief information officer officials to discuss the role that office has played in overseeing the service center it modernization and implementing the clinger - cohen mandates within the department , and met with office of management and budget ( omb ) officials to discuss their reviews of funding requests by usda for this effort .
we did not validate the accuracy of agency - provided data on cost or benefit estimates , or actual costs .
usda has failed in past efforts to plan and manage it modernization , and some of the same fundamental planning and management weaknesses that caused past failures threaten this effort .
in conducting our review , we analyzed relevant service center it modernization plans and studies .
develop an acquisition strategy that focuses on buying technology in manageable increments , where cost justification and performance measures are developed and documented for each increment .
develop a comprehensive plan for the service center it modernization that documents and tracks all critical milestones , dependencies among major segments , and resources needed to complete them , taking into account the resources that will be needed to make the service center agencies' systems year 2000 compliant .
rather , usda cites actions that it already has underway and believes these are sufficient to mitigate risks .
