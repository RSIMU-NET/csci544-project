because the veterans corporation's programs are still in their early stages , we agreed with the staffs of the house and senate committees on small business and veterans' affairs to describe ( 1 ) the veterans corporation's efforts in providing small business assistance to veterans , including service - disabled veterans ; ( 2 ) the use of and controls over federal funds to provide these services ; and ( 3 ) the efforts of the veterans corporation to become financially self - sufficient .
the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( act ) , as amended , created the veterans corporation and , among other things , requires it to ( 1 ) improve access to technical assistance that promotes entrepreneurship , and ( 2 ) use public and private resources to assist veterans , including service - disabled veterans , with the formation and expansion of small businesses .
recognizing the need to assist the nation's veterans who choose to start or expand small businesses in their transition from military to civilian life , congress created the national veterans business development corporation ( the veterans corporation ) — a chartered corporation — to provide small business and entrepreneurship assistance .
a congressional report released in january 1999 , identified gaps in the federal government's delivery of entrepreneurial services to veterans .
the act also required gao to evaluate the effectiveness of the veterans corporation in providing services to veterans .
to carry out these activities , the act authorized the appropriation of $12 million in federal funds to the veterans corporation over a 4-year period .
it also required that the veterans corporation implement a plan to raise private funds and become a self - sustaining corporation .
to meet our objective to describe the veterans corporation's use of federal funds , we interviewed officials at the veterans corporation .
to complete our work , we obtained and analyzed program information and corporate documents provided by the veterans corporation .
we also obtained technical comments from the small business administration ( sba ) and the department of veterans' affairs ( va ) that have been incorporated where appropriate .
we also obtained and analyzed the veterans corporation's fiscal years 2001 and 2002 financial statements , obtained and reviewed minutes of board of directors meetings , and interviewed the veterans corporation's external auditors .
we also interviewed officials from the staff and board of the veterans corporation , as well as officials from federal agencies , partnering organizations , and veteran service organizations .
officials additionally have identified some initial challenges that have slowed the progress of these efforts , including ( 1 ) the inability to collect data on the veteran population , ( 2 ) limited government participation in the veterans corporation activities , ( 3 ) delays in appointing management , and ( 4 ) unclear corporate legal status of the veterans corporation .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
the board established three committees , including the ( 1 ) barriers identification committee , which is tasked with reviewing studies and research to identify barriers that affect transitioning military personnel ; ( 2 ) information clearinghouse committee , which is responsible for obtaining and disseminating certification , licensure , and small business development information ; and ( 3 ) research and legislative action committee , which will analyze barriers and develop recommendations .
