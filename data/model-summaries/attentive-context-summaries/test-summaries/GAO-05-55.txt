however , in an era of limited resources and growing mission demands , congress has authorized agencies to use approaches other than full , up - front funding to finance capital acquisitions such as land improvement projects , buildings , and equipment .
subsequently , as requested , we have analyzed in greater detail two of the identified approaches: energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnerships ( partnerships ) .
the objectives of this study were to determine ( 1 ) what specific attributes of energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnerships ( partnerships ) contributed to budget scoring decisions , ( 2 ) the costs of financing through espcs and partnerships compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and ( 3 ) how espcs and partnerships are implemented and monitored .
given this estimate agencies have relied heavily on costly leasing instead of ownership to meet new needs .
borderline agencies and transactions should be included in the budget unless there are exceptionally persuasive reasons for exclusion.” with specific regard to capital investments , the commission recommended strongly against a capital budget that would spread outlays over an asset's life , noting that it would likely “distort decisions about the allocation of resources.” we have long supported an inclusive budget that discloses up - front the full commitments of the government .
while leasing to meet long - term needs almost always results in excessive long - term costs to taxpayers and does not necessarily reflect the best approach to capital asset management , it also provides the government opportunities to spend more on other mission objectives .
finding a solution for this problem has been difficult .
accordingly , these alternative financing mechanisms have been used by agencies to acquire assets by spreading the cost over a number of years in their budgets .
in particular , we determined ( 1 ) what specific attributes of espcs and partnerships contributed to budget scoring decisions , ( 2 ) the costs of financing through espcs and partnerships compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and ( 3 ) how espcs and partnerships are implemented and monitored .
this same problem arises for any asset that is acquired to meet long - term needs .
moreover , when capital costs are not fully recognized up - front , before funds are committed , important information about the full budgetary effects may not be considered as trade - offs are made among competing priorities .
agencies are faced with requirements for energy savings and need appropriations to implement energy conservation measures .
we selected case studies from agencies that had awarded a large dollar volume of espcs awarded under the department of energy's ( doe ) federal energy management program's ( femp ) umbrella contract , had broad partnership authority , or were discussed in our prior report .
this is of particular concern at a time of rising budget deficits and concern about underrecognition of long - term costs and commitments .
congress could use this information in evaluating whether to further extend espc authority beyond its current expiration date .
