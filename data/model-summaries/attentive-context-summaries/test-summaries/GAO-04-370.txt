however , mission support problems continued to occur at the laboratories in areas such as business operations ( accounting , procurement , and property management ) and emergency management ( identifying possible hazards and threats and developing plans and procedures to address the hazards ) .
for more than 50 years , the university of california ( university ) has operated the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico and the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california for the department of energy ( doe ) .
instead , in january 2001 , doe's national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) decided to extend the university's contracts through september 2005 .
these areas include project management ( managing projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget and achieve their intended purpose ) and nuclear safety ( conducting operations and activities in a way that ensures the safety of workers , the public , and the environment ) .
our report ( 1 ) describes the actions taken to address the major mission support problems identified when nnsa extended the contracts in 2001 , ( 2 ) describes the actions taken to address additional mission support problems that have emerged or become more significant since the contracts were extended in 2001 , and ( 3 ) assesses the major challenges nnsa and the university face in sustaining improvements in mission support activities at the two laboratories .
these two research laboratories , with a $2.9 billion fiscal year 2003 budget , have a science and technology mission that focuses on maintaining the nation's nuclear weapons , preventing nuclear proliferation , and furthering scientific knowledge in chemistry , structural biology , and mathematics .
in december 2003 , the congress enacted legislation to require nnsa to compete the contracts for both laboratories when the current terms expire in 2005 .
you asked us to identify the steps that nnsa and the university have taken to improve contractor performance in mission support activities at the laboratories and to assess whether any improvements can be sustained over time .
besides conducting this research and development work , managing and operating the two sites encompasses a broad range of mission support functions , such as maintaining roads and providing communications , managing facilities to ensure that needed repairs are done to buildings , purchasing and accounting for products and services , and ensuring good relations with local communities .
another mission support area — facilities management — had also become an area of concern , as buildings continued to age and the need for maintenance and repairs increased .
mission support problems led congressional committees and others to call on doe to open these two contracts to competitive bidding .
the two laboratories have a reputation for conducting world - class science and technology work .
nnsa had identified problems with management accountability ; safeguards and security management ; facility safety , including nuclear facility operations ; critical skills , knowledge , and technical capabilities ; and project management .
nnsa officials believed they could successfully address the laboratories' mission support problems using contract mechanisms such as setting clearer performance expectations and requiring the contractor to meet those expectations in order to earn incentive fees .
starting in the 1990s , however , performance problems in various mission support areas have been reported at both laboratories .
