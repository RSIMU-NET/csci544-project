imbalances in agricultural markets develop because consumers do not respond to price changes by buying proportionally smaller or larger quantities ( demand is price - inelastic ) and , similarly , farmers do not respond to price changes by proportionally reducing or increasing production ( supply is price inelastic ) .
the economic argument for federal support of farms , in contrast to nonfarm businesses , is that markets do not efficiently balance commodity supply with demand .
the imbalances are further exacerbated by the long time lag between crop planting ( or livestock breeding ) and harvest , during which economic and yield conditions may dramatically change .
as congress moves increasingly closer to the 2007 expiration of current farm support programs, policymakers face design of a new law that ( 1 ) meets the nation's domestic needs , ( 2 )  satisfies this country's international trade obligations under the world trade organization , and  ( 3 ) fits within budgetary constraints .
the objectives of federal commodity programs are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks of short term market price instability and longer - term capacity adjustments to the federal government .
however , they argue that ( 1 ) current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade , ( 2 ) the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of production and make the united states less competitive in global markets , and ( 3 ) the benefits are concentrated among a comparatively small number of commodities produced on a small number of large farms .
the goals are to maintain the economic health of the farm sector so that it can utilize the nation's comparative advantages in natural , infrastructure , and technology resources to be globally competitive .
the imbalances then often result in inadequate or exaggerated resource adjustments by farmers .
the law mandates federal support for a specific list of commodities .
landowners are concerned about a loss of rents and wealth if land prices drop in response to a reduction in the subsidies .
secretary of agriculture johanns has repeatedly stated that his objective is for commodity assistance to be equitable across commodities , predictable in terms of design regularity , and beyond challenge within the framework of the world trade organization ( wto ) .
while initially intended to be a temporary effort , the commodity support programs survived , but have been modified away from supply control and commodity stocks management to direct income support payments .
supporters of commodity subsidy programs may not contradict the critics , but do point out that other nations have distorting subsidy programs and / or trade barriers that should be eliminated if the united states is to make reforms .
for most of these commodities , support began during 1930s depression era efforts to generally raise farm household income when commodity prices were low because of prolonged weak consumer demand .
similarly , rural communities are concerned about any large decline in the real estate tax base that supports local schools , roads , and other community services .
critics of commodity programs agree on the underlying fundamental economic conditions that make stability more difficult to achieve for agriculture than for some other sectors .
