these tools can include statistical models , mathematical algorithms , and machine learning methods ( algorithms that improve their performance automatically through experience , such as neural networks or decision trees ) .
data mining involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown , valid patterns and relationships in large data sets .
these include concerns about the quality of the data being analyzed , the interoperability of the databases and software between agencies , and potential infringements on privacy .
however , the proliferation of data mining has raised some implementation and oversight issues as well .
consequently , data mining consists of more than collecting and managing data , it also includes analysis and prediction .
also , there are some concerns that the limitations of data mining are being overlooked as agencies work to emphasize their homeland security initiatives .
reflecting this conceptualization of data mining , some observers consider data mining to be just one step in a larger process known as knowledge discovery in databases ( kdd ) .
some of these changes include the growth of computer networks , which can be used to connect databases ; the development of enhanced search - related techniques such as neural networks and advanced algorithms ; the spread of the client / server computing model , allowing users to access centralized data resources from the desktop ; and an increased ability to combine data from disparate sources into a single searchable source .
as a result of its complex capabilities , two precursors are important for a successful data mining exercise ; a clear formulation of the problem to be solved , and access to the relevant data .
data mining has become increasingly common in both the public and private sectors .
a number of advances in technology and business processes have contributed to a growing interest in data mining in both the public and private sectors .
in addition to these improved data management tools , the increased availability of information and the decreasing costs of storing it have also played a role .
data mining can be performed on data represented in quantitative , textual , or multimedia forms .
organizations use data mining as a tool to survey customer information , reduce fraud and waste , and assist in medical research .
similarly , computing power has continued to double every 18-24 months , while the relative cost of computing power has continued to decrease .
other steps in the kdd process , in progressive order , include data cleaning , data integration , data selection , data transformation , ( data mining ) , pattern evaluation , and knowledge presentation .
over the past several years there has been a rapid increase in the volume of information collected and stored , with some observers suggesting that the quantity of the world's data approximately doubles every year .
data mining applications can use a variety of parameters to examine the data .
they include association ( patterns where one event is connected to another event , such as purchasing a pen and purchasing paper ) , sequence or path analysis ( patterns where one event leads to another event , such as the birth of a child and purchasing diapers ) , classification ( identification of new patterns , such as coincidences between duct tape purchases and plastic sheeting purchases ) , clustering ( finding and visually documenting groups of previously unknown facts , such as geographic location and brand preferences ) , and forecasting ( discovering patterns from which one can make reasonable predictions regarding future activities , such as the prediction that people who join an athletic club may take exercise classes ) .
