in this review , we examine ( 1 ) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify cps of substance - affected infants , and to guide how cps officials respond once they receive a notification ; ( 2 ) the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to develop plans of safe care for substance - affected infants , and any challenges associated with implementing such policies and procedures ; and ( 3 ) steps hhs has taken to assist and monitor states' efforts in implementing capta provisions related to substance - affected infants .
the secretary of hhs should direct acf to provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of capta requirements , including the requirements for health care providers to notify cps of substance - affected infants and the development of a plan of safe care for these infants .
under capta , state governors are required to provide an assurance to the secretary of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that their states have in effect and are enforcing a law or statewide program that requires ( 1 ) health care providers to notify child protective services ( cps ) of all infants affected by substance use or withdrawal symptoms resulting from prenatal drug exposure , and ( 2 ) a plan of safe care be developed for all such infants , including the affected caregiver .
effective implementation of our recommendation should help states better implement protections for children .
in addition , the number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent ( from 41,235 to 47,219 ) from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015 â€” an increase that many researchers and child welfare professionals attribute to the opioid epidemic .
the child abuse prevention and treatment act ( capta ) is one of the key pieces of federal legislation that guides child protection and includes provisions related to substance - affected infants .
states reported that parental drug abuse was a factor associated with the removal of 32 percent of the children entering foster care in fiscal year 2015 .
infants born to women who misuse drugs or alcohol during their pregnancy are particularly vulnerable .
additional guidance and assistance from hhs would help states better understand what they need to do to develop policies and procedures that meet the needs of children and families affected by substance use .
in addition , we interviewed officials from the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) administration for children and families ( acf ) and the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) about oversight , technical assistance , and guidance regarding capta provisions related to substance - affected infants .
the survey included open - ended and closed - ended questions about state laws , policies , and procedures regarding substance - affected infants ; specific requirements or processes relating to infants affected by opioids ; plans for ensuring the safety and well - being of substance - affected infants ; data collection efforts ; challenges to implementing capta requirements ; and assistance and guidance provided by hhs .
many infants are born affected by substance exposure and experience withdrawal symptoms , referred to as substance - affected infants .
