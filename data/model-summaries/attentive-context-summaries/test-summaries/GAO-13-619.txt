we compared the results of these analyses with consideration of several practices gao has identified in prior work that can benefit collaborating agencies , including ( 1 ) having overarching plans to align activities and resources ; ( 2 ) clearly defining roles and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) articulating agreements in formal documents ; ( 4 ) communicating frequently ; and ( 5 ) having a single designated leader .
in 2012 , in a committee report to accompany a proposed bill for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 , the house armed services committee mandated us to review dod's efforts to increase its capability and capacity to account for missing persons , and to report to the senate armed services committee and house armed services committee .

to help avert unexpected operational or diplomatic issues that might hinder missing persons operations , direct the commander , u.s. pacific command , and commander , joint prisoner of war / missing in action accounting command , or the appropriate department entities in light of any reorganization , to develop memoranda of agreement or other appropriate mechanisms with the other combatant commands in whose area of responsibility jpac is likely to operate .
several dod components and organizations , collectively known as the missing persons accounting community , have a role in accounting for missing persons .

more than 3 years have passed since congress directed dod to increase its capability and capacity to account for missing persons and established the accounting - for goal , but the department has yet to establish a community - wide plan to meet these goals in a unified manner by 2015 .
while dod has made some progress in drafting a community - wide plan to increase its capability and capacity , as of june 2013 dod had not completed a community - wide plan .
ensure that dpmo , in coordination with all members of the accounting community , develop personnel files for all unaccounted for persons as required by statute , in order to help avoid potential overlap or unnecessary duplication of effort and to ensure better communication among community members with respect to missing persons cases .
concerns have risen over the years , both within and outside of dod , with regard to whether dod's missing persons accounting community's current organizational structure enables it to most effectively meet its mission .
