our objectives for this review were to ( 1 ) identify and evaluate the policies that guide the dissemination of federal research results at the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) ; ( 2 ) determine how effectively the dissemination and dispute resolution policies of these agencies have been communicated to researchers ; ( 3 ) determine the extent to which researchers at these agencies have experienced restrictions on the dissemination of their research results , and ( 4 ) provide an overview of the role of the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) in helping agencies develop and implement policies related to the dissemination of research results .
in this context , we ( 1 ) identified and evaluated the policies that guide the dissemination of federal research results at nasa , nist , and noaa ; ( 2 ) determined how effectively the dissemination and dispute resolution policies of these agencies have been communicated to researchers ; and ( 3 ) determined the extent to which researchers at these agencies have experienced restrictions on the dissemination of their research results .
to ensure that ( 1 ) researchers have a clear process to follow for appealing decisions regarding dissemination of research results and ( 2 ) all researchers are aware of and understand how to comply with their agencies' policies for disseminating research , we recommend that the secretary of commerce , the nasa administrator , the nist director , and the noaa administrator each take the following two actions: review their dissemination policies and ensure that they clearly identify a process by which researchers can appeal dissemination decisions .
because progress in scientific is conducted by federal researchers .
federal agencies strive to base science - related public policy on the best federal agencies strive to base science - related public policy on the best available information provided through objective research , some of which available information provided through objective research , some of which is conducted by federal researchers .
in addition , we obtained information on the role that the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) has identified for itself in helping agencies develop and implement policies related to the dissemination of research results .
much scientific research is either conducted by federally employed researchers scientific research is either conducted by federally employed researchers or supported through grants and contracts awarded by over a dozen or supported through grants and contracts awarded by over a dozen federal departments and agencies , such as the national aeronautics and federal departments and agencies , such as the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the national institute of standards and space administration ( nasa ) , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , and the national oceanic and atmospheric technology ( nist ) , and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) .
to some extent , this situation may have been partly caused by a lack of formal training provided by the agencies on the dissemination and dispute resolution policies to their research staff .
this report focuses on the dissemination of administration ( noaa ) .
