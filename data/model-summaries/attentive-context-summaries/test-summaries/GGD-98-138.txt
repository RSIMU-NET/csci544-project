our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs' progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in our year 2000 assessment guide , ( 2 ) identify the risks irs faces to completing the year 2000 effort on time , and ( 3 ) identify risks to the continuity of irs operations in the event of year 2000-induced system failures .
although 2000 is less than 2 years in the future , irs has less than 1 year to complete all of the work that it believes is necessary to reach its goal of having all of its systems year 2000 compliant by january 1999 .
this report summarizes the information we provided to your office on the results of our work to date on the internal revenue service's ( irs ) efforts to have its information systems function correctly when processing dates beyond december 31 , 1999 .
these irs efforts are necessary because the irs' information systems , many of which are over 25 years old , were programmed to read two - digit date fields .
irs established this goal to help ensure that it can accurately process tax returns and other tax data through multiple systems by the start of the 1999 filing season .
the outcome of these efforts will also depend on the extent to which agencies have institutionalized key systems development and program management practices , as well as on their ability to execute large - scale software development or conversion projects .
therefore , if unchanged , beginning january 1 , 2000 , these systems would interpret 2000 as 1900 and thus would seriously jeopardize critical tax processing and collection operations .
agencies' success or failure will largely be determined by the quality of their program management and executive leadership .
irs is still assessing some of its infrastructure components and faces the risk of not completing all of its year 2000 efforts by january 1999 .
irs is experiencing delays in completing conversion efforts for its existing systems and major systems replacement efforts .
the enormous challenge involved in making information systems year 2000 compliant is managerial as well as technical .
irs' contingency management plan does not address the possibility that ( 1 ) irs may have overlooked a date dependency during its assessment phase of applications or infrastructure areas or ( 2 ) even if system conversion and replacement efforts are completed on time and fully tested , unexpected failures may occur .
we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue take the following steps to better ensure that irs has adequately assessed the vulnerabilities of its core business processes in the event of year 2000-induced system failures: solicit the input of business functional area officials to identify irs' core business processes and prioritize those processes that must continue in the event of year 2000-induced failures ; map irs' mission - critical systems to those core business processes ; determine the impact of information system failures on each core business assess any existing business continuity and contingency plans that may have been developed for non - year 2000 reasons to determine whether these plans are applicable to year 2000-induced failures , and develop and test contingency plans for core business processes if existing plans are not appropriate .
