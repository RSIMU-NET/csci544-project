although social security is important because of its size , the real driver of the long - term fiscal outlook is health care spending .
long - term fiscal simulations by gao , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and others all show that despite a 3- year decline in the federal government's unified budget deficit , we still face large and growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends .
medicare and medicaid are both large and projected to continue growing rapidly in the future .
our long - term fiscal challenge is primarily a health - care challenge .
i appreciate this invitation to talk with you about our nation's long - term fiscal outlook as we enter 2008 — and the challenge it continues to present for the future of america and americans .
your decision to dedicate a hearing to this important issue again demonstrates the seriousness with which you and this committee view our nation's large and growing fiscal challenge .
already the first members of the baby boom generation have filed for early social security retirement benefits — and will be eligible for medicare in only 3 years .
the passage of time only serves to worsen this situation: the size of the challenge has grown and the time to address it has shrunk .
my remarks are based on gao's previous work , including various reports and testimonies on our nation's long - term fiscal challenges , health care , and the need for budget process reform .
everyone on this committee is well aware of the nature and importance of the challenge we face .
today , therefore , i will emphasize a few key points: although recent declines in the annual budget deficit are good news , our longer - term fiscal outlook is worse — and absent meaningful action we will face spiraling levels of debt .
the goal of these reports is to increase public awareness and understanding of the long - term fiscal outlook in light of escalating health care cost growth and population aging , to stimulate public and policy debates , and to help policymakers make more informed decisions .
we face an increasing need and yet a shrinking window of opportunity for action .
it provides 13 potential tools for congress and the administration to use to begin to confront our long - term fiscal and other challenges .
these countries used a variety of measures , including projections of future revenue and spending and summary measures of fiscal imbalance and fiscal gaps , to assess fiscal sustainability .
under any plausible scenario , the federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path .
i wish i could say the long - term outlook is different than when i last appeared before you on halloween — but as all of you know , it is not .
first , even this short - term deficit is understated: it masks the fact that the federal government has been using the social security surplus to offset spending in the rest of government for many years .
for example , the department of the treasury ( treasury ) reported a unified deficit of $163 billion and an on - budget deficit of $344 billion in fiscal year 2007 .
