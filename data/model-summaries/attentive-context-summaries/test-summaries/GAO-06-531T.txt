we are pleased to be here today to discuss our work on how the departments of energy ( doe ) and defense ( dod ) use the designations official use only ( ouo ) and for official use only ( fouo ) , respectively , to manage information that is unclassified but sensitive .
this report ( 1 ) identified and assessed the policies , procedures , and criteria that doe and dod employ to manage ouo and fouo information ; and ( 2 ) determined the extent to which doe's and dod's training and oversight programs assure that information is identified and marked according to established criteria .
in summary , both doe and dod base their programs on the premise that information designated as ouo or fouo must ( 1 ) have the potential to cause foreseeable harm to governmental , commercial , or private interests if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information to perform their jobs ; and ( 2 ) fall under at least one of eight freedom of information act ( foia ) exemptions .
my testimony today is based on our report issued earlier this month entitled managing sensitive information: departments of energy and defense policies and oversight could be improved ( gao - 06-369 ) .
both agencies have policies in place to implement their programs .
however , our analysis of these policies showed a lack of clarity in key areas that could allow inconsistencies and errors to occur .
 ( see the appendix for a list and description of the exemptions of foia. ) .
this lack of training requirements and oversight leaves doe and dod officials unable to assure that ouo and fouo documents are marked and handled in a manner consistent with agency policies and may result in inconsistencies and errors in the application of the programs .
specifically: it is unclear which dod office is responsible for the fouo program , and whether personnel designating a document as fouo should note the foia exemption used as the basis for the designation on the document .
both doe's and dod's policies are unclear regarding at what point a document should be marked as ouo or fouo and what would be an inappropriate use of the ouo or fouo designation .
with regard to training and management oversight , we recommended that both doe and dod require personnel to be trained before they can designate information as ouo or fouo , and that they develop a system to conduct periodic oversight of ouo or fouo designations to assure that their policies are being followed .
we also recommended that dod clarify its policies as to which office is responsible for the fouo program and that it require personnel designating a document as fouo also to note the foia exemption they used to determine that the information should be restricted .
in addition , while both doe and dod offer training on their ouo and fouo policies , neither doe nor dod has an agencywide requirement that employees be trained before they designate documents as ouo or fouo .
for example , ouo or fouo designations should not be used to conceal agency mismanagement .
in closing , the lack of clear policies , effective training , and oversight in doe's and dod's ouo and fouo programs could result in both over - and underprotection of unclassified yet sensitive government documents .
