my statement today is based on our report , which ( 1 ) describes how regulation has evolved in banking , securities , thrifts , credit unions , futures , insurance , secondary mortgage markets and other important areas ; ( 2 ) describes several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades that have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system ; and ( 3 ) presents an evaluation framework that can be used by congress and others to shape potential regulatory reform efforts .
we prepared this work under the authority of the comptroller general to help policymakers weigh various regulatory reform proposals and consider ways in which the current regulatory system could be made more effective and efficient .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss our january 8 , 2009 , report that provides a framework for modernizing the outdated u.s. financial regulatory system .
to do this work , we synthesized existing gao work and other studies and met with representatives of financial regulatory agencies , industry associations , consumer advocacy organizations , and others .
the report was enhanced by input from representatives of 29 agencies and other organizations , including federal and state financial regulatory agencies , consumer advocacy groups , and financial service industry trade associations , who reviewed and commented on a draft of the report prior to its release .
this work was conducted between april 2008 and december 2008 .
the work upon which the report is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards .
as a result of significant market developments in recent decades that have outpaced a fragmented and outdated regulatory structure , significant reforms to the u.s. regulatory system are critically and urgently needed .
the current system has important weaknesses that , if not addressed , will continue to expose the nation's financial system to serious risks .
a critical first step to modernizing the regulatory system and enhancing its ability to meet the challenges of a dynamic financial services industry is to clearly define regulatory goals and objectives .
finally , with the increasingly global aspects of financial markets , the current fragmented u.s. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators .
in general , reviewers commented that the report represented an important and thorough review of the issues related to regulatory reform .
our report offers a framework for crafting and evaluating regulatory reform proposals ; it consists of the following nine characteristics that should be reflected in any new regulatory system .
as early as 1994 , we identified the need to examine the federal financial regulatory structure , including the need to address the risks from new unregulated products .
regulators failed to adequately oversee the sale of mortgage products that posed risks to consumers and the stability of the financial system .
in particular , the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors , and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products .
since then , we have described various options for congress to consider , each of which provides potential improvements , as well as some risks and potential costs .
