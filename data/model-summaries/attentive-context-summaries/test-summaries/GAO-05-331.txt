in light of past problems with and continuing concerns about funding major atc system acquisitions under the atc modernization program , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) faa's experience in meeting cost , schedule , and / or performance targets for major system acquisitions under its atc modernization program ; ( 2 ) the steps faa has taken to address long - standing challenges with the atc modernization program and additional steps that are needed ; and ( 3 ) the potential effects of the constrained budget environment on faa's ability to modernize the atc system .
in 1981 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) began what it initially envisioned as a 10-year modernization program to upgrade and replace the national airspace system's ( nas ) facilities and equipment to meet projected increases in traffic volumes , enhance the system's margin of safety , and increase the efficiency of the air traffic control ( atc ) system â€” a principal component of the nas .
to date , faa has spent $43.5 billion for its nas modernization effort and plans to spend an additional $9.6 billion through fiscal year 2009 , primarily to upgrade and replace atc systems and facilities .
our review did not focus on faa's efforts to modernize its facilities .
to improve faa's management of the modernization program , congress , in 1995 , gave the agency acquisition and human capital flexibilities , which faa has largely implemented .
for more than two decades , atc system acquisitions under the nas modernization program have experienced significant cost growth , schedule delays , and performance problems .
acquisition management system: the ato has taken a number of steps to improve its acquisition management system ( ams ) .
to help ensure that key administration and congressional decision - makers have more complete information to assess the potential impact of annual budget submissions on individual atc system acquisitions , the overall atc modernization program , and related larger - scale nas modernization activities funded through the facilities and equipment budget , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct faa to identify which activities under the atc modernization program have had funding deferred , reduced , or eliminated and to provide detailed information about the impact of those decisions on faa's ability to modernize the atc system and related components of the nas in the near , mid , and longer term .
according to faa , the agency has spent about 58 percent , or $25.1 billion , of the $43.5 billion total for nas modernization on system acquisitions designed to replace or upgrade various atc systems .
in fiscal year 2005 , these 16 major atc system acquisitions account for about 36 percent of faa's facilities and equipment budget .
in 2000 , congress and the administration took further steps to improve the modernization program's management .
as a result , the atc modernization program has been on our list of high - risk programs since 1995 .
specifically , we selected the 16 atc system acquisitions with the largest life - cycle costs that met the following criteria: each system had cost , schedule , and performance targets ; was discussed in prior gao and department of transportation inspector general ( dot ig ) reports , had not been fully implemented or deployed by 2004 , and received funding in 2004 .
