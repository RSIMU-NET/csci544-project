 ( recommendation 1 ) .
congress passed the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) to improve the federal government's preparation for and response to natural and manmade disasters .
in this report , we examined: the challenges selected stakeholders have experienced related to emergency communications ; the emergency communications assistance — technical assistance and funding — provided by dhs and selected stakeholders' views on these efforts ; and the reccwgs established by the post - katrina act and their effect on emergency communications capabilities .
these provisions required that the department of homeland security ( dhs ) provide assistance to support the rapid establishment of interoperable emergency communications in urban areas and other areas deemed to be consistently at a high level of risk from disasters ; and the establishment of regional emergency communications coordination working groups ( reccwg ) in each of the 10 federal emergency management agency ( fema ) regions .
while dhs has provided assistance in the form of technical assistance and funding and congress has established the reccwgs ( commonly pronounced rec - wigs ) , natural disasters such as hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria in 2017 continued to test the nation's emergency communications capabilities .
you asked us to evaluate how the implementation of the post - katrina act's provisions has affected disaster preparedness , response , and recovery in general .
hurricane katrina exposed gaps in how federal , state , and local entities responded to the catastrophic storm , gaps that include revealing that the equipment the first responders used for emergency communications were often not operable and interoperable .
among the more than 300 reforms in the post - katrina act , two of the provisions relate to emergency communications during disaster response and recovery .
dhs noted that fema is committed to increased collaboration among reccwgs to coordinate multi - state efforts and measure progress on and improving survivability , sustainability , and interoperability of communication at the regional level and nationwide .
for first responders in emergency situations , reliable communications are critical for a rapid and sufficient response .
a concerted effort focusing on these groups' collaboration needs , while also considering fema's resource constraints , could help fema and regional stakeholders determine an appropriate mechanism for collaboration moving forward .
the administrator of fema should work with reccwg members to reach consensus on and implement an ongoing mechanism to encourage nationwide collaboration across these groups , considering the costs of one or more suitable methods , such as a national - level working group that uses virtual or other means of coordination , as appropriate .
we analyzed fema data on preparedness grant funding from fiscal years 2011 to 2016 .
these types of events can cross jurisdictional borders , highlighting the critical need for collaboration of first responders and public safety officials both within and across regions .
such collaboration could help the groups address common challenges by providing a way to improve the sharing of best practices and lessons learned and to allow members to leverage the knowledge and experience of their counterparts to improve emergency communications capabilities in their regions and nationwide .
we also reviewed relevant reports and documentation from dhs — such as reports on national preparedness and on specific emergency incidents and technical assistance offerings — as well as other documents we identified through a literature search .
