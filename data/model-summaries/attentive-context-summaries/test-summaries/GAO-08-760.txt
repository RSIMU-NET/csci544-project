the part d program , which began in january 2006 , is administered by the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) .
lack of cms oversight of medicare part d sponsors' implementation of programs to prevent fraud , waste , and abuse risks significant misuse of funds in this $39 billion program .
all part d sponsors had the required elements and recommended measures for written policies , procedures , and standards of conduct ( element 1 ) ; effective lines of communication ( element 4 ) ; and enforcement of standards through disciplinary guidelines ( element 5 ) .
to help safeguard the medicare part d program from fraud , waste , and abuse , we recommend the administrator of cms ensure that cms conducts timely audits of part d fraud and abuse programs to monitor sponsors' implementation of these programs .
we believe that cms oversight of medicare part d sponsors' programs could increase the completeness of sponsors' implementation of required compliance plan elements and selected recommended measures and , as a result , reduce the risk to medicare .
cms noted that congress did not respond to its request for additional program integrity funds in fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2008 .
in addition , cms stated that insufficient resources have been one of the primary impediments to its implementation of a robust oversight strategy .
while medicare part d is now in its third year of operation , little is known about the extent to which part d sponsors have implemented their fraud and abuse programs or the extent of cms's oversight of part d sponsors' programs .
specifically , this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which certain part d sponsors implemented programs to control fraud , waste , and abuse and ( 2 ) the extent of cms's oversight of part d sponsors' programs to control fraud , waste , and abuse .
medicare part d provides voluntary , outpatient prescription drug coverage for eligible individuals 65 years and older and eligible individuals with disabilities .
to protect beneficiaries and the fiscal integrity of the medicare program , the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) , which established the part d program , requires all part d sponsors to have programs to safeguard part d from fraud , waste , and abuse .
however , we believe that program integrity will remain at risk until cms conducts timely audits to monitor part d sponsors' implementation of fraud and abuse programs .
the oig limited its assessment to a document review of the compliance plans submitted to cms and did not assess the extent to which the compliance plans had been implemented .
we found that none of these five sponsors , which cover more than a third of part d enrollees , completely implemented all of the required compliance plan elements and selected recommended measures for their fraud and abuse programs .
cms has acknowledged that program compliance and integrity audits conducted by cms are necessary to ensure compliance and document cms's program oversight responsibilities .
due in part to this vulnerability , we have designated medicare as a high risk program since 1990 .
