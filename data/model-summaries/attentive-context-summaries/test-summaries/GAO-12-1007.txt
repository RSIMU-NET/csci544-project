civilian agencies' efforts to ( 1 ) compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories and ( 2 ) review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories .
to satisfy the mandate , we assessed civilian agencies' efforts to ( 1 ) compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories and ( 2 ) review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories .
to assess agencies' efforts to compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories , we reviewed the act , omb guidance , and the proposed federal acquisition regulation ( far ) rule on service contract inventories .
section 743 of the 2010 consolidated appropriations act directed gao to report on the second annual service contract inventory that civilian agencies were required to submit to the office of management and budget ( omb ) by december 31 , 2011 .
we also selected five civilian agencies — the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , the department of transportation ( dot ) , the general services administration ( gsa ) , and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — for a more in - depth review as to how they compiled and reviewed their service contract inventories .
congress has also expressed concern with agencies' reliance on contractors and has directed omb and other federal agencies to examine similar workforce issues , which include identifying functions that are not appropriate for contractors to perform or require increased government oversight .
to help ensure that the service contract inventories contain consistent and reliable information and that the service contract inventory analysis reports have sufficient information to provide greater context and value , we recommend that the administrator of omb's office of federal procurement policy clarify guidance to: require agencies to fully describe in their inventory review reports the scope of the inventory reviews , including information such as the number of contracts and the percentage of contracts reviewed for each product and service code selected and the total universe of contracts ; require agencies to consistently report on the number of contractor personnel and functions that were involved with the workforce issues identified during their inventory reviews ; and require agencies to include , as part of their inventory review reports , the status of agency efforts to resolve findings identified in previous reviews until they are resolved .
to help improve civilian agency compliance for compiling , reviewing , and reporting on inventories , we recommend that the administrator of omb's office of federal procurement policy work with agencies to improve how compliance with statutory and omb requirements is monitored , which might include agencies designating accountable officials to ensure appropriate internal management attention and responsiveness .
omb directed agencies to conduct a meaningful review of their fiscal year 2010 inventory and identify at a minimum ( 1 ) the special interest functions studied by the agency , including the dollars obligated to those specific product and service codes in fiscal year 2010 ; ( 2 ) the methodology used to support their reviews ; ( 3 ) their findings ; and ( 4 ) the actions taken or planned by the agency to address any identified weaknesses or challenges .
in fiscal year 2011 , federal civilian agencies reported $161 billion in total contract obligations , of which $126 billion , or almost 80 percent , were for services .
