in fiscal year 1996 , excluding interest on the public debt , civilian employee pension benefits ( i.e. , civil service retirement and disability ) was the seventh largest mandatory spending program , with nearly $40 billion in payments to 2.3 million retirees and survivor annuitants .
federal spending on pensions for retired civilian employees of the federal government represents a significant share of the budget .
although current employees finance a portion of these benefits through the contributions they make , the federal government pays most pension costs , as do states and localities and private sector employers .
as agreed with your office , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the number of federal retirees , if any , whose pensions have come to exceed the final salaries that they earned while working ; ( 2 ) explain why these retirees' pensions came to exceed their final salaries ; and ( 3 ) determine the difference , if any , in these retirees' pension amounts if current cost - of - living - adjustment ( cola ) policy — that is , the cola policy enacted in 1984 , which established the formula and schedule used today by the office of personnel management ( opm ) — had been in effect without interruption since 1962 , and also determine any difference in the number of retirees whose pensions would have exceeded their final salaries .
thus , it is important for policymakers to understand how key features of federal retirement policy — set in statute — affect pension costs .
this report addresses the part of your request that concerns pension costs and retirement policy .
we collected data for the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) and the federal employees retirement system ( fers ) general employees , as well as for all former members of congress who were retired and still living as of october 1 , 1995 , using a computerized personnel database and case file information maintained by opm .
at your request , we are responding to a series of questions about federal and nonfederal retirement programs .
for example , although the current underlying policy has been in effect since 1984 , congress has modified this policy several times for limited periods to help reduce the deficit .
also , the effects of many individual colas and cola policy changes are cumulative and compound over time .
we selected retirement variables to use as independent variables because they were ( 1 ) required to be used for computing pension benefits ( e.g. , years of service ) ; or ( 2 ) known to affect pension amounts for some or all retirees ( e.g. , colas and the selection of spousal survivor benefits ) .
generalization is difficult , in part because no one cola policy has ever been implemented for a sustained period .
the retiree's pension would have been larger if current policy had been in effect without interruption .
in particular , the effects of the cola policies of the 1960s and 1970s that overcompensated for inflation will continue to have an effect on retiree pensions for as long as those who received them are alive , just as not receiving scheduled colas in 1984 and the suspension of colas in 1986 will continue to be reflected in the pensions of anyone who retired before these years .
