the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) has helped over 3.69 million afghan refugees return to afghanistan since march of 2002 , marking the largest assisted return operation in unhcr's history .
issues of particular concern to the 110 th congress are 1 ) continuing and sustaining refugee returns as part of afghanistan's overall reconstruction ; 2 ) developing funding strategies for the next phase of afghanistan's remaining refugees ; and 3 ) examining the refugee situation in light of border security issues , particularly with regard to pakistan's recently announced plan to lay land mines and build a fence along its border with afghanistan .
in addition , more than a million refugees have returned to afghanistan without availing themselves of unhcr's assistance ( also known as "spontaneous returns" ) bringing the total number of returnees to 4.8 million or more .
in the long term , the impact of afghan migration trends may need to be better understood in light of its potential impact on political arrangements in south asia .
the success of the repatriation program thus depends on the success of the overall reconstruction effort in afghanistan , including the extent to which returned refugees ( and idps ) are integrated into reconstruction efforts .
almost all of these afghans have returned from neighboring iran and pakistan , where the vast majority of afghan refugees have lived for well over two decades ( see table 1 ) .
the united states government ( usg ) has provided humanitarian assistance to afghan refugees since the early 1980s .
another factor influencing the success of the repatriation program is the sustainability of previous returns to afghanistan â€” that is , the degree to which returnees are being adequately anchored in their communities , whether they are receiving health care , education , and opportunities to make a living .
almost all assistance has been provided through the migration and refugee assistance ( mra ) account , and has been programmed by the department of state's bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) .
afghans began fleeing their country in april 1978 , when the marxist people's democratic party of afghanistan ( pdpa ) , overthrew the government of muhammad daoud ( who had himself seized power from his cousin afghan king zahir shah in a bloodless coup in 1973 ) .
a related issue may be whether pakistan and iran would be receptive to encouragement to grant citizenship to afghans who do not want to return to afghanistan .
thus , as funding is declining , its importance may be increasing .
the united states thus faces the challenge of maintaining its crucial assistance in this area of the world despite competing priorities .
this funding is used not only for the protection and care of refugees in countries of asylum , but also for the reintegration of afghan returnees in afghanistan .
funding for afghan refugees declined rapidly since it peaked after the u.s. - led invasion in october 2001 .
maintaining security along the border with afghanistan is also a concern .
even after four years of exceptionally high refugee return numbers , the population of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran remains the second - highest in the world .
