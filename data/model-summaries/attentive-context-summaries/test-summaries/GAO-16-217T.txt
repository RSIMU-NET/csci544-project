my statement today focuses on ( 1 ) how the federal wildland fire management agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and ( 2 ) the forest service's efforts to modernize the large airtanker fleet and challenges it has faced in doing so .
we interviewed agency officials to identify key performance measures and other mechanisms the agencies use to determine the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and to understand agency efforts to identify their firefighting aircraft needs , including their use of information on performance and effectiveness .
as you know , wildland fires have resulted in tragic loss of life and damage to homes , infrastructure , and important cultural and natural resources .
our previous body of work on performance management has shown that it is important for agencies to collect performance information to inform key management decisions , such as how to identify problems and take corrective actions and how to identify and share effective approaches .
the 2015 fire season has been especially severe , with over 9 million acres burned to date â€” well over the annual average of about 6.5 million acres burned during each of the last 10 years .
for example , the forest service and interior agencies use a system called fuel treatment effectiveness monitoring to assess fuel reduction treatment effectiveness .
balancing the need to suppress unwanted wildland fires to protect people and resources with the need to recognize fire's natural role on the landscape is a complex task , particularly given the current condition of the nation's landscape , increased development in and around wildlands ( an area often called the wildland - urban interface ) , and the future outlook for wildland fires .
as a result , we recommended in our september 2015 report that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior direct the chief of the forest service and the director of interior's office of wildland fire to ( 1 ) develop specific criteria for selecting wildland fires for review and for conducting the reviews as part of their efforts to improve their approach to reviewing fires and ( 2 ) once such criteria are established , revise agency policies to align with the specific criteria developed by the agencies .
in recent decades , increased wildland fire intensity has prompted new policies and efforts aimed at implementing more effective management strategies to manage wildland fire .
a 2013 report assessing the usefulness of the forest service's five reviews of 2012 fires noted shortcomings in consistency across the reviews , including unclear criteria for selecting fires and conducting reviews , as well as limitations in the specificity of the resulting reports and recommendations .
for example , in response to significant fire events , the agencies developed the federal wildland fire management policy of 1995 , under which the agencies continued to move away from their earlier emphasis on suppressing every wildland fire , seeking instead , among other things , to respond to fires in ways that protect communities and important resources while considering both the cost and long - term effects of the response .
to examine how federal wildland fire management agencies assess program effectiveness , we reviewed documents , such as agency strategic plans , budget justifications , agency studies and strategy documents related to fire aviation , and reports resulting from fire reviews conducted by the agencies since 2009 .
