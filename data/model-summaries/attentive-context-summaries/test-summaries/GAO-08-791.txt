this report examines the factors that will affect the impact of recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) on the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi's ( 1 ) labor market , including foreign workers ; ( 2 ) tourism sector ; and ( 3 ) foreign investment .
the united states recently enacted legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) , ending decades of the cnmi's control over its own immigration system .
because current data gaps limit federal agencies' ability to make key implementation decisions to best meet the goals of the legislation , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of labor take the following two actions: develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on the cnmi labor market that are not currently available on an ongoing basis , such as data on the wages , occupations , and employment status of cnmi residents and foreign workers ; and develop a strategy for obtaining critical data on cnmi foreign investment , such as overall levels of foreign investment and the investment amounts associated with various types of foreign investor entry permits .
in preparing this report , we reviewed relevant cnmi immigration and labor laws ; current u.s. immigration law , including the u.s. immigration and nationality act ( ina ) and related regulations ; and the recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law to the cnmi , including earlier versions of the legislation .
the cnmi is subject to most u.s. laws , and the united states has complete responsibility and authority for cnmi defense and foreign affairs .
in addition , developing strategies for obtaining critical data that are currently unavailable on the cnmi labor market and foreign investment is essential to federal agencies' ability to make appropriate and effective decisions in implementing the legislation and fulfilling its goals .
we were asked to examine factors that will affect the impact of the recent legislation's implementation on the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi's ( 1 ) labor market , including foreign workers ; ( 2 ) tourism sector ; and ( 3 ) foreign investment .
however , since 1978 , the cnmi has administered its own immigration system under the terms of its 1976 covenant with the united states .
because the interaction of key federal decisions involving different departments will have a significant impact on the cnmi economy , coordination of these decisions is critical and necessitates an established interagency process , which currently does not exist .
because of the importance of key implementation decisions by different federal agencies and the interaction of those decisions , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security lead other relevant federal agencies , including the departments of the interior , labor , and state , in identifying the interagency process that will be used to collaborate with one another — and consult with the cnmi government , as required — to jointly implement the legislation .
the legislation's stated intent is to ensure effective border control procedures and protect national and homeland security while minimizing the potential adverse economic and fiscal effects of phasing out the cnmi's own foreign worker permit program and maximizing the cnmi's potential for economic and business growth .
