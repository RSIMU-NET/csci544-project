according to the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , which administers nfip , claims from hurricane katrina alone have totaled in excess of $16.3 billion , as of october 2007 .
following the signing of the bunning - bereuter - blumenauer flood insurance reform act of 2004 , which reauthorized the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) through september 30 , 2008 , the united states experienced back - to - back catastrophic hurricane seasons and experienced nearly $20 billion in flood - insurance losses .
because nfip premium rates have been set to cover losses in an average year ( that is , based on “average historical losses” ) , the program has been unable to set aside sufficient funds to meet future expected losses .
ensure implementation of written guidance for all nfip - related contracts on how to consistently handle the failure of a contractor to meet standards in performance areas and establish written policies and procedures about the coordination between fema officials and offices ( including the cotr , the program management office , and the contracting officer ) when addressing contractor deficiencies , including determining whether and under what circumstances to issue discrepancy reports , and ensuring that financial disincentives are appropriately and consistently applied .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe trends for national flood insurance program ( nfip ) policies , insurance amounts , premiums , and losses from 1997 through 2006 and the extent to which nfip losses were attributable to hurricanes and repetitive loss properties ; ( 2 ) assess how the amounts available for the purchase of flood - damaged properties changed over time , and the extent to which the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) purchased flood - damaged properties ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the extent to which fema followed its procedures for monitoring selected nfip - related contracts .
in response to the magnitude and severity of losses from the 2005 hurricanes , congress increased nfip's borrowing authority from the department of the treasury ( treasury ) to $20.8 billion .
with its current system limitations , fema cannot accurately assess or report the extent to which its mitigation programs are reducing the number of flood - damaged and repetitive loss properties .
the insufficient revenues highlight structural weaknesses in how the program is funded , and congress is considering a number of legislative changes to improve nfip's financial solvency .
as of december 2007 , fema owed more than $17.3 billion to treasury , an amount the program is unlikely to be able to repay while paying future claims with its current premium income of about $2 billion annually .
the katrina - related claims represent more than eight times the amount for claims in 2004 and surpass ( by more than $1 billion ) the aggregate amount of all claims previously paid in the nearly 40-year history of nfip .
real - time data would improve fema headquarters' ability to produce , analyze , and report information on ongoing operations and thus improve its ability to assess the effectiveness of its mitigation programs .
coupled with lack of a requirement for staff to consistently and promptly record acquisitions data , the lack of comprehensive data impedes fema's ability to account for the properties acquired through its mitigation programs and hinders its ability to provide congress with timely information with which to assess the impact of these programs on mitigating losses to nfip and ensure that limited resources are appropriately allocated .
