 ( recommendation 3 ) .
specifically , dol reported that it will ( 1 ) ensure letters granting or renewing self - insurance authority will inform operators that their authorization expires in one year and that they must submit renewal information three months in advance of the expiration date , ( 2 ) ensure letters denying self - insurance will inform operators that they have a 30- day appeal period ( limited to one extension ) and that dol has set a goal of resolving all appeals within 90 days of the denial letter , and ( 3 ) modify existing computer systems to identify lapses or cancellations of commercial insurance coverage , and require operators identified as having lapsed or cancelled coverage to obtain or provide proof of coverage within 30 days .
the federal government's black lung disability trust fund ( trust fund ) finances medical and cash assistance to certain coal miners who have been totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis ( also known as black lung disease ) .
this report examines ( 1 ) how coal mine operator bankruptcies have affected the trust fund , and ( 2 ) how dol managed coal mine operator insurance to limit financial risk to the trust fund .
its expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue and the trust fund has essentially borrowed with interest from the department of the treasury's ( treasury ) general fund almost every year since 1979 , which was its first complete fiscal year .
in fiscal year 2019 , the trust fund borrowed about $1.9 billion to cover its expenditures , according to department of labor ( dol ) officials .
 ( recommendation 2 ) the director of the office of workers' compensation programs should develop and implement a process to monitor operator compliance with commercial insurance requirements and periodically evaluate the effectiveness of this process .
we commend dol's efforts to address the deficiencies of its past self - insurance process .
dol commented that adopting gao's recommendations would further improve its oversight of coal mine operator insurance going forward .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the director of the office of workers' compensation programs should develop and implement procedures for self - insured coal mine operator appeals that identify time lines for self - insured operators to submit documentation supporting their appeals and that identify a goal for how much time dol should take to make appeals decisions .
dol's new self - insurance process may help to address past deficiencies in setting collateral and reviewing self - insured operators if implemented effectively .
however , the trust fund pays benefits in certain circumstances , including in cases where no responsible mine operator can be identified or when the liable mine operator does not pay .
we are making the following three recommendations to the department of labor: the director of the office of workers' compensation programs should develop and implement procedures for coal mine operator self - insurance renewal that clarifies how long an operator is authorized to self - insure ; when an operator must submit its renewal application and supporting documentation ; and the conditions under which an operator's self - insurance authority would not be renewed .
this may occur , for instance , when the amount of collateral dol requires from a self - insured coal operator does not fully cover the operator's benefit responsibility should the operator become insolvent .
