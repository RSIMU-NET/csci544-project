the department of defense ( dod ) relies on a broad array of intelligence systems to study the battlefield and to identify and hit enemy targets .
these systems include reconnaissance aircraft , satellites , and ground - surface - based stations that receive , analyze , and disseminate intelligence data .
given the importance of the dcgs initiative to the war fighter , you asked us to assess ( 1 ) whether dod has adequately planned for these processing systems and ( 2 ) whether dod's process for testing and certifying the interoperability of the systems is working effectively .
dod recognizes this problem , and it has undertaken a range of initiatives aimed at improving interoperability among all of its systems .
a key problem facing dod is the inability of these systems to operate effectively together for technical reasons ( such as incompatible data formats ) and / or operational reasons .
one multibillion - dollar initiative underway since 1998 is to pare down the number of ground - surface systems that process intelligence data and upgrade them to enhance their functionality and to ensure that they are interoperable with other dod systems .
the eventual goal is the migration to an overarching , interconnected family of systems for processing intelligence data known as the distributed common ground - surface system ( dcgs ) .
such problems can considerably slow the time involved with identifying and analyzing a potential target and deciding whether to attack it , as well as delivering an order to the war fighter in charge of the attack .
gao examines the use of public funds ; evaluates federal programs and policies ; and provides analyses , recommendations , and other assistance to help congress make informed oversight , policy , and funding decisions .
moreover , dod is fielding new systems and new versions of old systems without following its own certification process .
to ensure that an effective distributed common ground - surface system is adequately planned and funded , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for command , control , communications , and intelligence to expand the planning efforts for dcgs to include a migration plan or road map that at a minimum lays out ( 1 ) current system capabilities and desired capabilities ; ( 2 ) specific initiatives , programs , projects and schedules to get dod and the services to their goal ; ( 3 ) measures to gauge success in implementing the migration plan as well as the enterprise architecture ; and ( 4 ) mechanisms for ensuring that the plan is followed .
this delay has hampered dod's ability to ensure interoperability in the systems now being developed and deployed .
given the multi - billion - dollar commitment and many technical and operational challenges with the migration initiative , it is critical that dod have effective plans to guide and manage system development .
more fundamentally , dod still lacks visibility over spending on its intelligence systems since spending is spread among the budgets of dod's services and components .
at the same time , because funding has already been raised as a barrier , dod should include an analysis of innovative funding mechanisms into its review .
