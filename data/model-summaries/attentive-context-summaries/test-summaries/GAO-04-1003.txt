our specific objectives were to ( 1 ) develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and ( 2 ) assess dod's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals .
the mandate directed us to evaluate dod's recommendations .
for fiscal year 2005 , the department of defense ( dod ) has proposed eliminating or amending a number of general and flag officer provisions to provide greater flexibility in managing its senior uniformed leaders .
since 1996 , congress annually has authorized the military services a total of nearly 900 active duty general and flag officers .
we initiated this review in response to a mandate in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 .
the secretary of defense has expressed interest in retaining experienced leaders beyond the current statutory retirement limits .
such provisions reflect congressional interest in maintaining oversight and accountability of general and flag officers .
finally , dod has not determined the long - term cost implications of its proposals pertaining to retirement compensation .
as subsequently agreed with your offices , we developed information and analysis to assist congress as it considers dod's fiscal year 2005 legislative proposals .
among dod's stated goals of the proposals are to extend the careers of general and flag officers and to increase the length of individual assignments .
the mandate required dod to review the existing statutory framework for the management of general and flag officers and submit any recommendations for revising the framework .
this is the second report we have issued in response to the fiscal year 2003 mandate .
this evaluation should include an assessment of ( 1 ) factors that contribute to the retirement of senior general and flag officers prior to the statutory retirement limits , ( 2 ) the need for changes in dod policy or procedure to make greater use of existing authority to extend general and flag officers careers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory retirement limits , and ( 3 ) the long - term cost implications of proposals to change retirement compensation .
dod , however , has not analyzed the long - term cost implications of its retirement compensation proposals .
a legislative framework that has evolved over time shapes the careers of general and flag officers and the management of these officers .
for example , congress has enacted legislative provisions limiting the tenure of general and flag officers , the terms they can serve in specified senior leadership positions , and the distribution of general and flag officers across pay grades .
our first report reviewed dod's 2003 study of general and flag officer requirements and authorizations and recommended actions that dod could take to clarify its general and flag officer requirements .
in march 2004 , dod resubmitted many of the same proposals to congress for consideration as part of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 .
for example , we recommended that dod clarify the magnitude and impact between dod's validated requirements for general and flag officers and congressional authorizations , to include an analysis of the impact caused by the workarounds dod uses to fill the gap between requirements and authorizations .
if dod makes full use of its existing legislative authority but finds that it is inadequate to achieve its goal of retaining experienced leaders , then it may be in a better position to argue for changes to this authority .
