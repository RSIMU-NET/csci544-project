over 1.6 million u.s. troops have deployed in operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) since october 2001 .
we are pleased to be here today as you examine issues related to meeting the critical needs of recovering servicemembers by reviewing the progress made by the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) in jointly developing policies mandated by the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( ndaa 2008 ) .
because of improved battlefield medicine , those who might have died in past conflicts are now surviving , many with multiple serious injuries such as amputations , traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) , and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) .
we determined whether each of the requirements ( 1 ) had been completed , ( 2 ) was in progress , or ( 3 ) had not been acted upon .
specifically , section 1611 ( a ) of the ndaa 2008 directs dod and va to cover four key areas â€” ( 1 ) care and management , ( 2 ) medical evaluation and disability evaluation , ( 3 ) the return of servicemembers to active duty , and ( 4 ) the transition of recovering servicemembers from dod to va. because of the related ongoing work of the soc , it assumed responsibility for addressing these requirements .
beyond adjusting to their injuries , recovering servicemembers may face additional challenges , including difficulties managing their outpatient recovery process , difficulties navigating the military's disability evaluation system , and problems transitioning between care provided by dod and care provided by va .
in february 2009 , dod reported that over 33,000 servicemembers have been wounded in action since the onset of these conflicts .
in my testimony today , i will discuss our preliminary findings on ( 1 ) the progress dod and va have made in jointly developing comprehensive policies for recovering servicemembers in the areas of care and management , medical and disability evaluation , return to active duty , and transition from care and services received from dod to va as required by sections 1611 through 1614 of the ndaa 2008 and ( 2 ) the challenges dod and va are encountering in the joint development and initial implementation of these policies .
questions were raised in the media and by congress about whether dod and va are prepared to meet the needs of the increasing number of recovering servicemembers and veterans .
the ndaa 2008 also requires gao to report on the progress dod and va make in developing and implementing the comprehensive policy .
in may 2007 , dod and va established the wounded , ill , and injured senior oversight committee ( soc ) to address the problems that had been identified with the care of recovering servicemembers .
various review groups investigated the challenges that dod and va faced in providing care to recovering servicemembers and made a number of recommendations to address the problems they identified .
in february 2007 , a series of washington post articles disclosed deficiencies in the provision of outpatient services at walter reed army medical center , including poor living conditions at walter reed , a confusing disability evaluation system , and servicemembers remaining in outpatient status for months and sometimes years without a clear understanding about their plan of care or the future of their military service .
