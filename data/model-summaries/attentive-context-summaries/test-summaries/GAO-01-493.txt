according to the department of the navy , the primary purpose of forward - deployed naval forces is to project power from the sea to influence events ashore .
to be successful , our naval forces must be able to gain access to , and operate in the littoral regions of , potential adversaries .
consequently , they must be able to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines and submarines , and to protect themselves against cruise missiles and other antiship weapons .
specifically , we assessed the navy's existing mine countermeasures , antisubmarine warfare , ship self - defense , and surface fire support capabilities , and the progress of the acquisition programs the navy is pursuing to address shortfalls in these areas .
we have reported on the extent of these capabilities in several individual reports over the last 6 years .
finally , they must be able to launch and support offensive operations against enemy forces ashore .
in this context , the navy has as one of its missions the support of the marine corps as it conducts amphibious operations .
this report responds to your request that we update and consolidate the assessments contained in these reports and provide an overall assessment of the navy's capabilities to operate in the littoral .
dod did not agree with our statement that the navy has not established funding priorities among its various antisubmarine and mine countermeasures programs .
we accept dod's determination that current funding levels are adequate .
the navy has not established funding priorities among its various antisubmarine programs .
a congressionally mandated certification of the navy's mine warfare plan by the secretary of defense has enhanced the importance of mine countermeasures programs within the department of defense ( dod ) and the navy .
since dod's budget represents the outcomes of many diverse constituencies competing for limited resources , funding tradeoffs and compromises are required to achieve agreement .
as we have previously reported , dod employs overly optimistic planning assumptions in its budget formulation , which leads to far too many programs for the available dollars .
further progress in developing improved capabilities may be limited by funding reductions in specific programs and competition among a large number of acquisition programs for the same resources .
additional progress in overcoming shortfalls identified in the navy's 1997 anti - submarine warfare assessment may be limited by a lack of funding and the navy's failure to establish priorities among competing antisubmarine warfare acquisition programs .
until such decisions are made , the navy will not be able to plan the full extent of its future funding needs for all mine countermeasures forces , from the standpoint of development , procurement , maintenance , and modernization .
some countries are continuing to develop and proliferate mines that are increasingly more difficult to detect and neutralize .
the navy has not made a decision on the size and composition of its future mine countermeasures force structure .
on multiple occasions , the congress has unsuccessfully sought information from dod on the relative priorities of the programs being funded , the priorities among requirements , and the priorities of programs not funded .
finally , we reported that while the congressionally mandated certification process increased the visibility of mine countermeasures requirements within dod and the navy , it did not address the adequacy of overall resources for this mission , nor contain any measures against which the navy's progress in enhancing its mine countermeasures capabilities could be evaluated .
