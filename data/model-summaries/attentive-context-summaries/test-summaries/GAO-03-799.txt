in january 2003 , we designated the implementation and transformation of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) as high - risk due to the size and complexity of the effort , the existing challenges faced by the components being merged into the department , and the potentially serious consequences should dhs fail to effectively carry out its mission .
dhs , which is expected to have some of the most extensive acquisition requirements in government , is currently in the process of integrating the mission functions and acquisition practices of 23 incoming entities .
the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) is one of the largest agencies coming under the new department , with a budget of $6.1 billion and contracts for goods and services valued at $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2002 .
specifically , we assessed whether ins has an adequate infrastructure — including oversight , information , and workforce — to manage its acquisitions .
ins's procurement organization will continue to acquire goods and services under dhs .
given the heightened importance of ins's mission due to threats to the security of our nation , you asked us to review ins's contracting processes .
in addition , you asked us to determine whether ins is following sound contracting policies and procedures in awarding and managing individual contracts .
dhs officials are currently assessing the incoming agencies' ( 1 ) major procurements to determine whether duplication exists and to identify ways of maximizing the dhs's purchasing power by consolidating like procurements where feasible ; ( 2 ) procurement and financial systems to determine whether any of the existing systems are adequate to meet the department's future needs ; and ( 3 ) acquisition workforce to identify gaps and the need for dhs - specific training requirements .
its acquisition workforce is struggling to effectively manage the large and mission - critical procurements for which it is responsible .
in addition , while headquarters and administrative centers established performance goals and measures to help evaluate the effectiveness of the procurement function , these efforts have not been effective .
further , ins's acquisition workforce is not adequate to manage the agency's increased mission requirements .
ins has made limited use of internal controls , such as internal reviews and performance goals and measures , that could help monitor procurement activity across the agency .
ins's mission and overall workforce have expanded greatly in the past decade , and spending on contracts has also increased significantly .
the plan should also identify key strategies to attract and retain this workforce , including use of available recruiting and retention flexibilities or other targeted approaches .
a consulting firm helped the ins headquarters procurement office set goals , such as obligating funds in a timely manner ; providing clear , consistent customer guidance ; maximizing private and public sector resources ; and complying with statutory requirements .
we recommend that the secretary of dhs direct the under secretary for management to take the following actions as part of ongoing efforts to implement dhs procurement policies .
dhs is expected to spend billions annually to acquire a broad range of products , technologies and services , and these contractor - provided goods and services will be critical to the department's ability to achieve its mission of protecting the nation from terrorism .
