specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether marad will meet the statutory deadline of september 2006 to dispose of its obsolete ships and , if not , what factors may prevent it from doing so ; and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which marad has used alternative methods , other than ship scrapping , to dispose of its obsolete ships and the barriers to using such alternatives .
to determine whether marad will meet its september 2006 deadline and identify factors affecting this goal and to assess whether marad has considered alternative approaches to scrapping , we reviewed the agency's performance plans and program status reports and applicable laws and regulations .

the government performance and results act of 1993 , for example , embodies key principles that provide an effective management framework to improve the likelihood of successfully implementing programs and assessing results .
good management practices include identifying external factors that may be impediments to program success and actions needed to mitigate these impediments .
members of congress , the states , and environmental groups have expressed concerns about the environmental hazards posed by these ships .
external factors and mitigation plans .
these challenges include domestic disposal capacity limitations ; environmental , legal , and regulatory restrictions on export ; and similar restrictions on other disposal options .
to assess whether the maritime administration ( marad ) is likely to meet the statutory deadline of september 2006 and , if not , what factors may prevent it from doing so , we reviewed marad's 2001 report to congress , in which it presented its plan to meet the deadline , and its subsequent 2002 and 2004 status reports to congress .
dot stated that despite the complex challenges that marad's ship disposal program faces , through its efforts and actions , much has been achieved including the disposal of 26 vessels .
