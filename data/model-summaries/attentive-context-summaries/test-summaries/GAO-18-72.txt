to address the objectives , we selected four agencies with responsibility for assessing their own facilities — dhs's u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) ; the department of transportation's federal aviation administration ( faa ) ; and the united states department of agriculture's ( usda ) agricultural research service ( ars ) and forest service .
to help federal agencies protect and assess risks to their facilities , the interagency security committee ( isc ) , an organization chaired by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , developed physical security standards for non - military federal facilities in the united states .
this report examines: ( 1 ) how selected agencies' assessment methodologies align with the interagency security committee's ( isc ) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and ( 2 ) what management challenges , if any , selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results .
in light of these incidents and other emergent threats , it is important that agencies use risk - based methodologies to assess the physical security needs of the approximately 113,000 executive - branch , non - military federal buildings .
several incidents — such as armed citizens taking over a federal wildlife refuge in oregon for about 40 days in 2016 ; the active shooter incident at the washington navy yard in washington , d.c. , in 2013 that resulted in several deaths ; and the fatal shooting at the anderson federal building in long beach , california , in 2012 — demonstrate that government facilities and their employees continue to be targets of potential harm .
security assessments of facilities can uncover vulnerabilities and threats and recommend protective measures — called countermeasures — such as fences , access control systems , and closed - circuit television systems to mitigate those threats .
with regard to our recommendation to update the security policy and procedures handbook , dhs stated that cbp is updating the handbook to include: ( 1 ) a discussion and diagram of the isc risk management process and its application within cbp's assessment processes ; ( 2 ) specific guidance for conducting risk assessments in accordance with the isc's risk management process for federal facilities ; and ( 3 ) a requirement and guidance for data collection and analysis in support of a robust physical security program .
at least 30 federal agencies are responsible for protecting about 45 percent of civilian federal facilities and their occupants from potential threats .
secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to take the following three actions: develop a plan that provides sufficient details on the activities needed and time frames within the date when faa will implement an improved methodology ; update faa's policy to require the use of a methodology that fully aligns with the isc's risk management process for federal facilities for assessing all undesirable events , considering all three factors of risk , and documenting all deviations from the standard countermeasures ; and update faa's policy to include ongoing monitoring of physical security information .
