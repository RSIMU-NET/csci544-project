for the energy sector , which includes critical electrical infrastructure , the department of energy ( doe ) is the sector - specific agency and shares responsibility with dhs .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work regarding the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to address electromagnetic threats to the electric grid .
the threat posed by an electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) or solar weather event could have a debilitating impact on critical electrical infrastructure and communications systems , as well as other key assets and infrastructure that depend on electric utilities for power .
taken actions to address recommendations from the 2008 emp commission report , and ( 2 ) coordinated with other principal federal agencies and industry stakeholders to mitigate risks to the electric grid from electromagnetic threats .
within the nipp framework , dhs has the lead role in coordinating the overall federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the nation's critical infrastructure .
emp and solar weather events could potentially lead to power outages over broad geographic areas for extended durations , which experts have reported could result in severe economic disruption and significant impacts to public health and safety .
in april 2008 , the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack ( emp commission ) issued a report which included recommendations addressing the preparation , protection and recovery of u.s. critical infrastructures against a possible emp attack.to doe .
however , the national infrastructure protection plan ( nipp ) outlines the roles and responsibilities of dhs and applicable sector - specific agencies for each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors .
addressing these threats necessitates effective collaboration among multiple government agencies and industry partners and no singular federal program or entity has sole responsibility for addressing electromagnetic threats .
specifically , i will be discussing the extent to which dhs has: ( 1 ) we are conducting this work at the request of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on homeland security .
gao , critical infrastructure protection , observations on key factors in dhs's implementation of its partnership approach , gao - 14-464t ( washington , d.c.: march 6 , 2014 ) .
for example , ppd - 21 states that dhs , in carrying out its responsibilities under the homeland security act of 2002 , as amended , is to , among other things , evaluate national capabilities , opportunities , and challenges in protecting critical infrastructure ; analyze threats to , vulnerabilities of , and potential consequences from all hazards on critical infrastructure ; identify security and resilience functions that are necessary for effective stakeholder engagement with all critical infrastructure sectors ; integrate and coordinate federal cross - sector security and resilience activities ; and identify and analyze key interdependencies among critical infrastructure sectors .
for example , dhs - ip has not fully leveraged the infrastructure survey tool and regional resiliency assessment program ( rrap ) to help collect additional information related to infrastructure vulnerabilities and impacts related to electromagnetic threats .
for example , dhs's efforts to clearly identify agency roles and responsibilities to date have been limited .
for our ongoing review , dhs did not identify its actions as specifically responsive to the emp commission's recommendations ; nonetheless , some of the actions dhs has taken since 2008 could help to mitigate some electromagnetic impacts to the electric grid .
