to increase the safety , capacity , and efficiency of the national airspace system , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , in cooperation with aviation industry stakeholders and other federal agencies , is developing a new , technologically advanced air traffic management system — the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
to help improve and expand faa's capability to use data for aviation safety oversight , we recommend that the secretary of transportation direct the faa administrator to take the following four actions: develop and implement a comprehensive plan that addresses how data fit into faa's implementation of a proactive approach to safety oversight and ensure that this plan fully describes the relevant data challenges ( such as ensuring data quality and continued access to voluntarily reported safety data ) , analytical approaches , and staffing requirements and integrates efforts to address them ; given the importance of high - quality data , extend standard quality controls , as appropriate , to the databases that support aviation safety oversight to ensure that the data are as reliable and valid as possible ; proceed with all deliberate speed to develop the capability to model the impact of nextgen changes on the national airspace system and manage any risks emerging from these changes ; and systematically identify the reasons that carriers are not participating in voluntary reporting programs , such as through a survey , and identify and implement further steps to encourage greater program participation , especially by smaller carriers .
furthermore , sms will allow faa to test the impact of nextgen changes on aviation safety and to identify safety vulnerabilities and mitigating measures .
at the same time , faa is attempting to further enhance aviation safety by shifting to a new data - driven , risk - based safety oversight approach , which industry and international air traffic management organizations are also adopting .
faa has efforts under way to address two key challenges to using data more effectively to manage risk .
under this new approach , called a safety management system ( sms ) approach , faa will continue to use data on aviation accidents and incidents — referred to collectively as safety events — to identify and address their causes .
you asked us to assess faa's capacity to use available data to oversee aviation safety .
however , without carrier - specific information on why air carriers are not participating in these programs , faa cannot determine if its efforts to increase participation are sufficient .
as faa improves its ability to integrate and analyze data from multiple sources , it plans to increase its capacity to model the impact of nextgen changes and to identify and manage risks .
efforts such as the training faa provides to smaller carriers on how to develop programs that require less capital investment have the potential to increase participation and improve safety .
in this report , we assessed the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) capacity to use available data to oversee aviation safety .
aviation safety data are critical to faa's safety oversight and its planned implementation of sms .
to answer these questions , we reviewed 13 aviation safety databases maintained by faa , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) , and the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) .
