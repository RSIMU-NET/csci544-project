an officially secular nation , india has a long tradition of religious tolerance ( with periodic and sometimes serious lapses ) , which is protected under its constitution .
although religious discrimination and intolerance of social dissent is hardly new to india , the 2014 election of the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) to majority status at the federal level — the party won 52% of parliament's lok sabha ( lower - house ) seats in that year's national elections — triggered concerns among human rights advocates that agents of overt hindu majoritarianism would be empowered .
for some observers , prime minister modi's 2016 u.s. visit — and address to a joint session of congress — completed the "political rehabilitation" of a foreign leader who was at one time viewed by many in the united states as a pariah: in 2005 , modi had been denied a u.s. visa over concerns about his role in government during lethal anti - muslim violence in gujarat in 2002 .
in early 2017 , the bjp won a sweeping state - level victory in north - central uttar pradesh ( up ) , india's most populous state with more than 200 million residents , one - fifth of them muslim .
the visa denial had been lauded by some members of congress .
in the weeks leading up to modi's june 2016 visit to washington , dc , some members issued public criticisms of india's human rights record .
in its 2018 annual report , the u.s. commission on international religious freedom ( uscirf ) stated conditions for religious minorities have deteriorated over the last decade due to a multifaceted campaign by hindu - nationalist groups… .
at present , reporting by the u.s. government and international human rights watchdogs indicates that india's minority religious communities face mounting repression .
in 2017 , a bipartisan group of five u.s .
indian prime minister narendra modi , leader of the bjp , took office after serving as chief minister of the western gujarat state for nearly 13 years .
[religious minorities] face challenges ranging from acts of violence or intimidation , to the loss of political power , to increasing feelings of disenfranchisement and "otherness. .
the earlier optimism of many u.s. policymakers and stakeholders about the likelihood of expanding u.s. - india commercial ties under the modi government has given way to intensifying concerns over existing trade and investment barriers .
after four years of bjp rule at the federal level and expanded bjp power in state governments since 2014 , indicators of increasing hindu chauvinism and bigotry are more common in india .
india's rising middle - class population , infrastructure and energy needs , and digital connectivity present u.s. commercial opportunities , but challenges are significant .
the choice surprised and baffled many analysts , and elicited new fears of rising hindu chauvinism that chill many among the country's large muslim minority of up to 180 million persons , as well as in significant christian and other minority communities that number in the tens of millions .
it is unclear if the president did so .
legal restrictions on religious conversion in eight states ; lack of criminal investigations or accountability for cases related to rape , domestic violence , dowry - related deaths , honor killings , sexual harassment ; and discrimination against women and girls remained serious problems .
