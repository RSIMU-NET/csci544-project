my statement today will focus on ( 1 ) the extent to which dhs has used its other transaction authority , ( 2 ) the status of dhs's implementation of gao's previous recommendations , and ( 3 ) the accountability challenges associated with the use of these agreements .
we have previously reviewed dhs's use of this authority and ethics related management controls and made recommendations for improvements .
according to dhs officials , this authority , which is set to expire in september 2008 , is a critical tool because it has given the department the flexibility to attract new contractors to help develop and manage the mission of an integrated program of science and technology from basic research to production .
for this reason , it is important to monitor the use of this authority to help ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks to the government .
however , the flexibility afforded by other transaction authority also carries the risk of reduced accountability and transparency .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) use of its other transaction authority .
operational challenges to successfully making use of other transaction authority include: attracting and ensuring the use of non - traditional contractors ; acquiring intellectual property rights ; financial control ; and maintaining a skilled acquisition workforce .
in preparation for this hearing , we obtained recent data on other transaction agreements from dhs and looked at several of these agreements , interviewed dhs representatives from the science and technology directorate , reviewed related reports and studies , and identified the efforts dhs has made to address our previous recommendations .
dhs has implemented some measures to address many of these recommendations ; however , it has not addressed all of them .
about 77 percent of the $443 million spent on dhs's agreements has been on 7 of the 37 agreements .
we plan to conduct additional audit work on dhs's use of other transaction authority as required by the homeland security act of 2002 .
in addition , dhs has stated that its two cost - sharing agreements for development of its counter - manpads technology have resulted in savings of over $27 million and possibly more .
most of the department's use of other transaction authority to date occurred between fiscal years 2004 and 2005 .
beyond these efforts , gao found some areas for improvement and recommended that: dhs provide guidance on when to include audit provisions in agreements ; provide more training on creating and managing agreements ; capture knowledge gained from current agreements for future use ; and take measures to help rotational staff avoid conflicts of interest .
in fiscal year 2006 , other transactions accounted for almost $153 million of dhs's reported $15.9 billion in procurement obligations , approximately 1 percent ( see fig .
retaining a skilled acquisition workforce has been a continual challenge at dhs , and we have ongoing work in this area for this committee .
for example , the department estimates that from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 , s&t spent 13 percent of its total obligations on its other transaction agreements .
