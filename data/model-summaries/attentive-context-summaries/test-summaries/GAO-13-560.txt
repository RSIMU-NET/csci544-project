this report identifies ( 1 ) how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal or state law or established industry standards , ( 2 ) challenges associated with federal investigations and prosecutions of rogue internet pharmacies , ( 3 ) efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and ( 4 ) efforts to educate consumers about the risks of rogue internet pharmacies and how to recognize legitimate online pharmacies .
while educational efforts attempt to overcome these challenges , their success thus far is unknown â€” in part , because the volume of drugs purchased from rogue internet pharmacies is unknown , making it difficult to assess whether educational efforts have been effective at reducing such purchases .
the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) is responsible for enforcing laws prohibiting the illegal importation of goods into the united states , including prescription drugs that have not been approved for marketing in the united states by fda , and its u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) conducts investigations related to violations of these laws , including illegally importing prescription drugs and trafficking in counterfeit goods .

many consumers mistakenly believe that if a drug may be prescribed for medical use , it is safe to consume regardless in addition , of whether they have a prescription for that particular drug.other pressures , including consumers' desire to self - medicate , their wish for privacy related to obtaining lifestyle medications ( such as drugs for sexual dysfunction ) , and relatively high out - of - pocket costs for brand - name drugs may fuel a demand among consumers to purchase prescription drugs from rogue internet pharmacies .
for example , fda is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs , and fda approval is required prior to marketing prescription drugs in the united states .
to identify how rogue internet pharmacies are selling prescription drugs in violation of federal or state laws or established industry standards , we interviewed officials from federal agencies such as fda , cbp , ice , uspis , and doj , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency documents , including those that presented information about federal indictments and prosecutions related to internet pharmacy crimes .

to identify challenges involved in investigating and prosecuting rogue internet pharmacies , as well as efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , we interviewed officials from federal agencies such as fda , cbp , ice , and doj .
a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for regulating prescription drugs that are marketed and sold to u.s. consumers , including by internet pharmacies .
