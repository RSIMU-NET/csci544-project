in a sharp reversal of its policy of denying the existence of a chemical weapons program , the syrian government agreed to destroy its chemical weapons stocks and joined the treaty banning the possession and use of these weapons , the chemical weapons convention ( cwc ) , on september 12 .
president obama had been seeking congressional authorization to use military force in response to a large - scale chemical weapons attack by syria , but on september 10 asked congressional leaders to postpone a vote in order to give the administration time to pursue a u.s. - russian diplomatic initiative to achieve chemical weapons disarmament in syria .
the target dates for implementation are completion of initial on - site inspections of syria's declared chemical weapons - related sites by november 2013 ; destruction of syrian chemical weapons production , mixing , and filling equipment by november 2013 ; and complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014 .
on september 14 , 2013 , secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov announced a proposed framework for elimination of syrian chemical weapons .
as a first step , the syrian government is required to declare all its stocks , munitions , precursor chemicals , and production and storage facilities to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) .
the u.n. mission to investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons in the syrian arab republic released its report on september 16 .
u.n. security council resolution 2118 authorizes measures under chapter vii of the u.n. charter if syria does not comply with its chemical weapons disarmament commitments .
syria has requested technical assistance for the cw dismantlement process , which would likely include u.s. technical or financial assistance to the opcw .
in past cases of chemical weapons elimination , the country holding the stocks was responsible for securing the stockpile and related facilities while awaiting dismantlement .
the united nations and the opcw have had experience successfully monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons in several countries .
under chapter vii , a response could include sanctions or use of military force .
based on this declaration , the opcw recommended a plan for cw destruction , which was approved by its executive council on september 27 , 2013. international inspectors would first verify that the declaration was accurate and complete , and are to begin inspections by october 1 .
key implementation issues will include verification , access , security of stocks and of international personnel , and timelines for action .
this contingency has raised two major policy concerns: the use of chemical weapons by the regime of president bashar al asad ; and whether the regime could lose control over these weapons .
the potency and effectiveness of syrian chemical agents are unknown since precursor chemicals may degrade over time , but , as noted , syria has used chemical weapons with some apparent effectiveness .
there will continue to be limits , however , to the united states' ability to monitor the security of these stockpiles and limits to intelligence about where , how well , and by whom they are being secured .
president barack obama and other world leaders had said that the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population would be met with consequences , which could include the use of military force .
