in 1996 , the un and iraq began the oil for food program to address growing concerns about iraq's humanitarian situation after international sanctions were imposed in 1990 .
today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the control environment established by the un for managing the sanctions and oil for food program ; ( 2 ) other key internal control elements addressed by the un , including lines of authority and responsibility , risk assessment , and monitoring and oversight ; and ( 3 ) our observations on the lessons learned from the oil for food program .
iraq obtained more than $67 billion in oil revenues through the program ; as of november 2003 , about $31 billion in commodities and humanitarian assistance had been delivered to iraq .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the lessons learned from the united nations ( un ) oil for food program and the implications for future sanctions programs and ongoing un reform efforts .
the intent of the program was to allow the iraq government to use the proceeds of its oil sales to pay for food , medicine , and infrastructure maintenance and , at the same time , prevent the regime from obtaining goods for military purposes .
to address these objectives , we used the body of work that gao has completed on iraq sanctions , the oil for food program , and un oversight issues .
four key entities were responsible for most of the program's operations â€” the security council's iraq sanctions committee , the un secretariat's office of the iraq program , nine un agencies with separate programs in northern iraq , and the iraqi government under saddam hussein .
the 2005 defense authorization act mandated that gao review the oil for food program following allegations of corruption and misconduct .
we have also testified numerous times on the oil for food program and issued a report in may 2002 on the implementation of sanctions against iraq .
our april 2006 report used this internal control framework to identify the key weaknesses in enforcing sanctions against iraq and implementing the oil for food program .
policymakers and program managers are continually seeking ways to better achieve agencies' missions and program results and improve accountability for results .
internal controls also serve as the first line of defense in safeguarding assets and preventing fraud , waste , and abuse .
in april 2006 , we issued a report on the results of our work and our recommendations for strengthened internal controls at the un .
although the sanctions curbed the iraq regime's ability to advance its military and weapons of mass destruction programs , the un established a weak control environment for the oil for food program at its beginning due to compromises it made with the iraq government and neighboring states .
a key factor in helping to achieve such outcomes is appropriate internal control , which , if properly designed and implemented , provide reasonable assurance that objectives are being met .
the un did not adequately address other key internal control elements as it implemented the oil for food program: ( 1 ) establishing clear authorities , ( 2 ) identifying and addressing program risks , and ( 3 ) ensuring adequate monitoring and oversight .
