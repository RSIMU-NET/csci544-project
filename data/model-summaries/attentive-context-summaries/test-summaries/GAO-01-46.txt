under the clean air act , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) is responsible for overseeing the states' air quality programs and for ensuring that the states appropriately implement the act's requirements .
concerned about the air quality consequences of emissions that exceed allowable levels , you asked us to provide information on ( 1 ) the steps that epa and state regulators take to verify that large sources comply with their title v or state permit and the extent of compliance found ; ( 2 ) the steps that regulators take to verify the accuracy of emissions reports submitted by large industrial sources and the extent of errors found ; and ( 3 ) the steps that epa is taking , if any , to improve its oversight of these processes .
in 1999 , 62 million americans lived in areas that did not meet federal air quality standards .
title v of the clean air act amendments of 1990 requires nearly 20,000 major stationary sources ( such as factories that emit more than specified levels of pollutants ) to obtain and comply with the conditions of a permit that consolidates all applicable air pollution control requirements .
to address these questions , we performed audit work at epa's headquarters , 2 of epa's 10 regional offices , and the air quality offices of four states ( two states within each of two of epa's regions ) .
while these reports are not intended to demonstrate compliance with clean air act requirements , their accuracy is important for determining the amount of permit fees that major sources must pay and for developing state and national emission inventories , which are used to develop air pollution control strategies .
generally , the permits contain provisions that limit emissions of pollutants as well as requirements for record keeping and monitoring .
in addition , most major sources must report their aggregate annual emissions to their state air quality agency and pay fees based partly or entirely on their level of emissions .
we selected these regions and states because of their large numbers of stationary sources and their levels of recent regulatory activity .
for information on the extent of compliance and the extent of errors in emissions reports , we used data for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 , the most recent years for which data were available at the time of our review .
within each region , we accompanied state air quality program officials on inspections of large facilities .
the accuracy of these reports is important because they influence ( 1 ) the financing of states' regulatory programs through fees and ( 2 ) the development of emissions inventories , which , in turn , assist regulators in developing control strategies and establishing permit limits .
finally , more thorough reviews could help epa and state compliance efforts .
while taking steps to improve its overall compliance - monitoring strategy , epa does not plan to evaluate state processes for verifying emissions reports from large facilities .
specifically , through its lengthy and resource - intensive investigations , epa identified widespread potential violations of new source review requirements in all four of the industries it reviewed .
to help ensure the accuracy of large facilities' emissions reports , we recommend that the administrator of epa evaluate states' programs to determine whether they have adequate mechanisms in place for verifying the accuracy of emissions reports .
