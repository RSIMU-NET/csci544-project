pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed three power marketing administrations ' ( pma ) cost recovery practices , and financing for capital projects , focusing on how these pma differ from nonfederal utilities . gao found that : the three pma are not recovering through power rates some costs related to producing and marketing federal hydropower ; pma are not recovering the full costs of providing postretirement health benefits and civil service retirement system pensions to agency employees ; the western area power administration will probably not be able to recover the construction costs of its washoe project because it is not generating sufficient revenue to cover its operating and maintenance expenses and repay the federal investment ; western is not required to repay the $ 454 million allocated to its incomplete irrigation facilities ; pma rely primarily on debt financing for their large capital construction projects ; and compared to other nonfederal utilities , pma benefit from their reliance on inexpensive hydropower , lower construction costs , and tax - exempt status .
this report provides an overview of the electronic communications privacy act ( ecpa ) and the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) . ecpa consists of three parts . the first , often referred to as title iii , outlaws wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping , except as otherwise provided . the second , the stored communications act , governs the privacy of , and government access to , the content of electronic communications and to related records . the third outlaws the use and installation of pen registers and of trap and trace devices , unless judicially approved for law enforcement or intelligence gathering purposes . fisa consists of seven parts . the first , reminiscent of title iii , authorizes electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence investigations . the second authorizes physical searches in foreign intelligence cases . the third permits the use and installation of pen registers and trap and trace devices in the context of a foreign intelligence investigation . the fourth affords intelligence officials access to business records and other tangible items . the fifth directs the attorney general to report to congress on the specifics of the exercise of fisa authority . the sixth , scheduled to expire on december 31 , 2017 , permits the acquisition of the communications of targeted overseas individuals and entities . the seventh creates a safe harbor from civil liability for those who assist or have assisted in the collection of information relating to the activities of foreign powers and their agents . this report includes the text of the electronic communications privacy act and the foreign intelligence surveillance act , as well as appendixes listing the citations to state statutes that correspond to various aspects of ecpa . the report is available in an abridged form without footnotes , attributions to authority , the text of ecpa or fisa , or appendixes found here as crs report 98-327 , privacy : an abbreviated outline of federal statutes governing wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] . crs report r41733 , privacy : an overview of the electronic communications privacy act , by [ author name scrubbed ] , replicates portions of this report . related crs reports include crs report r42725 , reauthorization of the fisa amendments act , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report r40138 , amendments to the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) extended until june 1 , 2015 , by the same author .
credit cards offer clear advantages to college students because they provide an interest free loan until the payment is due and a convenient noncash payment option for both routine transactions and emergencies . if used responsibly , credit cards allow students to build up credit histories that will increase their access to credit in the future . however , if college students have not learned sound financial management skills in high school or from their parents , the disadvantages of credit cards can outweigh the advantages . gao found that more than one - third of students had credit cards before they entered college , and another 46 percent acquired them during the first year . except for charges for tuition and fees , their spending patterns resembled those of nonstudents . gao did not find a uniform response to the controversial issue of on - campus credit card marketing among the universities gao visited . in response to complaints about aggressive marketing techniques , a few universities have restricted credit card solicitation on campus . the credit card issuers that responded to gao 's inquiries participated actively in the student market , but they did not have a uniform set of policies or practices .
despite efforts by the international community to reduce the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus , aids is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world and the primary cause of death in sub - saharan africa . the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids ( unaids ) , funded in part by the united states , is one important international effort against the disease . unaids was established by the united nations ( u.n. ) in 1996 to provide coordinated u.n. action and to lead and promote an expanded global response to the worldwide epidemic . this report assesses unaids ' progress , especially at the country level , toward increasing the coordination and commitment of the u.n. and global community ; assesses unaids ' progress in providing technical assistance and information and in developing a monitoring and evaluation plan to measure results ; and identifies factors that may have affected unaids ' progress . gao found that unaids has made progress in increasing u.n. coordination and enhancing the global response to the worldwide hiv / aids epidemic , but its country - level efforts need to be strengthened . unaids has provided financial and technical support to about 50 hiv / aids technical networks worldwide , but has not been as successful in tracking the funding and actions host governments and others have taken to address the aids problem . unaids has also been unable to follow its intended model of u.n. reform , whereby a single secretariat together with several u.n. agencies would marshal the u.n. and global community 's resources to address the aids epidemic .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the states ' fiscal decisions for the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant and whether states are taking steps to prepare for the effects of future economic downturns on their welfare programs , focusing on : how state budgetary resources , including federal aid , have been allocated since states have had access to tanf funds ; what plans states are making to ensure programmatic stability in times of fiscal and economic stress ; and the extent to which states have used , or plan to use , the program 's federal contingency fund for state welfare programs and the federal loans for state welfare programs ( loan fund ) which are available for downturns or other emergencies affecting states . gao noted that : more federal and state resources are available for states ' low - income family assistance programs since welfare reform passed in 1996 than would have been available under the previous system of financing welfare programs consolidated in the tanf block grant ; gao 's estimates showed that , taking caseload declines into account , 46 states would have more total resources -- both state and federal -- for their low - income family assistance programs than they would have had under the previous welfare programs ; states are transforming the nation 's welfare system into a work - focused , temporary assistance program for needy families and generally chose to spend these resources to expand programs and benefits by shifting the emphasis from entitlement to self - sufficiency , enhancing support services , and increasing work participation rates ; states also have achieved budgetary savings by reducing state funds to the statutory maintenance - of - effort level of 75 or 80 percent of previous state spending levels ; while states have gained greater resources under the block grant , they also take greater responsibilities for fiscal risks should program costs increase in the future ; most states , including 7 of the 10 gao visited , also have a general fund budget stabilization or rainy day funds that could be used to augment program spending during an economic downturn , but welfare programs would have to compete for these resources with other state funding priorities ; the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwora ) includes features that could provide federal funding to cover future increases in program needs ; states can carry forward unused tanf funds without fiscal year limitation ; as of september 30 , 1997 , states had left about $ 1.2 billion in unspent balances in their accounts with the u.s treasury , or about 9 percent of the total grant ; it is unclear whether these balances will remain , shrink , or increase as states gain experience with the problem ; prwora also creates two federal safety - net mechanisms -- the contingency fund and the loan fund -- that were designed to provide states with access to additional funds during times of economic downturn or fiscal stress ; as of february 1998 , neither the contingency nor the loan funds had been used by any state ; officials in states gao visited said they did not view the contingency fund as a viable source of additional resources ; and officials in many states gao visited indicated they did not believe their states would borrow from the loan fund during an economic downturn .
the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , through the federal housing administration ( fha ) , insures billions of dollars in home mortgage loans made by private lenders . hud 's 2020 management reform plan , issued in 1997 , sought to downsize and reform the agency , including its single - family mortgage insurance program . as part of its 2020 plan , hud consolidated the single - family program 's field activities at four new regional homeownership centers and specified resources for the centers . although hud has substantially streamlined fha 's single - family mortgage insurance programs , human capital issues remain a concern . this report reviews hud 's implementation of the homeownership center concept under the 2020 plan , focusing on the deployment of center staff , the training provided to the center staff , and the centers ' monitoring of contractors . gao found that nearly half of the centers ' staff remain in 71 field offices across the country , even though hud envisioned that only a third of the staff would stay in the field offices . the deployment of staff across the centers is not consistent with their workload , and , as a result , the centers are having trouble supervising and making effective use of staff . gao also found that hud has not developed a standardized training curriculum for center staff . the centers have had difficulty using their training funds effectively because hud provided them late in the fiscal year and then pulled back some funds before they could be used . finally , increased responsibilities and staff shortage have caused the centers to expand their use of contractors . however , the centers ' ability to monitor contractors has not kept pace with their growing reliance on them .
visitor centers at the national parks are among the most important facilities run by the national park service . as existing visitor centers age and new parks are created , renovated or new facilities are needed . this report discusses the number , the status , and the reasons for park service visitor center projects ; whether the projects involve new construction or the renovation of existing buildings ; whether these projects were designated priorities by the park service or by congress ; the costs and functions of the projects ; and the funding sources for the projects . gao found that from 1996 through 2005 , the park service has completed or planned 80 projects to renovate or build new visitor centers . the renovations and new construction are intended to replace aging facilities and exhibits , to provide more space , and to handle rising numbers of visitors . of the 80 projects , 53 were a priority of the park service and 27 were a priority of congress . the park service estimates that the total cost of the 80 projects will be $ 542 million . the visitor center projects are funded primarily by the park service 's appropriated funds . other funding sources include private partnerships and fee demonstrations .
the military 's ability to carry out its mission depends on its having adequate supplies of spare parts on hand for maintenance and repairs . shortages are a key indicator that the billions of dollars being spent on these parts are not being used effectively , efficiently , and economically . despite additional funding from congress , the army still has concerns about spare parts shortages . spare parts shortages for the apache , blackhawk , and chinook helicopters have harmed operations and lowered morale among maintenance personnel . cannibalization of parts from one aircraft to another is an inefficient practice that results in double work for the maintenance personnel , masks parts shortages , and lowers morale . parts were unavailable for various reasons , including higher - than - expected demand for parts , delays in obtaining parts from contractors , and problems with overhaul and maintenance . another factor contributing to the shortage was the army 's inability to obtain parts for these aging aircraft from the original manufacturers , which sometimes had gone out of business . the army and the defense logistics agency have efforts planned or underway to improve the availability of aviation spare parts . once these initiatives are further along , gao will review them to determine whether they can be enhanced .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) effort to modernize information technology ( it ) at its field service centers , focusing on : usda 's plans and ongoing efforts , including estimated costs , to modernize it for its service centers ; and any significant risks in these plans and ongoing efforts . gao noted that : usda 's service center it modernization effort , as currently being planned , will be the biggest , most costly , and complex in the department 's history ; it involves projects to : develop new business processes ; acquire and install telecommunications equipment ; acquire , implement , and maintain a common computing environment at about 3,100 locations ; and acquire and develop geospatial data ; usda 's life - cycle cost estimates show that the department could ultimately spend more than $ 3 billion for these projects by 2011 ; the department reported spending about $ 145 million since starting its service center it modernization in 1996 , and plans to spend over $ 200 million more during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 ; usda 's multibillion dollar undertaking faces significant risks ; specifically : usda continues to acquire new technology before it has reengineered business processes for providing one - stop service in all of its service centers ; usda is not managing its it - related projects for its service centers as investments , using cost , benefit , risk , and performance information to select , control , and evaluate projects throughout their life - cycle ; usda has not completed a comprehensive plan identifying critical milestones , project dependencies , and resources required for the modernization ; in acquiring technology , usda is not following an incremental approach that uses cost justifications and performance measures for each increment to reduce risks associated with large - scale acquisitions or projects ; and usda lacks the project management structure needed to manage a modernization of this magnitude ; specifically , usda has not assigned a senior - level official with overall responsibility , authority , and accountability for managing and coordinating the separate , service center it modernization projects and for ensuring that the clinger - cohen mandates have been met and that critical tasks are completed on time and within budget ; as a result of these risks , even after spending billions of dollars on its service center it modernization , the department may not obtain an adequate return on its investment , meet the needs of its customers , or achieve the secretary of agriculture 's vision of one - stop service ; and many of the weaknesses gao identified are similar to those that caused usda 's earlier info share program , which cost more than $ 100 million , to fail .
the environmental protection agency ( epa ) performs limited oversight of states ' processes for verifying the accuracy of large industrial facilities ' emissions reports . epa 's data show that most emissions determinations from large sources are based on generic emissions factors . although epa allows facilities to estimate their emissions in this manner , epa officials generally consider direct methods to be more reliable . the accuracy of these reports is important because they influence the financing of states ' regulatory programs through fees and the development of emissions inventories , which , in turn , help regulators to develop control strategies and establish permit limits . furthermore , steps taken to assess the accuracy of these reports , such as more thoroughly reviewing the supporting information , could improve compliance with clean air act requirements . for example , a more thorough review of the information underlying a facility 's emission reports , or a more systematic comparison of these reports over time , could identify increased emissions . such indications could , in turn , trigger a review of compliance with new source review requirements , an area in which epa found widespread noncompliance in four industries . in the four states that gao reviewed , the states that had done the most detailed reviews found widespread inaccuracies . although it is taking steps to improve its overall compliance monitoring strategy , epa does not plan to evaluate states ' processes for verifying emissions reports from large facilities .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the defense business operations fund 's ( dbof ) cash management practices , focusing on : department of defense ( dod ) efforts to manage cash ; and ways dod could provide additional management oversight . gao found that : dbof cash management problems persist and reflect long - standing dod financial management weaknesses ; dbof managers do not have timely , accurate , and complete data on individual business areas ' cash balances and do not fully disclose adjustments to account balances in their monthly financial reports ; the defense finance and accounting service consistently has the most severe problems in accurately accounting for and reporting the navy 's cash balances , but it is developing reporting procedures to identify monthly cash balances in each business area ; collection and disbursement data can not be provided more promptly until dbof financial systems and processes are improved ; dod continues to rely on advance billing to supply cash for day - to - day operations , but billing and collection problems have resulted in billions of dollars in outstanding accounts receivable ; dod needs to enhance accountability and employ tools to effectively manage its cash to prevent inaccurate , untimely , and incomplete cash balances , collections , and disbursements when new financial systems are implemented ; and if cash management practices do not change , dod could require excessive cash amounts to maintain ongoing dbof operations , violate the antideficiency act , and limit its opportunities to fulfill dbof objectives .
more than half the estimated 220 million acres of marshes , bogs , swamps , and other wetlands in the united states during the colonial times , have disappeared , and others have become degraded . this decline is due , primarily , to farming and development . developers whose projects may harm wetlands must , according to environmental regulations , first avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to wetlands to the extent practicable . if harmful impacts are unavoidable , the developer must compensate by restoring a former wetland , enhancing a degraded wetland , creating a new wetland , or preserving an existing wetland . such mitigation efforts can occur under the following three types of arrangements : mitigation banks , under which for - profit companies restore wetlands under army corps of engineers agreements and then sell credits for these wetlands to developers ; in - lieu - fee arrangements under which developers pay public or non - profit organizations fees for establishing wetland areas , usually under formal corps agreements ; and ad hoc arrangements , under which developers pay individuals or companies to perform the mitigation . this report , determines the extent to which the in - lieu - fee option has been used to mitigate adverse impacts to wetlands , the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its intended purpose of mitigating such impacts , and in - lieu - fee organizations compete with mitigation banks for developers ' mitigation business . this report also discusses the use of ad hoc arrangements as a mitigation option . most of the arrangements were designed to use fees received from developers to restore , enhance , or preserve wetlands , with a few arrangements designed to allow wetlands to be created . during fiscal years 1998 through 2000 , developers used the in - lieu - fee option to fulfill mitigation requirements for more than 580 acres of adversely affected wetlands , and paid more than $ 39.5 million to in - lieu - fee organizations . the extent to which the in - lieu - fee option has achieved its purpose of mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands is uncertain . although corps officials in 11 of the 17 districts with the in - lieu - fee option said that the number of wetland acres restored , enhanced , created , or preserved by in - lieu - fee organizations equaled or exceeded the number of wetland acres adversely affected , data submitted by more than half of those districts did not support these claims . officials in 9 of the 17 districts said that functions and economic values lost from the adversely affected wetlands were replaced at the same level or better through in - lieu - fee mitigation , but officials in more than half of those districts also acknowledged that they have not tried to assess whether mitigation efforts have been ecologically successful . as a result , the corps can not be certain that in - lieu - fee mitigation has been effective . corps district officials in 9 of the 17 districts with the in - lieu - fee option said that organization and mitigation banks were competing with each other by providing similar mitigation services in the same geographic area . no competition existed in 5 of the 17 districts because either no mitigation banks were available , or in - lieu - fee organizations and mitigation banks provided different services , or served different geographic areas . gao found that hoc arrangements typically were for one - time projects without a formal agreement . oversight of mitigation affairs was lacking in almost half of the districts using such arrangements . corps districts disagreed on whether responsibility for the ecological success of ad hoc mitigation rests with the ad hoc fund recipient or the developer .
to deter illegal entry between the nation 's ports of entry , the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) developed its southwest border strategy . ins has spent seven years implementing the border strategy , but it may take ins up to a decade longer to fully implement the strategy . this assumes that ins obtains the level of staff , technology , equipment , and fencing it believes it needs to control the southwest border . although illegal alien apprehensions have shifted , there is no clear indication that overall illegal entry into the united states along the southwestern border has declined . ins ' current efforts to measure the effectiveness of its border control efforts could be enhanced by analyzing the data in its automated biometric identification system ( ident ) . these data offer ins an opportunity to develop additional performance indicators that could be incorporated into its annual performance plan review process and could help ins assess whether its border control efforts are associated with an overall reduction in the flow of illegal aliens across the border . borderwide analysis of the ident data could be used to address several important questions related to illegal entry . the strategy 's impact on local communities has been affected by the timing of ins , infusion of agent and other resources intended to protect the local community from a surge in illegal alien traffic ; what routes the illegal aliens have used in crossing the border ; and ins ' involvement with the community . ins has learned the importance of outreach efforts in attempting to mitigate the potential negative effects the strategy can cause a community and the harm that can befall illegal aliens who risk injury and death to cross the border .
the u.s. tax system is based on voluntary reporting . the internal revenue service ( irs ) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with tax laws governing this voluntary system . despite these efforts , each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid , which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs , higher tax rates , or both . there are three types of voluntary compliance measures : filing compliance , which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner ; payment compliance , which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner ; and reporting compliance , which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns . this report reviews the status of irs ' plans to measure voluntary reporting compliance as well as six other federal programs that currently measure voluntary compliance . gao found that irs has tried to develop an approach for measuring voluntary compliance . it has established objectives and guiding principles for developing this measure as well as developed database software to collect and analyze data . as of march 2001 , irs ' preliminary draft plan included four alternatives for measuring voluntary reporting compliance . gao found that each of the six programs measure compliance by gathering different types and amounts of information from a random sample of clients . sample sizes range from about 1,400 to more than 500,000 annually . in all but one program , clients are randomly selected and interviewed in person .
according to the navy , the primary purpose of forward - deployed naval forces is to project power from the sea to influence events ashore . to be successful , naval forces must be able to gain access to , and operate in the coastal areas of potential adversaries . consequently , they must be able to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines and other antiship weapons . finally , they must be able to launch and support offensive operations against enemy forces ashore . this report assesses the navy 's existing mine countermeasures , antisubmarine warfare , ship self - defense , surface fire support capabilities , and progress in the acquisition programs the navy is pursuing to address shortfalls in these areas . gao found that the navy 's current force of specialized ships , helicopters , and other assets developed to detect and neutralize enemy sea mines lack several key warfighting capabilities it needs for shoreline operations . although the navy is making some progress in overcoming shortfalls in antisubmarine warfare , a lack of resources and priorities among competing programs persists . the navy 's ship defense capabilities against cruise missiles are marginal , and surface ships will be at risk when operating within the range of these weapons . the navy will not meet the marine corps ' naval surface fire support requirements for at least another decade . the navy has shown limited progress in overcoming shortfalls in the acquisition programs it is pursuing .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the background and training of key financial personnel at 34 of the largest private corporations and 19 of the largest state governments in the united states , focusing on : education , work experience , training , and professional certifications of their key management personnel ; and training and qualification requirements for these personnel . gao noted that : while a majority of fortune 100 and state government financial management personnel held undergraduate degrees in accounting or other business fields , personnel in chief financial officer ( cfo ) and controller positions were more likely to also hold advanced degrees ; in both sectors , managers and supervisors of financial analysis were more likely to hold advanced degrees than their counterparts in financial reporting and accounting operations ; in the fortune 100 companies , the most common advanced degree was a master of business administration ( mba ) ; in state governments , mbas and other master 's degrees were both prevalent ; accounting , auditing , and systems experience of financial management personnel averaged about 14 years for fortune 100 companies and about 20 years for state government organizations ; for each sector , the majority of the work experience was in corporate or governmental accounting and finance , respectively ; combined experience in public accounting , internal auditing , and accounting systems design and maintenance averaged 2.5 years for the fortune 100 respondents and about 4 years for the state government respondents ; these fields often provide personnel with a broad base of experience with accounting , and other organizationwide issues ; continuing professional education training was encouraged in fortune 100 and state government organizations responding to gao 's survey ; on average , fortune 100 and state government financial management personnel completed about 26 to 31 hours of training , respectively , in 1996 ; respondents from both groups received the majority of their training in technical accounting subjects ; about 70 percent of fortune 100 respondents and 45 percent of state government respondents set aside from 1 to 2 percent of their budgets for financial management staff salaries and benefits to train these staff each year ; as for professional certifications , over 40 percent of the fortune 100 and about 30 percent of the state controllers and managers and supervisors of financial reporting were certified public accountants ; and in addition , about 10 percent of state government personnel , across positions , were certified government financial managers .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the denver international airport 's ( dia ) financial condition , focusing on dia : cash reserves and estimated cash flows ; and ability to meet its financial obligations . gao found that : predicting the future financial performance of dia is difficult , since it has been operating for less than 1 year ; the difficulties in projecting dia financial performance relate to the volatility of the airline industry , unexpected construction delays and costs , and the city of denver 's ability to repay airport investors ; the securities and exchange commission is formally investigating the adequacy of the city 's disclosure of information in bond documents with respect to delays in opening the airport ; there is no evidence that dia will be unable to meet its financial obligations , since dia has generated positive cash flows in its first 6 months of operation despite operating at well below capacity ; dia debt service costs are expected to remain stable over the next 30 years , while operating and maintenance costs are expected to rise with inflation ; and as of september 1995 , dia had an operating cash balance of $ 57 million and held $ 420 million in reserve funds , of which $ 260 million could be used in the event of a financial crisis .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao evaluated the department of the interior 's high - level implementation plan for improving its management of the indian trust funds and resources under its control , focusing on whether the interior has reasonable assurance that : the high - level plan provides an effective solution for addressing its long - standing problems ; and its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs . gao noted that : interior does not have reasonable assurance that its high - level plan for improving indian trust operations provides an effective solution for addressing long - standing management weaknesses ; the plan : recognizes the severity of long - standing weaknesses in managing trust fund assets ; identifies 13 projects intended to improve information systems , enhance the accuracy and completeness of its data regarding the ownership and lease of indian lands , and address deficiencies with respect to records management , training , policy and procedures , and internal controls ; and assigns responsibility for oversight and management of the 13 projects ; however , interior has not properly analyzed its information technology needs which are essential to the overall success of the plan ; until interior develops an information systems architecture addressing all of its trust management functions , it can not ensure that its information systems will not be duplicative or incompatible or will optimally support its needs across all business areas ; interior also does not know whether its acquisition of a new service for managing indian assets and land records will cost - effectively meet trust management needs ; before deciding to contract with a service vendor , interior did not adequately define important service requirements or sufficiently analyze technical alternatives ; interior also did not take the steps needed to minimize acquisition risks ; in particular , it did not develop a risk management plan , ensure that the vendor 's system could work with interior 's data and systems , or establish realistic project timeframes ; and thus , interior faces an unnecessarily high risk that the service will not meet its general business and specific performance needs , and it lacks the means for dealing with this risk .
this report examines the working capital fund activities for the department of defense ( dod ) . gao identifies potential changes in current management processes or policies that , if made , would result in a more efficient operation and evaluates various aspects of the dod policy that allow defense working capital fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next . gao found that dod lacks a sound analytical basis for its current 3-month carryover standard . dod established a 3-month carryover standard for most working capital fund activity groups , although it has not done the analysis necessary to support the 3-month standard . without a validation process , neither dod nor congressional decisionmakers can be sure that the 3-month standard is providing activity groups with reasonable amounts of carryover to ensure a smooth transition from one fiscal year to the next or whether the carryover is excessive . in addition , carryover information currently reported under the 3-month standard is not comparable between services and is misleading to dod and congressional decisionmakers . specifically , results can differ markedly because the military services use different methods to calculate the number of months of carryover . further complicating the congressional budget review of carryovers is that some activity groups have underestimated their budgeted carryover year after year , thereby providing decisionmakers with misleading year - end carryover information and resulting in more funding being provided than was intended . gao also reviewed the potential financial impact of reducing the amount of fiscal year - end carryover permitted by dod policy . gao 's analysis showed that if a 30-day , 60-day or 75-day carryover policy had been in effect during the fiscal year 2001 budget review process , the amount of budgeted customer orders could have been reduced by about $ 2.9 billion , $ 1.6 billion , or $ 1.0 billion , respectively .
the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan have the potential for focusing the department 's missions , but these efforts are compromised in several areas . usda 's goals and measures are too general to give insight into what usda is actually trying to achieve . it is difficult to assess usda 's progress when it uses unrealistic goals to achieve strategic outcomes and when it uses untimely data that has not been consistently verified . in two areas -- strategic human capital management and information security -- progress in measuring usda 's performance has been frustrated by the lack of goals and measures for identified issues . finally , by not sharing information about the major management challenges identified by its own inspector general , usda 's agencies miss the opportunity to develop strategies and plans to respond to these issues .
kyrgyzstan is a small and poor central asian country that gained independence in 1991 with the breakup of the soviet union . the united states has been interested in helping kyrgyzstan to enhance its sovereignty and territorial integrity , bolster economic reform and development , strengthen human rights , prevent weapons proliferation , and more effectively combat transnational terrorism and trafficking in persons and narcotics . special attention long has been placed on bolstering civil society and democratization in what has appeared to be the most receptive — but still challenging — political and social environment in central asia . the significance of kyrgyzstan to the united states increased after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the united states . kyrgyzstan offered to host u.s. forces at an airbase at the manas international airport outside of the capital , bishkek , and it opened in december 2001. the u.s. military repaired and later upgraded the air field for aerial refueling , airlift and airdrop , medical evacuation , and support for u.s. and coalition personnel and cargo transiting in and out of afghanistan . the kyrgyz government threatened to close down the airbase in early 2009 , but renewed the lease on the airbase ( renamed the manas transit center ) in june 2009 after the united states agreed to higher lease and other payments . president almazbek atambayev and the legislature have stated that the basing agreement will not be renewed when it expires in 2014. as of 2013 , the manas transit center reports that it hosts about 1,500 u.s. troops and u.s. contractors and a fleet of kc - 135 refueling tankers and c - 17 transport aircraft . besides hosting the manas transit center , kyrgyzstan also participates as part of the northern distribution network for the transit of military supplies to and from afghanistan . cumulative u.s. budgeted assistance to kyrgyzstan for fy1992-fy2010 was $ 1.22 billion ( all agencies and programs ) . kyrgyzstan ranks third in such aid per capita among the soviet successor states , indicative of u.s. government and congressional support in the early 1990s for its apparent progress in making reforms and more recently to support anti - terrorism , border protection , and operations in afghanistan . after an april 2010 coup in kyrgyzstan and ethnic violence in june 2010 in the south of the country , the united states committed about $ 90 million in urgent humanitarian and other assistance in addition to appropriated foreign assistance . foreign assistance was $ 41.36 million in fy2011 and $ 47.399 million in fy2012 . the administration has requested $ 51.82 million for fy2014 . country totals for fy2013 are not yet available .
pursuant to congressional requests , gao reviewed , in conjunction with the department of defense 's ( dod ) inspector general ( ig ) , dod efforts to reduce problem disbursements and its implementation of a statutory requirement to match each disbursement exceeding $ 5 million to the appropriate obligation before the disbursement is made . gao found that : dod reduced its problem disbursements from $ 37.8 billion to $ 23.1 billion as of september 1995 ; dod disbursement problems persist due to long - standing system weaknesses and dod failure to comply with basic accounting procedures for validating , reconciling , and reporting transactions ; dod has automated the prevalidation process for the defense finance and accounting service 's ( dfas ) columbus center contract payment system and eight other primary contract accounting systems to handle their large volume of transactions ; there are deficiencies in the automated programs for prevalidating army and air force disbursements ; dod has lowered the prevalidation threshold to $ 1 million for all disbursement centers except dfas - columbus ; this limited implementation hampers dod ability to resolve its disbursement problems , since dfas - columbus is responsible for about 40 percent of dod contractor and vendor payments ; from july 1995 through january 1996 , dfas - columbus prevalidated only about one - third of the total dollar amount of its disbursements ; and to resolve disbursement problems , dod needs to prevalidate as many transactions as practical , further lower the prevalidation threshold , and follow basic accounting procedures until it has corrected serious weaknesses in its accounting and contracting systems .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation 's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation . billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system . although it is not fully known at this time what actually occurred or what all the weaknesses in the nation 's aviation security apparatus are that contributed to the horrendous terrorist acts of semptember 11 , 2001 , it is clear that serious weaknesses exist in the nation 's aviation security system and that their impact can be far more devastating than previously imagined . there are security concerns with airport access controls , passenger and carry - on baggage screening , and alternatives to current screening practices , including practices in selected other countries . controls for limiting access to secure areas , including aircraft , have not always worked as intended . in may of 2000 , special agents used counterfeit law enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas at two airports , bypassing security checkpoints and walking unescorted to aircraft departure gates . in june 2000 , testing of screeners showed that significant , long - standing weaknesses -- measured by the screeners ' abilities to detect threat objects located on passengers or contained in their carry - on luggage -- continue to exist . more recent results show that as tests more closely approximate how a terrorist might attempt to penetrate a checkpoint -- screeners ' performance declines significantly . weaknesses in screening and controlling access to secure are as have left questions concerning alternative approaches . in assessing alternatives , respondents identified five important criteria : improving screening performance , establishing accountability , ensuring cooperation among stakeholders , moving people efficiently , and minimizing legal and liability issues .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of defense 's ( dod ) efforts to improve the defense integration support tools ( dist ) database , which serves as the dod inventory of automated information systems and is intended to be used as a tool to help dod components in addressing year 2000 date problems . gao noted that : a critical step in solving the year 2000 problem is to conduct an enterprisewide inventory of information systems for each business area to establish the necessary foundation for year 2000 program planning ; a thorough inventory also ensures that all systems are identified and linked to a specific business area or process , and that all enterprisewide cross - boundary systems are considered ; in addition , the inventory can play a critical role in the later stages of year 2000 correction ; for dod , this inventory is particularly important given the tens of thousands of systems and the many interfaces between systems owned by the services and dod agencies and considering that these systems vary widely in their importance in carrying out dod missions ; in such a complex system environment , the inventory helps facilitate information technology resource and trade - off decisions ; the office of the assistant secretary for command , control , communications and intelligence ( asd / c3i ) and defense information systems agency ( disa ) have recognized that , at present , dist , the department 's enterprisewide inventory , is not a reliable and accurate tool for managing dod 's year 2000 effort ; as a result , the office of the asd / c3i and disa have initiated efforts to : improve the integrity of dist inventory information ; facilitate access to information within the database ; and ensure that services and components input information needed to complete the inventory ; however , given the pace at which these efforts have been proceeding , gao does not believe that dist will be usable and reliable in time to have a beneficial impact on year 2000 correction efforts ; without a complete inventory , the department as a whole can not adequately assess departmentwide progress toward correcting the year 2000 problem and address crosscutting issues -- such as whether system interfaces are being properly handled and whether there is a need for additional testing facilities ; and thus , the office of the asd / c3i and disa need to expedite efforts to complete the dist inventory before substantial renovation efforts begin in the services and components , and ensure that the information in dist is accurate , complete , reliable , and usable .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed its observations on the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) efforts to carry out its responsibilities to set policy and oversee the management of the executive branch , focusing on : omb 's wide - ranging management responsibilities and the question of whether to integrate or separate management and budget functions ; the effectiveness of omb 's management leadership ; and the factors that appear to contribute to progress in sustaining improvements in federal management . gao noted that : omb is the lead agency for overseeing a statutory framework of financial , information resources , and performance planning and measurement reforms designed to instill a performance - based approach to federal management , decisionmaking , and accountability ; the chief financial officers act of 1990 mandated significant financial management reforms and established the deputy director for management ( ddm ) position within omb ; the ddm is to serve as the government 's key official for financial management and coordinate and supervise a wide range of general management functions ; omb is responsible for providing guidance and oversight for various other laws and executive orders as well ; omb 's perennial challenge is to carry out its central management leadership responsibilities in such a way that leverages opportunities of the budget process , while at the same time ensuring that management concerns receive appropriate attention in an environment driven by budget and policy decisions ; prior omb reorganizations have alternated between seeking to more directly integrate management into the budget review process and creating separate management offices ; previous congressional and omb attempts to elevate the status of management by creating separate management units within omb sought to ensure that an adequate level of effort was focused on management issues ; omb has focused increased attention on management issues , but there is much more that needs to be done ; omb should ensure that agencies incorporate appropriate goals and strategies in their annual performance plans and describe their relevance to achieving the priority management objectives described in the governmentwide performance plan ; the record of omb 's stewardship of management initiatives suggests that creating and sustaining attention to management improvement is a key to addressing the federal government 's longstanding problems ; in the past , management issues often remained subordinated to budget concerns and timeframes , and the leverage the budget could offer to advance management efforts was not directly used to address management issues ; and continued improvement in omb 's strategic plans would provide congressional decisionmakers with better information to use in determining the extent to which omb is addressing its statutory management and budgetary responsibilities , as well as in assessing omb 's contributions toward achieving desired results .
medicare provides valuable and extensive health care coverage for beneficiaries . nevertheless , significant gaps leave some beneficiaries vulnerable to sizeable financial burdens from out - of - pocket expenses . medigap is a widely available source of supplemental coverage . this testimony discusses beneficiaries ' potential financial liability under medicare 's current benefit structure and cost - sharing requirements , the cost of medigap policies and the extent to which they provide additional coverage , and concerns that medigap 's so - called `` first dollar '' coverage undermines the cost control incentives of medicare 's cost - sharing requirements . gao found that medicare 's benefits package and cost - sharing requirements leave beneficiaries liable for high out - of - pocket costs . medigap policies pay for some or all medicare cost - sharing requirements but do not fully protect beneficiaries from potentially significant out - of - pocket costs such as prescription drug coverage . medigap first - dollar coverage eliminates the ability of medicare 's cost - sharing requirements to promote prudent use of services .
gao reviewed selected data collection and reporting requirements of the 1990 clean air act amendments , focusing on whether : the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) planned state emissions reporting requirements exceed its program needs ; and states use the epa aerometric information retrieval system ( airs ) to monitor emissions data . gao found that : epa draft regulation would have required states to submit emissions data that exceeded its minimum air pollution program needs and to develop complicated pollutant databases that they could not afford ; epa has since suspended the regulation and is considering alternative reporting options ; despite epa intentions , 9 of the 10 heavy emission states use their own independently developed systems to track air pollution emissions ; and the state tracking systems are more efficient and easier to use than airs .
this testimony discusses the government performance and results act ( gpra ) of 1993. during the last decade , congress , the office of management and budget , and executive agencies have worked to implement a statutory framework to improve the performance and accountability of the executive branch and to enhance executive branch and congressional decisionmaking . the core of this framework includes financial management legislation , especially gpra . as a result of this framework , there has been substantial progress in the last few years in establishing the basic infrastructure needed to create high - performing federal organizations . the issuance of agencies ' fiscal year 2000 performance reports , in addition to updated strategic plans , annual performance plans , and the governmentwide performance plans , completes two full cycles of annual performance planning and reporting under gpra . however , much work remains before this framework is effectively implemented across the government , including transforming agencies ' organizational cultures to improve decisionmaking and strengthen performance and accountability .
the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) includes severalenvironment - related provisions , that while limited , were unprecedented for their inclusion in a trade agreement . however , furtherenvironmental ( and labor ) assurances were needed to secure passage of nafta , and ultimately , the negotiatingparties agreed to aside accord that promotes cooperation on environmental matters and includes provisions to address a party 's failureto enforceenvironmental laws . additionally , the united states and mexico entered into the border environmentalcooperation agreement ( beca ) , which authorized the establishment of the border environment cooperation commission ( becc ) and thenorth americandevelopment bank ( nadb ) to help border communities finance environmental infrastructure projects . in the 108th congress , nafta 's environmental provisions and related institutions have continuedto receive attention . a key issuehas concerned the effectiveness of the nadb and the becc , and especially the bank 's ability to finance projects.enacted on april5 , 2004 , p.l . 108-215 ( h.r . 254 ) authorizes several operational reforms to the nadb . other issues involvetheenvironmental impact of nafta , and the effect that nafta and its environmental side agreement have had onthe negotiation ofother u.s. trade agreements , including the u.s. - central america free trade agreement ( cafta ) and u.s. - chilefta . this reportbriefly reviews nafta 's environmental provisions , associated agreements , and related issues and congressionalactions . it will beupdated .
an adequate level of dissolved oxygen is necessary to support most forms of aquatic life . while very low levels of dissolved oxygen ( hypoxia ) can be natural , especially in deep ocean basins and fjords , hypoxia in coastal waters is mostly the result of human activities that have modified landscapes or increased nutrients entering these waters . hypoxic areas are more widespread during the summer , when algal blooms stimulated by spring runoff decompose to diminish oxygen . such hypoxic areas may drive out or kill animal life , and usually dissipate by winter . in many places where hypoxia has occurred previously , it is now more severe and longer lasting ; in others where hypoxia did not exist historically , it now does , and these areas are becoming more prevalent . the largest hypoxic area affecting the united states is in the northern gulf of mexico near the mouth of the mississippi river , but there are others as well . most u.s. coastal estuaries and many developed nearshore areas suffer from varying degrees of hypoxia , causing various environmental damages . research has been conducted to better identify the human activities that affect the intensity and duration of , as well as the area affected by , hypoxic events , and to begin formulating control strategies . near the end of the 105th congress , the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act of 1998 was signed into law as title vi of p.l . 105-383. provisions of this act authorize appropriations through noaa for research , monitoring , education , and management activities to prevent , reduce , and control hypoxia . under this legislation , an integrated gulf of mexico hypoxia assessment was completed in the late 1990s . in 2004 , title i of p.l . 108-456 , the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia amendments act of 2004 , expanded this authority and reauthorized appropriations through fy2008 . legislation has been introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize and amend the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act . as knowledge and understanding have increased concerning the possible impacts of hypoxia , congressional interest in monitoring and addressing the problem has grown . the issue of hypoxia is seen as a search for ( 1 ) increased scientific knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon , as well as ( 2 ) cost - effective actions that might diminish the size of hypoxic areas by changing practices that promote their growth and development . this report presents an overview of the causes of hypoxia , the u.s. areas of most concern , federal legislation , and relevant federal research programs . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
no provision in the u.s. constitution expressly establishes a procedure for public access to executive branch records or meetings . congress , however , has legislated various public access laws . among these laws are two records access statutes , the freedom of information act ( foia ; 5 u.s.c . §552 ) , and the privacy act ( 5 u.s.c . §552a ) , and two meetings access statutes , the federal advisory committee act ( faca ; 5 u.s.c . app . ) , and the government in the sunshine act ( 5 u.s.c . §552b ) . these four laws provide the foundation for access to executive branch information in the american federal government . the records - access statutes provide the public with a variety of methods to examine how executive branch departments and agencies execute their missions . the meeting - access statutes provide the public the opportunity to participate in and inform the policy process . these four laws are also among the most used and most litigated federal access laws . while the four statutes provide the public with access to executive branch federal records and meetings , they do not apply to the legislative or judicial branches of the u.s. government . the american separation of powers model of government provides a collection of formal and informal methods that the branches can use to provide information to one another . moreover , the separation of powers anticipates conflicts over the accessibility of information . these conflicts are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive . although there is considerable interbranch cooperation in the sharing of information and records , such conflicts over access may continue on occasion . this report offers an introduction to the four access laws and provides citations to additional resources related to these statutes . this report includes statistics on the use of foia and faca and on litigation related to foia . the 114th congress may have an interest in overseeing the implementation of these laws or may consider amending the laws . in addition , this report provides some examples of the methods congress , the president , and the courts have employed to provide or require the provision of information to one another . this report is a primer on information access in the u.s. federal government and provides a list of resources related to transparency , secrecy , access , and nondisclosure .
the large influx of immigrants in recent decades has led to an equally long debate over their effect on the labor market outcomes of native - born workers . economic theory posits that an increase in the supply of labor , such as from immigration , will reduce the wage employers are willing to pay all workers ( native - born and foreign - born ) in a given labor market . as a result , some of the workers who had been earning a higher wage before the increase in labor supply will be unwilling to accept a lower wage and they will leave that labor market . the economic model assumes , however , that labor is homogenous . but , workers enter the united states possessing different skill levels and they therefore will compete with ( i.e . , put downward wage pressure on ) native - born workers possessing very similar skill levels . economists have conducted empirical studies to measure the labor market effects of immigration that take into account the skill composition of foreign - born vis - à - vis native - born workers . they have employed two different approaches to do so . the concentration of foreign - born workers in certain cities and skill groups led some economists to posit that immigration 's greatest impact would be felt by similarly skilled native - born workers living in those areas . studies thus have compared differences in labor market outcomes between native - born workers who live in high - versus low - immigrant areas and who most often compete for jobs with foreign - born workers ; given the composition of the recent immigrant flow , these would be low - skilled u.s. workers . most inter - area analyses have found scant evidence that foreign - born labor adversely affects the labor market prospects of u.s. workers in general . a few cross - city studies have estimated a slight negative impact on low - skilled natives . other economists have argued that the cross - city approach underestimates immigration 's consequences because it assumes that labor , capital , and goods do not rapidly adjust to the immigration - induced increase in the supply of labor . if , for example , native - born competitors quickly leave labor markets in high - immigrant areas , their movements would spread any wage effects due to immigration across the nation , and thereby make it difficult for spatially based research to detect any impact . some analysts , therefore , have concluded that immigration 's labor market effects can best be identified by examining data at the national level . for many years , national studies estimated that immigration in the short - run substantially reduced the wages of native - born workers in each skill ( education - experience ) group . native - born workers who lacked a high school diploma were determined to be the most severely affected . more recent national studies have estimated the adverse wage effect of immigration in the short - run to be much smaller , even among the least skilled . the different results in part stem from the finding that workers with at most a high school degree are close substitutes for workers without a degree , which dampens the competitive effect of immigration on the least skilled workers . a 2009 study that utilized cross - city data similarly estimated that the two groups do not compete with one another ; as a result , any adverse effect of low - skilled immigrants is not concentrated on the relatively few native - born workers who are high school dropouts .
the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act ( prwpra ) of 1996 changed the nation 's cash assistance program for needy families with children . the former program , aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) , was replaced with the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , which provides states with $ 16.5 billion each year through 2002 to serve this population . tanf 's goals include ending the dependence of needy families on government benefits by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage ; preventing and reducing the incidence of nonmarital pregnancies ; and encouraging two - parent families . prwora expanded the scope of services that could potentially be contracted out , such as determining eligibility for tanf , which had traditionally been done by government employees . moreover , with the large drop in tanf caseloads nationally , a greater share of federal tanf block grant funds and state funds is now devoted to various support services that are typically contracted out . although prwora expanded the flexibility of states to design and administer tanf programs , its also limited the ability of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to regulate states ' tanf programs . contracting with nongovernmental entities to provide tanf - funded services occurs in almost every state and exceeds $ 1.5 billion in federal tanf and state maintenance - of - effort funds for 2001. hhs relies primarily on state single audit reports to oversee tanf contracting by states and localities . their regional offices follow up on the tanf deficiencies identified by these reports , and hhs focuses on reported deficiencies that involve unallowable or questionable costs . however , hhs does not know the extent and nature of problems pertaining to the oversight of nongovernmental tanf contractors that have been cited by state single audits because they do not analyze the reports in a comprehensive manner . state and local governments rely on third parties to help ensure compliance with bid solicitation and contract award procedures , including bid protests , judicial processes , and external audits . state and local government agencies use various approaches to oversee tanf contractors , and problems have been identified with both contract oversight and contractor performance . state and local governments have primary responsibility for overseeing tanf contractors , and they rely on various approaches , including reviewing contractor - provided information and performing on - site reviews . however , auditors in four of the six states identified deficiencies in state or local oversight of tanf contractors , such as uneven oversight by local contracting agencies .
because of internal control weaknesses , the department of education 's student financial assistance programs are at high risk for fraud or erroneous payments . gao discovered fraud in the grant and loan areas and pervasive control breakdowns and improper payments in other areas . controls over grant and loan disbursements lacked a key edit check or follow - up process that would identify schools improperly disbursing pell grants . significant internal control weaknesses over education 's third party drafts also increased the department 's vulnerability . gao found that individual education employees could control the entire payment process for third party drafts . education employees also circumvented a key computerized control designed to prevent duplicate payments . education eliminated third party drafts in may 2001. inconsistent and inadequate authorization and review processes for purchase cards , combined with a lack of monitoring , meant that improper purchases were unlikely to be detected . inadequate control over these expenditures , combined with the inherent risk of fraud and abuse associated with purchase cards , led to fraudulent , improper , and questionable purchases totaling $ 686,000 . poor internal controls over computers acquired with purchase cards and third party drafts led to 241 missing personal computers and other equipment valued at $ 261,500 . although education changed policies and procedures over disbursements to improve internal controls and program integrity , many of these changes have not been effectively implemented .
immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) officials believe that some aliens are using the benefit application process to carry out illegal activities , such as crimes of violence , narcotics trafficking , and terrorism . the extent of immigration benefit fraud is unknown , but ins officials and others believe that this problem will increase as smugglers and other criminal enterprises use fraud to bring illegal aliens , including criminals , into the united states . ins investigative units in both the service centers and the district offices investigate possible benefit fraud on the basis of information they receive from staff who process benefit applications , other ins units , the public , and law enforcement agencies . providing immigration benefits in a timely manner may conflict with the goal of preserving the integrity of the legal immigration system . although ins recognizes the need to balance these competing goals , it has not always succeeded . ins has several performance measures in place to gauge the results of its benefit fraud enforcement activities . however , ins has not established outcome - based performance measures to assess the results of fraud activities . additionally , ins has not established goals or measurement criteria for the service center units that are responsible for fraud investigations .
a growing backlog of cases and longer processing times have prompted concern about the management of the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) offer in compromise ( oic ) program . oic inventory and processing time have grown despite significant increases in program staff . program changes increased the demand for offers , the number of processing steps , and the number of staff hours needed to process the case . yet , the demand for offers exceeded staff 's capacity to process them . the extent to which irs ' current initiatives would reduce the oic program inventory and processing time is uncertain . the current initiatives are intended to separate the processing of less complex and more complex offers , with lower - grade staff using standardized procedures to process less complex offers and higher - grade staff specializing in more complex offers . irs projects that the initiatives will stabilize the inventory and keep up with the flow of new offers by the end of fiscal year 2002. irs met the requirements of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 by independently reviewing all proposed offer rejections , considering the facts and circumstances of each taxpayer when determining allowances for monthly living expenses , and not rejecting offers from low - income taxpayers solely on the basis of the amount offered . irs lacks data on the effect on taxpayers of its 1998 decision that the agency lacked the authority to enter into partial payment installment agreements . irs officials said the policy change created a situation in which taxpayers who were willing to pay some of their tax liability might not qualify for either an installment agreement or an offer . according to these officials , the only other option was to put such taxpayers ' accounts into inactive status .
the three largest disability programs collectively provided $ 89.7 billion in cash benefits to 10.2 million adults in 2001. however , the disability insurance ( di ) program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , and va disability criteria reflect neither medical and technological advances nor the labor market changes that affect the skills needed to perform work and work settings . if these federal disability programs do not update scientific and labor market information , they risk overestimating the limiting nature of some disabilities while underestimating others . twelve years ago , both the social security administration and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) began reviewing relevant medical advances and updating the criteria they use to evaluate claims . however , the time the agencies are taking to revise the medical criteria could undermine the very purpose of the update . moreover , because of the limited role of treatment in the statutory and regulatory design of these programs , the updates have not fully captured the benefits afforded by advances in treatment . also , the disability criteria used by di , ssi , and va programs have not incorporated labor market changes . these programs continue to use outdated information about the types and demands of jobs needed to determine the impact that impairments have on individuals ' earning capacity . to incorporate scientific advances and labor market changes into the di , ssi , and va programs , steps can be taken within the existing program design , but some would require more fundamental change . agencies need to continue their medical updates and vigorously expand their efforts to more closely examine labor market changes . at a more fundamental level , ssa and va could consider changes to the disability criteria that would revisit the programs ' basic orientation .
federal , state , and local governments share responsibility for terrorist attacks . however , local government , including police and fire departments , emergency medical personnel , and public health agencies , is typically the first responder to an incident . the federal government historically has provided leadership , training , and funding assistance . in the aftermath of september 11 , for instance , one - quarter of the $ 40 billion emergency response fund was earmarked for homeland security , including enhancing state and local government preparedness . because the national security threat is diffuse and the challenge is highly intergovernmental , national policymakers must formulate strategies with a firm understanding of the interests , capacity , and challenges facing those governments . the development of a national strategy will improve national preparedness and enhance partnerships between federal , state , and local governments . the creation of the office of homeland security is an important and potentially significant first step . the office of homeland security 's strategic plan should define and clarify the appropriate roles and responsibilities of federal , state , and local entities ; establish goals and performance measures to guide the nation 's preparedness efforts ; and carefully choose the most appropriate tools of government to implement the national strategy and achieve national goals . the president 's proposed homeland security act of 2002 would bring many federal agencies with homeland security responsibilities -- including public health preparedness and response -- into one department to mobilize and focus assets and resources at all levels of government . gao believes that the proposed reorganization has the potential to repair fragmentation in the coordination of public health preparedness and response programs at the federal , state , and local levels . the proposal would institutionalize the responsibility for homeland security in federal statute . in addition to improving overall coordination , the transfer of programs from multiple agencies to the new department could reduce overlap among programs and facilitate response in times of disaster . there are concerns about the proposed transfer of control of public health assistance programs that have both public health and homeland security functions from health and human services to the new department . transferring control of these programs , including priority setting , to the new department has the potential to disrupt some programs that are critical to basic public health responsibilities . gao does not believe that the president 's proposal is sufficiently clear on how both the homeland security and public health objectives would be accomplished .
the unemployment insurance ( ui ) program is a federal - state partnership to help replace the lost earnings of unemployed persons and to stabilize the economy during a recession . the department of labor estimates that $ 2.4 billion in overpayments were made in 2001 , including $ 577 million attributed to fraud or abuse . overpayments in the ui program result from management and operational practices at the state and federal level . at the state level , many states do not sufficiently balance the need to quickly process and pay ui claims with the need to control program payments . moreover , states rely heavily on self - reported information from claimants for other important data , such as a claimant 's receipt of other federal or state program benefits and whether they are citizens of the united states . at the federal level , policies and directives from the department of labor affect states ' priorities and procedures in a manner that makes overpayments more likely .
the earned income credit ( eic ) is a refundable tax credit available to low - income , working taxpayers . administering the eic is not an easy task for the internal revenue service ( irs ) . irs has to balance its efforts to help ensure that all qualified persons claim the credit with its efforts to protect the integrity of the tax system and guard against fraud and other forms of noncompliance associated with eic . although irs made some changes to its correspondence , improved its examiner training , and expanded taxpayer outreach , certain aspects of the recertification process continue to cause problems for taxpayers . since the inception of the eic recertification program in 1998 , irs has taken steps to improve some of the letters and forms it uses to correspond with taxpayers about the program . however , two standard forms that irs uses in corresponding with taxpayers as part of the recertification process can lead to unnecessary taxpayer burden . irs asks taxpayers to submit certain information as part of the process that can be difficult for some eic claimants to obtain or is inconsistent with what many examiners consider acceptable .
each year , the federal housing administration ( fha ) insures billions of dollars in multifamily housing mortgage loans to help construct , rehabilitate , purchase , and refinance apartments and health care facilities . however , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) lacks assurances that the lenders approved for the multifamily accelerated processing ( map ) program always meet all of hud 's qualifications . hud 's guidance requires prospective lenders to submit documents showing that they are financially sound , have a satisfactory lending record , and have qualified underwriters . gao found that hud did not always comply with , or effectively implement , controls and procedures for reviewing and monitoring map lenders ' underwriting of loans . before issuing a loan , field staff are required to conduct and document reviews of lenders ' mortgage insurance applications and associated loan exhibits to ensure compliance with hud underwriting requirements . however , staff did not always properly document their reviews . hud has held some lenders accountable for specific violations of program requirements but is unable to systematically identify lenders that exhibit patterns of noncompliance . to hold lenders accountable for specific violations or for patterns of noncompliance , hud 's office of multifamily housing can suspend or terminate their ability to participate in the map program .
in light of its continuing financial deterioration and its stated goal of eliminating federal operating assistance by december 2002 , amtrak undertook several steps to improve its financial condition , including changing in its routes and services . amtrak has been unsuccessful in implementing its network growth strategy to shift its route and service plans for new routes and expanded services on the freight tracks over which it operates . two years after announcing the new strategy , amtrak has only implemented three routes , one of which was later canceled . amtrak still plans to implement the remaining three routes , although later than planned . increased mail and express revenues were the cornerstone of the new strategy . however , amtrak overestimated the mail and express revenue expected . according to amtrak , this overestimation occurred because it had no empirical basis for its revenue estimates and express shippers were reluctant to enter into contracts for service that did not yet exist . six of the planned route actions were canceled because amtrak overestimated the revenues associated with them . amtrak was unable to reach agreement with freight railroads because they were concerned about amtrak 's plans to operate additional trains in already congested areas , amtrak 's plans to carry express merchandise that might compete with their own business , and compensation that amtrak would pay for use of their tracks .
by law , married persons who file joint tax returns are each fully responsible for the accuracy of the tax return and for the full tax liability . this is true even though only one taxpayer may have earned the wages or income shown on the tax return . under the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) innocent spousal program , irs can relieve taxpayers of tax debts on the basis of equity considerations , such as not knowing that their spouse failed to pay taxes due . since passage of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 , irs has received thousands of requests from taxpayers for innocent spouse relief . irs 's inability to provide timely responses to such requests has generated concerns among taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders . irs reached decisions on 21 percent more cases than it received in fiscal year 2001 , reducing some of its backlog from previous years . the agency accomplished this through a variety of initiatives , including a substantial staffing commitment , centralization and specialization , automated tools , and routine estimating of future workload and staffing needs . irs 's procedures conform to applicable guidance for transferring tax liabilities from joint tax accounts to individual tax accounts when innocent spouse relief has been granted . the procedures follow federal internal control guidelines by requiring a mix of checks , verifications , reconciliations , and documentation to support steps throughout the process . the web site for irs 's innocent spouse program -- part of irs 's agency wide web site -- went on - line in december 1999 to help taxpayers determine their eligibility for innocent spouse relief . because irs has not evaluated the web site , the agency does not know how useful the web site has been to taxpayers in determining their eligibility for innocent spouse relief .
information sharing and coordination are key elements in any defense against cyber attacks . the organizations gao reviewed identified factors they considered critical to their success in building successful information - sharing relationships with and among their members . all of the organizations identified trust as essential to successful relationships . they said that trust could only be built over time and through personal relationships . one of the most difficult challenges identified was the initial reluctance of new members to share information . other challenges included developing agreements on the use and protection of shared information , obtaining adequate funding for websites and meetings while avoiding contributions intended primarily to promote the interests of an individual organization , maintaining a focus on emerging issues of interest to members , and maintaining appropriately skilled professional and administrative staff .
federal , state , and local governments share responsibility in preparing for catastrophic terrorist attacks . because the national security threat is diffuse and the challenge is intergovernmental , national policymakers need a firm understanding of the interests , capacity , and challenges when formulating antiterrorism strategies . key aspects of this strategy should include a definition and clarification of the appropriate roles and responsibilities of federal , state , and local entities . gao has found fragmentation and overlap among federal assistance programs . more than 40 federal entities have roles in combating terrorism , and past federal efforts have resulted in a lack of accountability , a lack of cohesive effort , and program duplication . this situation has led to confusion , making it difficult to identify available federal preparedness resources and effectively partner with the federal government . goals and performance measures should be established to guide the nation 's preparedness efforts . for the nation 's preparedness programs , however , outcomes have yet to be defined in terms of domestic preparedness . given the recent and proposed increases in preparedness funding , real and meaningful improvements in preparedness and establishing clear goals and performance measures are critical to ensuring a successful and a fiscally responsible effort . the strategy should include a careful choice of the most appropriate tools of government to best achieve national goals .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides health care services to veterans who have been diagnosed with psychosis -- primarily schizophrenia , a disorder that can substantially limit their ability to care for themselves , secure employment , and maintain relationships . these veterans also have a high risk of premature death , including suicide . effective treatment , especially antipsychotic drug therapy , has reduced the severity of their illnesses and increased their ability to function in society . va 's guideline for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs is sound and consistent with published clinical practice guidelines used by public and private health care systems . va 's prescribing guideline , recommends that physicians use their best clinical judgment , based on clinical circumstances and patients ' needs , when choosing among the atypical drugs . most veterans integrated service networks and facilities use va 's prescribing guideline ; however , five visns have additional policies and procedures for prescribing atypical antipsychotic drugs . although these procedures help manage pharmaceutical cost , they also have the potential to result in more weight given to cost than clinical judgment which is not consistent with the prescribing guideline .
the department of defense ( dod ) faces complex financial and management problems that are deeply rooted in dod 's business operations and management culture . during the past 12 years , dod has begun several broad - based departmentwide reform efforts to overhaul its financial operations and other key business areas . these efforts have been unsuccessful . gao identified several key elements that are essential to the success of any dod financial management reform effort . these include addressing the department 's financial management challenges as part of a comprehensive , integrated , dod - wide business reform ; providing for sustained leadership and resource control to implement needed reforms ; establishing clear lines of responsibility , authority , and accountability for such reform ; incorporating results - oriented performance measures and monitoring tied to the reforms ; providing appropriate incentives or consequences for action or inaction ; establishing and implementing an enterprise architecture to guide and direct financial management and modernization investments , and ensuring effective oversight and monitoring .
in recent years , funding for the department of state has increased dramatically , particularly for security upgrades at overseas facilities and a major hiring program . the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) has also received more funds , especially for programs in afghanistan and iraq and hiv / aids relief . both state and usaid face significant management challenges in carrying out their respective missions , particularly in areas such as human capital management , performance measurement , and information technology management . despite increased funding , resources are not unlimited . thus , state , usaid , and all government agencies have an obligation to ensure that taxpayer resources are managed wisely . long - lasting improvements in performance will require continual vigilance and the identification of widespread opportunities to improve the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of state 's and usaid 's existing goals and programs . gao was asked to summarize its findings from reports on state 's and usaid 's management of resources , actions taken in response to our reports , and recommendations to promote cost savings and more efficient and effective operations at the department and agency . overall , state has increased its attention to managing resources , and its efforts are starting to show results , including potential cost savings and improved operational effectiveness and efficiency . for example , in 1996 , gao criticized state 's performance in disposing of its overseas property . between fiscal years 1997 through 2002 , state sold 129 properties for more than $ 459 million with plans to sell additional properties between fiscal years 2003 through 2008 for approximately $ 300 million . additional sales would help offset costs of replacing about 160 unsecure and deteriorating embassies . state is now taking a more businesslike approach with its embassy construction program , which is estimated to cost an additional $ 17 billion beginning in fiscal year 2004. cost - cutting efforts allowed state to achieve $ 150 million in potential cost savings during fiscal year 2002. state should continue its reforms as it determines requirements for , designs , and builds new embassies . the costs of maintaining staff overseas are generally very high . in response to management weaknesses gao identified , state has begun addressing workforce planning issues to ensure that the government has the right people in the right places at the right times . state should continue this work and adopt industry best practices that could reduce costs and streamline services overseas . gao and others have highlighted deficiencies in state 's information technology . state invested $ 236 million in fiscal year 2002 on modernization initiatives overseas and plans to spend $ 262 million over fiscal years 2003 and 2004. ongoing oversight of this investment will be necessary to minimize the risks of spending large sums of money on systems that do not produce commensurate value . state has improved its strategic planning to better link staffing and budgetary requirements with policy priorities . setting clear objectives and tying resources to them will make operations more efficient . gao and others have also identified some management weaknesses at usaid , mainly in human capital management and workforce planning , program evaluation and performance measurement , information technology , and financial management . while usaid is taking corrective actions , better management of critical systems is essential to safeguard the agency 's funds . given the added resources state and usaid must manage , current budget deficits , and new requirements since sept. 11 , 2001 , oversight is needed to ensure continued progress toward effective management practices . this focus could result in cost savings or other efficiencies .
estimating the extent of abusive tax schemes used by individual taxpayers is difficult because they are often hidden . nevertheless , the internal revenue service ( irs ) believes that the number and dollar consequences of these schemes has grown recently . irs estimates that 740,000 taxpayers used abusive schemes in tax year 2000. irs caught $ 5 billion in improper tax avoidance or tax credit and refund claims , but estimates that another $ 20 to $ 40 billion went undetected . recent developments suggest that the number of individuals using an abusive tax scheme involving offshore accounts may be greater than estimated and potential lost revenues may be higher than estimated . because no one individual or office could provide an agencywide perspective on irs 's strategy , goals , objectives , performance measures , or program results , it is difficult to provide a clear picture of irs 's efforts to address abusive tax schemes . irs has created new offices , reemphasized and reorganized earlier efforts , and plans to assign at least 200 additional staff to its efforts . limited data suggest that irs 's enhanced efforts have helped to successfully convict those promoting and taking advantage of abusive schemes , publicize these results , and uncover previously hidden major offshore compliance problems . the number of possible abusive tax schemes , however , could outstrip irs 's audit resources . furthermore , identifying and handling these cases will require better coordination on irs 's part . irs has not yet developed a way to track the resources used to combat abusive schemes , nor has it developed goals and measures to assess its progress .
in march of this year , gao testified before the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations , committee on veterans ' affairs , about the department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) information technology ( it ) program , and the strides that the secretary had made in improving departmental leadership and management of this critical area -- including the hiring of a chief information officer . at the subcommittee 's request , gao evaluated va 's new it organizational structure , and provided an update on va 's progress in addressing other specific areas of it concern and our related recommendations pertaining to enterprise architecture , information security , the veterans benefits administration 's replacement compensation and pension payment system and maintenance of the benefits delivery network , and the government computer - based patient record initiative . since our march testimony , va has made important progress in its overall management of information technology . for example , the secretary 's decision to centralize it functions , programs , and funding under the department - level cio holds great promise for improving the accountability and management of it spending -- currently over $ 1 billion per year . but in this as well as the other areas of prior weakness , the strength of va 's leadership and continued management commitment to achieving improvements will ultimately determine the department 's degree of success . as for its progress in other areas includes : enterprise architecture : the secretary recently approved the initial , `` as is '' version of this blueprint for evolving its information systems , focused on defining the department 's current environment for selected business functions . va still , however , needs to select a permanent chief architect and establish a program office to facilitate , manage , and advance this effort . information security : steps have been taken that should help provide a more solid foundation for detecting , reporting , and responding to security incidents . nonetheless , the department has not yet fully implemented a comprehensive computer security management program that includes a process for routinely monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of security policies and controls , acting to address identified vulnerabilities . compensation and pension payment system : while some actions have been taken , after more than 6 years , full implementation of this system is not envisioned before 2005 ; this means that the 3.5 million payments that va makes each month will continue to depend on its present , aging system . government computer - based patient record initiative : va and the department of defense have reported some progress in achieving the capability to share patient health care data under this program . since march , the agencies have formally re named the initiative the federal health information exchange and have begun implementing a more narrowly defined strategy involving a one - way information transfer from defense to va ; a two - way exchange is planned by 2005 .
the medicare program is the nation 's largest health insurer with almost 40 million beneficiaries and outlays of over $ 219 billion annually . because of the susceptibility of the program to fraud and abuse , congress enacted the health care fraud and abuse control ( hcfac ) program as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act ( hippaa ) of 1996. hcfac , which is administered by the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and the department of justice ( doj ) , established a national framework to coordinate federal , state , and local law enforcement efforts to detect , prevent , and prosecute health care fraud and abuse in the public and private sectors . hippaa requires hhs and doj to issue a joint annual report no later than january 1 of each year to congress for the proceeding fiscal year . the joint hcfac reports included deposits of $ 210 million for fiscal year 2000 and $ 464 million for fiscal year 2001 , pursuant to the act . in testing at doj , gao found errors in the recording of criminal fines deposits to the federal hospital insurance trust fund in fiscal year 2001 that resulted in an estimated overstatement to the trust fund of $ 169,765 . gao found that the planned use of hcfac appropriations was in keeping with the stated purpose in the act . although gao found expenditures from the trust fund were generally appropriate at hhs , at doj gao found $ 480,000 in interest penalties not related to hcfac activities that were charged to the hcfac appropriation . gao was unable to identify expenditures from the hcfac trust fund for activities unrelated to medicare because the hhs / oig and doj do not separately account for or monitor these activities . likewise , gao was unable to identify savings specifically attributable to activities funded by the hcfac program .
prescription drug diversion is the channeling of pharmaceuticals for illegal purposes or abuse . according to the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , increased prescription drug abuse and emergency room admissions , as well as the theft and illegal resale of prescription drugs , indicate that drug diversion is a growing problem associated with addiction , overdose , and death . all 15 state prescription drug monitoring programs ( pdmp ) collect information about the prescribing , dispensing , and use of prescription drugs and distribute it to medical practitioners , pharmacies , and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies . however , the programs differ in terms of objectives , design , and operations . in addition to helping law enforcement identify and prevent prescription drug diversion , program objectives also include education of the public , physicians , and pharmacists about the nature and extent of the problem , and medical treatment options for abusers of diverted drugs . the programs ' designs vary by specific drugs covered and by the type of state agency in which they are housed . some programs use the prescription data proactively to identify trends or patterns of use and to respond to law enforcement requests . others use it only to respond to requests . states with pdmps improve the timeliness of law enforcement and regulatory investigations . states considering establishing a pdmp , or expanding an existing one , face several challenges . these include educating the public and policymakers about prescription drug diversion and abuse and the benefits of a pdmp , responding to the concerns of physicians , patients , and pharmacists regarding the confidentiality of prescription information , and funding for program development and operations . national efforts to assist states in addressing illegal diversion have focused on providing guidance and technical assistance .
the tennessee valley authority ( tva ) relied on its 11 coal - burning plants to supply 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001. these plants account for almost all of tva 's emissions of two key air pollutants -- sulfur dioxide ( so2 ) , which has been linked to reduced visibility , and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) , which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone . to meet an increase in demand of 1.7 percent annually through 2010 , tva estimates that it will need to expand its current generating capacity of 30,365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually . building new generating capacity can produce more emissions , which raises environment concerns . to lessen the need for new capacity , tva and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through `` demand - side management '' programs , which seek to reduce the amount of energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed . even though tva intends to increase its capacity to generate electricity through 2005 , it also expects to reduce its so2 and nox emissions during the same time period , primarily by burning lower - sulfur coal , installing devices to control emissions at its existing plants , and relying on fuels other than coal for new capacity . although tva 's demand - side management programs have allowed customers to cut their electrical consumption , these programs have made only modest contributions to reducing peak - time demand . tva has limited the scope of its key program to reduce peak - time consumption by residential customers because tva believes the program is not cost - effective . tva projects that its demand - side programs will produce nearly twice as much in savings between 2001 and 2005 as was achieved in the previous five years . other large utilities have more fully implemented the types of programs that tva now has in place and have also implemented a greater array of demand - side management tools . these programs have involved a much higher proportion of their residential customers and established different prices for electricity used during different times of the day .
federal research and preparedness activities related to bioterrorism center on detecting of such agents ; developing new or improved vaccines , antibiotics , and antivirals ; and developing performance standards for emergency response equipment . preparedness activities include : increasing federal , state , and local response capabilities ; developing response teams ; increasing the availability of medical treatments ; participating in and sponsoring exercises ; aiding victims ; and providing support at special events , such as presidential inaugurations and olympic games . to coordinate their activities , federal agencies are developing interagency response plans , participating in various interagency work groups , and entering into formal agreements with each other to share resources and capabilities . however , gao found that coordination of federal terrorism research , preparedness , and response programs is fragmented , raising concerns about the ability of states and localities to respond to a bioterrorist attack . these concerns include poor state and local planning and the lack of hospital participation in training on terrorism and emergency response planning . this report summarized a september 2001 report ( gao - 01-915 ) .
the farm service agency ( fsa ) runs a direct loan program that provides loans to farmers who are unable to obtain private commercial credit to buy and operate farms . fsa is required to administer this program in a fair , unbiased manner . gao found that during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , fsa averaged 4 days longer to process loan applications from hispanic farmers than it did for non - hispanic farmers : 20 days versus 16 days . however , the processing times in three of the four states with the highest number of hispanic borrowers was faster that it was for non - hispanic borrowers in those states . fsa 's direct loan approval rate was somewhat lower for hispanic farmers than for non - hispanic farmers nationwide -- 83 and 90 percent , respectively . the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) policies for staying foreclosures when discrimination has been alleged depend on the method used to lodge complaints . when an individual has a discrimination complaint accepted by usda 's office of civil rights ( ocr ) , fsa 's policy is to automatically issue a stay of foreclosure until the complaint has been resolved . a gao survey revealed that during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 , fsa foreclosed on the loans of 600 borrowers nationwide . although hispanic farmers make up 4 percent of the agency 's direct loan portfolio , 3 percent of these foreclosures involved hispanic farmers . ocr has made modest progress in the length of time it takes to process discrimination complaints . usda requirements direct ocr to complete its processing up through the investigative phase of complaints within 180 days of acceptance . it does not , however , have a time requirement for all of the phases of complaint processing .
the estimated $ 6.5 billion full - cycle cost of the 2000 decennial census is nearly double that of the 1990 census . when the full - cycle cost is divided by the number of american households , the cost per housing unit of the 2000 census was $ 56 compared to $ 32 per housing unit for the 1990 census . the primary reasons for the cost increases include the following : in the 1990 census , field data collection cost was $ 16 per housing unit , while in the 2000 census it was $ 32 per housing unit ; in the 1990 census , technology costs were $ 5 per housing unit compared to $ 8 per housing unit for the 2000 census ; and the data content and products activity cost $ 3 per housing unit in 1990 and $ 5 per housing unit in 2000 .
the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , through its accreditation program , has made considerable progress in achieving uniformity among state insurance regulators . in addition , competitive pressures from further consolidation in the financial services sector and enactment of the gramm - leach - bliley act has focused attention on regulator reforms in the insurance industry . naic 's producer licensing reciprocity and uniformity initiative aims to streamline the licensing process for selling insurance in multiple states . state regulators are also trying to streamline regulatory processes to bring new insurance products to market more quickly . naic 's speed to market initiative focuses both on developing a more centralized filing and approval process for life and health insurance products and on improving existing state - based approval processes for other types of products . finally , naic 's national treatment of companies initiative aims to facilitate the licensing process for conducting business on a multistate basis . however , naic and the states face significant challenges in implementing their initiatives .
this testimony discusses challenges in defining the federal role with respect to freight transportation issues . there are concerns that the projected increases in freight tonnage for all transportation modes will place pressures on the marine , aviation , and highway transportation systems . as a result , there is growing awareness of the need to view various transportation modes , and freight movement in particular , from an integrated standpoint , particularly for the purposes of developing and implementing a federal investment strategy and considering alternative funding approaches . the federal approach for funding the marine transportation system relies heavily on general revenues , although the approach for funding the aviation and highway systems relies almost exclusively on collections from users of the systems . during fiscal years 1999 through 2001 , customs duties on imported goods transported through the transportation systems averaged $ 15 billion each year for the marine transportation system , $ 4 billion each year for the aviation system , and $ 900 million each year for the highway system . customs duties are taxes on the value of imported goods and have traditionally been viewed as revenues to be used for the support of the general activities of the federal government . diverse industry stakeholders believe that substantial new investments in the maritime infrastructure may be required from public and private sources because of an aging infrastructure , changes in the shipping industry , and increased concerns about security . a systematic framework would be helpful to decision makers as they consider the federal government 's purpose and role in providing funding for the system and as they develop a sound investment approach to guide federal participation . in examining federal investment approaches across many national activities , gao has identified four key components of such a framework -- establishing national goals , defining the federal role , determining appropriate funding tools , and evaluating performance -- which could potentially be applied to all transportation systems .
after the events of september 11 , 2001 , concerns were raised over the security of u.s. ports and waterways . in response to the concerns over port security , congress passed the maritime transportation security act in november 2002. the act created a broad range of programs to improve the security conditions at the ports and along american waterways , such as identifying and tracking vessels , assessing security preparedness , and limiting access to sensitive areas . a number of executive agencies were delegated responsibilities to implement these programs and other provisions of the act . the senate committee on commerce , science , and transportation asked gao to conduct a review of the status of the agencies ' efforts to implement the security requirements of the act . this testimony reflects gao 's preliminary findings ; much of gao 's work in the area is still under way . agencies responsible for implementing the security provisions of the maritime transportation security act have made progress in meeting their requirements . thus far , gao has obtained information about 43 of 46 specific action areas , and efforts are under way in 42 of them . for example , the coast guard , the department of homeland security agency with lead responsibility for most of the assignments , has published six interim rules covering responsibilities ranging from security of port facilities to vessel identification systems . two other agencies within the new department -- the transportation security administration and the bureau of customs and border protection -- have actions under way in such areas as establishing an identification system for millions of port workers and setting information requirements for cargo . the maritime administration , a department of transportation agency , has already completed or is well into implementing such responsibilities as developing training for security personnel . while much has been accomplished , gao 's review found five areas of concern . three relate primarily to security issues : only a limited number of ports covered by vessel identification system ; questions about the scope and quality of port security assessments ; and concerns related to approving security plans for foreign vessels . two relate primarily to organizational and operational matters : potential duplication of maritime intelligence efforts ; and inconsistency with port security grant program requirements .
rightsizing is the aligning of the number and location of staff assigned to u.s. embassies with foreign policy priorities , security , and other constraints . gao is developing a framework to enable the executive branch to assess the number and mix of embassy staff . the framework will link staffing levels to the following three critical elements of overseas operations : physical security and real estate , mission priorities and requirements , and operational costs . gao reviewed policies and practices at the u.s. embassy in paris because of its large size and history of rightsizing decisions . gao found that about 700 employees from 11 agencies work in main buildings at the paris embassy . serious security concerns in at least one embassy building in paris suggest the need to consider staff reductions unless building security can be improved . staffing levels are hard to determine because agencies use different criteria and priorities to place staff . the lack of comprehensive cost data on all agencies ' operations , which is estimated at more than $ 100 million annually in france , and the lack of an embassywide budget eliminate the possibility of cost - based decisionmaking on staffing . the number of staff could be reduced , particularly those in support positions , which constitute about one - third of the total . options include relocating functions to the united states or to regional centers and outsourcing commercial activities .
as the nation 's largest cash assistance program for the poor , the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program ssi provided $ 33 billion in benefits to 6.8 million aged , blind , and disabled persons last year . in 2001 , the outstanding ssi debt and newly detected overpayments totaled $ 4.7 billion . to deter and detect overpayments , the agency obtained legislative authority to use additional tools to verify recipients financial eligibility for benefits , enhanced its processes for monitoring and holding staff accountable for completing assigned ssi workloads , and improved its use of automation to strengthen its overpayment detection capabilities . however , because a number of initiatives are still in the planning or early implementation stages , it is too soon to assess their ultimate impact on ssi payment accuracy . in addition to improving its overpayment deterrence and detection capabilities , ssa has made recovery of overpaid benefits a high priority .
preventive medicine , including immunizations for many diseases and screening for some types of cancer , holds the promise to extend and improve the quality of life for millions of americans . medicare now covers three preventive services for immunizations and three for screenings , and the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) sponsors `` interventions '' to increase the use of preventive services . gao found that the use of preventive services varies widely by service , state , ethnic group , income , and education . the greatest differences among ethnic groups were for immunization rates . cancer screening rates tended to differ according to income and education level . cms pays for interventions that promote breast cancer screenings and pneumonia and flu shots . most of the techniques being used , such as reminder systems that medical offices can use to alert doctors and patients to needed cancer screenings , have been effective . cms is evaluating what its current efforts have accomplished and expects the results later this year .
the office of pipeline safety ( ops ) oversees 2.2 million miles of pipelines that transport potentially dangerous materials , such as oil and natural gas . ops has been slow to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry and implement critical pipeline safety improvements . as a result , ops has the lowest rate of any transportation agency for implementing the recommendations of the national transportation safety board . in recent years , ops has taken several steps to improve its oversight of the pipeline industry , including requiring `` integrity management '' programs for individual operators to assess their pipelines for risks , take action to mitigate the risks , and develop program performance measures . ops has also revised forms and procedures to collect more complete and accurate data , which will enable ops to better assess the causes of incidents and focus on the greatest risks to pipelines ; allowed more states to oversee a broader range of interstate pipeline safety activities ; and increased the use of fines . ops has made progress in responding to recommendations from the safety board and statutory requirements , but some key open recommendations and requirements , such as requiring pipeline operators to periodically inspect their pipelines , are now more than a decade old . ops faces challenges that include developing performance measures for the integrity management approach , ensuring sufficient resources and expertise to oversee operators ' integrity management programs , providing consistent and effective enforcement of integrity management program requirements , and issuing requirements for integrity management programs for operators of gas transmission pipelines .
welfare reform significantly changed federal policy for low - income families with children and established a five - year lifetime limit on cash assistance . welfare reform also extended transitional medicaid assistance through 2001. states have implemented various initiatives to help families move from cash assistance to the workforce , including some enhancements to transitional medicaid . these initiatives likely helped to cut cash assistance caseloads by more than half from 1996 through mid - 2001 . low - wage or part - time jobs -- which are common for newly working individuals -- often do not come with affordable health insurance , thus making transitional medicaid coverage an important option . the implementation of transitional medicaid assistance varied across the 21 states that gao reviewed . state practices enhanced beneficiaries ' ability to retain medicaid coverage . however , many families did not receive their full transitional medicaid assistance benefits because they failed to report their income three times during the 12-month period of coverage . amending the medicaid statute to provide states with greater flexibility to ease income - reporting requirements , as has been done for other aspects of the medicaid program , could facilitate uninterrupted health insurance coverage for families moving from cash assistance to the workforce .
for several years , the department of defense ( dod ) and the congress have encouraged the defense logistics support community to pursue partnerships with the private sector to combine the best commercial processes and practices with dod 's extensive maintenance capabilities . in january 2002 , dod issued policy encouraging the use of public - private depot maintenance partnerships to improve the efficiency and viability of its depots . gao reviewed these partnerships and assessed the extent that dod is participating in these partnerships , the characteristics needed to achieve effective partnerships and where dod is in its ability to measure success , and the management challenges to dod 's planned expansion of partnerships . while the number of public - private partnerships that dod is participating in has increased from 19 to 93 from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002 , the existing partnerships represented only 2 percent of dod 's fiscal year 2002 $ 19 billion depot maintenance program . even with the small amount of expenditures and workload associated with partnerships , some partnerships that gao reviewed either improved some aspects of repair performance or showed potential for doing so . on the other hand , 19 partnerships have generated no work thus far . dod and contractor officials have identified 14 characteristics that they believe over time will contribute to a partnership 's success in achieving dod 's objective of improved depot efficiency and viability . however , dod has a limited ability to measure the overall success of its partnering efforts because it has not yet developed measurable goals for the expected outcomes of the effort and the metrics that it has developed sometimes will not provide the data needed to fully assess the partnerships . without initially establishing clear , measurable goals to define success in improving the efficiency and viability of its depots and metrics that provide the relevant data for the measurement , dod has limited objective means to assess whether the partnerships are working as intended . furthermore , dod faces challenges in its efforts to expand its use of public - private partnerships . for example , opportunities available for dod to expand its use of these partnerships may be limited by external factors that the services can not replicate or create at will , such as one - time business opportunities . also , while dod is expecting private sector funding to support the establishment of capability for depot partnerships for new systems , the amount of private - sector investment to date is only $ 6.9 million , and the extent to which the private - sector will make additional investments is uncertain .
in june 2002 , gao reported that the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) had not yet adequately revised its regulatory and oversight approach for the natural gas and electricity industries ' transition from regulated monopolies to competitive markets . gao also concluded that ferc faced significant human capital challenges to transform its workforce to meet such changes . in responding to the report , ferc said that the new office of market oversight and investigations ( omoi ) it was creating and human capital improvements under way would address these concerns . gao was asked to report on ferc 's progress in establishing an oversight and enforcement capability for competitive energy markets and improving agency - wide human capital management . ferc has made strides in putting an energy market oversight and enforcement capability in place , but work remains to ensure that its efforts will be comprehensive and systematic . since ferc declared omoi functional in august 2002 , the office has focused primarily on outlining its vision , mission , and primary functions ; developing basic work processes ; integrating its use of an array of tools to oversee the markets ; and hiring staff with market experience . omoi is also assessing its data needs and developing its working relationships with others , such as the industry 's market monitoring units . nonetheless , the office still has work to do in the following two key areas . clearly defining its role : omoi has not clearly defined its role and the activities that it will engage in to achieve its mission . for example , the office has not yet decided on the level of detail at which it will review electricity markets . this decision has substantial implications for the office 's data , technology , resource , and staff skill mix needs . developing formal processes and written procedures : omoi 's processes are largely informal and ad hoc , and it has few written procedures to ensure that its efforts are coordinated , systematic , understood by its staff , and transparent to its stakeholders . although omoi has had some early accomplishments -- such as a $ 20 million civil penalty against a company for anticompetitive behavior -- it is difficult to judge how effective the office will be until its role and major processes are clearly set out . ferc is also making progress toward addressing its considerable human capital management challenges , but additional actions could increase its likelihood of success . ferc 's success in these efforts is important because the extent to which it can carry out its mission in a changing environment depends on its ability to adjust its staff skills and abilities in a difficult context . for example , over half of its workforce will be eligible to retire by 2007. in response , ferc has , among other things , expanded its use of certain personnel flexibilities , such as recruiting and retention bonuses , and is considering use of additional flexibilities . more importantly , ferc , in february 2003 , developed a human capital plan . however , the plan does not contain some elements key to successful implementation , including details on specific activities and resources needed to implement its human capital initiatives and results - oriented measures that can be used to track the agency 's progress in implementing the initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness . ferc also has not established time frames for many of its human capital initiatives .
this study responds to a legislative mandate , which directs the comptroller general to review the actions taken by the department of defense ( dod ) to implement provisions included in the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 ( public law 107-314 ) concerning management of the purchase card program . this study also discusses dod efforts to implement provisions in the dod appropriations act for fiscal year 2003 ( public law 107-248 ) as well as recommendations and the status of disciplinary actions taken against individuals identified in prior gao reports as having used the government purchase card for potentially fraudulent , improper , and abusive or questionable purposes . dod has initiated actions to implement all of the requirements in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 and the dod appropriations act for fiscal year 2003. while it has largely completed revamping its policies and other requirements , it still had considerable work to complete in order to implement managerial and oversight mechanisms , such as strategic sourcing , monitoring , and auditing . however , to implement the legislative requirement that dod evaluate credit worthiness prior to issuing a purchase card , dod is allowing cardholders to self - certify their credit worthiness rather than conducting credit checks on cardholders , as is typically done in the private sector . dod started actions to implement nearly all of the 109 gao recommendations , some of which may closely relate to the legislative provisions . dod and the military services have taken disciplinary actions against cardholders whom a court of law determined had fraudulently used their purchase cards . they have also started to educate cardholders and approving officials on the proper use of the purchase card . the military services have not taken strong disciplinary actions against cardholders gao identified as making improper and abusive or questionable purchase card acquisitions . the military services determined that many of these purchases did not directly violate existing policies . consequently , the services modified these policies to provide a basis for disciplinary actions for similar purchases in the future .
future demographic trends include a doubling of the nation 's retiree population and only modest labor force growth , leading to concerns about retirement income adequacy for future generations . credible projections of the effects of policy proposals on federal spending and future retirees ' income are necessary . because adequate data is critical to the analysis of retirement income and wealth , gao was asked to identify data improvements that experts say are a priority for the study of retirement income and wealth , as well as factors limiting efforts to obtain the needed information . experts consulted by gao cited priorities for improving retirement data that fit into two broad categories : obtaining better data from employers on employee benefits and obtaining better data by linking more individual and household surveys with administrative data ( such as employer records , and social security earnings history records ) . information from employers , such as documents describing the features of their pension plans , would enable analysts to forecast future retirement income of pension holders , based on the specific features of their pension plans and the likely distribution of pension income and wealth for different segments of the population . linking individual and household surveys with administrative data creates new information , such as the demographic characteristics of employees whose pensions are affected by the formulas that employers use to calculate contributions or pension payments . analysts attribute the shortcomings in retirement income data primarily to fragmentation of the responsibility for data collection and analysis , the burden of data collection on respondents , and confidentiality considerations that restrict access to these data . fragmentation of responsibility occurs , in their view , because no single agency has a statutory mandate to collect or to analyze all the data needed to support a more comprehensive study of retirement income and wealth . with regard to respondent burden , some information on pension plans is no longer collected , in part , out of concern that it was an unnecessary burden on the firms having to submit it . finally , certain kinds of data needed to make projections are not widely available to all analysts because of the confidentiality laws that authorize their collection .
the department of defense ( dod ) is pursuing a new initiative involving a core competency approach for making sourcing decisions -- that is , sourcing decisions based on whether the function is core to the agency 's warfighting mission . in determining how to best perform non - core functions , dod 's position is that its components should look beyond just the use of public - private competitions under office of management and budget ( omb ) circular a - 76 in making sourcing decisions , and consider other alternatives such as partnering or employee stock ownership . gao was asked to assess the department 's progress in assessing its core functions as a basis for sourcing decisions , the plans and progress dod has made in identifying and implementing alternatives to a - 76 , and the current status of dod 's a - 76 program . progress in assessing core functions has been varied and limited across major defense components , affected somewhat by ambiguous definitions of the term `` core function . . in some instances additional guidance was obtained , but definitions of core remain somewhat broad and subjective , and will likely remain so in the future . army and air force have led within dod in assessing core functions , but the army has done the most , and found , contrary to its expectations , that distinguishing between core and non - core functions does not , by itself , prescribe a sourcing decision . other factors must also be considered such as risk and operational considerations . the range of alternatives to a - 76 likely to be pursued under the core competency - based approach is not yet clear , but dod has made some progress toward identifying and / or using some alternatives through pilot projects and other efforts by the services as they have focused on the core initiative . however , the use of alternatives could be limited without special legislative authorities and / or repeal of various existing prohibitions , and some could be tempered by the department 's efforts to meet the a - 76 competitive sourcing goals set by omb . dod reported that as of june 1 , 2003 , it has met omb 's short - term goal to use the a - 76 process to study 15 percent of the positions identified in dod 's commercial activities inventory by the end of fiscal year 2003. however , meeting the longer - term goal to study at least 50 percent ( 226,000 ) of its nearly 453,000 commercial activity positions through fiscal year 2008 will present a challenge . this is nearly double the number of positions that dod has previously studied during a comparable time period , and providing sufficient resources ( financial and technical ) to complete the studies may prove challenging . also , the defense components , particularly the air force , plan to transfer certain military personnel into warfighting functions and replace them with government civilian and / or contractor personnel . this will require the components to reprioritize their funding for operation and maintenance accounts , because it is from those accounts the services must fund replacement civilian or contractor personnel .
microenterprises -- small businesses owned and operated by poor entrepreneurs -- have potential to help the world 's poorer populations . for this reason , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) included microenterprise development in its programming . in 2001 , the agency reported that its was conducting microenterprise projects in 52 countries and had obligated almost $ 2 billion since 1988 to support its program . the program supports micro loans , among other services , to assist poor entrepreneurs . since 1996 , usaid has annually reported the program 's results . to help congress oversee usaid 's management of its microenterprise development program , gao was asked to determine the extent to which the agency 's microfinance activities are meeting the program 's key objectives , assess the reliability of usaid 's reporting on its overall microenterprise activities , and examine the agency 's role in identifying and disseminating microenterprise best practices . usaid 's microfinance activities have met some , but not all , of the agency 's microenterprise program objectives . these objectives are to reduce poverty among participants ; target the poor and very poor ; encourage women 's participation ; and develop sustainable microfinance institutions ( mfi ) . first , regarding reducing poverty -- defined as alleviating its impacts or lifting and keeping a large number of people above the poverty line -- gao found that microfinance can help alleviate some impacts of poverty , incrementally improving borrowers ' income levels and quality of life and offering an important coping mechanism to poor workers and their families . however , there is little evidence that it can lift and keep many over the poverty line . second , microfinance generally has served the poor clustered around the poverty line but not the very poor . third , usaid has successfully encouraged the participation of women , who have comprised about two - thirds of micro loan clients since 1997. fourth , usaid has emphasized the importance of mfi sustainability . in fiscal 2001 , of 294 usaid - supported mfis that reported on sustainability , 38 percent reported achieving full sustainability -- a percentage consistent since 1999. the basic data in usaid 's microenterprise results reporting ( mrr ) system are reliable , but certain methodological problems may affect the accuracy of some of the agency 's reporting on key program objectives . specifically , usaid may not be reporting accurately the amounts it has obligated to microenterprise activities ; whether 50 percent of its resources went to the very poor , as required by congress ; and the sustainability of usaid - supported institutions . further , although the agency reports annually on the activities of institutions it supports , it does not show the percentage of those institutions ' total funding that its contribution represents . usaid has identified and disseminated microenterprise best practices , providing information to its missions and implementing partners through policy guidance , training , and technical assistance . in addition , usaid has collaborated with microenterprise development provider networks and others to publish information about these practices .
millions of americans are unable to provide their own transportation -- or even use public transportation -- for medicaid appointments , head start classes , job training , or other services . such `` transportation disadvantaged '' persons are often disabled , elderly , or low income . various federal programs are authorized to provide transportation services to them . gao was asked to identify the federal programs that fund such transportation services and the amount spent on them , assess the extent of coordination among the various programs , and identify any obstacles to coordination and potential ways to overcome such obstacles . sixty - two federal programs -- most of which are administered by the departments of health and human services , labor , education , and transportation -- fund transportation services for the transportation disadvantaged . the full amount these programs spend on transportation is unknown because transportation is not always tracked separately from other spending . however , available information ( i.e . , estimated or actual outlays or obligations ) on 29 of the programs shows that federal agencies spent at least an estimated $ 2.4 billion on these services in fiscal year 2001. additional spending by states and localities is also not fully known but is at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars . efforts to improve services and achieve cost savings through coordination of transportation activities ( through sharing resources or information or consolidating services under a single agency ) among federal agencies vary . the coordinating council on access and mobility -- a body with representation from the departments of transportation and health and human services -- has undertaken some activities to improve coordination . however , other agencies that administer a substantial number of programs for the transportation - disadvantaged , such as the departments of labor and education , are not part of the council . in addition , the coordinating council 's strategic plan is not linked to its action plan and contains few measurable performance goals . the strategic and annual performance plans of the departments of transportation and health and human services contain few references to coordination relating to their subagencies and programs that fund transportation services for the transportation disadvantaged , and the plans of the departments of labor and education do not mention coordinating these services . obstacles impeding coordination include concern among administrators that their own participants might be negatively affected , program rules that limit use by others , and limited guidance and information on coordination . to mitigate these obstacles , officials and experts suggested making federal standards more consistent , creating a clearinghouse or better web site to facilitate interagency communication and provide better guidance on coordination , and providing financial incentives or instituting mandates to coordinate .
the trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) reform act of 2002 consolidated two programs serving trade - affected workers and made changes to expand benefits and decrease the time it takes for workers to get services . gao was asked to provide information on how key reform provisions have affected program services , what have been the challenges in implementing new provisions , whether demand for taa training has changed and how states are meeting this demand , and what is known about what the taa program is achieving . most workers are enrolling in services more quickly than in prior years , partly because of a new 40-day time limit labor must meet when processing a request , or petition , for taa coverage . labor reduced its average petition - processing time from 107 days in fiscal year 2002 to 38 days in fiscal year 2003 after the reform act took effect . also , most states reported that workers are enrolling in training sooner because of a new deadline requiring workers to be enrolled in training by the later of 8 weeks after petition certification or 16 weeks after a worker 's layoff . however , this deadline may have negatively affected some workers -- especially during large layoffs -- as it does not always leave enough time to assess workers ' training needs . states reported challenges implementing some new provisions of the taa reform act . officials in most of the states we visited reported an increased administrative workload from issuing training waivers to allow workers to qualify for the health coverage tax credit ( hctc ) -- over 40 percent more waivers were issued in fiscal year 2003 than in 2002. while officials in all the states we visited said workers are or are likely to be interested in the wage insurance provision ( alternative taa , or ataa ) that supplements the wages of certain workers aged 50 and over , it is still unclear how many workers will take advantage of this benefit . however , some found the provision 's eligibility criteria problematic , partly because they require workers to lack easily transferable skills yet find reemployment within 26 weeks of layoff . demand for taa training increased substantially in fiscal year 2002 , prior to the implementation of the reforms . states have struggled to meet this higher demand with available taa training funds , even though taa training funds available nationally doubled between fiscal years 2002 and 2003. most states have responded by using other federal employment and training resources . information on taa program results has been limited , but labor is making improvements by requiring states to use wage records to track taa outcomes . labor also initiated a new , 5-year evaluation study .
food aid cargo must generally be carried on u.s. - flag ships under requirements set by the cargo preference program . two groups of carriers compete for this cargo : those that participate in the maritime security program and receive an annual government subsidy -- generally liners operating on scheduled routes and those that do not -- generally carriers operating on a charter basis . congress directed gao to study how the cargo preference and maritime security programs are designed and who participates ; the nature and extent of msf and non - msf carrier participation and competition in the food aid program ; and how a tonnage limitation on bagged preference cargo for msf vessels could affect msf , other u.s. - flag ships , the cargo preference food aid program , and the ports servicing these ships . the cargo preference program and the maritime security program provide incentives to retain privately owned u.s. - flag ships and their u.s. citizen mariners for commercial and national defense purposes . the cargo preference program is open to all u.s. - flagged vessels , while the maritime security fleet ( msf ) subsidy is only available to certain militarily useful vessels . of the 47 ships currently in the msf , 37 have participated in cargo preference food aid shipments . msf and non - msf carriers compete for food aid shipped as bagged cargo , which averaged 33 percent of food aid shipments by tonnage from fiscal years 1999 to 2003. there is no competition for bulk food aid shipments because msf carriers do not carry bulk cargo . changes in food aid spending have contributed to a shift from bulk to bagged cargo and increased reliance on bagged cargo by some non - msf carriers . from 1999 to 2003 , msf carriers shipped about 45 percent and non - msf carriers 55 percent of bagged food aid cargo . competition between msf and non - msf carriers for bagged food aid is affected by certain cargo preference requirements . establishing a tonnage limitation on msf vessels would likely reduce their share of food aid shipments , but the extent would depend on factors such as the level of the limit and the options msf carriers have in responding to it . we examined three proposed limits and found that the percentage of food aid voyages carrying more than the proposed limit rises from 3 percent with a limit of 7,500 tons to 19 percent above 2,500 tons , according to fiscal year 2001 to 2003 data . the actual impact on msf carriers will be smaller if they are able to carry some food aid up to the limit , replace some food aid above the limit with other cargo , and / or elect to carry food aid even without the subsidy . food aid agencies are concerned about the impacts of a tonnage limit , including increased delays in providing food aid , administrative burdens , and higher shipping costs . major ports would generally experience a limited overall impact of a tonnage limitation , but specific food aid terminals could be affected .
in 2001 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) administration for children and families ( acf ) implemented the child and family services reviews ( cfsr ) to increase states ' accountability . the cfsr uses states ' data profiles and statewide assessments , as well as interviews and an on - site case review , to measure state performance on 14 outcomes and systemic factors , including child well - being and the provision of caseworker training . the cfsr also requires progress on a program improvement plan ( pip ) ; otherwise acf may apply financial penalties . this report examines acf 's and the states ' experiences preparing for and conducting the statewide assessments and on - site reviews ; acf 's and the states ' experiences developing , funding , and implementing items in pips ; and any additional efforts that acf has taken beyond the cfsr to help ensure that all states meet federal goals related to children 's safety , permanency , and well - being . acf and many state officials perceive the cfsr as a valuable process and a substantial undertaking , but some data enhancements could improve its reliability . acf staff in 8 of the 10 regions considered the cfsr a helpful tool to improve outcomes for children . further , 26 of 36 states responding to a relevant question in our survey commented that they generally or completely agreed with the results of the final cfsr report , even though none of the 41 states with final cfsr reports released through 2003 has achieved substantial conformity on all 14 outcomes and systemic factors . additionally , both acf and the states have dedicated substantial financial and staff resources to the process . nevertheless , several state officials and child welfare experts we interviewed questioned the accuracy of the data used in the review process . while acf officials contend that stakeholder interviews and case reviews complement the data profiles , many state officials and experts reported that additional data from the statewide assessment could bolster the evaluation of state performance . program improvement planning is under way , but uncertainties have affected the development , funding , and implementation of state pips . officials from 3 of the 5 states we visited said acf 's pip - related instructions were unclear , and at least 9 of the 25 states reporting on pip implementation in our survey said that insufficient funding and staff were among the greatest challenges . while acf has provided some guidance , acf and state officials remain uncertain about pip monitoring efforts and how acf will apply financial penalties if states fail to achieve their stated pip objectives . since 2001 , acf 's focus has been almost exclusively on the cfsrs and regional staff report limitations in providing assistance to states in helping them to meet key federal goals . while staff from half of acf 's regions told us they would like to provide more targeted assistance to states , and state officials in all 5 of the states we visited said that acf 's existing technical assistance efforts could be improved , acf officials acknowledged that regional staff might still be adjusting to the new way acf oversees child welfare programs .
congress established the superfund program in 1980 to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites . among other things , the law established a trust fund to help the environmental protection agency ( epa ) pay for cleanups and related program activities . the trust fund was financed primarily by three dedicated taxes until 1995 , when the taxing authority expired . epa continues to discover sites eligible for cleanup under the superfund program . gao was asked to examine the current status of the superfund program , the factors guiding epa 's selection of sites to be placed on its national priorities list , and the program 's future outlook . the balance of the superfund trust fund available for future appropriations has decreased significantly since 1996 , while highly contaminated hazardous waste sites continue to be added to the national priorities list ( npl ) , epa 's list of the nation 's most contaminated sites . a decline in revenues to the trust fund has led the superfund program to rely increasingly on appropriations from the general fund . in epa 's fiscal year 2004 budget request for the superfund program , the general fund appropriation would make up about 80 percent of the program 's total appropriation . at the end of fiscal year 2002 , the npl had 1,233 sites in various stages of cleanup . epa considers many factors in selecting from the sites that are eligible to be listed , the most prominent of which are the availability of alternative federal or state programs that could be used to clean up the site , the status of responsible parties associated with the sites , and the cost and complexity of the cleanup required . as the superfund program continues to add sites to the npl and funding sources shift toward general fund appropriations , the effect of epa 's actions to address future program challenges remains uncertain . because superfund lacks indicators to fully measure the outcomes of the program 's cleanup efforts , epa has asked an advisory council to develop criteria by which to measure the program 's progress . however , it is unclear whether the advisory council will reach consensus on its recommendations , and its findings are not expected until december 2003 , at the earliest . performance indicators could help epa and the congress make the difficult funding , policy , and program decisions that the current budget environment demands .
the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act of 1999 ( act ) created the national veterans business development corporation ( the veterans corporation ) to address perceived gaps in providing small business and entrepreneurship assistance to veterans . the act requires gao to review the veterans corporation . gao described the veterans corporation 's efforts to provide small business assistance to veterans , including service - disabled veterans ; use of and controls over federal funds in providing these services ; and efforts to become financially self - sufficient . the veterans corporation is providing veterans with entrepreneurial training , on - line educational resources , micro loans , business insurance , and an on - line marketplace . the veterans corporation identified initial challenges that slowed program progress , including getting information on transitioning military personnel ; and veteran - owned businesses ; and delays in making management appointments . because the programs are new , it is too early to determine their effectiveness . during its first 2 years of operation , the veterans corporation spent about $ 5 of $ 8 million in total federal appropriations ; about $ 1 million in fiscal year 2001 ; and about $ 4 million in fiscal year 2002 , with the largest part of the increase due to salaries and program costs . an external audit for fiscal year 2001 identified internal control issues , such as the lack of adequate supporting documentation for disbursements and untimely reconciliation of bank accounts . according to the external auditor , all but one of the deficiencies was addressed in 2002. the veterans corporation has developed a financial self - sufficiency plan based on four major revenue sources -- an on - line marketplace , a credit card program , an insurance service program , and fund - raising . at the time of gao 's review , most of these efforts were just beginning to produce revenue . according to the plan , the veterans corporation is not expected to achieve self - sufficiency until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004. if outcomes do not meet projections , veterans corporation officials stated that they would explore alternatives .
congress has established a legislative framework that shapes the careers and the management of general and flag officers . the department of defense ( dod ) has proposed eliminating or amending a number of legislative provisions , such as revising existing statutory retirement limits based on age and years of service , to provide greater flexibility in managing its senior officers in order to retain experienced leaders . gao is issuing this report in response to a mandate in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003. gao 's objectives were to develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and assess dod 's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals . general and flag officers who have retired over the past several years typically retired at age 56 after having served an average of 33 years of active commissioned service and 3-1 / 2 years in their last pay grade . on average , retired general and flag officers were first promoted to general and flag officer at age 49 , upon reaching 26 years of active commissioned service , and served 6 years as a general or flag officer before retiring . dod did not present evidence that the legislative provisions it seeks to change hinder the management of general and flag officers or the agency 's ability to perform its mission . dod presented various rationales for its proposals and sponsored a study of general and flag officer management but did not provide data to support the need for these proposals . gao found that dod can achieve its goal of extending some general and flag officers ' careers and assignments within the parameters of the current legislative framework since many general and flag officers retire several years before reaching the statutory retirement limits . more specifically , the career profile data show that more than three - fourths of general and flag officers who retired in grades o - 9 and o - 10 between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 could have served at least 3 more years before reaching the current statutory retirement limits . existing legislative authority provides some flexibility in managing general and flag officers , but the executive branch has not made frequent use of this authority . in particular , the executive branch has rarely used its existing authority to defer the retirement of general and flag officers on a case - by - case basis beyond the statutory limits on age and years of service . additionally , factors other than the statutory limits , such as personal considerations and military service culture , may account for early retirements of general and flag officers . gao also found that the proposals would reduce congressional oversight and provide broad latitude to the executive branch in managing general and flag officers , could impede the upward flow of officers by limiting promotion opportunities due to the extension of general and flag officer careers , and would likely increase federal retirement outlays for retirement compensation , based on a cost estimate developed by gao .
some economists predict that by 2030 , the united states could experience a labor shortage of 35 million workers . as the shortage approaches , one option available is to encourage people to work beyond traditional retirement ages , especially because people who are age 55 or older will constitute nearly a third of the poppulation . accordingly , increasing demands will be made on the workforce development system to help ensure that older workers are provided opportunities to help address the anticipated labor shortage . concerned that the existing workforce development system may not meet the needs of older workers , the subcommittee 's ranking minority member asked gao to determine the extent that older workers are enrolled in federal employment and training programs , what services are provided , and how performance measures affect such services . about 12 percent of the 1.3 million older people who were not working and wanted a job were enrolled in these programs between july 2000 and june 2001. some older workers received services without being enrolled in a program but these people were not counted in program statistics . the majority of older people enrolled received subsidized jobs through the senior community service employment program . about one - third participated in programs funded by the workforce investment act and trade adjustment assistance . most of the older workers enrolled in these programs received job search assistance , such as help in preparing for interviews and writing resumes , but some also received job training . research findings have been inconsistent as to whether older workers have distinct learning needs , but workforce investment act program providers are less likely now than in the past to have separate programs for older workers . the workforce investment act requires program providers to report certain information so that labor can determine how well programs are performing . these performance measures include how many participants find jobs and how much their earnings have increased . program providers report that some performance measures provide a disincentive to enrolling older workers into the program because of employment characteristics that may negatively affect program performance . for example , in 6 of 10 the local areas we visited , officials said they considered performance measures a barrier to enrolling older workers seeking part - time jobs because they would have lower earnings and therefore reduce program performance . consequently , some older workers may only receive job search assistance and not have access to in - depth services , such as computer training .
gao has reported that the department of defense 's ( dod ) inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements is a long - term , major problem . gao was requested to determine the magnitude of the adjustments and related costs in fiscal year 2002 , why contracts , including payment terms , are so complex , the key factors that caused defense finance and accounting service ( dfas ) columbus to make payment adjustments , and what steps dod is taking to address the payment allocation problems . for fiscal year 2002 , dfas columbus data showed that about $ 1 of every $ 4 in contract payment transactions in the mocas system was for adjustments to previously recorded payments -- $ 49 billion of adjustments out of $ 198 billion in transactions . to research payment allocation problems , dfas columbus reported that it incurred costs of about $ 34 million in fiscal year 2002. this represents about 35 percent of the total $ 97 million that dfas columbus spent on contract pay services . dfas columbus bills dod activities for contract pay services based on the number of accounting lines on an invoice . consequently , all dod activities pay the same line rate , regardless of whether substantial work is needed to reconcile problem contracts and adjust payment records . gao 's analysis of two contracts showed that the contracts were complex because of the legal and dod requirements to track and report on the funds used to finance the contracts , substantial number of modifications made on the contracts to procure goods and / or services , and different pricing provisions on the contracts . gao 's review of $ 160 million of adjustments showed that the adjustments were made for four reasons . the army made an error in accounting for obligations , resulting in about $ 127 million in payment allocation adjustments . dfas columbus did not follow its internal procedures for allocating payments to accounts on an army contract containing multiple pricing provisions , resulting in about $ 5 million in adjustments . dfas made over $ 2 million in adjustments to correct recording errors on an army contract due to complex and changing payment instructions . the air force frequently changed payment instructions after payments were made on an air force contract , resulting in about $ 26 million in adjustments . dod has initiated a major long - term effort to improve its business operations , including its acquisition and disbursement activities . if implemented successfully , this initiative may help correct many of the contract payment allocation problems . in the interim , dod has initiatives under way to address payment allocation problems , including billing dod contracting offices for contract reconciliation services , providing dod activities information on the correct method for presenting payment instructions , and establishing a working group to develop options for presenting standard contract payment instructions . while the dod working group initiative may reduce payment allocation errors associated with misinterpreting contract payment instructions , dod needs to automate the standard payment instructions to eliminate payment allocation errors associated with manually allocated payments .
encouraging a clearer and closer link between budgeting and planning is essential to improving federal management and instilling a greater focus on results . through work at various levels within the organization , this report on the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) -- and its two companion studies on the administration for children and families ( gao - 03-09 ) and the veterans health administration ( gao - 03-10 ) -- documents what managers considered successful efforts at creating linkages between planning and performance information to influence resource choices and the challenges managers face in creating these linkages . although in differing stages of implementation throughout nrc , nrc designed the planning , budgeting , and performance management process ( pbpm ) to better integrate its strategic planning , budgeting , and performance management processes . pbpm links four individual components : setting the agency 's strategic direction , determining activities and performance targets of component offices and related resources , executing the budget and monitoring performance targets and taking corrective actions , if needed , to achieve those targets , and assessing agency progress toward achieving its goals . gao 's report provides examples of how the pbpm framework can influence budget formulation and execution decisions . these examples show how nrc informs its resource allocation decisions by providing strategic direction to operating units prior to budget formulation , how operating units that have implemented these processes link strategic direction to budgets through tools that set priorities and assign resources to office activities to accomplish these priorities , and how operating units monitor performance targets and make adjustments as necessary during budget execution . in addition , agency managers have told gao that pbpm also promotes agencywide coordination of budget formulation and execution decisions by providing a common language and common goals . integrating budget and planning processes and improving performance management in nrc is an ongoing effort that includes addressing a series of challenges . they are creating performance measures that balance competing goals and keep performance measures current , associating resource requests with outcomes , standardizing pbpm practices and techniques but still allowing some flexibility among offices to tailor the process to their needs , developing the assessment component , and committing significant effort to maintain pbpm . in addition , nrc must continue developing a cost accounting system to support pbpm .
with annual obligations for goods and services totaling $ 1.7 billion , the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) is one of the largest of 23 entities coming into the department of homeland security ( dhs ) . ins 's procurement organization will continue to acquire goods and services under dhs . gao was asked to review ins 's contracting processes to assess whether ins has an adequate infrastructure to manage its acquisitions and to determine whether ins is following sound contracting policies and procedures in awarding and managing individual contracts . ins does not have the basic infrastructure -- including oversight , information , and an acquisition workforce -- in place to ensure that its contracting activity is effective . oversight of procurement is difficult because procurement managers are placed at a low level within the organization , and they do not have the leverage to hold employees across the agency accountable for compliance with procurement policies . further , procurement activities are not coordinated well because ins has not made effective use of cross - functional teams -- consisting of procurement , program , budget , financial , and legal representatives -- throughout the acquisition process . procurement managers are unable to make strategic decisions that would allow them to maximize spending power across the agency because ins 's information systems do not provide visibility into what is being spent agencywide for goods and services and who the major vendors are . ins 's acquisition workforce is struggling to manage effectively large and mission - critical procurements . despite growth in mission requirements and the overall workforce during the past decade , the agency has not been able to attract and retain the necessary contracting staff . further , ins lacks a strategic acquisition workforce plan to help identify the knowledge , skills , and abilities the agency needs to ensure it can meet current and future requirements . in addition , acquisition planning , competition , and contractor monitoring have been inadequate on some large contracts . the lack of adequate advanced planning for several detention center contracts and one large information technology management contract limited opportunities for full and open competition . contractor performance monitoring has , in some cases , been inadequate to provide assurance that ins received the goods or services it paid for or that quality standards were met . gao did not find significant or widespread compliance problems with other contract criteria we reviewed . because ins has become a significant part of dhs and brings with it a procurement function that needs attention , it is imperative for dhs leadership to address these problems early in the development of the new department .
changes in the department of defense 's ( dod ) mission can lead to changes in inventory requirements , which , in turn , determine the size of dod 's inventory . since 1990 , gao has identified dod 's management of inventory as a high - risk area because levels of inventory were too high and management systems and procedures were ineffective . furthermore , dod has attributed readiness problems to parts shortages . in this report , gao provides information on changes in and make up of the department 's inventory and analyzes changes in inventory requirements , focusing on the navy . dod reported a $ 5.6 billion increase in inventory on hand and a $ 1.7 billion increase in inventory on order between september 30 , 1999 , and september 30 , 2001. the reported inventory increases were primarily due to the navy reporting aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons that were previously not reported and to overall dod inventory requirements increases . in addition , gao identified large imbalances in the department 's inventory ; as of september 30 , 2001 , over 1.7 million items had $ 38 billion of inventory that exceeded the items ' current inventory operating requirements of $ 24.9 billion . at the same time , there were 523,000 items that needed an additional $ 10.4 billion of inventory to meet the items ' current inventory operating requirements . generally , inventory increases are the result of increases in inventory requirements . dod 's overall inventory requirements increased by $ 10.6 billion , or 26 percent , between the end of fiscal years 1999 and 2001 , with some of the navy 's requirements being overstated . the navy was responsible for the largest dollar increase , $ 4.7 billion of the $ 10.6 billion increase . a large part of the navy increase , $ 3.4 billion , was attributable to a change in the way the navy accounted for aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons . the remaining navy increase was attributable to a variety of reasons , such as price increases ; increased demand and item wear - out rates ; and , in some cases , inaccurate data . also , since 1997 the navy has reduced the amount of administrative lead time it takes to place inventory orders ( the period between when the need to replenish an item through a purchase is identified and when a contract is let ) , yet it has not formally updated the data used to compute those requirements . for example , the navy reduced the administrative lead time for medium - sized sole - source contracts for repairable items from 200 days to 130 days , but it did not recognize the reduction in its requirements computations . as a result , those requirements are inaccurate and overstated .
the federal government is dramatically changing the way it purchases goods and services -- by relying more on judgment and initiative versus rigid rules to make purchasing decisions . at the same time , agencies are dealing with reductions in the civilian acquisition workforce . gao was asked to determine what efforts federal civilian agencies are making to address their future acquisition workforce needs . gao looked at the efforts six civilian agencies are undertaking to address their future acquisition workforce needs . together , these agencies account for about 72 percent of civilian agency contracting dollars . all of these agencies are taking steps to address their future acquisition workforce needs . three -- the departments of energy and veterans affairs ( va ) and the general services administration -- are developing specific plans to strengthen their acquisition workforces , and three others -- the departments of treasury and health and human services and the national aeronautics space administration ( nasa ) -- are including their acquisition workforces in their overall plans to strengthen human capital . all are implementing new or strengthening existing career development and training programs . nasa and va are also developing new information management systems . the agencies , however , are facing considerable challenges to making their human capital strategic plans and training programs a success . principally : most acquisition professionals will need to acquire a new set of skills focusing on business management . because of a more sophisticated acquisition environment , they can no longer be merely purchasers or process managers . instead , they will also need to be adept at analyzing business problems and assisting with developing strategies in the early stages of the acquisition . beyond this immediate transformation , it is difficult for agencies to forecast what will be needed in terms of numbers of workers , skills , and expertise in the years to come . rules , regulations , and agency missions are always changing , and budgets are constantly shifting . many agencies simply lack good data on their workforces , including information on workforce size and location , knowledge and skills , attrition rates , and retirement rates . this data is critical to mapping out the current condition of the workforce and deciding what needs to be done to ensure that the agency has the right mix of skills and talent for the future . in overcoming these challenges , agencies can learn from the department of defense ( dod ) , which has made progress in acquisition workforce strategic planning and has addressed some of the same issues . dod officials learned that the strategic planning effort was going to take a long time and that effective leadership and guidance , along with technology and sound methodology , were required to accurately forecast workforce needs .
the federal home loan bank system 's ( fhlbank system ) traditional approach to providing community and housing finance through 12 regional fhlbanks faces continual challenges due to consolidation in the financial services industry and the emergence of mortgage lenders with nationwide operations . in addition , the federal housing finance board ( fhfb ) , the system 's financial regulator , is analyzing the benefits and costs of potential changes to the system 's membership rules that would make it easier for financial institutions to join multiple fhlbank districts ( referred to as multidistrict membership ) . to provide information that would be helpful in assessing the potential safety and soundness implications of these developments , gao was asked among other items to determine whether key differences exist in the terms -- such as interest rates and collateral requirements -- that fhlbanks make on loans , also known as advances , to member financial institutions such as banks and thrifts and discuss fhfb 's oversight of the fhlbanks and safety and soundness data reporting requirements . federal statutes and regulations require that the fhlbanks set advance interest rates above their borrowing costs and fully secure advances with eligible forms of collateral , such as single - family mortgage loans . however , within this framework , each of the 12 fhlbanks has independent authority to set advance pricing terms , which can result in several significant key differences among the banks . for example , due to differing costs and business strategies , fhlbank advance interest rates may differ and many fhlbanks charge lower interest rates based on advance size while others do not . moreover , fhlbanks may set differing collateral requirements for their members . for example , one fhlbank allows its members to borrow up to 60 percent of the value of single family mortgages pledged as collateral to secure advances while another allows up to 85 percent . among the fhlbanks ' differing approaches to setting advance pricing terms , fhfb has not found that any practice results in significant violations of statute or regulation . however fhfb also collects collateral data from the fhlbanks that have questionable value in their current format for monitoring the system 's safety and soundness . because fhlbank officials do not have clear information about how fhfb would like the data reported , the fhlbanks use different reporting definitions and criteria , which limits the data 's analytical usefulness . moreover , fhfb has not collected data necessary to assess the current extent of competition within the fhlbank system and the implications of holding companies with subsidiaries that operate in multiple fhlbank districts as well as multidistrict membership .
since the mid - 1990s , gao has highlighted the need for the department of state and other agencies to establish a systematic process for determining their overseas staffing levels . to support this long - standing need and in support of the president 's management agenda , gao developed a framework for assessing overseas workforce size and identified options for rightsizing . because the framework was largely based on work at the u.s. embassy in paris , gao was asked to determine whether the rightsizing framework is applicable at u.s. embassies in developing countries . to accomplish this objective , we visited three u.s. embassies in west africa -- a medium - sized post in dakar , senegal ; and two small embassies in banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania -- and applied the framework and its corresponding questions there . gao 's rightsizing framework can be applied at u.s. embassies in developing countries . officials from the bureau of african affairs , and u.s. embassy officials in dakar , senegal ; banjul , the gambia ; and nouakchott , mauritania , said that the framework 's questions highlighted specific issues at each post that should be considered in determining staffing levels . officials in other state bureaus also believed that the security , mission , cost , and option components of the framework provided a logical basis for planning and making rightsizing decisions . at each of the posts gao visited , application of the framework and corresponding questions generally highlighted physical and technical security deficiencies that needed to be weighed against proposed staff increases ; mission priorities and requirements that are not fully documented or justified in the posts ' mission performance plans ; cost of operations data that were unavailable , incomplete , or fragmented across funding sources ; and rightsizing actions and other options that post managers should consider for adjusting the number of personnel .
technological advances and changes in workplace habits have increasingly affected the operating environment for time and attendance ( t & a ) reporting in recent years . perhaps the most significant influence on changes to t & a reporting , however , is advancing technology and the accelerated adoption of automation driven largely by the need for increased efficiency , as promoted by the government paperwork elimination act ( gpea ) . although focused on electronic systems that process information obtained from and provided to sources outside the government , gpea encourages agencies to seek internal applications of paperless systems and use of electronic signatures . this document provides agencies with the flexibility needed to streamline t & a reporting systems and reduce their costs while maintaining adequate internal control , updates the requirements for electronic signature control , and addresses the need for controls over alternative workplace arrangements .
officials at several federal uniformed police forces in the washington , d.c. , metropolitan area have raised concerns that disparities in pay and retirement benefits have caused their police forces to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining officers . these concerns have increased during the past year with the significant expansion of the federal air marshal program , which has created numerous relatively high - paying job opportunities for existing federal uniformed police officers and reportedly has lured many experienced officers from their uniformed police forces . gao 's objectives were to determine the differences that exist among selected federal uniformed police forces regarding entry - level pay , retirement benefits , and types of duties ; provide information on the differences in turnover rates among these federal uniformed police forces , including where officers who separated from the police forces went and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available and used to address turnover ; and provide information on possible difficulties police forces may have faced recruiting officers and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available to help these forces recruit officers . during fiscal year 2002 , entry - level police officer salaries varied by more than $ 10,000 across the 13 police forces , from a high of $ 39,427 per year to a low of $ 28,801 per year . four of the 13 police forces received federal law enforcement retirement benefits . between october 1 , 2002 , and april 1 , 2003 , 12 of the 13 police forces received pay increases , which narrowed the pay gap for entry - level officers at some of the 13 forces . officials at the 13 police forces reported that while officers performed many of the same types of duties , the extent to which they performed specialized functions varied . total turnover at the 13 police forces nearly doubled ( from 375 to 729 ) between fiscal years 2001 and 2002. additionally , during fiscal year 2002 , 8 of the 13 police forces experienced their highest annual turnover rates over the 6-year period , from fiscal years 1997 through 2002. sizable differences existed in the turnover rates among the 13 federal uniformed police forces during fiscal year 2002. the availability and use of human capital flexibilities to retain employees , such as retention allowances , varied . gao found that the increase in the number of separations across the 13 police forces between fiscal years 2001 and 2002 almost equaled the number of officers who left their forces to join the transportation security administration ( tsa ) . given that the buildup in staffing for tsa 's federal air marshal program has been substantially completed , the increase in turnover experienced in fiscal year 2002 at 12 of the 13 police forces may have been a one - time occurrence . officials at 9 of 13 police forces reported at least some difficulty recruiting officers . however , none of the police forces used important human capital flexibilities , such as recruitment bonuses and student loan repayments , during fiscal year 2002 .
the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , intensified long - standing concerns about the adequacy of safeguards and security at four nuclear weapons production sites and three national laboratories that design nuclear weapons -- most of these facilities store plutonium and uranium in a variety of forms . these facilities can become targets for such actions as sabotage or theft . the department of energy ( doe ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) -- a separately organized agency within doe -- are responsible for these facilities . nnsa plays a crucial role in managing the contractors operating many of these facilities to ensure that security activities are effective and in line with departmental policy . gao reviewed how effectively nnsa manages its safeguards and security program , including how it oversees contractor security operations . nnsa has not been fully effective in managing its safeguards and security program in four key areas . as a result , nnsa can not be assured that its contractors are working to maximum advantage to protect critical facilities and material from individuals seeking to inflict damage . defining clear roles and responsibilities : nnsa still has not fully defined clear roles and responsibilities for its headquarters and site operations . assessing sites ' security activities : without a stable and effective management structure and with ongoing confusion about roles and responsibilities , inconsistencies have emerged among nnsa sites on how they assess contractors ' security activities . consequently , nnsa can not be assured that all facilities are subject to the comprehensive annual assessments that doe policy requires . overseeing contractors ' corrective actions : to compound the problems in conducting security assessments , nnsa contractors do not consistently conduct required analyses in preparing corrective action plans . as a result , potential opportunities to improve physical security at the sites are not maximized because corrective actions are developed without fully considering the problems ' root causes , risks posed , or cost versus the benefit of taking corrective action . allocating staff : nnsa has shortfalls at its site offices in the total number of staff and in expertise , which could make it more difficult for site offices to effectively oversee security activities .
the department of defense ( dod ) planned to spend $ 7.9 billion on acquiring munitions in fiscal year 2002. ongoing military operations associated with the global war on terrorism have heightened concerns about the unified combatant commands having sufficient quantities of munitions . since 1994 , the dod inspector general and gao have issued numerous reports identifying weaknesses and expressing concerns about the accuracy of the process used by the department to determine munitions requirements . dod has improved its munitions requirements process by eliminating most of the systematic problems -- correcting questionable and inconsistently applied data , completing target templates , and resolving issues involving the level of detail that should be included in planning guidance . however , a fundamental problem remains unaddressed -- inadequate linkage between the near - term munitions needs of the combatant commands and the purchases made by the military services based on computations derived from the department 's munitions requirement determination process . the department 's munitions requirements process provides varied answers for current munitions acquisitions questions because of the aforementioned disjunction . as a result , the services , in the short term , are purchasing some critically needed munitions based on available funding and contractors ' production capacity . although this approach may be necessary in the short term , it raises questions as to whether over the long term it would position the services to make the most efficient use of appropriated funds and whether the needs of combatant commands to carry out their missions will be met .
drug effectiveness and adverse events can vary between children and adults and among racial and ethnic groups . the food and drug administration ( fda ) is authorized under the pediatric exclusivity provision to grant drug sponsors 6 months of additional exclusive marketing rights for conducting clinical drug studies in children . the best pharmaceuticals for children act of 2002 ( bpca ) expanded this provision to require fda to take into account the adequacy of minority representation in pediatric exclusivity studies . bpca also directed gao to evaluate the representation of minorities in such studies . gao examined the extent to which minority children are represented , whether drugs that treat diseases disproportionately affecting minority groups are studied under the provision , and fda 's monitoring of the representation of minority children in the studies . gao reviewed related fda documents , fda requests for pediatric studies and final study results , and interviewed fda officials and other experts . compared with the proportions of children from racial and ethnic minority groups in the u.s. population , smaller proportions of children from minority groups were included in the pediatric clinical drug studies requested by fda before the enactment of bpca that gao reviewed . however , fda required , and drug sponsors included , larger proportions of african american children in clinical studies for hypertension drugs because there is evidence that hypertension is more prevalent and more severe among african americans . furthermore , fda has requested that forthcoming studies for certain drugs include larger proportions of minority children . studies of some drugs that may be used to treat diseases or conditions that disproportionately affect minorities have been completed and additional such studies have been requested by fda . from january 4 , 2002 , through march 6 , 2003 , fda granted additional exclusive marketing rights to four drugs that may be used to treat conditions such as hypertension , type ii diabetes , and sickle cell anemia -- conditions or diseases that disproportionately affect minority children . during that time , fda also issued written requests for studies of six drugs for these conditions . fda does not have a system in place to serve as a single source of data to allow the agency to efficiently determine the extent of participation of children by racial and ethnic group under the pediatric exclusivity provision . gao found that some study reports submitted to fda from drug sponsors did not specify the race and ethnicity of all study participants . across all the studies for drugs granted additional exclusive marketing rights that gao reviewed , 86 percent of study participants were identifiable by race or ethnicity , but the race or ethnicity of 14 percent of study participants was unknown . in january 2003 , fda issued draft guidance recommending that drug sponsors use standard definitions for race and ethnicity in drug studies . however , drug sponsors are not required to use these definitions . fda has also begun to develop an agency - wide system to monitor demographic characteristics of study participants , such as age , sex , and race . fda agreed with the gao recommendation to specify the categories that sponsors should use to report minority representation as well as gao 's findings regarding the efficiency of its data collection systems . fda expressed concerns about the gao comparison of the proportion of minorities in drug studies to their proportion in the u.s. population . however , fda had previously used the methodology gao employed in its analyses of adult study participants .
making sure systems can work effectively together ( interoperability ) has been a key problem for the department of defense ( dod ) yet integral to its goals for enhancing joint operations . given the importance of being able to share intelligence data quickly , we were asked to assess dod 's initiative to develop a common ground - surface - based intelligence system and to particularly examine whether dod has adequately planned this initiative and whether its process for testing and certifying the interoperability of new systems is working effectively . dod relies on a broad array of intelligence systems to study the battlefield and identify and hit enemy targets . these systems include reconnaissance aircraft , satellites , and ground - surface stations that receive , analyze , and disseminate intelligence data . at times , these systems are not interoperable -- either for technical reasons ( such as incompatible data formats ) and / or operational reasons . such problems can considerably slow down the time to identify and analyze a potential target and decide whether to attack it . one multibillion - dollar initiative dod has underway to address this problem is to pare down the number of ground - surface systems that process intelligence data and upgrade them to enhance their functionality and ensure that they can work with other dod systems . the eventual goal is an overarching family of interconnected systems , known as the distributed common ground - surface system ( dcgs ) . to date , planning for this initiative has been slow and incomplete . dod is developing an architecture , or blueprint , for the new systems as well as an overarching test plan and an operational concept . although dcgs was started in 1998 , dod has not yet formally identified which systems are going to be involved in dcgs ; what the time frames will be for making selections and modifications , conducting interoperability tests , and integrating systems into the overarching system ; how transitions will be funded ; and how the progress of the initiative will be tracked . moreover , dod 's process for testing and certifying that systems will be interoperable is not working effectively . in fact , only 2 of 26 dcgs systems have been certified as interoperable . because 21 of the systems that have not been certified have already been fielded , dod has a greater risk that the new systems will not be able to share intelligence data as quickly as needed . certifications are important because they consider such things as whether a system can work with systems belonging to other military services without unacceptable workarounds and whether individual systems conform to broader architectures designed to facilitate interoperability across dod .
since its inception , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has undertaken numerous programs that have greatly advanced scientific and technological knowledge . nasa 's activities span a broad range of complex and technical endeavors . but the agency is at a critical juncture , and major management improvements are needed . in january of this year , we identified four challenges facing nasa : strengthening strategic human capital management , improving contract management ; controlling international space station costs , and reducing space launch costs . in summary , these challenges affect nasa 's ability to effectively run its largest programs . nasa 's ultimate challenge will be in tackling the root problems impeding those programs . this will require instituting a results - oriented culture that fosters knowledge sharing and empowers its workforce to accomplish programmatic goals ; ensuring that the agency adheres to management controls to prevent cost overruns and scheduling problems ; transforming the financial management organization so it better supports nasa 's core mission ; and sustaining commitment to change .
the local tv act required that gao perform an annual audit of the administration of the provisions of the act , and financial position of each applicant who receives a loan guarantee under the act , including the nature , amount , and purpose of investments made by the applicant . in fiscal year 2002 , the local tv program was funded ; however , because it was not fully implemented in that year , there were no loan guarantee applicants for gao to audit . therefore , this report primarily addresses whether program administration during fiscal year 2002 satisfied the provisions of the act . in december 2000 , the congress passed the launching our communities ' access to local television act of 2000 ( local tv act or act ) . the act created the local television loan guarantee program ( program or local tv program ) and established the local television loan guarantee board ( board ) to approve guaranteed loans , totaling no more than $ 1.25 billion , to finance projects that will provide local television access to households with limited over - the - air television broadcast signals or cable service . the board is comprised of the secretary of the treasury , the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system , the secretary of agriculture , and the secretary of commerce , or their designees . the department of agriculture ( usda ) rural utilities service serves as program administrator ( administrator ) . the local tv program has not been established in an expeditious fashion as specified by the act . given that funds were appropriated in november 2001 , thus starting the clock on the 120 days allowed for completing program regulations and underwriting criteria , the program should have been ready for implementation by march 2002. according to the board and administrator , three factors contributed to program delays : initial uncertainties over program funding , inadequate dedicated staff resources for program activities , and the decision to issue a proposed rule . as of the end of august 2003 , neither of these key documents , which provide the overall framework for the program , was ready for implementation , thus delaying lending activities and ultimately , realization of improved television reception in target areas throughout the united states . further , the full costs of administering the program , including those incurred by the respective agencies and departments providing support to the board , were not accumulated and charged to the program as called for by federal accounting standards . statement of federal financial accounting standard no.4 , managerial cost accounting standards requires federal agencies to capture the costs of federal programs to assist the congress in authorizing , modifying , and discontinuing programs and to provide agencies with reliable cost data for making informed managerial decisions and evaluating performance . further , the capacity to capture these costs going forward is key to fully recovering certain costs of administering the program through loan application and loan guarantee origination fees .
the department of defense ( dod ) has , in the past , lacked a strategic approach to human capital management . in april 2002 , dod issued two human capital strategic plans for military personnel . one plan addresses military personnel management and policies ; the second addresses quality of life issues affecting service members and their families . as a follow - on to its recent work on benefits for military personnel , gao reviewed the extent that these two plans , in addressing military benefits , promote the integration and alignment of human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and the use of reliable data to make human capital decisions -- two critical success factors for human capital planning . gao also reviewed dod 's plans for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans . dod 's human capital plans addressing military personnel and quality of life represent a positive step forward in fostering a more strategic approach to human capital management . the two plans lay some of the groundwork needed to incorporate benefits into the strategic management of human capital . the plans , for example , recognize that benefits are important elements to meeting recruiting and retention goals and to alleviating some of the hardships of military life . however , the two plans do not satisfy the two critical success factors gao has identified for human capital planning . the plans do not specifically address how dod will integrate and align benefits with other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals . dod 's plans identify a number of initiatives , but the plans do not describe how individual initiatives , many of which are studies , will work in conjunction with one another to meet dod 's goals and objectives . for example , one of dod 's initiatives is to study alternatives to the military retirement system , and another initiative is to study variable career lengths for officers . however , the human capital plans do not explain how these two initiatives may be integrated and aligned with each other to achieve desired outcomes . the military personnel strategic plan also does not identify outcome - oriented performance measures or discuss , at a strategic level , military workforce needs or gaps in meeting these needs -- the kinds of data used by high - performing organizations to manage their human capital . dod lacks a process for overseeing the progress and implementation of its human capital plans from a strategic vantage point . without such a process , dod may have difficulty integrating and aligning benefits and other human capital approaches to meet organizational goals and promoting a data - driven , performance - oriented approach to human capital management . moreover , an oversight process could help dod officials maintain the momentum of their strategic human capital planning efforts . dod is considering establishing a defense human resources board to maintain the viability of its strategic human capital planning , but dod officials have not determined the roles and responsibilities of the board .
the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks exposed the vulnerability of u.s. financial markets to wide - scale disasters . because the markets are vital to the nation 's economy , gao 's testimony discusses how the financial markets were directly affected by the attacks and how market participants and infrastructure providers worked to restore trading ; the steps taken by 15 important financial market organizations to address physical security , electronic security , and business continuity planning since the attacks ; and the steps the financial regulators have taken to ensure that the markets are better prepared for future disasters . the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks severely disrupted u.s. financial markets as the result of the loss of life , damage to buildings , loss of telecommunications and power , and restrictions on access to the affected area . however , financial market participants were able to recover relatively quickly from the terrorist attacks because of market participants ' and infrastructure providers ' heroic efforts and because the securities exchanges and clearing organizations largely escaped direct damage . the attacks revealed limitations in the business continuity capabilities of some key financial market participants that would need to be addressed to improve the ability of u.s. markets to withstand such events in the future . gao 's review of 15 stock exchanges , clearing organizations , electronic communication networks , and payments system providers between february and june 2002 showed that all were taking steps to implement physical and electronic security measures and had developed business continuity plans . however , some organizations still had limitations in one or more of these areas that increased the risk that their operations could be disrupted by future disasters . although the financial regulators have begun efforts to improve the resiliency of clearance and settlement functions within the financial markets , they have not fully developed goals , strategies , or sound practices to improve the resiliency of trading activities . in addition , the securities and exchange commission 's ( sec ) technology and operations risk oversight , which is increasingly important , has been hampered by program , staff , and resource issues . gao 's report made recommendations designed to better prepare the markets to deal with future disasters and to enhance sec 's technology and operations risk oversight capabilities .
nationwide , underground storage tanks ( ust ) containing petroleum and other hazardous substances are leaking , thereby contaminating the soil and water , and posing health risks . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , which implements the ust program with the states , required tank owners to install leak detection and prevention equipment by the end of 1993 and 1998 respectively . the congress asked gao to determine to what extent tanks comply with the requirements , epa and the states are inspecting tanks and enforcing requirements , upgraded tanks still leak , and epa and states are cleaning up these leaks . in response , gao conducted a survey of all states in 2000 and issued a report on its findings in may 2001. this testimony is based on that report , as well as updated information on program performance since that time . gao estimated in its may 2001 report that 89 percent of the 693,107 tanks subject to ust rules had the leak prevention and detection equipment installed , but that more than 200,000 tanks were not being operated and maintained properly , increasing the chance of leaks . states responding to our survey also reported that because of such problems , even tanks with the new equipment continued to leak . epa and the states attributed these problems primarily to poorly trained staff . while epa is working with states to identify additional training options , in december 2002 , epa reported that at least 19 to 26 percent of tanks still have problems . epa and states do not know how many upgraded tanks still leak because they do not physically inspect all tanks . epa recommends that tanks be inspected once every 3 years , but more than half of the states do not do this . in addition , more than half of the states lack the authority to prohibit fuel deliveries to problem tanks -- one of the most effective ways to enforce compliance . states said they did not have the funds , staff , or authority to inspect more tanks or more strongly enforce compliance . as of september 2002 , epa and states still had to ensure completion of cleanups for about 99,427 leaks , and initiation of cleanups at about another 43,278. states also face potentially large , but unknown , future workloads in addressing leaks from abandoned and unidentified tanks . some states said that their current program costs exceed available funds , so states may seek additional federal support to help address this future workload .
over the years , the traveling public , flight attendants , and the medical community have raised questions about how airliner cabin air quality contributes to health effects , such as upper respiratory infections . interest in cabin air quality grew in 2003 when a small number of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) infections may have occurred on board aircraft serving areas that were experiencing outbreaks of the disease . in 2001 , a national research council report on airliner cabin air quality and associated health effects recommended that additional research be done on the potential health effects of cabin air . gao reviewed what is known about the health effects of cabin air , the status of actions recommended in the 2001 national research council report , and whether available technologies should be required to improve cabin air quality . despite a number of studies of the air contaminants that airline passengers and flight attendants are potentially exposed to , little is known about their associated health effects . reports on airliner cabin air quality published by the national research council in 1986 and 2001 concluded that more research was needed to determine the nature and extent of health effects on passengers and cabin crew . although significant improvements have been made to aircraft ventilation systems , cabin occupants are still exposed to allergens and infectious agents , airflow rates that are lower than those in buildings , and air pressures and humidity levels that are lower than those normally present at or near sea level . the 2001 national research council report on airliner cabin air quality made 10 recommendations , 9 of which directed the federal aviation administration ( faa ) to collect more data on the potential health effects of cabin air and to review the adequacy of its standards for cabin air quality . faa has addressed these 9 recommendations to varying degrees as it attempts to balance the need for more research on cabin air with other research priorities ( e.g . , passenger safety ) . however , some in the aviation community , including some of the committee members who produced the report on cabin air , do not feel that faa 's planned actions will address these recommendations adequately . for example , most members were concerned that faa 's plan for implementing the report 's key recommendations on the need for more comprehensive research on the health effects of cabin air was too limited . faa plans to address these recommendations in two parts -- the first , which started in december 2003 , and the second , which will start in december 2004 and end in late 2006 or early 2007. however , faa lacks a comprehensive plan , including key milestones and funding needs . in addition , most committee members thought that faa 's response to a recommendation for it to improve public access to information on the health risks of flying was inadequate . we also had difficulty accessing this information on faa 's web site . several technologies are available today that could improve cabin air quality , ( e.g . , increasing cabin humidity and pressure or absorbing more cabin odors and gasses ) ; however , opinions vary on whether faa should require aircraft manufacturers and airlines to use these technologies . gao found that one available technology , high - efficiency particulate air ( hepa ) filtering , was strongly endorsed by cabin air quality and health experts as the best way to protect cabin occupants ' health from viruses and bacteria in recirculated cabin air . while faa does not require the use of these filters , gao 's survey of major u.s. air carriers found that 85 percent of large commercial airliners in their fleets that recirculate cabin air and carry more than 100 passengers already use these filters . however , the use of hepa filters in smaller commercial aircraft that carry fewer than 100 passengers is much lower . the cost to retrofit the smaller aircraft to accept the hepa filter , if it were made mandatory , could be expensive .
in october 2001 , in response to the taliban regime 's protection of al qaeda terrorists who attacked the united states , coalition forces forcibly removed the regime from afghanistan . in december 2002 , congress passed the afghanistan freedom support act authorizing assistance funds to help afghanistan rebuild a stable , democratic society . the act directed gao to monitor the implementation of u.s. humanitarian and development assistance . this report analyzes , for fiscal years 2002-2003 , u.s. obligations and expenditures in afghanistan , results of assistance projects , the assistance coordination mechanisms and strategy , and major obstacles that affected the achievement of u.s. goals . of the $ 900 million that the u.s. government spent on nonsecurity - related assistance in afghanistan in fiscal years 2002-2003 , over 75 percent supported humanitarian efforts , including emergency food and shelter , and over 20 percent supported longer - term reconstruction . usaid , the department of state , and the department of defense spent $ 508 million , $ 254 million , and $ 64 million , respectively , for humanitarian , quick - impact , and some longer - term projects . u.s. funding represented about 38 percent of the $ 3.7 billion the international community disbursed over the 2-year period . u.s. humanitarian and short - term assistance benefited afghanistan , but longerterm reconstruction efforts achieved limited results by the end of fiscal year 2003 due to late funding . by providing food and shelter to returning refugees and other vulnerable populations , early u.s. assistance helped avert a humanitarian crisis . usaid 's and defense 's quick - impact projects also helped rebuild smallscale infrastructure such as schools and bridges . usaid initiated several longerterm reconstruction activities , such as repairing the kabul - kandahar road and starting a democracy program . however , because of delays in funding most major assistance contracts were not signed until summer 2003 , limiting the results in fiscal years 2002-2003. u.s. coordination mechanisms for afghanistan assistance were generally effective , but international assistance was not well coordinated in fiscal years 2002-2003. in addition , the united states lacked a complete and integrated assistance strategy , which hampered the u.s. government 's ability to focus available resources and hold itself accountable for measurable results . further , u.s. officials responsible for coordinating efforts lacked complete financial data , which hindered their ability to oversee the assistance . in fiscal years 2002-2003 , afghanistan confronted many obstacles that other postconflict nations have faced , such as multiple competing parties . in addition , security deteriorated and opium production increased , thereby jeopardizing u.s. reconstruction efforts . lack of staff , poor working conditions , and delayed reconstruction funding further impeded u.s. efforts . in september 2003 , to expedite progress , the u.s. government announced the `` accelerating success '' initiative , providing $ 1.76 billion for reconstruction in 2004 .
each year , about 2.5 million people file claims with the social security administration ( ssa ) for disability benefits . if the claim is denied at the initial level , the claimant may appeal to the hearings level . the hearings level has allowed more than half of all appealed claims , an allowance rate that has raised concerns about the consistency of decisions made at the two levels . to help ensure consistency , ssa began a `` process unification '' initiative in 1994 and recently announced a new proposal to strengthen its disability programs . this report examines the status of ssa 's process unification initiative , ssa 's assessments of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels , and whether ssa 's new proposal incorporates changes to improve consistency in decisions between adjudication levels . ssa has only partially implemented its process unification initiative . although the agency initially made improvements in its policies and training intended to address inconsistency in decisions made at the two adjudication levels , it has not continued to actively pursue these efforts . further , as part of this initiative , the agency implemented a review of hearings level decisions to identify ways to improve training and policies , but no new improvements were made as a result of the review . finally , the agency began tests of two process changes intended to improve the consistency of decision making between the two adjudication levels . one test , which is ongoing , was not well designed and therefore will not provide conclusive results . the other test was abandoned because of implementation difficulties . ssa 's assessments have not provided a clear understanding of the extent and causes of possible inconsistencies in decisions between adjudication levels . the two measures ssa uses to monitor inconsistency of decisions have weaknesses , such as not accounting for the many factors that can affect decision outcomes , and therefore do not provide a true picture of the changes in consistency . furthermore , ssa has not sufficiently assessed the causes of possible inconsistency . for example , ssa conducted an analysis in 1994 that identified potential areas of inconsistency , but it did not employ more sophisticated techniques -- such as multivariate analyses , followed by in - depth case studies -- that would allow the agency to identify and address the key areas and leading causes of possible inconsistency . ssa has yet to repeat or expand upon this 10-year - old study . ssa 's new proposal incorporates changes intended to improve consistency in decisions between levels . however , challenges may hinder its implementation . most stakeholder groups for adjudicators and claimant representatives told us that a number of aspects of the proposal hold promise for improving consistency . these included one change , being tested as part of the process unification initiative , that requires state adjudicators to more fully develop and document their decisions , as well as several new changes , such as providing both adjudication levels with equal access to medical expertise . however , stakeholder groups also told us that insufficient resources and other obstacles might hinder the implementation of some changes . adding to uncertainties about the proposal 's overall success is its dependence on a new electronic folder system that would allow cases to be easily accessed by various adjudicators across the country . however , this technically complex project has not been fully tested .
the maritime transportation security act of 2002 , as implemented by the coast guard , calls for owners and operators of about 3,150 port facilities ( such as shipping terminals or factories with hazardous materials ) and about 9,200 vessels ( such as cargo ships , ferries , and tugs and barges ) to develop and implement security plans by july 1 , 2004. the coast guard intends to conduct on - site compliance inspections of all facilities by january 1 , 2005 , and all vessels by july 1 , 2005 , to ensure plans are adequately implemented . the coast guard estimated the act 's security improvements would cost $ 7.3 billion over 10 years -- most of it borne by facility and vessel owners and operators . gao was asked to assess the progress towards developing , reviewing , and approving plans by july 1 , 2004 , the coast guard 's monitoring and oversight strategy for ensuring that plans are implemented , and the accuracy of the coast guard 's cost estimate . owners and operators have made progress in developing security plans for their port facilities and vessels . however , the extent to which the coast guard will have reviewed and approved the approximately 12,300 individual plans by july 1 , 2004 , varies considerably . about 5,900 plans were being developed under an option allowing owners and operators to self - certify that they would develop and implement plans by july 1 , using industry - developed , coast guard - approved standards and templates . these individual plans will not be reviewed before july 1 unless owners or operators choose to submit them for review . the remaining 6,400 plans went through a review process established by the coast guard . every plan required revisions , some of which were significant . as of june 2004- - 1 month before the deadline for implementation -- more than half of the 6,400 plans were still in process . the coast guard took steps to speed up the process and to allow facilities and vessels to continue operating with less than full plan approval after july 1 , as long as the coast guard was satisfied with their progress . the coast guard 's strategy for monitoring and overseeing security plan implementation will face numerous challenges . whether the coast guard will be able to conduct timely on - site compliance inspections of all facilities and vessels is uncertain because questions remain about whether the coast guard will have enough inspectors ; a training program sufficient to overcome major differences in experience levels ; and adequate guidance to help inspectors conduct thorough , consistent reviews . another challenge is to ensure inspections reflect assessments of the normal course of business at facilities and aboard vessels . the accuracy of the coast guard 's $ 7.3 billion estimate for implementing security improvements is likewise uncertain . the estimate , while a goodfaith effort on the coast guard 's part , is based on limited data and on assumptions that are subject to error . the estimate should be viewed more as a rough indicator than a precise measure of costs .
the ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and effectively manage the day - to - day operations of the federal government and provide accountability to taxpayers has been a long - standing challenge to most federal agencies . to help address this challenge , the federal financial management improvement act of 1996 ( ffmia ) requires the 23 chief financial officers act agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements , applicable federal accounting standards , and the u.s. government standard general ledger ( sgl ) at the transaction level . ffmia also requires gao to report annually on the implementation of the act . federal agencies continue to make progress in addressing their financial management weaknesses ; however , for fiscal year 2003 , auditors for 17 of the 23 cfo act agencies still reported that agencies ' financial management systems failed to comply with ffmia . the nature and severity of the reported problems indicate that generally agency management lacked the full range of reliable , useful , and timely information needed for accountability , performance reporting , and decision making . six main types of problems related to agencies ' systems were consistently identified . as prescribed in omb 's reporting guidance , auditors for six agencies provided negative assurance on agency systems ' ffmia compliance for fiscal year 2003. this means that nothing came to their attention to indicate that financial management systems did not meet ffmia requirements . gao continues to believe that this type of reporting is not sufficient under the act and that report users may have the false impression that auditors have reported agency systems to be compliant . to address problems such as nonintegrated systems , inadequate reconciliations , and lack of sgl compliance , agencies are implementing or upgrading financial management systems . agencies anticipate the new systems will provide reliable , useful , and timely data to support managerial decision making . however , our work at dod , hhs , and nasa has shown significant problems exist in implementing financial management systems and that agencies are not following the necessary disciplined processes for efficient and effective implementation of these systems . disciplined processes have been shown to reduce the risks associated with software development and acquisition efforts to acceptable levels and are fundamental to successful system acquisition and implementation . moreover , governmentwide initiatives to improve financial management systems can help enhance the government 's performance and services for citizens .
the maritime administration ( marad ) has more than 100 obsolete and deteriorating ships awaiting disposal that pose potentially costly environmental threats to the waterways near where they are stored . congress , in 2000 , mandated that marad dispose of them by september 30 , 2006. while marad has various disposal options available , each option is complicated by legal , financial , and regulatory factors . in this report , gao assesses whether marad will meet the september 2006 disposal deadline for these ships and , if not , why not ; the extent that marad has used alternative disposal methods other than scrapping , and barriers to using other methods ; the appropriateness of marad 's methods for procuring ship disposal services ; and the impact of foreign competition and other factors on reducing disposal costs . marad is unlikely to meet its statutory deadline of september 30 , 2006. as of september 2004 , marad had disposed of 18 ships from its inventory , with over 100 ships left to dispose of by the deadline . marad 's current approach is not sufficient for disposing of these remaining ships within the next 2 years . marad 's slow progress is due primarily to program leaders not developing a comprehensive management approach that could address the myriad of environmental , legal , and regulatory challenges that the program faces . marad 's approach lacks an integrated strategy with goals , milestones , performance measures , and a mitigation plan for overcoming anticipated impediments . in the absence of this comprehensive approach , marad 's ship disposal program lacks the vision needed to sustain a long - term effort . consequently , marad has not been able to assure congress that it can dispose of these ships in a timely manner to reduce the threat of a costly environmental event , nor has it clearly articulated what additional congressional assistance , such as funding , may be needed . while marad has considered alternative disposal methods to scrapping , it has made limited use of these methods because of a number of environmental , financial , and legislative barriers . since fiscal year 2001 , marad has disposed of 17 ships through scrapping , but only 1 through artificial reefing . marad has not disposed of ships using deep - water sinking and donations to historic organizations . marad has taken positive steps to reduce barriers limiting its use of these methods but still may be years away from increasing the number of disposals using these alternative methods because it has not developed an overall plan for expanding their use . consequently , marad may be losing opportunities that could expedite the disposal of the obsolete ships in its inventory . since fiscal year 2002 , marad has relied almost entirely on an inappropriate procurement method -- program research and development announcements ( prda ) -- to acquire ship scrapping services . the federal acquisition regulation and the competition in contracting act of 1984 generally require that marad use other methods for acquiring these types of services . prdas may only be used to contract for research or development . according to marad , prdas provide greater flexibility and allow firms to propose innovative solutions to ship disposal . gao found , however , that marad was not contracting for research or development but instead was acquiring ship scrapping services . marad 's use of prdas has also resulted in a lack of transparency in the contract award process and has raised concerns among firms as to the fairness of marad 's processes . while gao was unable to isolate the specific impact of foreign competition and other factors on reducing ship disposal costs , marad attributes the decrease in ship disposal prices almost exclusively to foreign competition . however , other factors , such as larger annual program funding and increases in the scrap value of steel , may have also played a role .
since the events of september 11 , 2001 , the security of the nation 's drinking water and wastewater infrastructure has received increased attention from congress and the executive branch . wastewater facilities in the united states provide essential services to residential , commercial , and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters . these facilities , however , may possess certain characteristics that terrorists could exploit either to impair the wastewater treatment process or to damage surrounding communities and infrastructure . gao was asked to obtain experts ' views on the key security - related vulnerabilities affecting the nation 's wastewater systems , the activities the federal government should support to improve wastewater security , and the criteria that should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated to improve security , and the best methods to distribute these funds . gao conducted a systematic , web - based survey of 50 nationally recognized experts to seek consensus on these key wastewater security issues . epa expressed general agreement with the report , citing its value as the agency works with its partners to better secure the nation 's critical wastewater infrastructure . experts identified the collection system 's network of sewer lines as the most vulnerable asset of a wastewater utility . experts stated that the sewers could be used either as a means to covertly gain access to surrounding buildings or as a conduit to inject hazardous substances that could impair a wastewater treatment plant 's capabilities . among the other vulnerabilities most frequently cited were the storage and transportation of chemicals used in the wastewater treatment process and the automated systems that control many vital operations . in addition , experts described a number of vulnerabilities not specific to particular assets but which may also affect the security of wastewater facilities . these vulnerabilities include a general lack of security awareness among wastewater facility staff and administrators , interdependencies among various wastewater facility components leading to the possibility that the disruption of a single component could take down the entire system , and interdependencies between wastewater facilities and other critical infrastructures . experts identified several key activities as most deserving of federal funds to improve wastewater facilities ' security . among those most frequently cited was the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous alternatives . this activity was rated as warranting highest priority for federal funding by 29 of 50 experts . other security - enhancing activities most often rated as warranting highest priority included improving local , state , and regional collaboration ( 23 of 50 experts ) and supporting facilities ' efforts to comprehensively assess their vulnerabilities ( 20 of 50 experts ) . when asked how federal wastewater security funds should be allocated among potential recipients , the vast majority of experts suggested that wastewater utilities serving critical infrastructure ( e.g . , public health institutions , government , commercial and industrial centers ) should be given highest priority ( 39 of 50 ) . other recipients warranting highest priority included utilities using large quantities of gaseous chemicals ( 26 of 50 ) and utilities serving areas with large populations ( 24 of 50 ) . experts identified direct federal grants as the most effective method to distribute the funds , noting particular circumstances in which a matching contribution should be sought from recipients . specifically , a matching requirement was often recommended to fund activities that benefit individual utilities . grants with no matching requirements were often recommended for activities that should be implemented more quickly and would benefit multiple utilities . the other funding mechanisms experts mentioned most frequently included the federal clean water state revolving fund , loans or loan guarantees , trust funds , and tax incentives .
russia 's continued operation of three plutonium production reactors poses a serious proliferation threat . the department of energy 's ( doe ) elimination of weapons - grade plutonium production program seeks to facilitate the reactors ' closure by building or refurbishing replacement fossil fuel plants . this report describes doe 's efforts to manage and implement the program , assesses the challenges doe faces in achieving its goal of shutting down the reactors , and identifies doe 's current expenditures and projected program costs . doe is financing and managing the construction of two fossil fuel plants in russia that will replace the heat and electricity that will be lost with the shutdown of russia 's three plutonium production reactors . doe has developed an overall plan to manage its program , has selected two u.s. contractors to oversee the construction of replacement fossil fuel plants , and is working with its u.s. contractors to review specific design and construction plans for the plants . doe officials expressed concern that the number of organizations , 17 , involved in the program makes coordination difficult and has led to delays . additionally , doe and u.s. contractor officials said that the primary russian contractor may not have adequate experience and currently lacks enough staff to implement its part of the program . final shutdown of the reactors is uncertain because doe faces a number of challenges in implementing its program , including ensuring russia 's commitment to the nonproliferation and safety goals of the program , clarifying the existing reactor shutdown agreement , and working with russia to find employment for thousands of russian nuclear workers who will lose their jobs when the reactors are closed . russia 's rejection of doe 's proposals to reduce the amount of plutonium produced by the reactors and to improve the safety of the reactors before they are shut down raises serious questions about russia 's commitment to key program goals . furthermore , the existing reactor shutdown agreement contains shutdown dates that do not reflect doe 's planned program schedule . finally , the challenge of finding employment for russian nuclear workers could undermine the program by creating the potential for russia to continue operating the reactors longer than necessary to ensure jobs for the workers . doe has not developed a plan to address this issue . as of december 31 , 2003 , doe had spent $ 7.8 million -- about 4 percent of available funds on planning and developing the program , including travel , overhead , project administration , and document translation costs . regarding future program costs , doe officials told us that they expect the projected costs to build the replacement fossil fuel plants to be significantly higher than their original estimate of $ 466 million , possibly as much as $ 1 billion .
the technology used to cast and count votes is one aspect of the multifaceted u.s. election process . gao examined voting technology , among other things , in a series of reports that it issued in 2001 following the problems encountered in the 2000 election . in october 2002 , the congress enacted the help america vote act , which , among other things , established the election assistance commission ( eac ) to assist in the administration of federal elections . the act also established a program to provide funds to states to replace older punch card and lever machine voting equipment . as this older voting equipment has been replaced with newer electronic voting systems over the last 2 years , concerns have been raised about the vulnerabilities associated with certain electronic voting systems . among other things , gao 's testimony focuses on attributes on which electronic voting systems can be assessed , as well as design and implementation factors affecting their performance . gao also describes the immediate and longer term challenges confronting local jurisdictions in using any type of voting equipment , particularly electronic voting systems . an electronic voting system , like other automated information systems , can be judged on several bases , including how well its design provides for security , accuracy , ease of use , and efficiency , as well as its cost . for example , direct recording electronic systems offer advantages in ease of use because they can have features that accommodate voters with various disabilities , and they protect against common voter errors , such as overvoting ( voting for more candidates than is permissible ) ; a disadvantage of such systems is their capital cost and frequent lack of an independent paper audit trail . advantages of optical scan voting equipment ( another type of electronic voting system ) include capital cost and the enhanced security associated with having a paper audit trail ; disadvantages include lower ease of use , such as their limited ability to accommodate voters with disabilities . one important determinant of voting system performance is how it is designed and developed , including the testing that determines whether the developed system performs as designed . in the design and development process , a critical factor is the quality of the specified system requirements as embodied in applicable standards or guidance . for voting technology , these voluntary standards have historically been problematic ; the eac has now been given responsibility for voting system guidelines , and it intends to update them . the eac also intends to strengthen the process for testing voting system hardware and software . a second determinant of performance is how the system is implemented . in implementing a system , it is critical to have people with the requisite knowledge and skills to operate it according to well - defined and understood processes . the eac also intends to focus on these people and process factors in its role of assisting in the administration of elections . in the upcoming 2004 national election and beyond , the challenges confronting local jurisdictions in using electronic voting systems are similar to those facing any technology user . these challenges include both immediate and more long term challenges .
in fiscal year 2003 , the federal food stamp program made payment errors totaling about $ 1.4 billion in benefits , or about 7 percent of the total $ 21.4 billion in benefits provided to a monthly average of 21 million low - income participants . because payment errors are a misuse of public funds and can undermine public support of the program , it is important that the government minimize them . because of concerns about ensuring payment accuracy gao examined : what is included in the national food stamp payment error rate and how it has changed over time , what is known about the causes of food stamp payment errors , and what actions the food and nutrition service ( fns ) and states have taken to reduce these payment errors . to answer these questions , gao analyzed program quality control data for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 and interviewed program stakeholders , including state and local officials from nine states . the national dollar payment error rate for the food stamp program , which combines states ' overpayments and underpayments to program participants in all states , has declined by almost one - third over the last 5 years to a record low of 6.63 percent . this decline has been widespread ; the rate fell in 41 states and the district of columbia , and rates in 18 of these states fell by at least one - third . however , despite this decrease , some states continue to have relatively high payment error rates . for example , in 2003 , 7 states had payment error rates of more than 10 percent . almost two - thirds of food stamp payment errors are caused by caseworkers , usually when they fail to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules , and one - third are caused by participant failure to report required , complete , or correct information , such as household income and composition . state officials said program complexity and other factors , such as the lack of resources and staff turnover , can contribute to these errors . in fiscal year 2003 , states referred about 5 percent of all cases identified with errors for suspected participant fraud investigation . to increase food stamp payment accuracy , fns and the 9 states gao reviewed took many approaches that parallel good internal control practices . these efforts include increasing the leadership and accountability in the program , performing risk assessments to identify problem areas , implementing various program and process changes in response to the findings from risk assessments , and monitoring and promoting improved performance . the states are using a combination of approaches to improve payment accuracy , making it difficult to tie error rate improvements to specific practices . however , state officials point to their improved state error rates as evidence of a collective impact .
in 1967 , the congress created the national park foundation ( foundation ) -- a nonprofit organization with the sole purpose of providing private support to the national park service ( park service ) . however , some park service officials have raised concerns that the foundation 's support is not meeting parks ' priority needs . in this context , congressional requesters asked gao to review the activities of the foundation by determining the foundation 's roles and responsibilities for raising funds to support the park service , amount and kinds of donations the foundation has raised between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , and extent to which the contributions obtained by the foundation assisted the park service in addressing park priorities . in accordance with its legislative charter , the foundation raises private donations from a variety of sources and has broad discretion in how it distributes these donations to support the park service . in general , the foundation 's policy is to support systemwide projects that serve the park service and are not otherwise federally funded , such as supporting temporary transportation advisors to help alleviate congestion at national parks . overall , annual private donations to the foundation have more than doubled -- from $ 18 million in fiscal year 1999 to $ 41 million in fiscal year 2003. much of this increase has stemmed from the foundation 's concerted effort to target corporate donations , which accounted for the bulk of the donations received . most of the corporate donations are noncash or `` inkind , '' such as providing expertise to renovate the red bus fleet in glacier national park or providing electric vehicles to parks in california . corporate donors typically specify how their donations are to be used . for example , one corporation donated funds to renovate a national monument in the district of columbia . the foundation , in consultation with the park service , decided to use these funds to renovate the washington monument . because the majority of the foundation 's donations are restricted by the donors for a specific use , there are limited funds available to respond to some parks ' requests , such as for fund - raising assistance or support for local nonprofit groups . consequently , some park officials question the usefulness of foundation donations and believe support should be directed at park priorities . in an effort to raise more discretionary funds and possibly better support individual park needs , the foundation is expanding its fund - raising approach to attract more donations from individuals . the foundation 's efforts to assist the park service are hampered by poor communication and documentation problems . first , unlike most other partner relationships with the park service , the foundation and the park service do not have a comprehensive written agreement that clearly describes the foundation 's fund - raising strategy and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each partner . second , the foundation and the park service sometimes enter into verbal rather than written fund - raising agreements , thereby making it more difficult to determine the responsibilities of each party and whether commitments were met . third , foundation and park service officials disagree about the fund - raising strategy as well as the objectives for one of the foundation 's key fundraising programs . both parties have taken initial steps to address these and other communication problems .
many developing countries have expressed concern about their inability to take advantage of global trading opportunities . the united states considers this ability a key factor in reducing poverty , achieving economic growth , raising income levels , and promoting stability . u.s. trade capacity building assistance is designed to address these concerns . gao identified the nature and extent of u.s. trade capacity building ; described how agencies implement such assistance , including coordination ; and assessed whether agencies evaluate its effectiveness . u.s. trade capacity building is primarily a collection of existing trade and development activities placed under the umbrella of trade capacity building . the u.s. government initiated an annual governmentwide survey in 2001 to identify u.s. trade capacity building efforts , which it defined as assistance meant to help countries become aware of and accede to the world trade organization ( wto ) ; implement wto agreements ; and build the physical , human , and institutional capacity to benefit from trade . u.s. agencies self - reported that they had provided almost $ 2.9 billion in trade capacity building assistance to over 100 countries from fiscal years 2001 through 2004. the agency for international development ( usaid ) reported providing about 71 percent of the trade capacity building funding . agencies are coordinating their assistance through the trade capacity building interagency group formed in 2002 to help countries negotiate and implement u.s. free trade agreements . most of the u.s. agencies we reviewed are not systematically measuring the results of their trade capacity building assistance or evaluating its effectiveness . although some agencies have set program goals for building trade capacity , they have not generally developed performance indicators , compiled data , or analyzed the results in terms of building trade capacity . usaid 's march 2003 strategy for building trade capacity includes a limited number of performance indicators . usaid officials have stated that developing such indicators is difficult but have begun work independently and with other international donors toward that end . without a strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of its trade capacity building assistance , the united states can not identify what works and what does not work to ensure the reasonable use of resources for these efforts .
the university of california ( university ) operates the los alamos and lawrence livermore national laboratories for the department of energy 's national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) . the two research laboratories , with a combined fiscal year 2003 budget of $ 2.3 billion , have had problems in such mission support areas as managing projects , conducting business operations , and ensuring safe nuclear operations . gao was asked to describe the actions taken to address mission support problems identified in 2001 , as well as problems that have since emerged , and to assess the main challenges to sustaining mission support improvements . for the three mission support areas with problems as of 2001- - managing construction and other major projects , maintaining and managing existing facilities , and ensuring safe operations of nuclear facilities -- actions are basically complete in the first two areas but not in the third . for all three areas , nnsa incorporated new requirements into the contracts , developed new performance measures , and increased its oversight . the university of california has strengthened oversight of the laboratories by , among other things , establishing a new position of vice president for laboratory management . the laboratories will not fully comply with new requirements for providing a safety analysis of each nuclear facility until mid - 2005 . the actions taken by nnsa and the university to correct problems in project , facilities , and nuclear safety management were not systemic enough to keep problems from developing in other mission support areas after 2001. at the los alamos laboratory , emerging problems centered on business operations , including inadequate controls over procurement , purchase cards , and property management . the laboratory now has extensive corrective actions underway and expects to have most of the new measures in place by the end of 2005. at the lawrence livermore laboratory , the problems centered on emergency planning and preparedness , in that the laboratory had made little progress in developing an emergency management program that complied with nnsa requirements . the laboratory has taken steps over the past 2 years to improve in this area , and nnsa now estimates that the laboratory will have an approved emergency management program by the end of fiscal year 2004. nnsa and the university face three main challenges to sustaining improvements in mission support performance over the long term . the first challenge is for the laboratories to ensure that actions taken to address mission support problems translate into effective performance of mission support activities . a past lack of emphasis on mission support activities was a major factor when problems surfaced , particularly at the los alamos laboratory . ensuring that mission support activities are effective will require sustained leadership , resources , and effective internal controls . the second challenge is ensuring appropriate and effective oversight of mission support activities , which has been inadequate in the past . in particular , a draft nnsa policy that calls for relying primarily on contractors ' management controls raises concerns about the future adequacy of nnsa oversight . the third challenge is ensuring that the laboratories follow best practices in developing any future improvement initiatives . in its efforts to improve business systems , the los alamos laboratory did not follow best business practices for managing such improvements . not doing so lessens the laboratory 's ability to ensure that the efforts will achieve the desired results .
in august 2001 , the administration announced competitive sourcing as one of five initiatives in the president 's management agenda . under competitive sourcing , federal agencies open their commercial activities to competition among public and private sector sources . while competitive sourcing is expected to encourage innovation and improve efficiency and performance , it represents a major management change for most agencies . this report describes the progress selected agencies have made in establishing a competitive sourcing program , identifies major challenges these agencies are facing , and discusses strategies they are using to select activities for competition . since the president announced competitive sourcing as a governmentwide initiative , the six civilian agencies gao reviewed created a basic infrastructure for their competitive sourcing programs , including establishing offices , appointing officials , hiring staff and consultants , issuing guidance , and conducting training . with infrastructures in place and leadership involvement , each agency has developed competitive sourcing plans and conducted some competitions . the department of defense ( dod ) has had an extensive competitive sourcing program since the mid - 1990s . interagency forums for sharing competitive sourcing information also have been established . while such activities are underway , each agency gao reviewed , including dod , cited several significant challenges in achieving its competitive sourcing goals . key among these is maintaining workforce inventories that distinguish inherently governmental positions from commercial positions -- a prerequisite to identifying potential positions to compete . agencies also have been challenged to develop competitive sourcing approaches that would improve efficiency , in part because agencies have focused more on following omb guidance on the number of positions to compete -- not on achieving savings and improving performance . ensuring adequate personnel with the skills needed to run a competitive sourcing program also challenged agencies . many civilian department - level offices have only one or two full - time staff to interpret new laws , implement new omb guidance , maintain inventories of competable positions and activities , and oversee agency competitions . the federal acquisition council is currently identifying agency staffing needs to address this challenge . finally , some of the civilian agencies we reviewed reported funding challenges in implementing their competitive sourcing programs . omb told agencies to include a line item for competitive sourcing activities in their fiscal year 2005 budget requests . several agencies integrated their strategic , human capital , and competitive sourcing plans -- an approach encouraged by the commercial activities panel , which was convened to conduct a congressionally mandated study of the competitive sourcing process . for example , the internal revenue service ( irs ) used business case analyses to assess the economic benefits of various sourcing alternatives . an irs official said this approach required minimal investment to determine an activity 's suitability for competitive sourcing . the national institutes of health , the army , and the department of education also took a strategic approach to competitive sourcing . omb 's task in balancing the need for transparency and consistency with the flexibility agencies need is not an easy one . while omb is addressing funding and human capital challenges , it needs to do more to assure that the agencies ' inventories of commercial positions and goal - setting processes are more strategic and helpful to agencies in achieving savings and improving performance .
flood maps identify areas at greatest risk of flooding and provide the foundation for the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) managed by the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . the maps are used by communities to establish minimum building standards designed to reduce the impact of flooding , fema to set insurance rates , and lenders to identify property owners who are required to purchase flood insurance . nearly 70 percent of all flood maps are more than 10 years old , according to fema . in an effort to update its flood maps , fema is implementing a $ 1 billion , 5-year map modernization program . gao was asked to review the progress of fema 's map modernization program . through its map modernization program , fema intends to use advanced technologies to produce more accurate and accessible digital flood maps available on the internet . these maps are expected to improve community efforts to reduce the impact of floods , increase property owners ' use of flood insurance , and improve community , state and federal efforts to reduce the risks of other natural and man - made hazards . in developing digital flood maps , fema plans to incorporate data that are of a level of specificity and accuracy commensurate with communities ' relative flood risk . according to fema , there is a direct relationship between the types , quantity , and detail of the data and analysis used to develop maps and the costs of obtaining and analyzing those data . although fema ranked the nation 's 3,146 counties from highest to lowest risk , it has not yet established data standards that describe the appropriate level of detail , accuracy , and analysis required to develop digital maps based on risk level . without such standards , fema can not ensure that it uses the same level of data collection and analysis for all communities in the same risk category . such standards can also help fema to target its map modernization resources more efficiently by matching the level of data collection and analysis with the level of flood risk . fema has developed partnerships with states and local entities that have begun mapping activities and has a strategy on how to best work with these entities . however , the overall effectiveness of fema 's future partnering efforts is uncertain because fema has not yet developed a clear strategy for partnering with communities with less resources and little or no experience in flood mapping . by developing such a strategy , fema will be better able to identify and use the most effective approaches to engage all of its partners in map modernization .
when an emergency call is placed to 911 , prompt response depends on knowing the location of the caller . enhanced 911 ( e911 ) service automatically provides this critical information . e911 is in place in most of the country for traditional wireline telephone service , where the telephone number is linked to a street address . expanding e911 capabilities to mobile phones is inherently more challenging because of the need to determine the caller 's geographic location at the moment the call is made . concerns have been raised about the pace of wireless e911 implementation and whether this service will be available nationwide . gao reviewed the progress being made in implementing wireless e911 service , the factors affecting this progress , and the role of the federal government in facilitating the nationwide deployment of wireless e911 service . implementation of wireless e911 is several years away in many states , raising the prospect of piecemeal availability of this service across the country for an indefinite number of years to come . successful implementation depends on coordinated efforts by wireless carriers , local telephone companies , and more than 6,000 public safety answering points ( psaps ) -- the facilities that receive 911 calls and dispatch assistance . according to a database sponsored by the department of transportation ( dot ) , as of october 2003 , nearly 65 percent of psaps had phase i wireless e911 service , which provides the approximate location of the caller , while only 18 percent had phase ii , which provides a more precise location and is the ultimate goal of wireless e911 service . though valuable , the database does not differentiate between psaps that will require equipment upgrades and those that will not , thereby limiting its usefulness in accurately assessing progress toward full implementation . looking forward , 24 state 911 contacts said in response to a gao survey that their state will have phase ii implemented by 2005 or sooner ; however , all other state contacts estimated dates beyond 2005 or were unable to estimate a date . key factors hindering wireless e911 implementation involve funding and coordination . the wireless carriers , states , and localities must devise the means to fund more than $ 8 billion in estimated deployment costs over the next 5 years . some states and localities have established funding mechanisms ( such as e911 surcharges on phone bills ) , but others have not done so or have used their e911 funds for unrelated purposes . in addition , there is also a lack of coordination in some cases among the wireless carriers , local telephone companies , and psaps that can lead to delays in wireless e911 implementation . states with knowledgeable and involved coordinators were best able to work through these coordination issues . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and dot are involved in promoting wireless e911 , but their authority in overseeing its deployment is limited because psaps traditionally fall under state and local jurisdiction . fcc has set deadlines on the wireless carriers ' e911 responsibilities and has taken actions to identify best practices and improve coordination among the parties . dot is developing an action plan and clearinghouse for wireless e911 planning , implementation , and operations .
in 2002 , the united states experienced one of the worst wildland fire seasons in the past 50 years -- almost 7 million acres burned . these fires included the largest and costliest fire in oregon in the past century -- the biscuit fire . following a lightning storm , five fires were discovered in the siskiyou national forest over a 3- day period beginning july 13. these fires eventually burned together to form the biscuit fire , which burned nearly 500,000 acres in southern oregon and northern california and cost over $ 150 million to extinguish . gao evaluated whether policies and procedures were in place for acquiring needed firefighting resources during the initial days of the biscuit fire , and the extent to which these policies and procedures were followed when the fire was first identified ; what resource management issues , if any , affected the ability of personnel to fight the fire ; and what differences , if any , existed in key certification standards for personnel among federal and state agencies and whether these differences affected efforts to respond to the fire . in commenting on a draft of this report , the forest service stated that the report appears to be accurate and the agency generally agrees with its contents . the department of the interior did not provide comments . national policies and procedures were in place and provided the framework to guide personnel in the local interagency dispatch center in grants pass , oregon , who were responsible for acquiring resources to fight the biscuit fire . these policies and procedures provide for a multilevel dispatching system where , if sufficient firefighting personnel and equipment are not available locally , resource requests can be elevated to other dispatch centers at the regional and , if necessary , national level . to facilitate the swift suppression of new fires , local dispatch center personnel can contact neighboring centers directly , including those in adjacent regions , before elevating resource requests . when the first two fires were found on july 13 , the grants pass dispatch center did not have sufficient firefighting resources available locally . grants pass personnel requested resources from the responsible regional center in portland , as well as from a dispatch center in central oregon , but no resources were immediately available in the region due to other higher priority fires that were threatening lives and property . grants pass personnel did not request resources from a neighboring interagency dispatch center in fortuna , california , located in an adjoining dispatch region , because they believed the center had no available resources due to fire activity there . state officials working at the fortuna dispatch center later said that a fortuna - based helicopter fighting fires in northern california near the first of the five biscuit fires could have been made available to suppress this fire . however , forest service officials working with fortuna personnel disagreed , saying that the helicopter had been needed to fight fires in california . because no request was made , there was no discussion on that first day about whether the biscuit fire would have been the best use of the helicopter , and it is unclear , in any case , what the outcome of such a request would have been . following the initial days of the biscuit fire , delays in obtaining needed personnel hampered efforts to fight the rapidly growing fire . specifically , officials faced problems obtaining highly experienced management teams to direct suppression strategies and crews to carry the strategies out , supervisors to manage crews and equipment , and support staff to monitor the training and experience of contracted crews . an unusually severe fire season , with many other higher priority fires , affected the availability of personnel needed to fight the biscuit fire . finally , while some differences exist in certification standards for personnel between federal and state agencies responsible for fighting wildland fires , these differences did not appear to affect efforts to respond to the biscuit fire .
the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) multibillion - dollar effort to modernize the nation 's air traffic control ( atc ) system has suffered from cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls in its system acquisitions for more than two decades and has been on our list of high risk programs since 1995. faa 's performance - based air traffic organization ( ato ) was created in february 2004 , in part , to address these legacy challenges . in this report , gao examined faa 's experience in meeting cost , schedule , and performance targets for major atc system acquisitions ; steps taken to address legacy problems with the program and additional steps needed ; and the potential impact of the constrained federal budget on this program . the ato met its acquisition goal for fiscal year 2004. however , prior to the establishment of the ato , faa had experienced more than two decades of cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls in acquiring major systems under its atc modernization program . for example , 13 of the 16 major system acquisitions that we reviewed in detail have experienced cost , schedule , and / or performance shortfalls when assessed against their original milestones . these 13 system acquisitions experienced total cost growth from $ 1.1 million to about $ 1.5 billion ; schedule extensions ranging from 1 to 13 years ; and performance shortfalls , including safety problems . we found that one or more of four factors -- funding , requirements growth and / or unplanned work , stakeholder involvement , and software complexity -- have contributed to these legacy challenges . while faa met its recent acquisition goal , it is important to note that this goal is based on updated program milestones and cost targets for system acquisitions , not those set at their inception . consequently , they do not provide a consistent benchmark for assessing progress over time . also , as indicators of annual progress , they can not be used in isolation to measure progress over the life of an acquisition . although additional steps are warranted , faa has taken some positive steps to address key legacy challenges it has had with acquiring major systems under the modernization program . for example , the ato has cut funding for some major systems that were not meeting their goals and is reassessing all capital investments to help ensure that priority systems receive needed funding . the ato has improved its management of software - intensive acquisitions and information technology investments and begun to more actively involve stakeholders . as we recommended , the ato plans to establish an overall policy to apply its process improvement model to all software - intensive acquisitions . however , additional steps could be taken to improve its management of system acquisitions . for example , the ato could use a knowledge - based approach to managing system acquisitions , characteristic of best commercial practices , to help avoid cost , schedule , and performance problems . the ato will also be challenged to modernize the atc system under constrained budget targets , which would provide faa with about $ 2 billion less than it planned to spend through 2009. to fund its major system acquisitions and remain within these targets , the ato has eliminated planned funding to start new projects and substantially reduced planned funding for other areas . however , when forwarding its budget submission for review by senior officials at faa , dot , the office of management and budget , and congress , the ato provides no detail on the impact of the planned funding reductions on atc modernization and related activities to modernize the nas . our work shows that the ato should provide these decision - makers with detailed information in its budget submissions about the impact of funding decisions on modernization efforts . without this type of information , decision - makers lack important details when considering faa 's annual budget submissions .
the air force depot maintenance activity group in - house operations generate about $ 5 billion in annual revenue principally by repairing aircraft , missiles , engines , and other assets . in doing so , the group operates under the working capital fund concept , where customers are to be charged the anticipated costs of providing goods and services to them . the group 's average price for in - house work almost doubled between fiscal years 2000 and 2004 from $ 119.99 per hour to $ 237.84 per hour . gao was asked to determine what factors were primarily responsible for the price increase , if the prices charged recovered the reported actual costs of performing the work , and if the air force has taken effective steps to improve efficiency and control the activity group 's costs . gao identified five primary factors that showed why the air force depot maintenance activity group 's average price increased from $ 119.99 per direct labor hour of work in fiscal year 2000 to $ 237.84 per hour in fiscal year 2004. an increase in material costs accounted for about 67 percent of the total increase and was by far the most significant factor . the air force has identified some of the causes of the higher material costs such as aging aircraft , but has yet to complete an effective and comprehensive analysis of material cost increases . as a result , it can not quantify the extent to which individual causes contributed to higher costs and does not know if it has identified all of the major causes . gao 's analysis of the other four factors showed that the increase in labor costs was due largely to events beyond the group 's control , such as annual salary increases , the increase in business operations costs was due partly to costs related to implementing a new accounting system , a surcharge intended to recoup anticipated losses on work carried over from the previous fiscal year may have been unnecessary , and a surcharge intended to generate additional cash in fiscal year 2004 for the air force working capital fund was unnecessary . gao 's analysis showed that due in part to these surcharges the air force working capital fund , which includes the depot maintenance and several other activity groups , had a $ 2.5 billion cash balance as of january 31 , 2004 and this balance was more than $ 1.3 billion higher than the maximum level allowed by dod policy . either the office of the secretary of defense or the congress could use this unneeded cash to satisfy other requirements . dod officials told us that they are exploring options on what to do with the excess cash . gao 's analysis of the group 's financial reports showed that prices charged customers were not set high enough to recover about $ 1.1 billion of the group 's reported costs for fiscal years 2000 through 2003. the activity group is required by dod policy to set prices to recoup the cost of doing work . however , air force officials informed us that the prices were artificially constrained to help ensure that the group 's customers would be able to get needed work done with the amount of funds provided to them through the budget process . the air force changed its sales price development philosophy to bring prices charged customers in fiscal year 2004 more in line with operating costs . in addition , the air force allowed out - of - cycle price increases in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to alleviate projected losses . further , the air force materiel command has not been successful in its efforts to control costs . although several promising initiatives are underway , the command has not developed a successful methodology for analyzing the reasons for the rapid material cost increase and effectively utilized an established data repository for sharing cost - saving ideas among the three air logistics centers on process improvements and to demonstrate whether its cost savings initiatives have been successful .
title iv - b of the social security act , comprised of two subparts , is the primary source of federal funding for services to help families address problems that lead to child abuse and neglect and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families ; however , a number of challenges exist that impair states ' ability to deliver and track these services . this testimony is based on findings from three reports issued in 2003 and addresses the following : states ' use of title iv - b funds in providing a wide array of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and unnecessary foster care placements , as well as in providing other child welfare services ; factors that hinder states ' ability to protect children from abuse and neglect ; and the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) role in helping states to overcome these challenges . findings are based on multiple methodologies , including a survey to child welfare directors on states ' use of title iv - b funds ; an analysis of nearly 600 exit interview documents completed by staff who severed their employment from 17 state , 40 county , and 19 private child welfare agencies ; and a survey of all 50 states and the district of columbia regarding their experiences in developing and using information systems and their ability to report data to hhs . in each case , gao also conducted multiple site visits to selected states and interviewed child welfare experts and hhs headquarters and regional officials . states use of title iv - b funds to provide a wide variety of services to prevent the occurrence of abuse , neglect , and foster care placements , as well as to provide other child welfare services . according to gao 's title iv - b survey data for fiscal year 2002 , states spent about 60 percent of subpart 1 funds on the salaries of child welfare agency staff , administration and management expenses , and child protective services , while about 10 percent were used to provide family support and family preservation services . in comparison , states spent about 62 percent of their subpart 2 funds on family support and preservation services . child welfare agencies face a number of challenges related to staffing and data management that impair their ability to protect children from abuse and neglect . low salaries hinder agencies ' ability to attract potential child welfare workers and retain those already in the profession . according to caseworkers gao interviewed , high turnover rates and staffing shortages leave remaining staff with insufficient time to establish relationships with families and make the necessary decisions to ensure safe and stable permanent placements . states also face challenges developing appropriate information systems needed to track abuse or neglect reports and monitor children in foster care . in addition , several factors affect states ' ability to collect and report reliable adoption , foster care , and child abuse and neglect data , including insufficient caseworker training , inaccurate and incomplete data entry , and technical challenges reporting the data . hhs plays a role in helping states overcome some of the challenges they face in operating their child welfare programs , but additional oversight or technical assistance could assist states in meeting the needs of children served by child welfare agencies . hhs 's oversight of title iv - b focuses primarily on states ' overall child welfare systems and outcomes , but the agency provides relatively little oversight specific to title iv - b subpart 1. in addition , hhs plays a limited role in states ' workforce activities by offering partial reimbursement for training expenses and managing discretionary grant programs . the agency monitors states ' information systems development and data reporting , but despite the availability of technical assistance , states reported ongoing challenges reporting reliable data . in the related reports , gao made several recommendations to hhs . gao recommended that hhs provide the necessary guidance to ensure that regional offices monitor states ' use of title iv - b subpart 1 and to consider gathering additional information on its use . gao also recommended that hhs take actions that may help child welfare agencies address recruitment and retention challenges . last , gao recommended that hhs consider ways to enhance the guidance and assistance offered to help states overcome key data challenges . hhs generally agreed with gao 's findings and recommendations , except that it noted that its level of oversight of title iv - b was commensurate with the program 's scope and intent .
an institute at the national institutes of health ( nih ) and an office in the environmental protection agency ( epa ) entered into collaborative arrangements with the american chemistry council ( acc ) to support research on the health effects of chemical exposures . nih accepted a gift from acc to help fund the research . epa and acc funded their proposals separately . the arrangements raised concerns about the potential for acc to influence research that could affect the chemical industry . gao determined the agencies ' legal authorities to enter into the arrangements ; the extent to which the agencies evaluated and managed potential conflicts of interest resulting from these arrangements ; the extent to which the nih institute complied with nih 's gift acceptance policy ; and the extent to which nih , epa , and other agencies have similar arrangements . nih 's national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) used the authorities granted to nih 's institutes and centers under sections of the public health service act to enter into its arrangement with acc . similarly , epa 's office of research and development ( ord ) relied on authorities granted to epa under sections of the clean air act , the clean water act , and the solid waste disposal act to enter into its research arrangement . nothing in these statutes appears to prohibit either agency from entering into research arrangements with nonprofit organizations such as acc . niehs and ord did not formally evaluate the potential for conflicts of interest with acc before they entered into the arrangements , but both agencies took steps to manage the potential as the arrangements were implemented . nih and epa had no specific policies requiring officials to evaluate or manage potential conflicts of interest when they entered into the acc arrangements , nor do they currently have such policies . although no formal evaluation occurred , agency officials managed the arrangements through their existing research management processes . both agencies believe these actions helped mitigate the potential for undue influence by acc and adequately protected the integrity of the scientific research conducted under the arrangements . because the agencies ' research management processes were not designed to address conflict of interest issues they are not a substitute for a formal evaluation of such conflicts . without policies requiring a formal evaluation and management of conflicts , there is no assurance that similar arrangements will be appropriately evaluated and managed for such conflicts in the future . niehs officials complied with portions of nih 's gift acceptance policy that guide the acknowledgement and administration of gifts . however , the policy 's guidance on evaluating and managing potential conflicts is extremely broad , and it lacks clarity and consistency . as a result , the policy gives officials wide discretion in this area . in addition , the policy does not require the agency to document the basis for its decisions . consequently , the policy does not provide sufficient assurance that potential conflicts of interest between nih and donor organizations will be appropriately considered . while some institutes and centers at nih had arrangements somewhat similar to the acc arrangements , gao did not find any similar arrangements at other program offices at epa or at the food and drug administration and the federal aviation administration -- two other agencies with significant research budgets . none of the nine research arrangements gao found at nih institutes and centers involve organizations that represent industry in the same direct manner that acc represents the chemical industry .
incomplete or inaccurate appraisals resulting in property overvaluations may expose the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) single - family mortgage insurance programs -- which insured about 3.7million single - family mortgage loans with a total value of about $ 425 billion in fiscal years 2001 through 2003- - to greater financial risks . in 1999 , gao reported on the need for improvements in hud 's oversight of appraisers , which has historically been a challenge for the department . also , in the past , gao reported that , due in part to poor oversight of appraisers , hud 's single - family mortgage insurance programs remained a high - risk area . gao conducted this review as a follow up to the 1999 report . this report examines how hud ensures that appraisers it approves are qualified to perform fha appraisals , the extent to which hud employs a risk - based monitoring approach , and hud 's efforts to take enforcement action against noncompliant appraisers . through new guidance and regulation , hud has strengthened its criteria for placing appraisers on its appraiser roster -- which establishes their eligibility to participate in hud programs . before 1999 , hud relied largely on the states ' licensing processes to ensure that appraisers were qualified , but the states ' minimum licensing standards did not specifically include proficiency in hud 's appraisal requirements . hud 's 1999 guidance requires appraisers to , among other things , pass an examination on hud appraisal methods and reporting . further , a 2003 regulation provides for , among other things , removing from the roster appraisers whose licenses have been suspended or revoked . however , hud has limited quality control over the approval process , limiting the department 's assurance that its criteria are being effectively implemented . hud has adopted an oversight approach that focuses on appraisers it believes pose risks to fha 's mortgage insurance fund , but certain weaknesses exist in its implementation . hud 's guidance calls for its homeownership centers ( hocs ) -- which are largely responsible for appraiser oversight -- to develop quarterly targeting lists of appraisers for review based on certain criteria , or risk factors . the primary factor is the rate of defaults in certain loans associated with the appraiser ; others include large numbers of appraisals as well as appraisals for loans made under one of hud 's programs known to be at higher risk of fraud and abuse . however , the hocs do not maintain a permanent record of the data used to identify the targeted appraisers -- even though hud 's automated system would enable them to -- which limits hud 's ability to verify that those targeted were those that met the criteria and to determine the effectiveness of its targeting criteria in reducing risk to the mortgage insurance fund . gao found that during fiscal year 2003 and the first half of fiscal year 2004 the hocs generally reviewed the appraisers they identified as high risk and targeted for review . however , they reviewed fewer appraisals for each targeted appraiser than hud 's guidance prescribes : on average , about 5.6 appraisals instead of the 10 called for . gao also found that hoc staff did not routinely visit appraised properties to verify the work of contractors whoconduct field reviews of selected appraisers . to facilitate enforcement actions against appraisers , hud expanded the hocs ' authority to sanction appraisers and developed a new appraisal scoring system . according to hud , the number of actions taken to remove appraisers from its roster has increased from 25 at a cost of over $ 10 million in 1998 to 132 at a cost of under $ 300,000 in 2003. hud also developed a tool that scores each appraiser on several appraisals , weighting the scores to capture violations that pose the greatest risk to fha 's mortgage insurance fund . according to hud , this tool allows the department to sanction appraisers more consistently .
the postal service is on the cusp of a major transformation to improve its fiscal outlook . one part of this transformation involves procurement . the postal service is homing in on supply chain management , a process that has helped successful private - sector companies leverage their buying power and identify more efficient ways to procure goods and services . to assist congressional efforts to enact fundamental postal reform , gao was asked to determine the extent to which the postal service has been successful in implementing and realizing savings from its supply chain management initiatives and whether these initiatives have had an effect on small businesses . the postal service has had mixed success in implementing the supply chain management initiatives we reviewed : the bulk fuel program ; reverse auctions for transportation contracts ; and national contracts for boxes , custodial supplies , labels , retail packaging , and tires . the postal service reported over $ 78 million in fiscal year 2003 savings and revenue from these initiatives . however , the postal service has been unable to recover millions of dollars in potential savings because of implementation problems with the bulk fuel program . for other savings initiatives , baseline data used to calculate savings were , in some cases , inaccurate or could not be validated because the postal service lacks a system for harnessing annual spending data . since the postal service started using the national contracts gao reviewed , the number of small business suppliers has dropped dramatically . acquisition plans for most of these contracts did not address small business participation , either at the prime or subcontractor level . gao could not determine the effect that the bulk fuel program and reverse auctions have had on small businesses because postal service contracting officers and contractors have been using incorrect business size standards , and , as a result , the reported small business accomplishments are not accurate . further , the postal service 's new supplier diversity policy does not establish targets for contracting with small businesses . therefore , the postal service will have difficulty gauging the effect of supply chain management initiatives on these businesses and holding contracting officers accountable for implementing the policy 's objective of ensuring improvement in the postal service 's relationships with small businesses .
the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) was required by the drug free media campaign act of 1998 ( 21 u.s.c . 1801 et seq . ) . to conduct a national media campaign to reduce and prevent drug use among america 's youth . since 1998 , congress has appropriated over $ 1 billion for the media campaign . however , a 2003 report by the senate committee on appropriations expressed some concerns about the media campaign , including concern that a large portion of the campaign 's budget had been used for consulting services rather than the direct purchase of media time and space . the report , therefore , directed gao to review the use of consultants to support the media campaign . this report describes the services provided by consultants ( defined by gao as the prime contractors and their subcontractors ) in support of the media campaign , along with the estimated award amounts for these services . our analysis of contracts covering ondcp 's national youth anti - drug media campaign from fiscal years 2002 through 2004 revealed that four contractors provided many of the services required to execute the campaign . these four prime contractors provided an array of services that fell within three broad categories : advertising , public communications and outreach , and evaluation services to gauge the campaign 's effectiveness . the prime contractors also acquired additional specialized expertise from 102 subcontractors . some of the specific tasks performed by the contractors and their subcontractors included conducting qualitative and quantitative research for advertising creation , working with the entertainment industry to portray the negative consequences of drug use in television and movies , and conducting an evaluation intended to measure the effectiveness of the media campaign . based on our analysis of contracts covering fiscal years 2002 through 2004 , we estimated that $ 520 million was awarded to the four prime contractors , of which an estimated $ 373 million -- 72 percent -- was committed to purchasing media time and space for campaign advertisements . the remaining $ 147 million -- 28 percent -- was for the services provided by the prime contractors . contractors , in turn , awarded $ 14 million of that amount to their subcontractors .
the department of defense ( dod ) is increasingly reliant on software and information systems for its weapon capabilities , and dod prime contractors are subcontracting more of their software development . the increased reliance on software and a greater number of suppliers results in more opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in defense software . in addition , dod has reported that countries hostile to the united states are focusing resources on information warfare strategies . therefore , software security , including the need for protection of software code from malicious activity , is an area of concern for many dod programs . gao was asked to examine dod 's efforts to identify software development suppliers and manage risks related to foreign involvement in software development on weapon systems . dod acquisition and software security policies do not fully address the risk of using foreign suppliers to develop weapon system software . the current acquisition guidance allows program officials discretion in managing foreign involvement in software development , without requiring them to identify and mitigate such risks . moreover , other policies intended to mitigate information system vulnerabilities focus mostly on operational software security threats , such as external hacking and unauthorized access to information systems , but not on insider threats , such as the insertion of malicious code by software developers . recent dod initiatives may provide greater focus on these risks , but to date have not been adopted as practice within dod . while dod has begun to recognize potential risks from foreign software content , this is not always the case within the weapon programs where software is developed or acquired . program officials for the systems in this review did not make foreign involvement in software development a specific element of their risk identification and mitigation efforts . as a result , program officials ' knowledge of the foreign developed software included in their weapon systems varied . in addition , risk mitigation efforts emphasized program level risks , such as meeting program cost and schedule goals , instead of software security risks . further , program officials often delegated risk mitigation and source selection to contractors who are primarily concerned with software functionality and quality assurance , rather than specifically addressing software security for development risks associated with foreign suppliers . unless program officials provide specific guidance , contractors may favor business considerations over potential software development security risks associated with using foreign suppliers . as the amount of software on weapon systems increases , it becomes more difficult and costly to test every line of code . further , dod can not afford to monitor all worldwide software development facilities or provide clearances for all potential software developers . therefore , the program manager must know more about who is developing software and where early in the software acquisition process , so that it can be included as part of software source selection and risk mitigation decisions .
tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the united states . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that , on average , over 440,000 deaths and $ 76 billion in medical expenditures were attributable to cigarette smoking each year from 1995 through 1999. reducing tobacco - related deaths and the incidence of disease , along with the associated costs , represents a significant public health challenge for the federal government . most adults who use tobacco started using it between the ages of 10 and 18. according to a surgeon general 's report , if children and adolescents can be prevented from using tobacco products before they become adults , they are likely to remain tobacco - free for the rest of their lives . gao was asked to provide information on federal efforts to prevent and reduce youth smoking . specifically , this report describes federal programs , research , and activities that aim to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth , the efforts of federal departments and agencies to monitor their programs , and the coordination among federal departments and agencies in efforts to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth . some federal programs , research , and activities that aim to address tobacco use among youth focus only on tobacco while others aim to address tobacco use as part of broader efforts to address unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse and violence . two federal programs within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) focus only on tobacco use . cdc 's national tobacco control program ( ntcp ) focuses on preventing and reducing tobacco use among the general population and explicitly targets youth . the substance abuse and mental health services administration 's program to oversee implementation of a provision of federal law , commonly referred as the synar amendment , focuses only on tobacco use among youth . the synar amendment requires states to enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors . in addition to these tobacco - focused programs , hhs , and the departments of defense ( dod ) , justice ( doj ) , and education sponsor programs that include tobacco use as part of broader efforts to address unhealthy behaviors among youth , such as substance abuse and violence . for example , education 's safe and drug - free schools and communities program is designed to prevent substance abuse and violence . hhs agencies , such as the national institutes of health , conduct research on tobacco use and nicotine addiction among youth and its health effects on youth . hhs agencies and other federal departments also support activities to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youth , such as education and outreach efforts . hhs and its component agencies coordinate tobacco - related efforts with other federal , state , and local government agencies and nongovernmental entities . federal departments and agencies collect a variety of information to monitor how programs that aim to address tobacco use among youth are being implemented by grantees and the effectiveness of grantee efforts in meeting program goals . the information is collected through various means , including grant applications , progress reports , periodic site visits , and program evaluations . for example , to monitor ntcp , cdc requires states to submit biannual reports on the implementation of state ntcp - supported tobacco control programs . the information that federal departments and agencies collect on these programs is also used to provide training and technical assistance to grantees on topics such as conducting program evaluation . in commenting on a draft of this report , hhs stated that the report was very informative but it did not include programs like medicaid that are a substantial element of hhs tobacco prevention efforts . including programs that finance health insurance such as medicaid , however , was beyond the scope of our review . also , hhs noted that we did not include information about the challenges other federal agencies face in coordinating tobaccorelated issues but dod , doj , and education did not describe such challenges . dod and doj had no comments on the report and hhs and education provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate .
to prevent pollutants from entering storm water runoff , the clean water act 's national pollutant discharge elimination system storm water program requires controls for construction activities that disturb land . phase i of this program requires permitting for construction activities that disturb 5 acres or more , while phase ii requires permitting for activities disturbing between 1 and 5 acres . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) extended the phase ii compliance date for discharges associated with oil and gas construction activities until march 2005 to analyze the impact of phase ii on the oil and gas industry . gao was asked to provide information about oil and gas construction activities -- such as well drilling and pipeline construction -- affected by phase i and likely to be affected by phase ii , as well as phase ii 's financial and environmental implications . a small fraction of total oil and gas construction activities have been permitted under phase i of epa 's storm water program . phase i storm water permit data for three of the six largest oil and gas producing states -- louisiana , oklahoma , and texas -- showed that 433 construction activities were permitted under phase i over the most recent 12 months for which data were available . about 70 percent , 304 of the 433 , were oil and gas pipeline activities , most of which were much larger than the 5 acre criterion under phase i. about 17 percent , 72 of the 433 , were drilling activities . in comparison , these three states reported drilling an average of about 10,000 wells for each of the past 3 years . industry must decide whether to seek permit coverage , and it has sought to have its drilling activities permitted on few occasions because it has determined that most drilling activity involves distinct projects that disturb less than 5 acres each . in states we reviewed , there were few reported compliance problems associated with oil and gas construction activities . while it appears that most oil and gas construction activities may have to be permitted under phase ii , the actual number of activities that could be affected is uncertain , and the financial and environmental implications are difficult to quantify . the oil and gas construction activities affected by the rule may lead to increased financial costs for the oil and gas industry and federal agencies implementing the rule . many of the potential costs stem from meeting permit requirements to review the impact of construction activities on endangered species , although this impact would be site specific and difficult to quantify . potentially offsetting these costs , the rule may lead to additional environmental protections that are difficult to quantify , such as decreased levels of sediment in water and benefits for endangered species and their habitat . after delaying implementation of this rule for oil and gas construction activities for 2 years to study the impact of phase ii , epa is analyzing the impact but , as yet , has not quantified the number of activities affected or the potential financial and environmental implications .
concerns have been raised about lead in district of columbia drinking water and how those charged with ensuring the safety of this water have carried out their responsibilities . the 1991 lead and copper rule ( lcr ) requires water systems to protect drinking water from lead by , among other things , chemically treating it to reduce its corrosiveness and by monitoring tap water samples for evidence of lead corrosion . if enough samples show corrosion , water systems officials are required to notify and educate the public on lead health risks and undertake additional efforts . the washington aqueduct , owned and operated by the u.s. army corps of engineers , treats and sells water to the district of columbia water and sewer authority ( wasa ) , which delivers water to d.c. residents . epa 's philadelphia office is charged with overseeing these agencies . gao is examining the current structure and level of coordination among key government entities that implement the safe drinking water act 's regulations for lead in the district of columbia , how other drinking water systems conducted public notification and outreach , the availability of data necessary to determine which adult and child populations are at greatest risk of exposure to elevated lead levels , and what information wasa is gathering to help track their health , and the state of research on the health effects of lead exposure . the testimony discusses preliminary results of gao 's work . gao will report in full at a later date . this statement discusses gao 's preliminary observations and highlights areas of further examination . one of the key relationships in the effort to ensure the safety of the district 's drinking water is the one between wasa , the deliverer of water , and epa 's philadelphia office , which oversees wasa 's compliance with drinking water regulations . recent public statements and corrective actions by these parties clearly indicate that coordination and communication between them could have been better in the years preceding the current lead controversy . gao 's future work will examine ( to the extent appropriate ) the interrelationships among other key agencies ( such as the aqueduct and the d.c. department of health ) ; how other water systems in similar situations interacted with federal , state , and local agencies ; and what the experiences of these other jurisdictions may suggest concerning how improved coordination can better protect drinking water in the district of columbia . other water systems facing elevated lead levels used public notification and education practices that may offer lessons for conducting outreach to water customers . for example , some of the practices of the two water systems we have begun to examine -- the massachusetts water resources authority and the portland ( oregon ) water bureau -- include tailoring their communications to varied audiences in their service areas , testing the effectiveness of their communication materials , and linking demographic and infrastructure data to identify populations at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . wasa faces challenges in collecting the information needed to identify district citizens at greatest risk from lead in drinking water . specifically , wasa has partial information on which of its customers have lead service lines , and is in the process of obtaining more complete information . gao 's future work will examine the efforts of other water systems to go one step further by linking data on at - risk populations ( such as pregnant mothers , infants , and small children ) with data on homes suspected of being served by lead service pipes and other plumbing fixtures that may leach lead into drinking water . nationally , much is known about the hazards of lead once in the body and how lead from paint , soil , and dust enter the body , but little research has been done to determine actual lead exposure from drinking water , and the information that does exist is dated . in our future work , we will examine the plans of epa and other organizations to fill this key information gap .
about 7,500 peace corps volunteers currently serve in 70 countries . the administration intends to increase this number to about 14,000. volunteers often live in areas with limited access to reliable communications , police , or medical services . as americans , they may be viewed as relatively wealthy and , hence , good targets for crime . in this testimony , gao summarizes findings from its 2002 report peace corps : initiatives for addressing safety and security challenges hold promise , but progress should be assessed , gao - 02-818 , on trends in crime against volunteers and peace corps ' system for generating information , the agency 's field implementation of its safety and security framework , and the underlying factors contributing to the quality of these practices . the full extent of crime against peace corps volunteers is unclear due to significant under - reporting . however , peace corps ' reported rates for most types of assaults have increased since the agency began collecting data in 1990. the agency 's data analysis has produced useful insights , but additional analyses could help improve anti - crime strategies . peace corps has hired an analyst to enhance data collection and analysis to help the agency develop better - informed intervention and prevention strategies . in 2002 , we reported that peace corps had developed safety and security policies but that efforts to implement these policies in the field had produced varying results . some posts complied , but others fell short . volunteers were generally satisfied with training . however , some housing did not meet standards and , while all posts had prepared and tested emergency action plans , many plans had shortcomings . evidence suggests that agency initiatives have not yet eliminated this unevenness . the inspector general continues to find shortcomings at some posts . however , recent emergency action plan tests show an improved ability to contact volunteers in a timely manner . in 2002 , we found that uneven supervision and oversight , staff turnover , and unclear guidance hindered efforts to ensure quality practices . the agency has taken action to address these problems . to strengthen supervision and oversight , it established an office of safety and security , supported by three senior staff at headquarters , nine field - based safety and security officers , and a compliance officer . in response to our recommendations , peace corps was granted authority to exempt 23 safety and security positions from the `` 5-year rule '' -- a statutory restriction on tenure . it also adopted a framework for monitoring post compliance and quantifiable performance indicators . however , the agency is still clarifying guidance , revising indicators , and establishing a performance baseline .
floods have been , and continue to be , the most destructive natural hazard in terms of damage and economic loss to the nation . from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2002 , about 900 lives were lost due to flooding and flood damages totaled about $ 55 billion . some properties have been repeatedly flooded and the subject of federal flood insurance claims . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within the department of homeland security is responsible for assisting state and local governments , private entities , and individuals to prepare for , mitigate , respond to , and recover from natural disasters , including floods . the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) is the primary vehicle for fema 's efforts to mitigate the impact of floods . the senate subcommittee on economic policy , committee on banking , housing , and urban affairs , asked gao to discuss fema 's approach to flood mitigation , the effect of repetitive loss properties on the nfip , and recent actions taken or proposed to address the impact of repetitive loss properties on the nfip . fema has taken a multifaceted approach to mitigating , or minimizing the life and property losses and disaster assistance costs that result from flooding . through the national flood insurance program , fema develops and updates flood maps that identify flood prone areas and makes insurance available for communities that agree to adopt and enforce building standards based upon these maps . since its inception in 1968 , the national flood insurance program has paid $ 12 billion in insurance claims to owners of flood - damage properties that have been funded primarily by policyholders ' premiums that otherwise would have been paid through taxpayer - funded disaster relief or borne by home and business owners themselves . through a variety of grant programs , fema also provides funding for mitigation planning activities and projects before and after floods occur . repetitive loss properties represent a significant portion of annual flood insurance program claims . about 1 percent of the 4.4 million properties currently insured by the program are considered to be repetitive loss properties -- properties for which policyholders have made two or more $ 1,000 flood claims . however , about 38 percent of all program claim costs have been the result of repetitive loss properties , at a cost of about $ 4.6 billion since 1978. recent federal actions to reduce program losses related to repetitive loss properties include fema 's strategy to target severe repetitive loss properties for mitigation and congressional proposals to phase out coverage or begin charging full and actuarially based rates for repetitive loss property owners who refuse to accept fema 's offer to purchase or mitigate the effect of floods on these buildings . fema 's strategy and the congressional proposals appear to have the potential to reduce the number and vulnerability of repetitive loss properties and , thereby , the potential to help reduce the number of flood insurance claims .
for the president 's budget for fiscal year 2005 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) stated that of the nearly 1,200 major information technology ( it ) projects in the budget , it had placed approximately half -- 621 projects , representing about $ 22 billion -- on a management watch list , composed of mission - critical projects with identified weaknesses . gao was asked to describe and assess omb 's processes for placing projects on its management watch list and following up on corrective actions established for projects on the list . for the fiscal year 2005 budget , omb developed processes and criteria for including it investments on its management watch list . in doing so , it identified opportunities to strengthen investments and promote improvements in it management . however , it did not develop a single , aggregate list identifying the projects and their weaknesses . instead , omb officials told gao that to identify it projects with weaknesses , individual omb analysts used scoring criteria that the office established for evaluating the justifications for funding that federal agencies submit for major projects . these analysts , each of whom is typically responsible for several federal agencies , were then responsible for maintaining information on these projects . to derive the total number of projects on the list that omb reported for fiscal year 2005 , omb polled its individual analysts and compiled the result . however , omb officials told gao that they did not compile a list that identified the specific projects and their identified weaknesses . the officials added that they did not construct a single list because they did not see such an activity as necessary . thus , omb has not fully exploited the opportunity to use the list as a tool for analyzing it investments on a governmentwide basis . omb had not developed a structured , consistent process for deciding how to follow up on corrective actions that its individual analysts asked agencies to take to address weaknesses associated with projects on its management watch list . according to omb officials , decisions on follow - up and monitoring of progress were typically made by the staff with responsibility for reviewing individual agency budget submissions , depending on the staff 's insights into agency operations and objectives . because it did not consistently require or monitor follow - up activities , omb did not know whether the project risks that it identified through its management watch list were being managed effectively , potentially leaving resources at risk of being committed to poorly planned and managed projects . in addition , because it did not consistently monitor the follow - up performed on projects on the management watch list , omb could not readily tell gao which of the 621 projects received follow - up attention . thus , omb was not using its management watch list as a tool in setting priorities for improving it investments on a governmentwide basis and focusing attention where it was most needed .
since the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 , the national capital region ( ncr ) , comprising jurisdictions including the district of columbia and surrounding jurisdictions in maryland and virginia , has been recognized as a significant potential target for terrorism . gao was asked to report on what federal funds have been allocated to ncr jurisdictions for emergency preparedness ; what challenges exist within ncr to organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs ; what gaps , if any , remain in the emergency preparedness of ncr ; and what has been the role of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) in ncr to date . in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 , grant programs administered by the departments of homeland security , health and human services , and justice awarded about $ 340 million to eight ncr jurisdictions to enhance emergency preparedness . of this total , the office for national capital region coordination ( oncrc ) targeted all of the $ 60.5 million urban area security initiative funds for projects designed to benefit ncr as a whole . however , there was no coordinated regionwide plan for spending the remaining funds ( about $ 279.5 million ) . local jurisdictions determined the spending priorities for these funds and reported using them for emergency communications and personal protective equipment and other purchases . ncr faces several challenges in organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs , including the lack of a coordinated strategic plan for enhancing ncr preparedness , performance standards , and a reliable , central source of data on funds available and the purposes for which they were spent . without these basic elements , it is difficult to assess first responder capacities , identify first responder funding priorities for ncr , and evaluate the effectiveness of the use of federal funds in enhancing first responder capacities and preparedness in a way that maximizes their effectiveness in improving homeland security .
this report responds to section 112 , division b , of the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 , which directs gao to review federal programs benefiting rural communities in alaska . after discussions with congressional staff , gao agreed to examine federal programs benefiting alaska native villages . specifically , this report provides information on the amount of federal assistance provided to alaska native villages during fiscal years 1998 through 2003 , describes how selected federal funds have been used to assist alaska native villages , and provides data on the number and average cost of houses built by villages and alaska native regional housing authorities . gao 's analysis of available data indicates that alaska native villages and regional native nonprofits -- including native associations , and regional health and housing nonprofits -- received over $ 3 billion in federal assistance from fiscal years 1998 through 2003. specifically , total federal funding included approximately $ 483 million to 216 alaska native villages and about $ 3 billion to 33 regional native nonprofits . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) accounted for 63 percent of all funding over the period . according to federal and state officials , alaska native villages also likely benefited from federal funding to the state of alaska and to cities and boroughs that contain villages , such as when federal funding is used by municipalities to provide water services . based on data gao obtained from the state of alaska , during fiscal years 1998 through 2003 , the state passed through more than $ 105 million in federal funding to native villages and regional native nonprofits . based on available information for 13 programs gao reviewed , federal funding was used to provide alaska natives with assistance in health care , housing , infrastructure , and other areas . for example , according to information from hhs , its tribal self - governance program was used by 13 regional native nonprofits , three native villages , four groups of alaska native villages , and one statewide native health care provider to provide clinical services at tribally run hospitals and health clinics that had over 1 million total visits throughout alaska in 2002. another program , hud 's indian housing block grant , provided funds used by villages and regional housing authorities to build , rehabilitate , modernize , and operate single - family homes and multifamily housing properties . however , the extent of readily available information on how funds were used from the 13 programs gao reviewed varied , in part due to different agency reporting requirements . results from gao 's survey of alaska native villages and regional housing authorities indicated that , during calendar years 1998 through 2003 , responding entities constructed a total of 874 single - family units . gao 's survey indicated that the average cost of units constructed by responding entities varied by region and by whether they were developed by villages or housing authorities . for example , the 6-year average regional cost ( in 2003 dollars ) of all units constructed ranged from a low of $ 138,944 per unit , or $ 122 per square foot , to a high of $ 305,634 per unit , or $ 267 per square foot . gao also found that the cost of new housing units developed by housing authorities was slightly higher than units developed by native villages , and that regional housing authorities constructed more than three times the number of units compared with villages . however , various factors could account for differences in the cost and number of units completed among regions or between villages and regional housing authorities .
espcs finance energy - saving capital improvements , such as lighting retrofits for federal facilities , without the government incurring the full cost up front . partnerships tap the capital and expertise of the private sector to develop real property . this report describes what specific attributes of espcs and partnerships contributed to budget scoring decisions , the costs of financing through espcs compared to the costs of financing via timely , full , and up - front appropriations , and how espcs and partnerships are monitored . using case studies , gao reviewed gsa and navy espcs and doe and va partnerships . energy savings performance contracts ( espc ) and public / private partnership arrangements we examined were authorized by congress and did not require reporting of the full , long - term costs up front in the budget . espcs are financed over time through annual cost savings from energy conservation measures ( ecm ) and only their initial - year costs must be recognized up front . omb policy determined how agencies obligated espcs in their budgets . with partnerships , agencies sometimes used short - term leases to acquire assets constructed for the government 's long - term use and benefit . as a result , budgetary decisions may favor alternatively financed assets . however , spreading costs over time enabled agencies to acquire capital that might not have been obtainable if full , up - front appropriations were required . a number of factors may cause third - party financing to be more expensive than timely , full , and up - front appropriations . for example , a higher rate of interest is incurred by using espcs and partnerships than if the same capital is acquired through timely , full , and up - front appropriations . for our six espc case studies , the government 's costs of acquiring assets increased 8 to 56 percent by using espcs rather than timely , full , and up - front appropriations . however , officials noted that there are opportunity costs , such as foregone energy and maintenance savings , associated with delayed appropriations , but there are insufficient data to measure this effect . for espc and partnership case studies , agency officials said they did not specifically consider or request full up - front appropriations because they did not believe funds would be available in a timely manner and because alternative mechanisms were authorized . an evaluation of funding alternatives on a present value basis could have helped agencies determine the most appropriate way of funding capital projects . implementation and monitoring of espcs is a relatively uniform process . since partnerships take a variety of forms , their implementation and monitoring is more complex . although third - party financing can make it easier for agencies to manage within a given amount of budget authority , it also increases the need for effective implementation and monitoring by agencies to ensure the government 's interests are protected .
ranchers pay a fee to graze their livestock on federal land . grazing occurs primarily on federal land located in the western states managed by 10 federal agencies . generally , the fee is based on animal unit months ( aum ) -- the amount of forage that a cow and her calf can eat in 1 month . for most federal land , the fee per aum is established by a formula . advocates argue that grazing uses federal land productively and that the grazing fee is fair . opponents argue that grazing damages public resources and that grazing fees are too low . gao was asked to determine the extent of , and purposes for , grazing in fiscal year 2004 on lands 10 federal agencies manage ; amount federal agencies spent in fiscal year 2004 to manage grazing ; total grazing receipts the 10 agencies collected in fiscal year 2004 and amounts disbursed ; and fees charged in 2004 by the 10 agencies , western states , and ranchers , and reasons for any differences . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the interior and the forest service neither agreed nor disagreed with the findings . the forest service stated that the report accurately described the purpose of the grazing fee . the army and air force and the department of energy provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate . the departments of commerce and of justice responded that they did not have comments . the 10 federal agencies managed more than 22.6 million aums on about 235 million acres of federal lands for grazing and land management in fiscal year 2004. of this total , the department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) and the u.s. department of agriculture 's forest service managed more than 98 percent of the lands used for grazing . the agencies manage their grazing programs under different authorities and for different purposes . for blm lands and western forest service lands , grazing is a major program ; the eight other agencies generally use grazing as a tool to achieve their primary land management goals . in fiscal year 2004 , federal agencies spent a total of at least $ 144 million . the 10 federal agencies spent at least $ 135.9 million , with the forest service and blm accounting for the majority . other federal agencies have grazing - related activities , such as pest control , and spent at least $ 8.4 million in fiscal year 2004. the 10 federal agencies ' grazing fees generated about $ 21 million in fiscal year 2004- - less than one - sixth of the expenditures to manage grazing . of that amount , the agencies distributed about $ 5.7 million to states and counties in which grazing occurred , returned about $ 3.8 million to the treasury , and deposited at least $ 11.7 million in separate treasury accounts to help pay for agency programs , among other things . the amounts each agency distributed varied , depending on the agencies ' differing authorities . fees charged in 2004 by the 10 federal agencies , as well as state land agencies and private ranchers , vary widely . the grazing fee blm and the forest service charge , which was $ 1.43 per aum in 2004 , is established by formula and is generally much lower than the fees charged by the other federal agencies , states , and private ranchers . the other agencies , states , and ranchers generally established fees to obtain the market value of the forage . the formula used to calculate the blm and forest service grazing fee incorporates ranchers ' ability to pay ; therefore the current purpose of the fee is not primarily to recover the agencies ' expenditures or to capture the fair market value of forage . as a result , blm 's and the forest service 's grazing receipts fell short of their expenditures on grazing in fiscal year 2004 by almost $ 115 million . the blm and forest service fee also decreased by 40 percent from 1980 to 2004 , while grazing fees charged by private ranchers increased by 78 percent for the same period . if the purpose of the fee were to recover expenditures , blm and the forest service would have had to charge $ 7.64 and $ 12.26 per aum , respectively ; alternately , if the purpose were to gain a fair market value , the agencies ' fees would vary depending on the market . differences in resources and legal requirements can cause fees to vary ; however , the approaches used by other agencies could close the gap in expenditures and receipts or more closely align blm and forest service fees with market prices . the purpose of the grazing fee is , ultimately , for the congress to determine .
in recent years , congress has expressed concerns about the federal land management agencies ' ability to provide quality recreational opportunities and reduce visitor confusion over the variety of user fees . in december 2004 , congress passed the federal lands recreation enhancement act ( rea ) to standardize recreation fee collection and use at federal lands and waters . gao was asked to determine what the agencies have done to coordinate implementation of rea , what agencies have done to implement rea , the extent to which agencies have controls and accounting procedures for collected fees , how projects and activities are selected to receive funding from fees , and the extent of unobligated fund balances . to answer these objectives , gao reviewed agency guidance , analyzed fee data , interviewed officials , visited 26 fee - collecting units , and administered a nationwide survey to 900 fee - collecting units . the departments of the interior ( doi ) and agriculture ( usda ) established four working groups to facilitate interagency cooperation and coordination of rea implementation . each working group has made progress , but some issues remain unresolved . for example , the interagency pass working group has yet to determine the price to charge for the new pass , which is to be implemented in january 2007. to implement rea , agencies reviewed their fee programs and made modifications to the fee programs at some of their units . for example , several of usda 's forest service units dropped 437 sites from their fee program , such as picnic areas , because they did not meet rea criteria . however , not all units are in compliance with rea . many agency officials said that while the agencies have issued some interim guidance , rea was difficult to interpret and suggested the need for more specific and detailed guidance on the fee program . in addition , doi 's bureau of reclamation has not yet determined whether to implement rea . reclamation is assessing how rea applies to its operations . some agencies lack adequate controls and accounting procedures for collected recreation fees and lack effective guidance for establishing such controls . on the basis of visits , some units did not have an effective means of verifying whether all collected fees are accounted for . in addition , many units have not implemented a system of routine audits to help ensure that fees are collected and used as authorized and that collected funds are safeguarded . the various agencies participating under rea have different processes for selecting projects to be funded with recreation fee revenues . at doi 's bureau of land management and fish and wildlife service and usda 's forest service , most proposed projects are approved at the local unit level , usually within a few weeks . at doi 's national park service , fee projects are reviewed and approved at the unit , regional , and headquarters or department level before projects are funded . according to national park service officials , under this process , it can sometimes take a year or more to obtain approval for a requested fee project , which delays project implementation and contributes to unobligated fee revenue balances . agencies have $ 300 million in unobligated fee revenue balances . unit officials cited several reasons for the unobligated balances , such as the need to save for large projects . many unit officials also said that recreation fee revenues are essential to providing services at their recreation areas that would not otherwise be funded .
since the general mining act of 1872 , billions of dollars in hardrock minerals , such as gold , have been extracted from federal land now managed by the department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) . for years , some mining operators did not reclaim land , creating environmental , health , and safety risks . beginning in 1981 , federal regulations required all operators to reclaim blm land disturbed by these operations . in 2001 , federal regulations began requiring operators to provide financial assurances before they began exploration or mining operations . gao was asked to determine the types , amount , and coverage of financial assurances operators currently use ; extent to which financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim land not reclaimed by the operator since blm began requiring financial assurances ; and reliability and sufficiency of blm 's automated information system ( lr2000 ) for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations . according to gao 's survey of blm state offices , as of july 2004 , hardrock operators were using 11 types of financial assurances , valued at about $ 837 million , to guarantee reclamation costs for existing hardrock operations on blm land . surety bonds , letters of credit , and corporate guarantees accounted for most of the assurances ' value . however , these financial assurances may not fully cover all future reclamation costs for these existing hardrock operations if operators do not complete required reclamation . blm reported that , as of july 2004 , some existing hardrock operations do not have financial assurances and some have no or outdated reclamation plans and / or cost estimates , on which financial assurances should be based . blm identified 48 hardrock operations on blm land that had ceased and not been reclaimed by operators since it began requiring financial assurances . blm reported that the most recent cost estimates for 43 of these operations totaled about $ 136 million , with no adjustment for inflation ; it did not report reclamation cost estimates for the other 5 operations . however , as of july 2004 , financial assurances had paid or guaranteed $ 69 million and federal agencies and others had provided $ 10.6 million to pay for reclamation , leaving $ 56.4 million in reclamation costs unfunded . financial assurances were not adequate to pay all estimated costs for required reclamation for 25 of the 48 operations because some operations did not have financial assurances , despite blm efforts in some cases to make the operators provide them ; some operations ' financial assurances were less than the most recent reclamation cost estimates ; and some financial assurance providers went bankrupt . also , cost estimates may be understated for about half of the remaining 23 operations because the estimates may not have been updated to reflect inflation or other factors . blm 's lr2000 is not reliable and sufficient for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations because blm staff do not always update information and lr2000 is not currently designed to track certain critical information . specifically , staff have not entered information on each operation , and for those operations that are included , the information is not always current . also , lr2000 does not track some critical information -- operations ' basic status , some types of allowable assurances , and state - and county - held financial assurances . given these limitations , blm 's reliance on lr2000 to manage financial assurances is mixed : headquarters does not always rely on it and blm state offices ' reliance varies . to compensate for lr2000 's limitations , some blm offices use informal record - keeping systems to help manage hardrock operations and financial assurances . blm has taken some steps and identified others to improve lr2000 for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations .
the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act of 2000 ( eeoicpa ) authorized the department of energy ( energy ) to help its former contractor employees file state workers ' compensation claims for illnesses that could be linked to exposure to toxic substances during their employment . concerned with the relatively small number of finalized cases and the overall effectiveness of the program , congress asked gao to review costs incurred by energy to administer the program . specifically , congress asked gao to determine whether internal controls over program payments were adequately designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper payments to contractors would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business and program payments were properly supported as a valid use of government funds . energy did not establish an effective control environment over payments to contractors or overall contract costs . specifically , because energy lacked an effective review and approval process for contractor invoices , it had no assurance that goods and services billed had actually been received . although responsibility for review and approval of invoices on the largest contract rested with the space and naval warfare systems center , new orleans ( ssc nola ) through an interagency agreement , energy did not ensure that ssc nola carried out proper oversight . energy also failed to maintain accountability for equipment purchased by contractors . further , subcontractor agreements , which represented nearly $ 15 million in program charges , were not adequately assessed , nor were overall contract costs sufficiently monitored or properly reported . these fundamental control weaknesses made energy highly vulnerable to improper payments . gao identified $ 26.4 million in improper and questionable payments for contractor costs , including billings of employees in labor categories for which they were not qualified or that did not reflect the duties they actually performed , the inappropriate use of fully burdened labor rates for subcontracted labor , add - on charges to other direct costs and base fees that were not in accordance with contract terms , and various other direct costs that were improperly paid . further , certain payments toward the end of the program for furniture and computer equipment may not have been an efficient use of government funds . these improper and questionable payments represent nearly 30 percent of the $ 92 million in total program funds spent through september 30 , 2005 , but could be even higher given the poor control environment and the fact that gao only reviewed selected program payments .
consumers can be violating the law and possibly risking their health by purchasing imported prescription drugs over the internet . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , in the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the food and drug administration ( fda ) , in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , work with other federal agencies at international mail and express carrier facilities to inspect for and interdict prescription drugs illegally imported for personal use . this report addresses available data about the volume and safety of personal prescription drug imports , the procedures and practices used to inspect and interdict prescription drugs unapproved for import , factors affecting federal efforts to enforce the laws governing prescription drugs imported for personal use , and efforts federal agencies have taken to coordinate enforcement efforts . the information currently available on the safety of illegally imported prescription drugs is very limited , and neither cbp nor fda systematically collects data on the volume of these imports . nevertheless , on the basis of their own observations and limited information they collected at some mail and carrier facilities , both cbp and fda officials said that the volume of prescription drugs imported into the united states is substantial and increasing . fda officials said that they can not assure the public of the safety of drugs purchased from foreign sources outside the u.s. regulatory system . fda has issued new procedures to standardize practices for selecting packages for inspection and making admissibility determinations . while these procedures may encourage uniform practices across mail facilities , packages containing prescription drugs continue to be released to the addressees . cbp has also implemented new procedures to interdict and destroy certain imported controlled substances , such as valium . cbp officials said the new process is designed to improve their ability to quickly handle packages containing these drugs , but they did not know if the policy had affected overall volume because packages may not always be detected . we identified three factors that have complicated federal enforcement of laws prohibiting the personal importation of prescription drugs . first , volume has strained limited federal resources at the mail facilities . second , internet pharmacies can operate outside the u.s. regulatory system and evade federal law enforcement actions . third , current law requires fda to give addressees of packages containing unapproved imported drugs notice and the opportunity to provide evidence of admissibility regarding their imported items . fda and hhs have testified before congress that this process placed a burden on limited resources . in may 2001 , fda proposed to the hhs secretary that this legal requirement be eliminated , but according to fda and hhs officials , as of july 2005 , the secretary had not responded with a proposal . fda officials stated that any legislative change might require consideration of such issues as whether to forgo an individual 's opportunity to provide evidence of the admissibility of the drug ordered . prior federal task forces and working groups had taken steps to deal with internet sales of prescription drugs since 1999 , but these efforts did not position federal agencies to successfully address the influx of these drugs imported from foreign sources . recently , cbp has organized a task force to coordinate federal agencies ' activities to enforce the laws prohibiting the personal importation of prescription drugs . the task force 's efforts appear to be steps in the right direction , but they could be enhanced by establishing a strategic framework to define the scope of the problem at mail and carrier facilities , determine resource needs , establish performance measures , and evaluate progress . absent this framework , it will be difficult to oversee task force efforts ; hold agencies accountable ; and ensure ongoing , focused attention to the enforcement of the relevant laws .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a multibillion - dollar program -- u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) -- to control and monitor the pre - entry , entry , visa status , and exit of foreign visitors . to deliver system and other program capabilities , the program relies extensively on contractors , some of whom are managed directly by us - visit and some by other agencies ( including both dhs agencies , such as customs and border protection , and non - dhs agencies , such as the general services administration ) . because of us - visit 's heavy reliance on contractors to deliver program capabilities , gao was asked to determine whether dhs has established and implemented effective controls for managing and overseeing us - visit - related contracts . us - visit - related contracts have not been effectively managed and overseen . the us - visit program office established and implemented certain nonfinancial controls for those contracts that it managed directly , such as verifying that contractor deliverables satisfied established requirements . however , it did not implement effective controls for overseeing its contracts managed by other dhs agencies and by non - dhs agencies . moreover , effective financial controls were not in place on any contracts that gao reviewed . the program office did not know the full extent of us - visit - related contract actions , and it had not performed key nonfinancial practices associated with understanding contractor performance in meeting the terms of these contracts . this oversight gap was exacerbated by the fact that the other agencies had not always established and implemented effective controls for managing their respective contracts . these other agencies directly managed more than half ( 56 percent ) of the total us - visit - related contract obligations reported to gao . the program office and other agencies did not implement effective financial controls . without these controls , some agencies were unable to reliably report us - visit contracting expenditures . further , the program office and these other agencies improperly paid and accounted for related invoices , including making duplicate payments and payments for non - us - visit services with funds designated for us - visit . according to the us - visit program official responsible for contract matters , the program office has focused on contracts that it manages directly and decided to rely on the responsible agencies to manage the other contracts . further , it has decided to use other agencies to properly manage financial matters for their respective contracts , and it also decided to rely on another agency for its own financial management services . without effective contract management and oversight controls , the program office does not know that required program deliverables and mission results will be produced on time and within budget , and that proper payments are made .
following major welfare reform in 1996 , the number of families receiving cash assistance was cut in half to 2 million . while many former recipients now rely more on their earnings , they often work at low - wage jobs with limited benefits and advancement opportunities . to better understand how to help these individuals and their families attain economic self - sufficiency , gao is reporting on strategies designed to increase income for tanf recipients through employment ; the key factors related to implementing and operating such strategies ; and actions the department of health and human services ( hhs ) has taken to facilitate the use of these strategies . gao consulted experts to gather information about promising strategies and visited 26 programs . based on interviews with experts and site visits , we identified four strategies that aimed to increase incomes for recipients of temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) -- training , post - secondary education , self - employment , and financial asset building . training strategies often targeted services to particular groups or job market needs . other programs used post - secondary education to position clients for higher - wage jobs . some programs we visited gave participants the tools to run their own businesses as a way out of poverty . finally , asset building strategies aim to help clients save and invest money to pursue career goals and support their families . the 26 programs we visited used one or more of these strategies . a broad network of local non - profits , state and local tanf offices , employers , and community colleges is key to operating these strategies . some of the programs we visited were non - profits under contract with the tanf office . others relied on a mix of public and private funds , some because of concerns that tanf 's emphasis on work was a barrier to providing education and training options . state and local tanf offices , for their part , sometimes set policies and provide additional funding to encourage the strategies discussed in this report . local non - profits and tanf agencies either directly provided or helped link clients to supplemental services such as child care , housing , on - the - job support , and transportation . as part of the broader network , local non - profits and tanf offices often forged links with employers and community colleges to leverage additional resources for their clients , including training curricula , career ladders , and work opportunities . hhs is supporting these strategies through research , targeted grants , and technical assistance . efforts by other federal agencies , such as the departments of education and labor , also support some of the strategies discussed in this report . hhs has several research projects focused on helping low - income individuals find higher - wage employment and build their assets . while these efforts are important , more needs to be known about the effectiveness of specific strategies , such as those identified in this report , in increasing tanf recipients ' earnings capacity . in addition to the tanf block grant , hhs has two small grant programs that support employment and asset - building strategies . while hhs has provided some technical assistance to facilitate the use of these strategies , it is not clear whether service providers understand ways they can incorporate education and training in a work - focused welfare system . furthermore , hhs faces some challenges disseminating information on new research or promising strategies to all of the organizations providing services to tanf clients in the more decentralized welfare environment .
following the invasion of iraq in march 2003 , concerns were raised about the security of iraq 's radiological sources . such sources are used in medicine , industry , and research , but unsecured sources could pose risks of radiation exposure , and terrorists could use them to make `` dirty bombs . . this report provides information on the readiness of the department of defense ( dod ) to collect and secure sources , the number of sources dod collected and secured , u.s. assistance to help regulate sources in iraq , and the lessons dod and the department of energy learned . dod was not ready to collect and secure radiological sources when the war began in march 2003 and for about 6 months thereafter . before dod could collect radiological sources , it had to specify criteria for which sources should be collected and how to safely collect them , coordinate within dod , coordinate assistance from the department of energy ( doe ) , and resolve contract issues . dod did not issue guidance for collecting and securing sources until july 2003 and did not finalize the terms of the contract to collect sources until september 2003. until radiological sources could be collected , some sources were looted and scattered , and some troops were diverted from their regular combat duties to guard sources in diverse places . in june 2004 , dod removed about 1,000 of the 1,400 radiological sources collected in iraq and sent them to the united states for disposal . dod left in place approximately 700 additional sources that it had judged were adequately secured and being used properly by iraqis . according to dod and department of state officials , however , the total number of radiological sources in iraq remains unknown . the united states assisted in establishing an iraqi agency to regulate radiological sources . since june 2004 , state and doe have helped this new agency develop an action plan with assistance from the international atomic energy agency . however , according to state officials , because of uncertainties associated with the continuing formation of the iraqi government , state will have to monitor iraqi efforts to ensure the continued growth and success of an independent , competent , and sustainable regulatory authority for the control of radioactive sources and materials . both dod and doe are considering improvements based on their iraq experiences . a 2004 study of lessons learned , requested by dod , recommended that dod develop the capability to quickly eliminate weapons of mass destruction in hostile environments , but it did not focus on the narrower radiological source mission . in contrast , doe has contracted for a study to examine lessons from its role in removing radiological sources from iraq .
between 2002 and 2012 nearly 850,000 jobs will open in the construction industry ; experts predict that there will not be enough skilled workers to fill them . this has heightened concerns about program outcomes and program quality in the nation 's apprenticeship system and the u.s. department of labor 's oversight of it . gao assessed the extent to which labor monitors registered apprenticeship programs in the states where it has direct oversight , its oversight activities in states that do their own monitoring , and the outcomes for construction apprentices in programs sponsored by employers and unions in relation to programs sponsored by employers alone . labor 's monitoring of programs it directly oversees has been limited . we found that in 2004 labor reviewed only 4 percent of programs in the 23 states where it has direct oversight . according to federal program directors in those states , limited staff constrained their ability to do more reviews . also , labor has focused in recent years on registering new programs and recruiting apprentices . although labor collects much data about the programs it oversees , it has not employed its database to generate information indicative of program performance , such as completion rates , that might allow it to be more efficient in its oversight . labor does not regularly review council - monitored states or collect data from them that would allow for a national picture of apprenticeships . labor is responsible for conducting formal reviews of the 27 states and the district of columbia that established apprenticeship councils to monitor their own apprenticeship programs ; but , according to directors in these states , the reviews have been infrequent and not necessarily useful . while labor collects only aggregate data on apprentices from these states , we identified 10 states with large numbers of apprentices that were willing and capable of providing gao data on apprentices by occupation as well as some information on completion rates , completion times , and wages . data in labor 's apprenticeship database and from council - monitored states show that completion rates and wages for construction apprentices in programs sponsored jointly by employers and unions were higher than those for programs sponsored by employers alone . we found that completion rates for apprentices in programs jointly sponsored by unions and employers were 47 percent on average compared with 30 percent in programs sponsored solely by employers . completion rates declined under both types of sponsorship for the period we examined , but labor , as part of its oversight , does not track reasons for noncompletion , making it difficult to determine what lies behind this trend .
since its creation , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) has operated passenger aircraft services . these operations have been questioned in several prior audit reports . gao was asked to perform a series of audits of nasa 's controls to prevent fraud , waste , and abuse of taxpayer dollars . in this audit , gao assessed the relative cost of nasa passenger aircraft services in comparison with commercial costs , whether nasa aircraft services were retained and operated in accordance with governmentwide guidance , and the effectiveness of nasa 's oversight and management of this program . nasa - owned and - chartered passenger aircraft services provide a perquisite to employees , but cost taxpayers an estimated five times more than flying on commercial airlines . while the majority of nasa air travel is on commercial airlines , nasa employees took at least 1,188 flights using nasa passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. use of nasa passenger aircraft services can save time , provide more flexibility to meet senior executives ' schedules , and provide other less tangible and quantifiable benefits . however , gao 's analysis of available reported data related to nasa passenger aircraft services during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed nasa reported costs were nearly $ 25 million compared with estimated commercial airline coach transportation costs of about $ 5 million . further , this relative cost comparison , based on available nasa reported costs , did not take into account all applicable types of costs associated with its passenger aircraft services , including , for example , depreciation associated with the estimated $ 14 million nasa paid in 2001 to acquire several aircraft used for passenger transportation . consequently , nasa 's passenger air transportation services are much more costly than indicated by available data . further , nasa is currently considering additional expenditures of about $ 77 million to upgrade and expand its existing passenger fleet . nasa 's ownership of aircraft used to provide passenger transportation conflicts with federal policy allowing agencies to own aircraft only as needed to meet specified mission requirements , such as prisoner transportation and aeronautical research . gao 's analysis of nasa passenger aircraft flights for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 showed that an estimated 86 percent -- about seven out of every eight flights -- were taken to support routine business operations specifically prohibited by federal policy regarding aircraft ownership , including routine site visits , meetings , speeches , and conferences . further , agencywide oversight and management of its passenger aircraft services was not effective . nasa 's ability to make informed decisions on continued ownership of its passenger aircraft fleet and on flight - by - flight justifications was impaired by the lack of reliable agencywide data on aircraft costs and other weak management oversight practices .
the department of defense ( dod ) has expressed concerns about servicemembers ' use of predatory consumer loans as well as their overall financial conditions . `` predatory lending '' has no precise definition but describes cases where a lender takes unfair advantage of a borrower , sometimes through deception , fraud , or terms such as very high interest or fees . serious financial problems can adversely affect unit morale and readiness as well as servicemembers ' credit history and military career . dod has tools such as off - limits lists to help curb the use and effects of predatory loans . gao answered two questions : to what extent do active duty servicemembers use consumer loans considered to be predatory in nature ? . and are dod and active duty servicemembers fully utilizing the tools that dod has to curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices ? . the extent to which active duty servicemembers use consumer loans considered to be predatory and the effects of that borrowing are unknown . the only dod - wide data come from surveys . in a 2004 survey , 12 percent of servicemembers said they or their spouse had used , during the last 12 months , at least one of four types of loans : payday , rent - to - own , automobile title pawn , or tax refund , which dod says can often be associated with predatory lending practices . dod is unable to quantify the extent to which the loans have associated predatory practices , the frequency of such borrowing , the amounts borrowed , or the effects of the loans . although not generalizable , participants in gao 's 60 focus groups at 13 bases in the united states and germany identified problems resulting from the use of short - term consumer loans , but other participants described the loans as quick , easy , and obtainable by servicemembers with bad credit . privacy concerns and the reluctance of servicemembers to reveal financial problems make it difficult to quantify the use and effects of predatory lending . dod and active duty servicemembers are not fully utilizing dod 's tools for curbing the use and effects of predatory lending practices . at some of the installations that we visited , the armed forces disciplinary control board -- a panel that can recommend to an installation commander that a business be placed off - limits to servicemembers -- had not met in over a year . fort drum 's board , for example , had not met in about 4 years , even though the new york attorney general had filed two lending - related lawsuits against businesses on behalf of servicemembers and some of their family members at fort drum . dod officials told us the reasons for boards not meeting or making recommendations include high deployment levels and the effort required to place a business on an off - limits list . other commanders effectively changed businesses ' predatory practices by using their board 's recommendations to place or threaten to place the businesses off - limits . in addition , dod is not always providing a clear message regarding advertising in installation publications . participants in gao 's focus groups said they were confused because dod - provided financial management training ( described in our 2005 report , military personnel : more dod actions needed to address servicemembers ' personal financial management issues ) warned them against using payday lenders but some installation newspapers carried advertisements for such businesses . these problems occur even though a dod instruction requires a disclaimer indicating that the advertisement does not constitute endorsement by the u.s. government and a review by public affairs staff to determine if the advertisement might be detrimental to servicemembers . our review of some installation newspapers showed possible reasons for the confusion ; the disclaimers were often not prominently displayed or were located away from the advertisements . dod also offers servicemembers free legal review of contracts and other financial transactions , but servicemembers often do not use the reviews until problems result . recently , dod began exploring additional on - installation alternatives to payday loans .
in early october 2004 , the nation lost about half its expected influenza vaccine supply when one of two major manufacturers announced it would not release any vaccine for the 2004-05 season because of potential contamination . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) had earlier recommended vaccination for 188 million individuals , including those at high risk of severe complications from influenza ( such as seniors and those with chronic conditions ) , and other groups ( such as their close contacts ) . although health officials took actions to distribute the limited supply of influenza vaccine , reports persisted of high - risk individuals and others in priority groups who could not find a vaccination , including those who were turned away and never returned when supplies became available . such reports raised questions about the adequacy of u.s. preparedness to respond to significant vaccine shortages . gao was asked to examine actions taken at federal , state , and local levels to ensure that high - risk individuals had access to influenza vaccine during the shortage , including any lessons learned . federal , state , and local health officials took several actions beginning in october 2004 to help ensure that individuals at high risk of severe complications from influenza had access to vaccine . federal officials , for example , quickly revised vaccination recommendations to target available vaccine to high - risk individuals and to other priority groups . additional actions were aimed to distribute vaccine expeditiously and to communicate with providers and the public as events unfolded and vaccine supplies changed . beginning in mid - december , health officials took steps to distribute additional vaccine , broadening recommendations on who should be vaccinated . although these actions helped achieve vaccination rates approaching past levels for certain priority groups , such as those aged 65 years and older , several lessons emerged , including some that could help with future shortages . first , unless planning for problems is already in place , action is delayed . cdc 's lack of a contingency plan contributed to delays and uncertainty about how to ensure that high - risk individuals had access to vaccine . second , when actions occur late in the influenza season , they are likely to have little effect . third , effective response requires communication that is both clear and consistent . cdc has taken a number of steps , including issuing interim guidelines in august 2005 , to respond to possible future shortages . it is too early , however , to assess the effectiveness of these efforts in coordinating actions of federal , state , and local health agencies and others . in commenting on a draft of this report , hhs concurred with gao 's finding that contingency planning would improve response efforts , and the agency indicated that additional preparations were under way .
the u.s. commercial aviation industry has an extraordinary safety record . however , when passenger airlines have accidents or serious incidents , regardless of their rarity , the consequences can be tragic . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) works to maintain a high level of safety through an effective safety oversight system . keys to this system are to : establish programs that focus resources on areas of highest safety risk and on mitigating risks ; provide training and communication to ensure that inspectors can consistently carry out the agency 's oversight programs ; and have processes and data to continuously monitor , evaluate , and improve the numerous oversight programs that make up the safety oversight system . this statement focuses on these three key areas and is based on recent gao reports on faa 's inspection oversight programs , industry partnership programs , enforcement program , and training program . faa 's safety oversight system includes programs that focus on risk identification and mitigation through a risk - based system safety approach , leveraging of resources through designee and partnership relationships , and enforcement of safety regulations , but the benefits of these programs are not being fully realized . for example , faa 's system safety approach includes the addition of a program that emphasizes risk identification to its traditional inspection program for overseeing some airlines , which is not based on risk . however , it is likely that the benefits of this approach could be enhanced if the inspection workload was not as heavily oriented to the traditional inspection program 's non - risk based activities . faa leverages its resources through its designee programs , in which designated individuals and organizations perform about 90 percent of certification - related activities , and through its industry partnership programs , which are designed to assist the agency in receiving safety information . an outgrowth of faa 's inspection process is its enforcement program , which is intended to ensure industry compliance with safety regulations . however , gao has expressed concerns that this program may not be as effective as it could be in deterring violations . faa has made training an integral part of its safety oversight system , but several actions could improve the results of its training efforts , including ensuring that inspectors are well - trained in faa 's system safety approach and have sufficient knowledge of increasingly complex aircraft and systems to effectively identify safety risks . faa has established mandatory training requirements for its workforce and designees . we have reported that faa has generally followed effective management practices for planning , developing , delivering , and assessing the impact of its technical training for safety inspectors . gao has found inadequate evaluative processes and limitations with data for faa 's inspection programs , designee programs , industry partnership programs , and enforcement program . for example , faa lacked requirements or criteria for evaluating its designee programs . in another example , faa 's nationwide enforcement database is not as useful as it could be because of missing or incomplete historical information about enforcement cases .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a program -- the u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) -- to collect , maintain , and share information , including biometric identifiers , on selected foreign nationals who enter and exit the united states . us - visit uses these biometric identifiers ( digital fingerscans and photographs ) to screen persons against watch lists and to verify that a visitor is the person who was issued a visa or other travel document . visitors are also to confirm their departure by having their visas or passports scanned and undergoing fingerscanning at selected air and sea ports of entry . gao was asked to testify on the status of us - visit and dhs progress in implementing recommendations that gao made as part of its prior reviews of us - visit annual expenditure plans . the testimony is based on gao 's prior reports as well as ongoing work for the house committee on homeland security . gao 's recommendations are directed at helping the department improve its capabilities to deliver us - visit capability and benefit expectations on time and within budget . according to dhs , the recommendations have made us - visit a stronger program . the us - visit program has met a number of demanding requirements that were mandated in legislation . a pre - entry screening capability is in place in overseas visa issuance offices , and an entry identification capability is operating at 115 airports , 14 seaports , and 154 land ports of entry . this has been accomplished during a period of dhs - wide change , and has resulted in preventing criminal aliens from entering the country and potentially deterring others from even attempting to do so . nevertheless , dhs has more to do to implement gao recommendations aimed at better ensuring that us - visit is maximizing its potential for success and holding itself accountable for results . dhs has taken steps to address those gao recommendations intended to ensure that us - visit as defined is the `` right thing . . for example , it is clarifying the strategic context within which us - visit is to operate , having drafted a strategic plan to show how us - visit is aligned with dhs 's mission goals and operations and to provide an overall vision for immigration and border management . however , the plan has yet to be approved , causing its integration with other departmentwide border security initiatives to remain unclear . in addition , the department has analyzed the program 's costs , benefits , and risks , but its analyses do not yet demonstrate that the program is producing or will produce mission value commensurate with expected costs and risks . in particular , the department 's return - on - investment analyses for exit options do not demonstrate that these solutions will be cost - effective . dhs has also taken steps to address those gao recommendations aimed at ensuring that the program is executed in the `` right way . . the department has made good progress in establishing the program 's human capital capabilities , which should help ensure that it has sufficient staff with the necessary skills and abilities . this is particularly important in light of the program 's more limited progress in establishing capabilities in certain program management process areas , such as test management . for example , a test plan used in a recent system acceptance test did not adequately trace between test cases and the requirements to be verified by testing . incomplete test plans reduce assurance that systems will perform as intended once they are deployed . dhs also has begun addressing gao 's recommendations to establish accountability for program performance and results , but more needs to be done . for example , dhs 's expenditure plans have not described progress against commitments made in previous plans . unless performance against commitments is measured and disclosed , the ability to manage and oversee the program will suffer . the longer the program proceeds without fully addressing gao 's recommendations , the greater the risk that it will not deliver promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget .
the indian health service ( ihs ) , located within the department of health and human services , is responsible for arranging health care services for native americans ( american indians and alaska natives ) . ihs services include primary care ( medical , dental , and vision ) ; ancillary services , such as laboratory and pharmacy ; and specialty care , including services provided by physician specialists . ihs provides some services through direct care at hospitals , health centers , and health stations , which may be federally or tribally operated . when services are not available -- that is , both offered and accessible -- on site , ihs offers them , as funds permit , through contract care furnished by outside providers . concerns persist that some native americans are experiencing gaps in necessary health care . gao was asked to examine the availability of primary care services and ancillary and specialty services for native americans . additionally , gao examined the underlying factors associated with variations in the availability of services and strategies used by facilities to increase service availability . gao conducted site visits to 13 facilities and interviewed ihs officials from all 12 ihs areas , which cover all or part of 35 states . gao received written comments from ihs . ihs substantially agreed with the findings and conclusions of this report . the availability of primary care -- medical , dental , and vision -- services was largely dependent on the extent to which native americans living in ihs areas were able to gain access to the services offered at ihs - funded facilities . all of the 13 facilities gao visited offered medical services , such as physical examinations , while 12 facilities offered dental and 12 facilities offered vision services . however , access to these services was not always assured because of factors such as the amount of waiting time between the call to make an appointment and the delivery of a service , travel distances to facilities , or a lack of transportation . certain ancillary and specialty services were not always available to the native americans served by the 13 facilities , primarily because of gaps in the services offered by the facilities . while some ancillary and specialty services were offered to all patients , gao also identified gaps in other services , including services to diagnose and treat nonurgent conditions -- such as arthritis and knee injuries -- specialty dental care , and behavioral health care . most facilities lacked the staff or equipment to offer these services on site and thus had to purchase them with contract care funds , which were rationed on the basis of relative medical need at 12 of the 13 facilities . five of the 12 facilities were unable to pay for any contract care services that were not deemed emergent or acutely urgent . gao identified three distinct factors that were associated with variations in the availability of services , namely a facility 's structure , location , and funding from sources other than ihs . a facility 's structure was associated with the overall amount and range of services available . for example , hospitals offered a broader array of services on site for more hours per week compared with other facilities . location was a factor in recruiting and retaining staff for geographically remote facilities and in the cost of certain types of services , most notably transportation . finally , a facility 's funding from two types of sources -- reimbursements from private and federal health insurance programs for care offered on site and any tribal contributions made -- affected the extent to which the facility was able to offer services . the amount of these funds varied across facilities . facilities reported using at least one of six strategies to increase the availability of services . these strategies included bringing specialists on site and negotiating discounts for contract care . according to officials , the strategies were not available to , or effective for , every facility . for example , four facilities reported that while hospitals generally offered discounted rates for contract care , physicians were not always willing to do so .
although the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property domestically , intellectual property protection in parts of the world is inadequate . as a result , u.s. goods are subject to piracy and counterfeiting in many countries . a number of u.s. agencies are engaged in efforts to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . this testimony , based on a prior gao report as well as recent work , describes u.s. agencies ' efforts , the mechanisms used to coordinate these efforts , and the impact of these efforts and the challenges they face . u.s. agencies undertake policy initiatives , training and assistance activities , and law enforcement actions in an effort to improve protection of u.s. intellectual property abroad . policy initiatives include identifying countries with the most significant problems -- an annual interagency process known as the `` special 301 '' review . in addition , many agencies engage in assistance activities , such as providing training for foreign officials . finally , a small number of agencies carry out law enforcement actions , such as criminal investigations and seizures of counterfeit merchandise . agencies use several mechanisms to coordinate their efforts , although the mechanisms ' usefulness varies . the national intellectual property law enforcement coordination council , established in 1999 to coordinate domestic and international intellectual property law enforcement , has struggled to find a clear mission , has undertaken few activities , and is generally viewed as having little impact despite recent congressional action to strengthen the council . the congress 's action included establishing the role of coordinator , but the position has not yet been filled ( although the selection process is underway ) . the administration 's october 2004 strategy targeting organized piracy ( stop ! ) . is intended to strengthen u.s. efforts to combat piracy and counterfeiting . thus far , the initiative has resulted in some new actions and emphasized other ongoing efforts . u.s. efforts have contributed to strengthened intellectual property legislation overseas , but enforcement in many countries remains weak , and further u.s. efforts face significant challenges . for example , competing u.s. policy objectives such as national security interests take precedence over protecting intellectual property in certain regions . further , other countries ' domestic policy objectives can affect their `` political will '' to address u.s. concerns . finally , many economic factors , as well as the involvement of organized crime , hinder u.s. and foreign governments ' efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property abroad .
since 1979 , egypt has received about $ 60 billion in military and economic assistance with about $ 34 billion in the form of foreign military financing ( fmf ) grants that enable egypt to purchase u.s. - manufactured military goods and services . in this report , gao describes the types and amounts of fmf assistance provided to egypt ; assesses the financing arrangements used to provide fmf assistance to egypt ; and evaluates how the u.s. assesses the program 's contribution to u.s. foreign policy and security goals . egypt is currently among the largest recipients of u.s. foreign assistance , along with israel , afghanistan , and iraq . egypt has received about $ 1.3 billion annually in u.s. foreign military financing ( fmf ) assistance and has purchased a variety of u.s. - manufactured military goods and services such as apache helicopters , f - 16 aircraft , and m1a1 tanks , as well as the training and maintenance to support these systems . the united states has provided egypt with fmf assistance through a statutory cash flow financing arrangement that permits flexibility in how egypt acquires defense goods and services from the united states . in the past , the defense security cooperation agency ( dsca ) accumulated large undisbursed balances in this program . because the flexibilities of cash flow financing permit egypt to pay for its purchases over time , egypt currently has agreements for u.s. defense articles and services worth over $ 2 billion -- some of which are not due for full payment until 2011. the departments of state ( state ) and defense ( dod ) have not conducted an assessment to identify the risks and impacts of a potential shift in fmf funding . officials and many experts assert that the fmf program to egypt supports u.s. foreign policy and security goals ; however , state and dod do not assess how the program specifically contributes to these goals . u.s. and egyptian officials cited examples of egypt 's support for u.s. interests , such as maintaining egyptian - israeli peace and providing access to the suez canal and egyptian airspace . dod has not determined how it will measure progress in achieving key goals such as interoperability and modernizing egypt 's military . for example , the u.s. central command , the responsible military authority , defines modernization as the ratio of u.s. - to - soviet equipment in egypt 's inventory and does not include other potentially relevant factors , such as readiness or military capabilities . achieving interoperability in egypt is complicated by the lack of a common definition of interoperability and limitations on some types of sensitive equipment transfers . given the longevity and magnitude of fmf assistance to egypt , evaluating the degree to which the program meets its goals would be important information for congressional oversight , particularly as congress assesses the balance between economic and military assistance to egypt as well as the impact on u.s. foreign policy interests .
this testimony discusses our recent report on the rules that govern the funding of defined benefit ( db ) plans and the implications of those rules for the problems facing the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) and the db pension system generally . in recent years , the pbgc has encountered serious financial difficulties . prominent companies , such as bethlehem steel , u.s. airways , and united airlines , have terminated their pension plans with severe gaps between the assets these plans held and the pension promises these plan sponsors made to their employees and retirees . these terminations , and other unfavorable market conditions , have created large losses for pbgc 's single - employer insurance program -- the federal program that insures certain benefits of the more than 34 million participants in over 29,000 plans . the single - employer program has gone from a $ 9.7 billion accumulated surplus at the end of fiscal year 2000 to a $ 23.3 billion accumulated deficit as of september 2004 , including a $ 12.1 billion loss for fiscal year 2004. in addition , financially weak companies sponsored db plans with a combined $ 96 billion of underfunding as of september 2004 , up from $ 35 billion as of 2 years earlier . because pbgc guarantees participant benefits , there is concern that the expected continued termination of large plans by bankrupt sponsors will push the program more quickly into insolvency , generating pressure on the congress , and ultimately the taxpayers , to provide financial assistance to pbgc and pension participants . given these concerns , we placed the pbgc 's single - employer program on gao 's high - risk list of agencies and programs that need broad - based transformations to address major challenges . in past reports , we identified several categories of reform that the congress might consider to strengthen the program over the long term . we concluded that the congress should consider comprehensive reform measures to reduce the risks to the program 's long - term financial viability and thus enhance the retirement income security of american workers and retirees . more broadly , pension reform represents a real opportunity to address part of our long - term fiscal problems and reconfigure our retirement security systems to bring them into the 21st century . this opportunity has many related pieces : addressing our nation 's large and growing long - term fiscal gap ; deciding on the appropriate role and size of the federal government -- and how to finance that government -- and bringing the wide array of federal activities into line with today 's world . continuing on our current unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security . we therefore must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that our government can respond to a range of current and emerging security , social , economic , and environmental changes and challenges . the pbgc 's situation is an excellent example of the need for the congress to reconsider the role of government organizations , programs , and policies in light of changes that have occurred since pbgc 's establishment in 1974. our recent work on db pension funding rules provides important insights in understanding the problems facing pbgc and the db system . to summarize our findings , while pension funding rules are intended to ensure that plans have sufficient assets to pay promised benefit to plan participants , significant vulnerabilities exist . although from 1995 to 2002 most of the 100 largest db plans annually had assets that exceeded their current liabilities , by 2002 over half of the 100 largest plans were underfunded , and almost one - fourth of plans were less than 90 percent funded . further , because of leeway in the actuarial methodology and assumptions that sponsors may use to measure plan assets and liabilities , underfunding may actually have been more severe and widespread than reported . additionally , on average over 60 percent of sponsors of these plans made no annual cash contributions to their plans . one key reason for this is that the funding rules allow a sponsor to satisfy minimum funding requirements without necessarily making a cash contribution each year , even though the plan may be underfunded . further , very few sponsors of underfunded plans were required to pay an additional funding charge ( afc ) , a funding mechanism designed to reduce severe plan underfunding . finally , our analysis confirms the notion that plans sponsored by financially weak firms pose a particular risk to pbgc , as these plans were generally more likely to be underfunded , to be subject to an additional funding charge , and to use assumptions to minimize or avoid cash contributions than plans sponsored by stronger firms .
the united states , along with coalition partners and various international organizations , has undertaken a challenging and costly effort to stabilize and rebuild iraq following multiple wars and decades of neglect by the former regime . this enormous effort is taking place in an unstable security environment , concurrent with iraqi efforts to complete a constitutional framework for establishing a permanent government . the united states ' goal is to help the iraqi government develop a democratic , stable , and prosperous country , at peace with itself and its neighbors , a partner in the war against terrorism , enjoying the benefits of a free society and a market economy . in this testimony , gao discusses the funding used to rebuild and stabilize iraq and the challenges that the united states faces in its rebuilding and stabilization efforts . this statement is based on several reports gao has issued to the congress over the past three months . in july , we issued two reports on the status of funding and reconstruction efforts in iraq and the use of private security providers in iraq . we issued two additional reports in september on u.s. reconstruction efforts in the water and sanitation sector and u.s. assistance for the january 2005 iraqi elections . finally , we expect to issue shortly a report on u.s. efforts to stabilize the security situation in iraq ( a classified report ) . this statement includes unclassified information only . the united states is the primary contributor to efforts to stabilize and rebuild iraq . since 2003 , the united states has made available about $ 30 billion for activities that include the construction and repair of infrastructure , procurement of equipment , and training and equipping of iraqi security forces . international donors have pledged $ 13.6 billion in reconstruction funds ( from 2004 through 2007 ) , of which about $ 2.7 billion was provided in multilateral and bilateral grants through august 2005. however , most of the pledged amount '' about $ 10 billion -- is in the form of loans on which the iraqi government largely has not yet drawn . iraqi funds have primarily supported the country 's operating budget , with some focus on capital improvement projects . for 2005 , iraq planned for about $ 28 billion in expenditures -- largely supported by oil proceeds -- to fund salaries , pensions , ministry operations , and subsidies . it is likely that iraq may need more funds than currently available due to the severely degraded infrastructure , post conflict looting and sabotage , and additional security costs . the united states faces three key challenges in stabilizing and rebuilding iraq . first , the security environment and the continuing strength of the insurgency have made it difficult for the united states to transfer security responsibilities to iraqi forces and to engage in rebuilding efforts . the security situation in iraq has deteriorated since june 2003 , with significant increases in attacks against the coalition and the coalition 's partners . second , inadequate performance data and measures make it difficult to determine the overall progress and impact of u.s. reconstruction efforts . the united states has set broad goals for providing essential services in iraq , but limited performance measures present challenges in determining the overall progress and impact of u.s. projects . third , the u.s. reconstruction program has encountered difficulties with iraq 's ability to maintain new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects and to address maintenance needs in the water , sanitation , and electricity sectors . for example , as of june 2005 , u.s. - funded water and sanitation projects representing about $ 52 million of approximately $ 200 million spent on completed projects were inoperable or were operating at lower than normal capacity . the united states has made a significant investment in the rebuilding and stabilization of iraq . to preserve that investment , the united states must address these critical challenges .
the radio - frequency spectrum is used to provide an array of wireless communications services that are critical to the u.s. economy and various government missions , such as national security . with demand for spectrum exploding , and most useable spectrum allocated to existing users , there is growing concern that the current spectrum management framework might not be able to respond adequately to future demands . this testimony , which is based on previous gao reports , provides information on the extent to which the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has adopted market - based mechanisms for commercial use , the extent to which market - based mechanisms have been adopted for federal government users of spectrum , options for improving spectrum management , and potential barriers to spectrum reform . fcc is incrementally adopting market - based approaches for managing the commercial use of spectrum . market - based mechanisms can help promote the efficient use of spectrum by invoking the forces of supply and demand . for example , although fcc currently employs largely a command - and - control process for spectrum allocation , it has provided greater flexibility within certain spectrum bands . in addition , fcc began using auctions to assign spectrum licenses for commercial uses in 1994. finally , fcc has taken steps to facilitate greater secondary market activity , which may provide an additional mechanism to promote the efficient use of spectrum . while some countries have adopted market - based mechanisms to encourage the efficient use of spectrum by government agencies , the department of commerce 's national telecommunications and information administration ( ntia ) has not adopted similar mechanisms for federal government use in the united states . ntia imposes fees designed to recover only a portion of its cost to administer spectrum management , rather than fees that would more closely resemble market prices and thus encourage greater spectrum efficiency among government users ; currently , ntia does not have authority to impose fees that exceed its spectrum management costs . however , adopting market - based mechanisms for federal government use of spectrum might be difficult or undesirable in some contexts because of the primacy of certain government missions , the lack of flexibility in use of spectrum for some agencies , and the lack of financial incentives for government users . industry stakeholders and experts have identified a number of options for improving spectrum management . the most frequently cited options include extending fcc 's auction authority , reexamining the use and distribution of spectrum , and ensuring clearly defined rights and flexibility in commercial spectrum bands ; there was no consensus on these options , except for extending fcc 's auction authority . given the success of fcc 's use of auctions and the overwhelming support for extending fcc 's auction authority , gao suggested that the congress consider extending fcc 's auction authority beyond 2007. congress extended fcc 's auction authority to 2011 with the passage of the deficit reduction act of 2005. the current spectrum management framework may pose barriers to reform , since neither fcc nor ntia has been given ultimate decision - making authority over all spectrum use , or the authority to impose fundamental reform , such as increasing the reliance on market - based mechanisms . under the divided management framework , fcc manages spectrum for nonfederal users , including commercial uses , while ntia manages spectrum for federal government users . as such , fcc and ntia have different perspectives on spectrum use . further , spectrum management issues and major reform cross the jurisdictions of both agencies . thus , contentious and protracted negotiations arise over spectrum management issues .
trading abuses -- including market timing and late trading violations -- uncovered among some of the most well - known companies in the mutual fund industry permitted favored customers to profit at the expense of long - term shareholders . questions have also been raised as to why the new york state office of the attorney general identified the trading abuses in september 2003 before the industry 's primary regulator : the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) . based on two recently issued gao reports , this testimony discusses the reasons sec did not detect the abusive practices at an earlier stage and lessons learned from the agency not doing so , steps the agency has taken to strengthen its mutual fund oversight program , and enforcement actions taken by sec and criminal prosecutors in response to these abuses and sec management procedures for making criminal referrals and ensuring staff independence . prior to september 2003 , sec did not examine mutual fund companies for trading abuses such as market timing violations because agency staff viewed other activities as representing higher risks and believed that companies had financial incentives to establish effective controls . while sec has competing examination priorities , it can draw lessons from not detecting the trading abuses earlier . first , by conducting independent assessments of controls in areas such as market timing ( through interviews , reviews of exception reports , reviews of independent audit reports , or transaction testing as necessary ) , sec could reduce the risk that violations may go undetected . second , sec could further develop its capacity to identify and evaluate evidence of potential risk ( for example , academic studies completed between 2000 and 2002 identified certain market timing concerns as a persistent risk to mutual fund customers ) . third , ensuring the independence of company compliance staff is critical and sec staff could better assess company risks and controls through routine interactions with such staff . sec has taken several steps to strengthen its mutual fund oversight program and the operations of mutual fund companies , but it is too soon to assess the effectiveness of several key initiatives . for example , sec has instructed its staff to make additional assessments of company controls and established a new office to identify and assess potential risks . sec also adopted a rule that requires mutual fund companies to appoint independent compliance officers who are to prepare annual reports on their companies ' policies and violations . however , sec has not developed a plan to receive and review these annual reports on an ongoing basis and thereby enhance its capacity to detect potential violations . since september 2003 , sec has brought 14 enforcement actions against mutual fund companies and 10 enforcement actions against other firms for mutual fund trading abuses . penalties obtained in settlements with mutual fund companies are among the agency 's highest -- ranging from $ 2 million to $ 140 million and averaging $ 56 million . in contrast , penalties obtained in settlements for securities law violations prior to 2003 were typically under $ 20 million . in reviewing a sample of investment adviser cases , gao found that sec followed a consistent process for determining penalties and that it coordinated penalties and other sanctions with interested states . however , gao found certain weaknesses in sec 's management procedures for making referrals to criminal law enforcement and ensuring staff independence . in particular , sec does not require staff to document whether a criminal referral was made or why . without such documentation , sec can not readily determine whether staff make appropriate referrals . further , sec does not require departing staff to report where they plan to work , information gathered by other financial regulators to assess staff compliance with federal laws regarding employment with regulated entities . in the absence of such information , sec 's capacity to ensure compliance with these conflict - of - interest laws is limited .
the chairman , committee on veterans ' affairs , u.s. house of representatives , asked gao to report on the claims processing challenges and opportunities facing the department of veterans affairs ( va ) disability compensation and pension program . for years , the claims process has been the subject of concern and attention within va and by the congress and veterans service organizations . their concerns include long waits for decisions , large claims backlogs , and inaccurate decisions . our work and media reports of significant discrepancies in average disability payments from state to state have also highlighted concerns over the consistency of decision making within va. in january 2003 , we designated federal disability programs , including va 's compensation and pension programs , as a high - risk area because of continuing challenges to improving the timeliness and consistency of its disability decisions and the need to modernize programs . va 's outdated disability determination process does not reflect a current view of the relationship between impairments and work capacity . advances in medicine and technology have allowed some individuals with disabilities to live more independently and work more effectively . the department of veterans affairs continues to experience challenges processing veterans ' disability compensation and pension claims including large numbers of pending claims and lengthy processing times . while va made progress in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 reducing the size and age of its inventory of pending claims , it has lost ground since the end of fiscal year 2003. for example , pending claims increased by over one - third from the end of fiscal year 2003 to the end of fiscal year 2005. meanwhile , va faces continuing questions about its ability to ensure that veterans get consistent decisions across its 57 regional offices . gao recommended in august 2002 that va study the consistency of decisions made by different regional offices , identify acceptable levels of decision - making variation , and reduce variations found to be unacceptable . several factors may impede va 's ability to significantly improve its claims processing performance . these include the potential impacts of laws , court decisions , and increases in the number and complexity of claims received . opportunities for improvement may lie in more fundamental reform in the design and operation of disability compensation and pension claims programs . this would include reexamining program design and the context in which decisions are made as well as the structure and division of labor among field offices . for example , in recent years , gao has found that va and other federal disability programs have not been updated to reflect the current state of science , medicine , technology , and labor market conditions . the schedule on which disability decisions are made within va , for example , is based primarily on estimates made in 1945 about the effect service - connected impairments have on the average individual 's ability to perform jobs requiring manual or physical labor . in addition , our work has shown that about one - third of newly compensated veterans could be interested in receiving a lump sum payment , potentially saving va time and money associated with reopening cases over time . in addition , va and other organizations have identified potential changes to field operations that could enhance productivity and accuracy in processing disability claims . while reexamining claims processing challenges in a larger context may be daunting , there are mechanisms for undertaking such an effort , including the congressionally chartered commission currently studying veterans ' disability benefits .
the freedom of information act ( foia ) establishes that federal agencies must provide the public with access to government information , thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions . to help ensure appropriate implementation , the act requires that agencies report annually to the attorney general , providing specific information about their foia operations . gao has reported previously on the contents of these annual reports for 25 major agencies . gao was asked to describe the foia process and discuss the reported implementation of foia . although the specific details of processes for handling foia requests vary among agencies , the major steps in handling a request are similar across the government . agencies receive requests , usually in writing ( although they may accept requests by telephone or electronically ) , which can be submitted by any organization or member of the public . once requests are received , the agency responds through a process that includes several phases : initial processing , searching for and retrieving responsive records , preparing responsive records for release , approving the release of the records , and releasing the records to the requester . according to data reported by agencies in their annual foia reports , citizens have been requesting and receiving an ever - increasing amount of information from the federal government through foia . the number of requests that agencies received increased by 71 percent from 2002 to 2004. further , agencies reported they have been processing more requests -- 68 percent more from 2002 to 2004. for 92 percent of requests processed in 2004 , agencies reported that responsive records were provided in full to requesters . however , the number of pending requests carried over from year to year -- known as the backlog -- has also been increasing , rising 14 percent since 2002 .
we are grateful to the congress for providing us with the support and resources that have helped us in our quest to be a world - class professional services organization . we are proud of the work we accomplish as we continue to provide our congressional clients with professional , objective , fact - based , non - partisan , non - ideological , fair , balanced , and reliable information in a timely manner regarding how well government programs and policies are working and , when needed , recommendations to make government work better . we believe that investing in gao produces a sound return and results in substantial benefits to the congress and the american people . in the years ahead , our support to the congress will likely prove even more critical because of the pressures created by our nation 's current and projected budget deficit and long - term fiscal imbalance . these fiscal pressures will require the congress to make tough choices regarding what the government should do , how it will do its work , who will help carry out its work in the future , and how government will be financed in the future . we summarized the larger challenges facing the federal government in our recently issued 21st century challenges report . in this report , we emphasize the critical need to bring the federal government 's programs and policies into line with 21st century realities . continuing on our current unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode , if not suddenly damage , our economy , our standard of living , and ultimately our national security . we , therefore , must fundamentally reexamine major spending and tax policies and priorities in an effort to recapture our fiscal flexibility and ensure that our programs and priorities respond to emerging security , social , economic , and environmental changes and challenges in the years ahead . we believe that gao can be of invaluable assistance in helping the congress address these challenges . this testimony focuses on our performance and results with the funding you provided us in fiscal year 2004 , streamlining and management improvement efforts under way , and budget request for fiscal year 2006 to support the congress and serve the american people . in summary the funding we received in fiscal year 2004 allowed us to audit and evaluate a number of major topics of concern to the nation and , in some cases , the world . we also continued to raise concerns about the nation 's long - term fiscal imbalance , summarized key health care statistics and published a proposed framework for related reforms , and provided staff support for the 9 / 11 commission . in fiscal year 2004 , we exceeded or equaled our all - time record for six of our seven key performance indicators while continuing to improve our client and employee feedback results . we are especially pleased to report that we documented $ 44 billion in financial benefits -- a return of $ 95 for every dollar spent , or $ 13.7 million per employee . in fiscal year 2004 , we also recorded 1,197 other benefits that could not be measured in dollar terms including benefits that helped to change laws , to improve services to the public and to promote sound agency and governmentwide management . also , experts from our staff testified at 217 congressional hearings covering a wide range of important public policy issues during fiscal year 2004. shortly after david walker was appointed comptroller general , he determined that our agency would undertake a transformation effort . our transformation effort has enabled us to eliminate a management layer , streamline our organization , reduce our overall footprint , and centralize many of our support functions . currently , over 50 percent of our support staff are contractors , allowing us to devote more of our staff resources to our mission work . we recently surveyed managers of agency support operations and identified additional activities that potentially could be filled through alternative sourcing strategies . in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 , we will further assess the feasibility of using alternative sourcing for these activities . i would be pleased to brief you at a later date on our preliminary analyses . in developing our fiscal year 2006 budget , we have taken into consideration the overall federal budget constraints and the committee 's desire to lead by example . accordingly , we are requesting $ 493.5 million which represents a modest increase of 4 percent over fiscal year 2005. this increase is primarily for mandatory pay costs and price level changes . this budget request will allow us to continue to maximize productivity , operate more effectively and efficiently , and maintain the progress we have made in technology and other areas , but it does not allow us sufficient funding to support a staffing level of 3,269- - the staffing level that we requested in previous years . even as we are tempering our budget request , it needs to be acknowledged that there are increasing demands on gao 's resources . while we have reduced our planned staffing level for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 in order to keep our request modest , we believe that the staffing level we requested in previous years is a more optimal staffing level for gao and would allow us to better meet the needs of the congress and provide the return on investment that both the congress and the american people expect .
in 2004 , an estimated 35.7 million foreign - born people resided in the united states , and many legitimately have ssns . many of these individuals have social security numbers ( ssns ) which can have a key role in verifying authorization to work in the united states . however , some foreign - born individuals have been given ssns inappropriately . recent legislation , aimed at protecting the ssn and preventing fraud and abuse , changes how the social security administration ( ssa ) assigns numbers and awards benefits for foreign - born individuals . the chairman of the subcommittee on social security asked gao to address two questions . first , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for an ssn ? . second , how does ssa determine who is and is not eligible for social security benefits ? . ssa determines who is eligible for an ssn by verifying certain immigration documents and determining if an individual 's card requires a work restriction . some foreign - born individuals are eligible for one of three kinds of social security cards depending in part on their immigration status : regular cards , those valid for work only with authorization from the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and those that are not valid for work -- non - work cards . as of 2003 ssa had issued slightly more than 7 million non - work cards to people who need them to receive benefits for which they were otherwise entitled . both ssa 's inspector general and gao have identified weaknesses in ssa procedures for assigning ssns and issuing cards , also known as enumeration . for example , working undercover and posing as parents of newborns , gao investigators were able to obtain social security cards by using counterfeit documents . congress has enacted recent legislation strengthening the ssn enumeration process and documentation requirements . ssa is implementing the law and is improving document verification and now requires third - party verification of noncitizen documents such as birth certificates and visual inspection of documents before issuing an ssn . ssa also continues to strengthen program integrity by , for example , restricting the number of replacement cards . congress and ssa have also improved laws and procedures designed to strengthen program integrity in the payment of benefits to the foreign - born . due to provisions of the social security protection act of 2004 , some foreign - born individuals who were not authorized to work will no longer be eligible for benefits . to be entitled to benefits , the law requires noncitizens originally assigned an ssn after 2003 to have a work - authorized ssn . amendments to the social security act in 1996 require individuals to be lawfully present in the u.s. to receive social security benefits , though some noncitizens can receive benefits while living abroad , such as noncitizens who have worked in the u.s. and in a country with which the u.s. has a totalization agreement . ssa 's totalization agreements coordinate taxation and public pension benefits . the agreements help eliminate dual taxation and social security coverage that multinational employers and employees encounter when workers temporarily reside in a foreign country with its own social security program . successful implementation of these agreements requires the countries involved to carefully coordinate and verify data they exchange . computer matches with foreign countries , for example , may help protect totalization programs from making payments to ineligible individuals . ssa is exploring options for undertaking such exchanges .
the nation 's commercial nuclear power plants are potential targets for terrorists seeking to cause the release of radioactive material . the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , an independent agency headed by five commissioners , regulates and oversees security at the plants . in april 2003 , in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , nrc revised the design basis threat ( dbt ) , which describes the threat that plants must be prepared to defend against in terms of the number of attackers and their training , weapons , and tactics . nrc also restructured its program for testing security at the plants through force - on - force inspections ( mock terrorist attacks ) . this testimony addresses the following : the process nrc used to develop the april 2003 dbt for nuclear power plants , the actions nuclear power plants have taken to enhance security in response to the revised dbt , and nrc 's efforts to strengthen the conduct of its force - on - force inspections . this testimony is based on gao 's report on security at nuclear power plants , issued on march 14 , 2006 ( gao - 06-388 ) . nrc revised the dbt for nuclear power plants using a process that was generally logical and well - defined . specifically , trained threat assessment staff made recommendations for changes based on an analysis of demonstrated terrorist capabilities . the resulting dbt requires plants to defend against a larger terrorist threat , including a larger number of attackers , a refined and expanded list of weapons , and an increase in the maximum size of a vehicle bomb . key elements of the revised dbt , such as the number of attackers , generally correspond to the nrc threat assessment staff 's original recommendations , but other important elements do not . for example , the nrc staff made changes to some recommendations after obtaining feedback from stakeholders , including the nuclear industry , which objected to certain proposed changes , such as the inclusion of certain weapons . nrc officials said the changes resulted from further analysis of intelligence information . nevertheless , gao found that the process used to obtain stakeholder feedback created the appearance that changes were made based on what the industry considered reasonable and feasible to defend against rather than on what an assessment of the terrorist threat called for . nuclear power plants made substantial security improvements in response to the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and the revised dbt , including security barriers and detection equipment , new protective strategies , and additional security officers . it is too early , however , to conclude that all sites are capable of defending against the dbt because , as of march 30 , 2006 , nrc had conducted force - on - force inspections at 27 , or less than half , of the 65 nuclear power plant sites . nrc has improved its force - on - force inspections -- for example , by conducting inspections more frequently at each site . nevertheless , in observing three inspections and discussing the program with nrc , gao noted potential issues in the inspections that warrant nrc 's continued attention . for example , a lapse in the protection of information about the planned scenario for a mock attack gao observed may have given the plant 's security officers knowledge that allowed them to perform better than they otherwise would have . a classified version of gao 's report provides additional details about the dbt and security at nuclear power plants .
concern has been rising about the nation 's preparedness to respond to vaccine shortages that could occur in future annual influenza seasons or during an influenza pandemic -- a global influenza outbreak . although the timing or extent of a future influenza pandemic can not be predicted , studies suggest that its effect in the united states could be severe , and shortages of vaccine could occur . for the 2004-05 annual influenza season , the nation lost about half its expected influenza vaccine supply when one of two major manufacturers announced in october 2004 that it would not release any vaccine . gao examined federal , state , and local actions taken in response to the shortage , including lessons learned . the nation 's experience during the unexpected 2004-05 vaccine shortfall offers insights into some of the challenges that government entities will face in a pandemic . gao was asked to provide a statement on lessons learned from the 2004-05 vaccine shortage and their relevance to planning and preparing for similar situations in the future , including an influenza pandemic . this statement is based on a gao report , influenza vaccine : shortages in 2004-05 season underscore need for better preparation ( gao - 05-984 ) , and on previous gao reports and testimonies about influenza vaccine supply and pandemic preparedness . a number of lessons emerged from federal , state , and local responses to the 2004-05 influenza vaccine shortage that carry implications for handling future vaccine shortages in either an annual influenza season or an influenza pandemic . first , limited contingency planning slows response . at the start of the 2004-05 influenza season , when the supply shortfall became apparent , the nation lacked a contingency plan specifically to address severe shortages . the absence of such a plan led to delays and uncertainties on the part of state and local public health entities on how best to ensure access to vaccine by individuals at high risk of severe influenza - related complications . second , streamlined mechanisms to expedite vaccine availability are key to an effective response . during the 2004-05 shortage , for example , federal purchases of vaccine licensed for use in other countries but not the united states were not completed in time to meet peak demand . some states ' experience also highlighted the importance of mechanisms to transfer available vaccine quickly and easily from one state to another . third , effective response requires clear and consistent communication . consistency among federal , state , and local communications is critical for averting confusion . state and local health officials also emphasized the value of updated information when responding to changing circumstances , using diverse media to reach diverse audiences , and educating providers and the public about prevention alternatives . over the past 5 years , gao has urged the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to complete its plan to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic . gao has reported on the importance of planning to address critical issues such as how vaccine will be purchased and distributed ; how population groups will be given priority for vaccination ; and how federal resources should be deployed before the nation faces a pandemic . on november 2 , 2005 , hhs released its pandemic influenza plan . gao did not have the opportunity to review the plan before issuing this statement to determine the extent to which the plan addresses these critical issues .
since the onset of operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , the department of defense ( dod ) reported that more than 12,000 servicemembers have been injured in combat . while many return to active duty , others with more serious injuries are likely to be discharged from the military . to ensure the continuity of medical care and access to all other department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) benefits , such as vocational rehabilitation , va formed its seamless transition task force . in january 2005 , gao reported that va had given high priority to oef / oif servicemembers , but faced challenges in identifying , locating , and following up with seriously injured servicemembers . gao recommended that va and dod reach an agreement for va to obtain systematic data from dod , and the departments concurred . however , dod raised privacy concerns . gao was asked to review va 's efforts to expedite vocational rehabilitation services to seriously injured servicemembers and to determine the status of an agreement between dod and va to share health data . gao relied on its prior work ; interviewed va and dod officials ; and reviewed the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and the hipaa privacy rule , which govern the sharing of individually identifiable health data . while va has taken steps to expedite services to seriously injured servicemembers , va does not have systematic data from dod on seriously injured servicemembers who may need va vocational rehabilitation and other benefits . as a result , va has had to rely on its regional offices to develop informal data sharing arrangements with local military treatment facility ( mtf ) staff to identify servicemembers who may need vocational rehabilitation services . however , va staff have no official data source from dod from which to confirm the completeness and reliability of the data they obtain . furthermore , they can not provide reasonable assurance that some seriously injured servicemembers who may have benefited from vocational rehabilitation services have not been overlooked . although several va headquarters officials and regional office staff gao interviewed said that systematic data from dod would provide them with a way to reliably identify and follow up with seriously injured servicemembers , dod and va have not developed a data sharing agreement . additionally , va officials said these data would help va plan for projected increases in the need for services for newly returning oef / oif servicemembers . va has requested that dod provide systematic data on seriously injured servicemembers who may need vocational rehabilitation . dod and va have been working on a data sharing agreement for over 2 years , but have not reached an agreement . dod and va differ in their understanding of hipaa privacy rule provisions that govern the sharing of individually identifiable health data for servicemembers currently receiving treatment at mtfs , and the extent to which the privacy rule would permit that exchange . dod 's and va 's inability to resolve these differences has impeded coming to an agreement on exchanging seriously injured servicemembers ' individually identifiable health data . despite being unable to agree on an exchange of individually identifiable health data , dod and va are reviewing a draft memorandum of understanding , which the departments believe will move them closer to a data sharing agreement . however , gao found that the draft memorandum restates many of the legal authorities contained in the privacy rule for the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data . as a result , even if the memorandum of understanding is finalized , dod and va will still have to agree on what types of individually identifiable health data can be exchanged and when the data can be shared . dod and va generally agreed with gao 's findings .
title insurance is a required element of almost all real estate purchases and is not an insignificant cost for consumers . however , consumers generally do not have the knowledge needed to `` shop around '' for title insurance and usually rely on professionals involved in real estate -- such as lenders , real estate agents , and attorneys -- for advice in selecting a title insurer . recent state and federal investigations into title insurance sales have identified practices that may have benefited these professionals and title insurance providers at the expense of consumers . at the request of the house financial services committee , gao currently has work under way studying the title insurance industry , including pricing , competition , the size of the market , the roles of the various participants in the market , and how the industry is regulated . this testimony discusses the preliminary results of gao 's work to date and identifies issues for further study . in so doing , this testimony focuses on : the reasonableness of cost structures and agent practices common to the title insurance market that are not typical of other insurance markets ; the implications of activities identified in recent state and federal investigations that may have benefited real estate professionals rather than consumers ; and the potential need for regulatory changes that would affect the way that title insurance is sold . some cost structures and agent practices that are common to the title insurance market are not typical of other lines of insurance and merit further study . first , the extent to which premium rates reflect underlying costs is not always clear . for example , most states do not consider title search and examination costs -- insurers ' largest expense -- to be part of the premium , and do not review these costs . second , while title agents play a key role in the underwriting process , the extent to which state insurance regulators review agents is not clear . few states collect information on agents , and three states do not license them . third , the extent to which a competitive environment exists within the title insurance market that benefits consumers is also not clear . consumers generally lack the knowledge necessary to `` shop around '' for a title insurer and therefore often rely on the advice of real estate and mortgage professionals . as a result , title agents normally market their business to these professionals , creating a form of competition from which the benefit to consumers is not always clear . fourth , real estate brokers and lenders are increasingly becoming full or part owners of title agencies , which may benefit consumers by allowing one - stop shopping , but may also create conflicts of interest . finally , multiple regulators oversee the different entities involved in the title insurance industry , but the extent of involvement and coordination among these entities is not clear . recent state and federal investigations have identified potentially illegal activities -- mainly involving alleged kickbacks -- that also merit further study . the investigations alleged instances of real estate agents , mortgage brokers , and lenders receiving referral fees or other inducements in return for steering business to title insurers or agents , activities that may have violated federal or state anti - kickback laws . participants allegedly used several methods to convey the inducements , including captive reinsurance agreements , fraudulent business arrangements , and discounted business services . for example , investigators identified several `` shell '' title agencies created by a title agent and a real estate or mortgage broker that had no physical location or employees and did not perform any title business , allegedly serving only to obscure referral payments . insurers and industry associations with whom we spoke said that they had begun to address such alleged activities but also said that current regulations needed clarification . in the past several years , regulators , industry groups , and others have suggested changes to the way title insurance is sold , and further study of these suggestions could be beneficial . for example , the department of housing and urban development announced in june 2005 that it was considering revisions to the regulations implementing the real estate settlement procedures act . in addition , the national association of insurance commissioners is considering changes to model laws for title insurers and title agents . finally , at least one consumer advocate has suggested that requiring lenders to pay for the title policies from which they benefit might increase competition and ultimately lower consumers ' costs .
in the interest of national security and personal privacy and for other reasons , federal agencies place dissemination restrictions on information that is unclassified yet still sensitive . the department of energy ( doe ) and the department of defense ( dod ) have both issued policy guidance on how and when to protect sensitive information . doe marks documents with this information as official use only ( ouo ) while dod uses the designation for official use only ( fouo ) . gao was asked to identify and assess the policies , procedures , and criteria doe and dod employ to manage ouo and fouo information ; and determine the extent to which doe 's and dod 's training and oversight programs assure that information is identified , marked , and protected according to established criteria . as gao reported earlier this month , both doe and dod base their programs on the premise that information designated as ouo or fouo must have the potential to cause foreseeable harm to governmental , commercial , or private interests if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information to perform their jobs ; and fall under at least one of eight freedom of information act ( foia ) exemptions . while doe and dod have policies in place to manage their ouo or fouo programs , our analysis of these policies showed a lack of clarity in key areas that could allow inconsistencies and errors to occur . for example , it is unclear which dod office is responsible for the fouo program , and whether personnel designating a document as fouo should note the foia exemption used as the basis for the designation on the document . also , both doe 's and dod 's policies are unclear regarding at what point a document should be marked as ouo or fouo and what would be an inappropriate use of the ouo or fouo designation . for example , ouo or fouo designations should not be used to conceal agency mismanagement . in our view , this lack of clarity exists in both doe and dod because the agencies have put greater emphasis on managing classified information , which is more sensitive than ouo or fouo . in addition , while both doe and dod offer training on their ouo and fouo policies , neither doe nor dod has an agencywide requirement that employees be trained before they designate documents as ouo or fouo . moreover , neither agency conducts oversight to assure that information is appropriately identified and marked as ouo or fouo . doe and dod officials told us that limited resources , and in the case of doe , the newness of the program , have contributed to the lack of training requirements and oversight . nonetheless , the lack of training requirements and oversight of the ouo and fouo programs leaves doe and dod officials unable to assure that ouo and fouo documents are marked and handled in a manner consistent with agency policies and may result in inconsistencies and errors in the application of the programs .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on its science and technology community to develop innovative technologies for weapon systems , spending $ 13 billion on basic , applied , and advanced technology research . several gao reports have addressed problems in transitioning technologies to the acquisition community . this report , which was prepared under the comptroller general 's authority to conduct evaluations , compares dod 's technology transition processes with commercial best practices . specifically , gao identifies technology transition techniques used by leading companies and assesses the extent to which dod uses the techniques leading commercial companies use three key techniques for successfully developing and transitioning technologies , with the basic premise being that technologies must be mature before transitioning to the product line side . strategic planning at the corporate level : strategic planning precedes technology development so managers can gauge market needs , identify the most desirable technologies , and prioritize resources . gated management reviews : a rigorous process is used to ensure a technology 's relevancy and feasibility and enlist product line commitment to use the technologies once the labs are finished maturing them . corroborating tools : to secure commitment , technology transition agreements solidify and document specific cost , schedule , and performance metrics labs need to meet for transition to occur . relationship managers address transition issues within the labs and product line teams and across both communities . meaningful metrics gauge project progress and process effectiveness . not only does dod lack the breadth and depth of these techniques , the department routinely accepts high levels of technology risk at the start of major weapon acquisition programs . the acquisition community works with technologies before they are ready to be transitioned and takes on responsibility for technology development and product development concurrently . a defined phase for technology transition is not evident . these shortcomings contribute significantly to dod 's poor cost and schedule outcomes . a stark contrast exists between dod 's and private industry 's environments for developing technology . the numerous examples of dod programs that have incurred cost overruns , schedule delays , and reduced performance serve as reminders that inserting a few best practices and changing the mechanics of technology transition processes without changing the environment that determines incentives may not produce better outcomes .
hurricane katrina was one of the largest natural disasters in u.s. history . despite a large deployment of resources at all levels , many have regarded the federal response as inadequate . gao has a body of ongoing work that covers the federal government 's preparedness and response to hurricanes katrina and rita . due to widespread congressional interest , this review was performed under the comptroller general 's authority . it examined the extent to which pre - katrina plans and training exercises reflected the military assistance that might be required during a catastrophic , domestic , natural disaster , the military support provided in response to katrina and factors that affected that response , and the actions the military is taking to address lessons learned from katrina and to prepare for the next catastrophe . the military mounted a massive response to hurricane katrina that saved many lives and greatly assisted recovery efforts but many lessons are emerging . prior to hurricane katrina , disaster plans and exercises did not incorporate lessons learned from past catastrophes to fully delineate the military capabilities needed to respond to a catastrophe . for example , the government 's national response plan made little distinction between the military response to a smaller regional disaster and its response to a catastrophic natural disaster . in addition , dod 's emergency response plan for providing military assistance to civil authorities during disasters lacked adequate detail . the plan did not : account for the full range of assistance that might be provided by dod , divide tasks between the national guard and the federal responders , or establish response time frames . national guard state plans were also inadequate and did not account for the level of outside assistance that would be needed during a catastrophe , and they were not synchronized with federal plans . moreover , plans had not been tested with a robust exercise program . none of the exercises that were conducted prior to katrina called for a major deployment of dod capabilities in response to a catastrophic hurricane . as a result , a lack of understanding exists within the military and among federal , state , and local responders as to the types of assistance and capabilities that dod might provide in the event of a catastrophe , the timing of this assistance , and the respective contributions of the active - duty and national guard forces . despite the lack of planning , the military took proactive steps and responded with about 50,000 national guard and 20,000 active federal personnel . based on its june 2005 civil support strategy , dod relied heavily on the guard during the initial response . active duty forces were alerted prior to landfall and key capabilities such as aviation , medical , and engineering forces were initially deployed . growing concerns about the magnitude of the disaster prompted dod to deploy large , active ground units to supplement the guard beginning about 5 days after landfall . several factors affected the military 's ability to gain situational awareness and organize and execute its response , including a lack of timely damage assessments , communications difficulties , force integration problems , uncoordinated search and rescue efforts , and unexpected logistics responsibilities . without detailed plans to address these factors , dod and the federal government risk being unprepared for the next catastrophe . dod is examining the lessons learned from its own reviews and those of the white house and the congress , and it is beginning to take actions to address the lessons and prepare for the next catastrophe . it is too early to evaluate dod 's actions , but many appear to hold promise . however , some issues identified after katrina such as damage assessments are long - standing problems that were identified by gao after hurricane andrew in 1992. they will be difficult to address because they are complex and cut across agency boundaries . thus , substantial improvement will require sustained attention from the highest management levels in dod , and across the government .
the energy policy act of 2005 ( act ) contains provisions that address a variety of challenges that face the geothermal industry , including the high risk and uncertainty of developing geothermal power plants , lack of sufficient transmission capacity , and delays in federal leasing . among the provisions are means to simplify federal royalties on geothermal resources while overall collecting the same level of royalty revenue . the act also changes how these royalties are to be shared with local governments ( disbursements ) . this report describes : the current extent of and potential for geothermal development ; challenges faced by developers of geothermal resources ; federal , state , and local government actions to address these challenges ; and how provisions of the act are likely to affect federal geothermal royalty disbursement and collections . geothermal resources currently produce about 0.3 percent of our nation 's total electricity and heating needs and supply heat and hot water to about 2,300 direct use businesses , such as district heating systems , fish farms , greenhouses , food - drying plants , spas , and resorts . recent assessments conclude that future electricity production from geothermal resources could increase by 25 to 367 percent by 2017. the potential for additional direct use businesses is largely unknown because the lower temperature geothermal resources that they exploit are abundant and commercial applications are diverse . one study has identified at least 400 undeveloped wells and hot springs that have the potential for development . in addition , the sales of geothermal heat pumps are increasing . developers of geothermal electricity plants face many challenges including a capital intensive and risky business environment , developing technology , insufficient transmission capacity , lengthy federal review processes for approving permits and applications , and a complex federal royalty system . direct use businesses face unique business challenges , remote locations , water rights issues , and high federal royalties . the act addresses many of these challenges through tax credits for geothermal production , new authorities for the federal energy regulatory commission , and measures that streamline federal leasing and that simplify federal royalties , which totaled $ 12.3 million in 2005. in addition , the department of energy and the state of california provide grants for addressing technology challenges . furthermore , some state governments offer financial incentives , including investment tax credits , property tax exclusions , sales tax exemptions , and mandates that certain percentages of the electricity within the state be generated from renewable resources . under the act , federal royalty disbursement will significantly change because half of the federal government 's share will now go to the counties where leases are located . although the act directs the secretary of the interior to seek to maintain the same level of royalty collections , gao 's analysis suggests this will be difficult because changing electricity prices could significantly affect royalty revenues . also , mms does not collect sales data that are necessary to monitor these royalty collections .
the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclba ) focused national attention on improving schools so that all students reach academic proficiency by 2014. in the 2006- 2007 school year , about 4,500 of the 54,000 title i schools failed to make adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) for 4 or more years . schools that miss ayp for 4 years are identified for corrective action , and after 6 years , they must be restructured . gao examined the characteristics of title i schools in corrective action and restructuring ; the actions that schools in corrective action and restructuring implemented ; the assistance those schools received from districts and states ; and how education supports states in their efforts to assist these schools . gao administered two web - based surveys to a nationwide sample of schools in corrective action and restructuring status and conducted site visits to five states . nationwide , the 2,790 title i schools that were in corrective action or restructuring status in the 2005-2006 school year were more frequently located in urban areas and in a few states . these schools served higher percentages of minority , poor , and middle - school students than other title i schools , and many report that factors such as neighborhood violence and student mobility pose additional challenges to improving student academic performance . as state proficiency targets continue to increase to 100 percent in 2014 , the number of schools in corrective action and restructuring may increase . a majority of schools in corrective action or restructuring status implemented required activities . however , in some cases , schools may not be meeting nclba requirements . gao estimates that 6 percent of schools did not take any of the required corrective actions and that about a third continued corrective actions implemented during earlier years of school improvement but did not take a new action after entering corrective action status . while this course of action may be an appropriate path for some schools to take , the department of education has not provided guidance to districts delineating when continuing a corrective action is appropriate and when it is not . in addition , about 40 percent of schools did not take any of the five restructuring options required by nclba . while states are required to report annually to the department of education the measures taken by schools in improvement status , education does not require states to report on the specific measures taken for each school . gao estimates that 42 percent of the schools in corrective action or restructuring did not receive all required types of assistance through their school districts , although most received discretionary assistance from their state educational agencies . districts are required to ensure that several types of assistance are provided to all schools in improvement status , including those in corrective action and restructuring status . this assistance includes help in analyzing students ' assessment data and revising school budgets so that resources are allocated to improvement efforts . nclba generally does not require states to provide specific kinds of assistance to schools in corrective action or restructuring ; however , they are required to develop a statewide system of support , including school support teams to provide technical assistance to schools and districts . most schools received some type of assistance from the state educational agency . education provides technical assistance and research results to states primarily through its comprehensive centers program . education also has provided more material in its web - based clearinghouse to address a greater number of topics and is developing an initiative to outline practical steps for schools in improvement , including those in restructuring .
the u.s. congress continues to be concerned about the underrepresentation of u.s. professionals in some un organizations and that insufficient progress has been made to improve u.s. representation . in 2001 , gao reported that several un agencies fell short of their targets for u.s. representation and had not developed strategies to employ more americans . this report reviews u.s. representation status and employment trends at five un agencies , factors affecting these agencies ' ability to meet employment targets , and the u.s. department of state 's ( state ) efforts to improve u.s. representation and additional steps that can be taken . we reviewed five un agencies that together comprise about 50 percent of total un organizations ' professional staff . the united states is underrepresented at three of the five united nations ( un ) agencies we reviewed , and increased hiring of u.s. citizens is needed to meet employment targets . the three agencies where the united states is underrepresented are the international atomic energy agency ; un educational , scientific , and cultural organization ; and the office of the un high commissioner for refugees . u.s. citizens are equitably represented at the un secretariat , though close to the lower end of its target range . the un development program has not established a target for u.s. representation , although u.s. citizens fill about 11 percent of its professional positions . given projected staff levels , retirements , and separations , iaea , unesco , and unhcr would need to increase hiring of americans to meet their minimum targets for u.s. representation in 2010. while the five un agencies face some common barriers to recruiting and retaining professional staff , including americans , they also face their own distinct challenges . most of these barriers and challenges are outside of the u.s. government 's control . the common barriers include nontransparent human resource practices , limited external hiring , lengthy hiring processes , comparatively low or unclear compensation , required mobility , and limited u.s. government support . un agencies also face distinct challenges . for example , at the secretariat , candidates serving in professional un positions funded by their governments are more likely to be hired than those who take the entry - level exam ; however , the united states has not funded such positions . also , iaea has difficulty recruiting u.s. employees because the number of u.s. nuclear specialists is decreasing . since 2001 , state has increased its efforts to achieve equitable u.s. representation at un agencies , and additional options exist . state has targeted efforts to recruit u.s. candidates for senior and policymaking un positions , and although it is difficult to link state 's efforts to un hiring decisions , u.s. representation in these positions has improved or displayed no trend in the five un agencies . u.s. representation in entry - level positions , however , has declined or did not reflect a trend in four of the five un agencies despite state 's increased efforts . additional steps include maintaining a roster of qualified u.s. candidates , expanding marketing and outreach activities , increasing un employment information on u.s. agency web sites , and assessing the costs and benefits of sponsoring entry - level employees at un agencies .
of the 26 areas on gao 's high - risk list of federal programs or activities that are at risk for waste , fraud , abuse , or mismanagement , 8 are department of defense ( dod ) programs or operations and another 6 are governmentwide high - risk areas that also apply to dod . these high - risk areas relate to most of dod 's major business operations . dod 's failure to effectively resolve these high - risk areas has resulted in billions of dollars of waste each year , ineffective performance , and inadequate accountability . at a time when dod is competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally constrained environment , it is critically important that dod get the most from every defense dollar . dod has taken several positive steps and devoted substantial resources toward establishing key management structures and processes to successfully transform its business operations and address its high - risk areas , but overall progress by area varies widely and huge challenges remain . this testimony addresses dod 's efforts to develop a comprehensive , integrated , enterprisewide business transformation plan and its related leadership approach and comply with legislation that addresses business systems modernization and improving financial management accountability . the testimony also addresses two sections included in recent legislation and other dod high - risk areas . in the past year , dod has made progress in transforming its business operations , but continues to lack a comprehensive , enterprisewide approach to its overall business transformation effort . within dod , business transformation is broad , encompassing people , planning , management , structures , technology , and processes in many key business areas . while dod 's planning and management continues to evolve , it has yet to develop a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide plan that covers all key business functions , and contains results - oriented goals , measures and expectations that link organizational , unit , and individual performance goals , while also being clearly linked to dod 's overall investment plans . because of the complexity and long - term nature of business transformation , dod also continues to need a chief management official ( cmo ) with significant authority , experience , and tenure to provide sustained leadership and integrate dod 's overall business transformation effort . without formally designating responsibility and accountability for results , reconciling competing priorities in investments will be difficult and could impede dod 's progress in its transformation efforts . dod is taking steps to comply with legislative requirements aimed at improving its business systems modernization and financial management ; however , much remains to be accomplished . in particular , dod recently issued updates to both the business enterprise architecture and the transition plan , which are still not sufficiently complete to effectively and efficiently guide and constrain business system investments across the department . most notably , the architecture is not adequately linked to dod component architectures , and the plan does not include business system information for all major dod components . to address these shortfalls , dod issued a strategy for `` federating '' or extending its architecture to the defense components . but much remains to be accomplished before a well - defined federated architecture is in place , given that gao recently reported that select components ' architecture programs are not mature . however , dod components continue to invest billions of dollars in thousands of new and existing business system programs . the risks associated with investing in systems ahead of having a well - defined architecture and transition plan are profound and must be managed carefully , as must the wide assortment of other risks that gao 's work has shown to exist on specific dod business system investments . while not a guarantee , gao 's work and research has shown that establishing effective system modernization management controls , such as an architecture - centric approach to investment decision making , can increase the chances of delivering cost - effective business capabilities on time and within budget . further , with regard to legislation pertaining to financial management improvement , dod issued and updated its financial improvement and audit readiness plan in fiscal year 2006 to provide components with a construct for resolving problems affecting the accuracy and timeliness of financial information and an improved audit strategy for obtaining financial statement audit opinions .
in 2006 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) spent about 38 percent of its $ 10.8 billion budget on processing returns and providing taxpayer assistance . gao was asked to assess irs 's 2006 filing season performance processing paper and electronically filed tax returns and providing telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance relative to 2006 goals and prior years ' performance ; identify potential cost savings or other improvements ; and report on the status of irs 's taxpayer assistance blueprint ( tab ) . to address these issues , gao collected relevant information from irs and other sources , reviewed performance measures and past filing season assessments , and interviewed officials . irs improved most filing season services in 2006 , continuing improvements since 2001. irs also generated efficiencies from increased electronic filing and benefits for taxpayers through systems modernization . irs 's processing of individual tax returns and refunds improved by most measures , but the growth rate of electronic filing continued to slow in part because of changes to the free file program , which reduced the number of taxpayers eligible to use it and the elimination of a program that allowed taxpayers to file via the telephone . access to irs 's telephone assistors was comparable to last year . the accuracy of responses to telephone inquiries was 90 percent or over in 2006. use of irs 's web site increased substantially and irs reconfigured the site to improve service . continuing past trends , fewer taxpayers used irs walk - in sites and more used less - costly volunteer sites . also , irs completed phase i of the tab , which identified strategic themes for improving taxpayer service ; tab phase ii is expected to be completed by early 2007. with the slowing growth rate in electronic filing , irs is missing an opportunity to generate additional savings . federal and state mandates for electronic filing have demonstrated success in increasing electronic filing ; however , irs currently lacks the authority to mandate electronic filing for certain income tax returns such as individual returns filed by paid tax preparers . using irs estimates , savings from such a mandate could be on the order of $ 60 million per year . irs has another opportunity to generate savings because of excess space at its call sites . however , irs lacks a strategy for eliminating that space by consolidating call sites . to replace its aging legacy computer system , irs continues to implement a modernized system for processing tax returns and refunds . however , irs does not report information on the chief benefit realized to date , faster refund issuance . such information could be useful for the congress when making decisions about funding the completion of the individual tax return processing part of the system , estimated by irs to require at least another $ 500 million .
the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of 2005 required gao to report on the federal banking regulators ' administration of the prompt corrective action ( pca ) program under section 38 of the federal deposit insurance act ( fdia ) . congress created section 38 as well as section 39 , which required regulators to prescribe safety and soundness standards related to noncapital criteria , to address weaknesses in regulatory oversight during the bank and thrift crisis of the 1980s that contributed to deposit insurance losses . the 2005 act also required gao to report on changes to the federal deposit insurance corporation 's ( fdic ) deposit insurance system . this report examines how regulators have used pca to resolve capital adequacy issues at depository institutions , assesses the extent to which regulators have used noncapital supervisory actions under sections 38 and 39 , and describes how recent changes to fdic 's deposit insurance system affect the determination of institutions ' insurance premiums . gao reviewed regulators ' pca procedures and actions taken on a sample of undercapitalized institutions . gao also reviewed the final rule on changes to the insurance system and comments from industry and academic experts . in recent years , the financial condition of depository institutions generally has been strong , which has resulted in the regulators ' infrequent use of pca provisions to resolve capital adequacy issues of troubled institutions . partly because they benefited from a strong economy in the last decade , banks and thrifts in undercapitalized and lower capital categories decreased from 1,235 in 1992 , the year regulators implemented pca , to 14 in 2005 , and none failed from june 2004 through january 2007. for the banks and thrifts gao reviewed , regulators generally implemented pca in accordance with section 38. for example , regulators identified when institutions failed to meet minimum capital requirements , required them to implement capital restoration plans or corrective actions outlined in enforcement orders , and took steps to close or require the sale or merger of those institutions that were unable to recapitalize . although regulators generally used pca appropriately , capital is a lagging indicator and thus not necessarily a timely predictor of problems at banks and thrifts . in most cases gao reviewed , regulators had responded to safety and soundness problems in advance of a bank or thrift 's decline in required pca capital levels . under section 38 regulators can take noncapital supervisory actions to reclassify an institution 's capital category or dismiss officers and directors from deteriorating institutions , and under section 39 regulators can require institutions to implement plans to address deficiencies in their compliance with regulatory safety and soundness standards . regulators generally have made limited use of these authorities , in part because they have chosen other informal and formal actions to address problems at troubled institutions . according to the regulators , other tools , such as cease - and - desist orders , may provide more flexibility than those available under sections 38 and 39 because they are not tied to an institution 's capital level and may allow them to address more complex or multiple deficiencies with one action . regulators ' discretion to choose how and when to address safety and soundness weaknesses is demonstrated by their limited use of section 38 and 39 provisions and more frequent use of other informal and formal actions . recent changes to fdic 's deposit insurance system tie the premiums a bank or thrift pays into the insurance fund more directly to the estimated risk the institution poses to the fund . in the revised system , fdic generally differentiates between larger institutions with current credit agency ratings and $ 10 billion or more in assets and all other , smaller institutions and requires all institutions to pay premiums based on their individual risk . most bankers , industry groups , and academics gao interviewed and many of the organizations and individuals that submitted comment letters to fdic on the new system generally supported making the system more risk based , but also had some concerns about unintended effects . fdic and the other federal banking regulators intend to monitor the new system for any adverse impacts .
the negative perceptions of the united states associated with u.s. foreign policy initiatives have underscored the importance of the united states presenting a complete portrayal of the benefits that many in the world derive from u.s. foreign assistance efforts . congress has expressed concerns that the united states has frequently understated or not publicized information about its foreign assistance programs . as requested , this report describes the policies , regulations , and guidelines that agencies have established to mark and publicize foreign assistance ; describes how state , usaid , and other agencies mark and publicize foreign assistance ; and identifies key challenges that agencies face in marking and publicizing foreign assistance . most of the agencies we reviewed involved in foreign assistance activities have established some marking and publicity requirements in policies , regulations , or guidelines . usaid has the most detailed policies and regulations relating to marking and publicity . usaid has also established a network of communications specialists at its missions to publicize its assistance efforts and has issued communications guidelines to promote that assistance . according to state officials , its policy is to allow its program managers and ambassadors to use their discretion when determining which programs and activities to mark or publicize . usda , dod , hhs , treasury , and mcc have also established some policies for marking and publicizing assistance , though these policies vary in their level of formality and detail . to increase awareness of u.s. assistance abroad , key agencies that we reviewed used various methods to mark and publicize some of their activities and exercised flexibility in deciding when it was appropriate to do so . these agencies used different methods of marking , or visibly acknowledging , their assistance . in addition , agencies generally used embassy public affairs offices for publicizing , information about the source of their assistance and , in some cases , augmented these efforts with their own publicity methods . we identified some challenges to marking and publicizing u.s. foreign assistance , including the lack of a strategy for assessing the impact of marking and publicity efforts on increasing the awareness of u.s. foreign assistance and governmentwide guidance for marking and publicizing u.s. foreign assistance . first , although some agencies conduct surveys in recipient countries that primarily capture information on public opinion of the united states , little reliable work has been done to assess the impact of u.s. assistance on foreign citizens ' awareness of the source of u.s. provided assistance . second , while the newly appointed director of foreign assistance has begun to address the issue of developing a governmentwide policy for marking and publicizing all u.s. foreign assistance , it is unclear to what extent this policy will be implemented by agencies whose foreign assistance programs are not under dfa 's direct authority .
the foundation laid by the chief financial officers act of 1990 and other management reform legislation provided a much needed statutory basis to improve the accountability of government programs and operations . such reforms were intended to produce reliable , timely , and useful financial information to help manage day - to - day operations and exercise oversight and promote fiscal stewardship . this testimony , based on gao 's prior work , addresses the progress made and challenges remaining to improve federal financial management practices , and the serious challenges posed by the government 's deteriorating long - range fiscal condition and the comptroller general 's views on a possible way forward . since the enactment of key financial management reforms , the federal government has made substantial progress in improving financial management activities and practices . federal financial systems requirements have been developed , and internal control has been strengthened . nonetheless , the federal government still has a long way to go to address the six principal challenges to fully realizing strong federal financial management : transforming financial management and business practices at dod , improving agency financial and performance reporting , modernizing financial management systems , addressing key remaining internal control weaknesses , building a financial management workforce for the future , and strengthening consolidated financial reporting . from a broad financial management perspective , the federal government 's financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many understand . we are currently experiencing strong economic growth and yet running large on - budget ( operating ) deficits that are largely unrelated to the global war on terrorism . the federal government faces large and growing structural deficits in future years due primarily to known demographic trends and rising health care costs . if it is assumed that recent tax reductions are made permanent and discretionary spending keeps pace with the growth of our economy , gao 's long - term simulations suggest that by 2040 , federal revenues may be adequate to pay little more than interest on debt held by the public and some social security benefits . neither slowing the discretionary spending growth nor allowing certain tax provisions to expire -- nor both together -- would eliminate the imbalance .
the july 2005 london subway bombings and july 2006 rail attacks in mumbai , india dramatically revealed the vulnerability of passenger rail and other surface transportation systems worldwide to terrorist attack and demonstrated the need for increased focus on the security of these systems . this testimony , which is based primarily on gao 's september 2005 report on passenger rail security ( gao - 05-851 ) and selected program updates obtained in january 2007 provides information on how the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has assessed the risks posed by terrorism to the u.s. passenger rail system ; actions tsa and other federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of u.s. rail systems ; and rail security practices implemented by domestic and selected foreign passenger rail operators . the dhs office of grants and training has conducted risk assessments of passenger rail systems to identify and protect rail assets that are vulnerable to attack , such as stations and bridges . tsa has also begun to conduct risk assessments of passenger rail assets . while tsa has begun to establish a methodology for analyzing and characterizing risks , as of january 2007 , the agency has not completed a comprehensive risk assessment of the u.s. passenger rail system . until tsa does so , the agency may be limited in its ability to prioritize passenger rail assets and help guide security investments . dhs has also begun developing a framework to help agencies and the private sector develop a consistent approach for analyzing and comparing risks among and across different transportation sectors . however , until this framework is finalized , it may not be possible to compare risks across different sectors , prioritize them , and allocate resources accordingly . after september 11 , 2001 , the department of transportation initiated a number of efforts to improve passenger rail security . after its creation , tsa also took a number of actions , including issuing rail security directives , testing rail security technologies , developing training tools for rail workers , and issuing a proposed rule in december 2006 regarding passenger and freight rail security , among other efforts . however , federal and rail industry stakeholders have questioned the extent to which tsa 's directives were based on industry best practices and expressed confusion about how tsa would monitor compliance with the directives . dhs and dot also signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) that delineated the two departments ' respective roles and responsibilities for promoting the safe , secure , and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the transportation system . tsa has recently completed specific agreements with the federal transit administration ( fta ) and the federal railroad administration ( fra ) to further delineate security - related roles and responsibilities for passenger rail . u.s. and foreign passenger rail operators gao visited have also taken actions to secure their rail systems . most had implemented customer security awareness programs , increased security personnel , increased the use of canines to detect explosives , and enhanced employee training programs . gao also observed security practices among foreign passenger rail systems that are not currently used by u.s. rail operators or by the u.s. government , which could be considered for use in the u.s. for example , some foreign rail operators randomly screen passengers or use covert testing to help keep employees alert to security threats . while introducing these security practices in the u.s may pose political , legal , fiscal , and cultural challenges , they warrant further examination . tsa has reported taking steps to identify foreign best practices for rail security .
veterans returning from service in iraq and afghanistan could increase demand for affordable rental housing . households with low incomes ( 80 percent or less of the area median income ) generally are eligible to receive rental assistance from the department of housing and urban development 's ( hud ) housing choice voucher , public housing , and project - based programs . however , because rental assistance is not an entitlement , not all who are eligible receive assistance . in response to a congressional mandate , gao assessed the income status and demographic and housing characteristics of veteran renter households , how hud 's rental assistance programs treat veteran status ( whether a person is a veteran or not ) and whether they use a veterans ' preference , and the extent to which hud 's rental assistance programs served veterans in fiscal year 2005. among other things , gao analyzed data from hud , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , and the bureau of the census , surveyed selected public housing agencies , and interviewed agency officials and veterans groups . gao makes no recommendations in this report . va agreed with the report 's findings . hud objected to the characterization in the report regarding hud 's policies on veteran status and program eligibility and subsidy amounts . in 2005 , an estimated 2.3 million veteran renter households had low incomes . the proportion of veteran renter households that were low income varied by state but did not fall below 41 percent . further , an estimated 1.3 million , or about 56 percent of these low - income veteran households , had housing affordability problems -- that is , rental costs exceeding 30 percent of household income . compared with other ( nonveteran ) renter households , however , veterans were somewhat less likely to be low income or have housing affordability problems . hud 's policies for its three major rental assistance programs generally do not take veteran status into account when determining eligibility or assistance levels , but eligible veterans can receive assistance . also , hud generally does not distinguish between income that is specific to veterans , such as va - provided benefits , and other sources of income . the majority of the 41 largest public housing agencies that administer the housing choice voucher or public housing programs have no veterans ' preference for admission . the 13 largest performance - based contract administrators that oversee most properties under project - based programs reported that owners generally did not adopt a veterans ' preference . in fiscal year 2005 , an estimated 11 percent of all eligible low - income veteran households ( at least 250,000 ) received assistance , compared with 19 percent of nonveteran households . although the reasons for the difference are unclear , factors such as differing levels of need for affordable housing among veteran and other households could influence the percentages .
congress passed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) , which created a part d outpatient prescription drug benefit that enables medicare beneficiaries to enroll in competing private drug coverage plans . the benefit also offers a subsidy administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) to assist certain low - income medicare beneficiaries with out - of - pocket costs . gao was asked to review ssa 's progress in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the subsidy ; ssa 's processes for making eligibility determinations , resolving appeals , and redetermining beneficiaries ' eligibility ; and how the subsidy has affected ssa 's workload and operations . to conduct this study , gao reviewed the law , assessed subsidy data , and interviewed ssa and other officials . ssa approved about 2.2 million medicare beneficiaries for the low - income subsidy as of march 2007 , despite barriers it faced in identifying the eligible population and soliciting applications ; however , measuring the success of ssa 's outreach efforts is difficult because there are no reliable data on the size of the eligible population . in 2005 , ssa mailed 18.6 million subsidy applications to medicare beneficiaries who were potentially eligible for the subsidy . ssa knew that this mailing was an overestimate , but took this approach to ensure that all who were eligible would be contacted . ssa had hoped to more specifically identify the eligible population using irs tax data , but current law restricts the use of taxpayer data unless an individual has already applied for the subsidy . further , ssa conducted a campaign of about 76,000 events held nationwide to educate people about the subsidy and how to apply for it . since the initial campaign ended , however , ssa has not developed specific performance goals and measures to assess the progress of its continuing outreach efforts . ssa 's efforts to solicit applications were hindered by beneficiaries ' confusion about the difference between the subsidy and the medicare part d prescription drug plan , and the reluctance of some individuals to share personal financial information , among other factors . while the early subsidy participation rate compares favorably to those of some other low - income programs , the lack of reliable data on the size of the eligible population means that the extent to which ssa has signed up the eligible population for the benefit is unknown . while ssa has established processes for making subsidy eligibility determinations , resolving appeals , and conducting redeterminations , it has not established some key management tools to monitor the progress of all of its efforts , as specified in gao 's internal control standards . for example , while ssa tracks various results from its appeals process , it does not currently have a performance goal to assess the timeliness of appeals decisions , but agency officials told us that ssa plans to establish a goal of processing 75 percent of appeals in 60 days . also , while ssa tracks the status of its redetermination decisions , officials do not believe that it is necessary to measure the time for processing individual redetermination decisions because they said that the time to complete the overall redeterminations cycle provides adequate information . ssa 's implementation of the low - income subsidy did affect the agency 's workload and operations , but according to ssa officials , the additional workloadhas been manageable overall as a result of increased funding that the agency received to carry out mma activities . ssa hired 2,200 field office staff , and 500 headquarters staff to handle its new subsidy workload , as well as to carry out other activities for the program . in 2006 , ssa staff spent the equivalent of 2,190 work years on low - income subsidy implementation activities , with about 50 percent of the time spent on subsidy applications . while there were periods of high subsidy application activity , ssa officials told us that subsidy program activities did not have an adverse impact on other ssa workloads . the officials attributed the minimal impact of part d to several factors , including the highly automated subsidy application process and the $ 500 million congressional appropriation that ssa spent on mma start - up costs . ssa estimates that its costs for low - income subsidy activities are $ 175 million annually .
at a time when u.s. military forces and their equipment are in high demand , effective management of the department of defense 's ( dod ) inventory is critical to ensure that the warfighter has the right items at the right time . the air force is the largest contributor to dod 's total on - hand inventory on the basis of inventory value . under the statutory authority of the comptroller general to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , gao determined the extent to which the air force 's on - order and on - hand inventory reflect the amount of inventory needed to support required inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , and the air force had shortages in its inventory needed to support required levels during this period . to address these objectives gao analyzed air force secondary inventory data ( spare parts such as engines and guided missiles ) from fiscal years 2002 through 2005. more than half of the air force 's secondary inventory ( spare parts ) , worth an average of $ 31.4 billion , was not needed to support required on - hand and on - order inventory levels from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , although increased demand due to ongoing military operations contributed to slight reductions in the percentage of inventory on hand and the number of years of supply it represents . dod regulations provide guidance for developing materiel requirements based on customer expectations while minimizing inventories . however , the value of air force on - order inventory not needed to support required inventory levels increased by about 7.8 percent , representing an average of 52 percent ( $ 1.3 billion ) of its on - order inventory . the air force has continued to purchase unneeded on - order inventory because its policies do not provide incentives to reduce the amount of inventory on order that is not needed to support requirements . when the air force buys these items it may obligate funds unnecessarily , which could lead to not having sufficient obligation authority to purchase needed items and could negatively impact readiness . in addition , although the percentage of the air force on - hand inventory was reduced by 2.7 percent due to increases in demand , about 65 percent ( $ 18.7 billion ) of this inventory was not needed to support required inventory levels . gao calculated that it costs the air force from $ 15 million to $ 30 million annually to store its unneeded items . of the air force 's inventory items not needed to support required inventory levels , 79 percent had no recurring demands ( such as engines and airframe components ) , resulting in a potentially infinite supply of those items . the air force has continued to retain this unneeded inventory with no recurring demands , in part , because the air force has not performed a comprehensive assessment to revalidate the need to continue to retain these items . for the remaining 21 percent of items that had recurring demands , increasing demands resulted in a reduction in the number of years of supply that this inventory represents , with the largest quantity and value of items having between 2 to 10 years of supply . inventory not needed to support required inventory levels can be attributed to many long - standing problems , such as decreasing demands , retaining items used to support aging weapon systems that have diminishing sources of supply or are being phased out of service , and not terminating contracts for on - order items . air force officials acknowledged that decreases in demand have resulted in having more inventory than is needed ; however , the air force has not evaluated why it continues to experience decreases in demand or taken actions to mitigate the effect of these changes . without taking actions to reduce its unneeded inventory , the air force will continue its past practices of purchasing and retaining items it does not need and then spending additional resources to handle and store these items . although more than half of its secondary inventory was not needed to support required levels , the air force still had shortages of certain items . from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , the percentage and value of the air force 's inventory shortages remained the same at about 8 percent and $ 1.2 billion .
the national aeronautics and space administration 's ( nasa ) james webb space telescope ( jwst ) is being designed to explore the origins and nature of the universe . it should allow scientists to look deeper into space -- and thus farther back in time -- than ever before . the program , however , has experienced cost growth of more than $ 1 billion and its schedule has slipped nearly 2 years . nasa recently restructured the program and now anticipates a launch no sooner than june 2013. because of the cost and schedule problems , under the comptroller general 's authority , we reviewed the jwst program to determine the extent to which this procurement follows nasa acquisition policy and gao best practices for ensuring that adequate product knowledge is used to make informed investment decisions although the jwst program recently revised its acquisition strategy to conform to nasa 's acquisition policies , the program still faces considerable challenges because it has not fully implemented a knowledge - based approach , which our past work has shown is often a key factor in program success . in a recent report , we made recommendations that nasa take steps to ensure that projects follow a knowledge - based approach for product development . nasa concurred and revised its acquisition policy . when we initiated our work and before the jwst program 's recently revised acquisition strategy , program officials intended to have nasa commit to program start , which is the end of the formulation phase and the beginning of the implementation phase , with immature technologies , according to best practices , and without a preliminary design . during our review , we discussed these shortfalls with nasa officials , and they revised their acquisition strategy to conform to nasa policy . however , the current strategy still does not fully incorporate a knowledge - based approach which ensures that resources match requirements in terms of knowledge , time , and money before program start . if program officials follow the current plan , the maturity of key technologies may not be adequately tested prior to program start . in addition , it appears the program will not have sufficient funding resources to ensure the program 's success . in light of the fiscally constrained environment the federal government and nasa will face in the years ahead , adopting a knowledge - based approach will not only increase the jwst program 's chances for success but also lay the foundation for comparison between competing programs .
although recycling can generate environmental and economic benefits , the national recycling rate has increased only slightly since 2000 , according to the environmental protection agency ( epa ) . while local governments have the primary role in operating recycling programs , epa and the department of commerce ( commerce ) have some legal responsibilities for encouraging recycling . gao was asked to identify key practices cities are using to increase recycling , describe what epa and commerce are doing to encourage recycling , and identify federal policy options that could help increase recycling . gao interviewed recycling coordinators in 11 large cities about key practices and 13 additional recycling stakeholders about policy options . gao selected both groups based on geographic representation and recycling expertise , among other factors . recycling coordinators with whom we spoke in selected cities across the country identified several key practices they are using to increase recycling in their cities . the three practices they cited most frequently were making recycling convenient and easy for their residents , offering financial incentives for recycling , such as allowing residents who produce less waste through recycling to use smaller garbage cans and pay lower fees , and conducting public education and outreach . in addition , both recycling coordinators and the recycling literature identified other ways to increase recycling , such as targeting a wide range of materials for recycling and extending recycling programs to the commercial sector . as a part of its resource conservation challenge strategy , epa operates several national and regional programs that are designed to increase recycling and help epa achieve its national municipal solid waste recycling goal of 35 percent by 2008. one of epa 's principal national recycling programs , wastewise , creates voluntary partnerships with groups , such as universities , states , and businesses , to help them increase their recycling . epa also provides competitive grants to support projects designed to increase recycling . the impact of epa 's programs is unknown , however , because the programs lack performance measures and comprehensive data on program performance . although commerce is required under the resource conservation and recovery act to stimulate the development of markets for recycled materials , the agency is not currently taking any actions to do so in the united states . for example , commerce is not identifying the location of markets for recycled materials , identifying economic and technical barriers to recycling , or encouraging the development of new uses for recycled materials in the united states . however , agency officials told gao that commerce supports increased international trade in recycled and recyclable materials as part of its general trade promotion responsibilities . the recycling stakeholders we interviewed identified various federal policy options that they believe could help municipalities increase their recycling rates . the three federal policy options cited most frequently were to establish a nationwide campaign to educate the public about recycling , enact a national `` bottle bill '' in which beverage containers may be returned for money , and require manufacturers to establish systems that consumers can use to recycle their products . other identified policy options included facilitating the sharing of recycling best practices among municipalities , expanding epa research on the economic and environmental benefits of recycling , and providing additional grant money for recycling projects .
the general services administration ( gsa ) issues different types of delegations , whereby agencies may request authority to perform certain real property activities , such as leasing space and maintaining property . effective management of the program is critical to ensuring that federal dollars are well spent and adequate workspace is provided . gao was asked to determine what real property authority gsa has delegated to its tenant agencies , what policies gsa used to manage delegated authority , and reasons the tenant agencies requested delegated authority . gao reviewed the law , federal regulations , and gsa policies relating to six types of delegated authority and interviewed gsa officials and officials from six select tenant agencies . gao analyzed gsa data on delegations issued from fiscal years 1996 to 2006. gsa delegated authority for operations and maintenance , utility services , lease management , administrative contracting officer , repair and alteration activities , and real estate leasing to its tenant agencies . however , gsa did not have complete or consistent data for key delegations . gsa officials believe the lack of complete data for repair and alteration delegations up to $ 100,000 was not problematic because they involve relatively small projects with limited program risk , and gsa has not noticed a pattern of problems that would warrant increased oversight . regarding delegations of authority for real estate leasing , two offices within gsa collected separate sets of data . one office collected data on the number of general purpose lease delegations issued while another collected data on the number of lease delegations exercised for three different types of lease delegations ( including general purpose , categorical , and special purpose ) . one office said its data are likely an undercount , and the different sets of data have not been reconciled . gsa is currently implementing several changes to improve its data collection for lease delegations and will issue separate oversight procedures that include a requirement to reconcile the two sources of lease delegation data . however , it is unclear when the oversight procedures will be issued . it is important to have accurate data on lease delegations because these delegations appear to be used more frequently than other delegation types . federal agencies using these delegations may lack experience in acquiring office space , which could result in the government not receiving the best deal . we found that gsa had written policies and procedures for managing the six types of delegations we reviewed , but the guidance was not always current . gsa officials acknowledged the need to update some of its guidance and said the updates are in process , but it is unclear when these updates will be finalized . further , gsa officials stated they did not always use mandated cost - effectiveness criteria when deciding to delegate authority for certain delegations due , in part , to staffing constraints . in addition , the procedures used for assessing cost - effectiveness were not always included in written guidance . the lack of updated guidance and limited use of mandated criteria inhibits gsa 's ability to manage its delegations and determine if they are in the best interests of the government . according to the six tenant agencies we interviewed , the main reasons agencies sought delegations were the ability to complete their delegated real property activities in a timely manner and prioritize their own service requests , particularly in those cases where gsa 's knowledge and expertise were less critical . most of the six agencies we contacted plan to seek delegations in the future .
more than 5.5 billion pounds of explosives are used each year in the united states by private sector companies and government entities . the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives ( atf ) has authority to regulate explosives and to license privately owned explosives storage facilities . after the july 2004 theft of several hundred pounds of explosives from a state and local government storage facility , concerns arose about vulnerability to theft . gao analyzed the extent of explosives thefts from state and local government facilities , atf 's authority to regulate and oversee state and local government explosives storage facilities , the information atf collects about state and local government storage facilities , and security oversight measures in place at selected state and local government storage facilities . judging from available atf data , there have been few thefts of explosives from state and local government storage facilities . from january 2002 to february 2005 , atf received only 9 reports of thefts or missing explosives from state and local facilities , compared with a total of 205 explosives thefts reported nationwide during this same period . during the course of our audit , we found evidence of 5 thefts from state and local government facilities , 1 of which did not appear in atf 's national database on thefts and missing explosives . thus , the actual number of thefts occurring at state and local storage facilities could be higher than that identified by atf data . atf has no authority to oversee or inspect all state and local government explosives storage facilities . state and local government agencies are not required to obtain a license from atf to use and store explosives , and only licensees -- such as private sector explosives storage facilities -- are subject to mandatory oversight . as a result , atf has no means to ensure that state and local government facilities are in compliance with federal regulations . while atf does not collect nationwide information about state and local government explosives storage facilities , information about some of these facilities is collected -- for example , when facility operators voluntarily request an atf inspection . since january 2002 , atf has conducted 77 voluntary inspections at state and local storage facilities and found no systemic violations . by comparison , all licensed private sector facilities must submit a variety of information about their facility -- including location and security measures in place -- to atf during the licensing process . atf also collects information about these facilities during mandatory inspections . at the 18 state and local government storage facilities we visited , a variety of security measures were in place , including locked gates , fencing , patrols , and in some cases , electronic surveillance . all the facilities ' officials told gao that they conducted routine inventories . but most were not required to be licensed or inspected by state or local regulatory agencies . we identified several instances of possible noncompliance with federal regulations , related primarily to storage safety issues rather than security .
the united nations ( un ) estimated in 2005 that renovating its headquarters will cost up to $ 1.75 billion . as the un 's host country and largest contributor , the united states has a substantial interest in the project 's success . in this report , we determine whether the development of the capital master plan ( cmp ) has been consistent with leading industry practices , examine factors that led to changes in the cost estimate and determine whether the 2005 estimate was updated using industry practices , review the status of financing of the renovation , identify decisions needed for the renovation to proceed , and review un oversight and state monitoring efforts . to address these objectives , we reviewed un design and planning documents , including the latest cost estimate , to compare them with industry standards . to assess oversight , we reviewed office of internal oversight services ( oios ) and un board of auditors reports and met with un officials . un officials continue to use leading industry practices in developing the un headquarters renovation project , but reliance on existing un procurement practices could impact the effective implementation of the renovation in the future . since the cmp office relies on current un procurement practices , implementation of future cmp procurements could become vulnerable to numerous un procurement weaknesses that gao previously reported in april 2006 ( gao - 06-577 ) , such as the lack of guidance for construction procurement in the procurement manual . the estimated total cost of the cmp increased from about $ 1.19 billion to almost $ 1.75 billion between 2002 and 2005 to reflect inflation arising from a later start date , refinements to the design , and a change in the renovation approach . the un continued to follow construction industry practices to develop the 2005 cost estimate and has included expected elements . however , the cost estimate is still preliminary and will likely change . while the un has passed a resolution expressing a preference for cash assessments , it has yet to decide how to finance the remaining renovation costs . in june 2006 , the general assembly passed a resolution stating that a cash payment option would be the simplest and most cost - effective approach for funding the cmp . under this approach , the un would assess member states for the cost of the renovation through single - or multiyear payments . the amount the un assessed member states would be likely based on each country 's rate for its annual regular budget contributions . the general assembly plans to revisit the financing issue by the end of 2006. without certain general assembly decisions by the end of 2006 , the renovation 's current schedule could be delayed and costs could increase . specifically , a general assembly decision on a financing arrangement for the total cmp budget would be needed to ensure that funds could be available by december 2007. without these decisions , the cmp office can not finalize a start date for the renovation . un oversight entities have continued to oversee the cmp while the department of state has monitored its progress . oios has conducted audits on cmp procurements and has issued several reports of its findings and recommendations . however , oios relies on funds from the cmp budget and must negotiate for those funds with the un budget office , which may impair its ability to secure sufficient funds . the un board of auditors has also conducted oversight of the cmp office by reviewing its financial records and internal controls and has found no material weaknesses in its review . similarly , state 's monitoring efforts have not identified any significant concerns , according to state officials .
the department of defense ( dod ) has been urged by commissions , legislation , and a panel to make increased use of commercial acquisition to achieve certain benefits . to help ensure the increased use of commercial acquisition , the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) established and the air force implemented two commercial acquisition goals to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2005. in setting these goals , osd expected that the increased use of commercial acquisition would provide dod with greater access to commercial markets ( products and service types ) with increased competition , better prices , and new market entrants and / or technologies . the committee asked gao to identify the extent to which the air force has increased its use of commercial acquisition to obtain expected benefits and the risks that are associated with this use . from 2001 to 2005 , the air force increased spending using commercial acquisition from $ 4.8 billion to over $ 8 billion in an effort to provide greater access to commercial markets to increase competition , obtain better prices , and attract new market entrants ( nontraditional contractors ) and / or technologies . even though the air force has significantly increased this spending , it has not measured the extent to which this increased use resulted in the benefits that were expected . for example , our analysis shows that for at least one of the expected benefits , attracting new market entrants , the expected benefit has not materialized . for the most part , traditional defense contractors received these contracts . government contracting officials face risks in using commercial acquisition . for example , improperly classifying an acquisition as a commercial acquisition can leave the air force vulnerable to accepting prices that may not be the best value for the department . a high - ranking dod acquisition official testified that he is concerned about items and services being identified as commercial that are not sold in an existing marketplace because under these circumstances , the government lacks assurances that the price is reasonable . at times , air force officials have disagreed about the classification of some acquisitions as commercial . the air force 's use of commercial acquisition has also been accompanied by an increased amount of dollars being awarded for sole - source contracts . despite dod policy to avoid sole - source commercial acquisitions because of increased risk , sole - source commercial acquisition dollars awarded by the air force have more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. further , of the 20 larger air force commercial product awards in 2004 , half were awarded as sole - source .
the health of our nation 's air transportation system is critical to our citizens and economy . however , the current approach to managing air transportation is becoming increasingly inefficient and operationally obsolete . in 2003 , congress created the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) to plan for and coordinate , with federal and nonfederal stakeholders , a transformation from the current air traffic control ( atc ) system to the `` next generation air transportation system '' ( ngats ) . housed within the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , jpdo has seven partner agencies that make up jpdo 's senior policy committee : the departments of transportation , commerce , defense , and homeland security ; faa ; the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) ; and the white house office of science and technology policy . this testimony , which provides preliminary results from gao 's ongoing work on jpdo , provides information on the status of jpdo 's efforts to plan for ngats , the key challenges facing jpdo as it moves forward with its planning efforts , and the key challenges facing faa as it implements the transformation while continuing its current operations . the statement is based on gao 's analysis of jpdo documents , interviews , and the views of a panel of experts , as well as on past gao work . jpdo has developed a framework for planning and coordination with its federal partner agencies and nonfederal stakeholders that is consistent with the requirements of its authorizing legislation -- vision 100- - and with several practices that our previous work has shown can facilitate federal interagency collaboration and the development of an enterprise architecture ( i.e . , system blueprint ) . jpdo 's framework includes an integrated plan that provides a vision for ngats , an organizational structure and processes for leveraging the resources and expertise of federal and nonfederal stakeholders , and an enterprise architecture that defines the specific requirements for ngats . as jpdo moves forward , it will face leadership , leveraging , and commitment challenges . currently , jpdo lacks a permanent director and a permanent chairperson of its senior policy committee to provide the leadership needed to overcome barriers to interagency coordination . in addition , despite early successes , jpdo may have difficulty continuing to leverage its partner agencies ' resources and expertise for ngats because these agencies have missions and priorities in addition to ngats and jpdo does not yet have signed , long - term agreements with the partner agencies on their respective roles and responsibilities . finally , jpdo faces the challenge of convincing nonfederal stakeholders that the government is fully committed to implementing ngats , given that , in some instances , it has discontinued work on new technologies for the national airspace system . faa faces challenges in institutionalizing recent improvements in its management and acquisition processes , as well as in obtaining the expertise and resources necessary to implement ngats . first , institutionalizing faa 's process improvements is critical to successfully implementing ngats . second , faa may lack the expertise needed to manage the ngats effort . gao has identified two potential approaches for faa to supplement its capabilities that faa is considering . third , achieving cost savings is critical to funding the implementation of ngats .
the staggers rail act of 1980 largely deregulated the freight railroad industry , giving the railroads freedom to price their services according to market conditions and encouraging greater reliance on competition to set rates . the act recognized the need for railroads to recover costs by setting higher rates for shippers with fewer transportation alternatives . the act also recognized that some shippers might not have access to competitive alternatives and might be subject to unreasonably high rates . it established a threshold for rate relief and granted the interstate commerce commission and the surface transportation board ( stb ) the authority to develop a rate relief process for those `` captive '' shippers . gao 's reported on rates , competition , and other industry trends in reports issued in october 2006 and august 2007. this statement is based on those reports and discusses the changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the enactment of the staggers rail act , including changes in rail rates since 1985 , the extent of captivity in the industry and stb 's efforts to protect captive shippers , and stb 's actions to address gao 's recent recommendations . the changes that have occurred in the railroad industry since the enactment of the staggers rail act are widely viewed as positive , since the financial health of the industry has improved and most rates have declined since 1985. the freight railroad industry 's financial health improved substantially as railroads cut costs through productivity improvements and new technologies . however , rates began to increase in 2001 , and in 2005 rates jumped nearly 9 percent -- the largest annual increase in twenty years -- and rates increased for all 13 commodities that we reviewed . revenues that railroads report as `` miscellaneous revenue '' -- a category that includes some fuel surcharges -- increased more than ten - fold from $ 141 million in 2000 to over $ 1.7 billion in 2005. it is difficult to precisely determine how many shippers are `` captive '' because available proxy measures can overstate or understate captivity . however some data indicate that potentially captive traffic appears to have decreased , while at the same time , data also indicates that traffic traveling at rates significantly above the threshold for rate relief has increased . in october 2006 , we reported that stb 's rate relief process to protect captive shippers have resulted in little effective relief for those shippers . we also reported that economists and shipper groups have proposed a number of alternatives to address remaining concerns about competition -- however , each of these alternative approaches have costs and benefits and should be carefully considered . stb has taken some actions to address our past recommendations , but it is too soon to determine the effect of these actions . our october 2006 report noted that the continued existence of pockets of potentially `` captive shippers '' raised questions as to whether rail rates in selected markets reflected reasonable pricing practices , or an abuse of market power . we recommended that the board undertake a rigorous analysis of competitive markets to identify the state of competition . stb has awarded a contract to conduct this study ; while this is an important step , it will be important that these analysts have stb 's authority and access to information to determine whether rail rates in selected markets reflect reasonable pricing practices . we also recommended that stb ensure that freight railroads are consistently reporting all revenues , including miscellaneous revenues . while stb has revised its rules on fuel surcharges , these rules did not address how fuel surcharges are reported and stb has not yet taken steps to accurately collect data on other miscellaneous revenues . stb has also taken a number of steps to revise its rate relief process . while these appear to be promising steps , it is too soon to tell what effect these changes will have and we have not evaluated them .
the department of defense ( dod ) maintains a military force with unparalleled logistics capabilities , but it continues to confront decades - old supply chain management problems . the supply chain can be the critical link in determining whether our frontline military forces win or lose on the battlefield , and the investment of resources in the supply chain is substantial . because of weaknesses in dod 's supply chain management , this program has been on gao 's list of high - risk areas needing urgent attention and transformation since 1990. last year , dod developed a plan to resolve its long - term supply chain problems in three focus areas : requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . in october 2005 , gao testified that the plan was a good first step . gao was asked to provide its views on dod 's progress toward implementing the supply chain management improvement plan and incorporating performance measures for tracking and demonstrating improvement , as well as to comment on the alignment of dod 's supply chain management improvement plan with other department logistics plans . this testimony is based on prior gao reports and ongoing work in this area . it contains gao 's views on opportunities to improve dod 's ability to achieve and demonstrate progress in supply chain management . since october 2005 , dod has continued to make progress implementing the 10 initiatives in its supply chain management improvement plan , but it will take several years to fully implement these initiatives . dod 's stated goal for implementing its plan is to demonstrate significant improvement in supply chain management within 2 years of the plan 's inception in 2005 , but the time frames for substantially implementing some initiatives are currently 2008 or later . while dod has generally stayed on track , it has reported some slippage in the implementation of certain initiatives . factors such as the long - standing nature of the problems , the complexities of the initiatives , and the involvement of multiple organizations within dod could cause the implementation dates of some initiatives to slip farther . dod has incorporated several broad performance measures in its supply chain management improvement plan , but it continues to lack outcome - focused performance measures for many of the initiatives . therefore , it is difficult to track and demonstrate progress toward improving the three focus areas of requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution . although dod 's plan includes four high - level performance measures that are being tracked across the department , these measures do not necessarily reflect the performance of the initiatives and do not relate explicitly to the three focus areas . further , dod 's plan does not include cost metrics that might show efficiencies gained through supply chain improvement efforts . in their effort to develop performance measures for use across the department , dod officials have encountered challenges such as a lack of standardized , reliable data . nevertheless , dod could show near - term progress by adding intermediate measures . these measures could include outcome - focused measures for each of the initiatives or for the three focus areas . dod has multiple plans aimed at improving aspects of logistics , including supply chain management , but it is unclear how these plans are aligned with one another . the plans were developed at different points of time , for different purposes , and in different formats , so it is difficult to determine how all the ongoing efforts link together to sufficiently cover requirements forecasting , asset visibility , and materiel distribution and whether they will result in significant progress toward resolving this high - risk area . also , dod 's supply chain management improvement plan does not account for initiatives outside the direct oversight of the office of the secretary of defense , and dod lacks a comprehensive strategy to guide logistics programs and initiatives . dod is in the process of developing a new plan , referred to as the `` to be '' roadmap , for future logistics programs and initiatives . the roadmap is intended to portray where the department is headed in the logistics area , how it will get there , and what progress is being made toward achieving its objectives , as well as to link ongoing capability development , program reviews , and budgeting . however , until it is completed , gao will not be able to assess how the roadmap addresses the challenges and risks dod faces in its supply chain improvement efforts .
in 1996 , the united nations ( un ) and iraq began the oil for food program after sanctions were imposed in 1990. the program was intended to allow the iraqi government to sell oil to pay for humanitarian goods and prevent it from obtaining goods for military purposes . more than $ 67 billion in oil revenue was obtained through the program , with $ 31 billion in assistance delivered to iraq . internal controls serve as the first line of defense in preventing fraud , waste , and abuse and in helping agencies achieve desired outcomes . gao assesses the control environment the un established for managing the sanctions and oil for food program and other key internal control elements . in addition , we provide observations on the lessons learned from the program . the un -- the security council , the secretariat , and member states -- established a weak control environment for the oil for food program at the beginning . the un allowed iraq to control contract negotiations for imported commodities with little oversight , enabling the regime to obtain illicit funds through surcharges and kickbacks . the un did not take steps to address the economic impact that the sanctions had on countries that depended on iraqi trade , which undermined international support for sanctions and allowed iraq to smuggle oil outside the oil for food program . overall , the sanctions were effective in helping to prevent the iraq regime from obtaining military items , but the un was less rigorous in overseeing economic activities such as monitoring the price and value of iraq 's contracts . the un 's neglect of iraq 's illicit revenue streams helped support a sanctioned regime and undermined the goals of using oil revenues to benefit the iraqi people . the un did not adequately address key internal control elements as it implemented the oil for food program . first , un entities lacked clear lines of authority . for example , the office of the iraq program lacked clear authority for rejecting commodity contracts based on pricing concerns . in addition , the customs contractor at iraq 's border was not authorized to evaluate imports for price and quality . second , the un did not assess emerging risks as the oil for food program expanded from a 6-month emergency measure to deliver food and medicine to a 6-year program providing more than $ 31 billion to 24 economic sectors . third , some monitoring activities constrained iraq 's ability to obtain illicit oil surcharges , but smuggling continued despite the presence of inspectors . in addition , the un 's internal audit office identified hundreds of weaknesses and irregularities in its reports . however , it lacked the resources and independence to provide effective oversight of this costly and complex un effort . the oil for food program offers several lessons for designing future sanctions and strengthening existing un programs : assess whether the sanctions program gives undue control to the sanctioned country ; consider the economic impact that sanctions have on neighboring countries ; ensure that all aspects of sanctions are equally enforced ; establish clear authority and responsibility for management , oversight , and monitoring activities ; assess and mitigate risk as programs and funding expand ; and assess the role of internal oversight units and ensure that they have the resources and independence needed for effective oversight .
six years after the attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) , concerns persist about health effects experienced by wtc responders and the availability of health care services for those affected . several federally funded programs provide screening , monitoring , or treatment services to responders . gao has previously reported on the progress made and implementation problems faced by these wtc health programs . this testimony is based on and updates gao 's report , september 11 : hhs needs to ensure the availability of health screening and monitoring for all responders ( gao - 07-892 , july 23 , 2007 ) . in this testimony , gao discusses the status of services provided by the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) wtc federal responder screening program , efforts by the centers for disease control and prevention 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area , and niosh 's awards to wtc health program grantees for treatment services . in july 2007 , following a re - examination of the status of the wtc health programs , gao recommended that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the wtc attack , regardless of who their employer was or where they reside . as of early september 2007 the department has not responded to this recommendation . as gao reported in july 2007 , hhs 's wtc federal responder screening program has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of screening services for federal responders . from january 2007 to may 2007 , the program stopped scheduling screening examinations because there was a change in the program 's administration and certain interagency agreements were not established in time to keep the program fully operational . from april 2006 to march 2007 , the program stopped scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services associated with screening . niosh , the administrator of the program , has been considering expanding the program to include monitoring , that is , follow - up physical and mental health examinations , but has not done so . if federal responders do not receive monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in seven states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in may 2007 it took steps toward expanding the provider network . niosh has awarded treatment funds to four wtc health programs in the nyc area . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded $ 44 million for outpatient treatment and set aside $ 7 million for hospital care . the new york / new jersey wtc consortium and the new york city fire department wtc program , which received the largest awards , used niosh 's funding to continue outpatient services , offer full coverage for prescriptions , and cover hospital care .
the u.s. dept . of agriculture 's ( usda ) risk management agency ( rma ) administers the federal crop insurance program in partnership with private insurers . in 2005 , the program cost $ 2.7 billion , including an estimated $ 117 million in losses from fraud , waste , and abuse . the agricultural risk protection act of 2000 ( arpa ) provided new tools to monitor and control abuses , such as providing rma sanction authority to address program abuse and having usda 's farm service agency ( fsa ) inspect farmers ' fields . this testimony is based on gao 's september 30 , 2005 , report , crop insurance : actions needed to reduce program 's vulnerability to fraud , waste , and abuse ( gao - 05-528 ) . gao assessed usda 's processes to address fraud , waste , and abuse , and the extent to which the program 's design makes it vulnerable to abuse . rma has taken a number of steps to improve its procedures and processes to address fraud , waste and abuse in selling and servicing crop insurance policies and has reported more than $ 300 million in savings from 2001 to 2004. however , rma is not effectively using all of its tools . gao identified weaknesses in four key areas . first , fsa inspections during the growing season are not being used to maximum effect . between 2001 and 2004 , fsa conducted only 64 percent of the inspections rma had requested . without inspections , farmers may falsely claim crop losses . second , rma 's data analysis of the largest farming operations is incomplete . according to gao 's analysis , in 2003 about 21,000 of the largest farming operations in the program did not report individuals or entities with an ownership interest in these operations as required . without this information rma was unaware of ownership interests that could help it prevent potential program abuse . fsa did not give rma access to the data needed to identify such individuals or entities . usda should be able to recover up to $ 74 million in improper claims payments . third , rma is not effectively overseeing insurance companies ' efforts to control program abuse . gao 's review of 120 cases showed that companies did not complete all of the required quality assurance reviews of claims and those that were conducted were largely paper exercises . fourth , rma has infrequently used its new sanction authority to address program abuse . rma has not issued regulations to implement its new sanction authority under arpa and imposed only 114 sanctions from 2001 through 2004 , although it annually identifies about 3,000 questionable claims , not all of which are necessarily sanctionable . rma 's regulations to implement the crop insurance program , as well as some statutory requirements , create program design problems that hinder rma 's efforts to reduce program abuse . for example , rma 's regulations allow farmers to insure fields individually rather than all fields combined . this option enables farmers to `` switch '' reporting of yield among fields to either make false claims or build up a higher yield history on a field to increase its eligibility for higher insurance guarantees . high premium subsidies , established by statute , may also limit rma 's ability to control program abuse because the subsidies shield farmers from the full effect of paying higher premiums associated with frequent claims . eight recent crop insurance fraud cases , investigated by usda 's office of inspector general and resulting in criminal prosecutions between june 2003 and april 2005 , reflect the issues gao noted . these cases show how farmers , sometimes in collusion with insurance agents and others , falsely claim prevented planting and low production . several of these cases also demonstrate the importance of having fsa and rma work together to identify and share information on questionable farming practices / activities .
the united states is a world leader in scientific and technological innovation . to help maintain this advantage , the federal government has spent billions of dollars on education programs in the science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) fields for many years . however , concerns have been raised about the nation 's ability to maintain its global technological competitive advantage in the future . this testimony is based on our october 2005 report and presents information on trends in degree attainment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , trends in the levels of employment in stem - and non - stem - related fields and factors that may influence these trends , and federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in stem - related fields . for this report , we analyzed survey responses from 13 civilian federal departments and agencies ; analyzed data from the departments of education and labor ; interviewed educators , federal agency officials , and representatives from education associations and organizations ; and interviewed students . while postsecondary enrollment has increased over the past decade , the proportion of students obtaining degrees in stem fields has fallen . in academic year 1994-1995 , about 519,000 students ( 32 percent ) obtained stem degrees . about 578,000 students obtained stem degrees in academic year 2003-2004 , accounting for 27 percent of degrees awarded . despite increases in enrollment and degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level , the number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several stem - related fields from academic year 1994-1995 to academic year 2003-2004. college and university officials and students most often cited subpar teacher quality and poor high school preparation as factors that discouraged the pursuit of stem degrees . suggestions to encourage more enrollment in stem fields include increased outreach and mentoring . the past decade has seen an increase in stem employees , particularly in mathematics and computer science . from 1994 to 2003 , employment in stem fields increased by an estimated 23 percent , compared to 17 percent in non - stem fields . mathematics and computer science showed the highest increase in stem - related employment , and employment in science - related fields increased as well . however , in certain stem fields , including engineering , the number of employees did not increase significantly . further , while the estimated number of women , african - americans , and hispanic - americans employed in stem fields increased , women and minorities remained underrepresented relative to their numbers in the civilian labor force . the number of foreign workers employed in the united states has fluctuated , experiencing declines in 2002 and 2003. key factors affecting stem employment decisions include mentoring for women and minorities and opportunities abroad for foreign employees . thirteen federal civilian agencies spent approximately $ 2.8 billion in fiscal year 2004 to fund over 200 programs designed to increase the numbers of students in stem fields and employees in stem occupations and to improve related educational programs . the funding reported for individual stem education programs varied significantly , and programs most commonly provided financial support to students or infrastructure support to institutions . however , only half of these programs had been evaluated or had evaluations underway , and coordination among stem education programs was limited . it is important to know the extent to which existing stem education programs target the right people and the right areas and make the best use of available resources . since our report was issued in october 2005 , congress , in addition to establishing new grants to encourage students from low - income families to enroll in stem fields , established an academic competitiveness council to identify , evaluate , coordinate , and improve federal stem programs .
the federal aviation administration ( faa ) operates one of the safest air transportation systems in the world , but this system is under growing strain as the demand for air travel increases . recognizing the need to transform this system , congress created the joint planning and development office ( jpdo ) , housed within faa , to plan and develop the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) . the current authorization for faa , the airport and airway trust fund ( trust fund ) , and most of the excise taxes that support the trust fund will expire september 30 , 2007. several proposals , including two reauthorization bills -- h.r . 2881 and s. 1300- - identify various funding sources for faa activities , including nextgen . among these are current excise taxes , fees , and flight surcharges . concerned about the need for stable , sustainable financing for the nation 's multibillion - dollar transportation infrastructure investments , including nextgen , gao has designated transportation financing as high risk . gao 's statement addresses the extent to which the current funding structure can support faa 's activities , including nextgen , issues that could affect the overall cost of nextgen , and the implications of selected proposals to fund aviation activities . the statement is based on recent gao reports and testimonies . recent estimates indicate that faa 's current funding structure -- consisting primarily of trust fund revenues plus a contribution from the general fund of the u.s. treasury -- can potentially support faa 's activities , including nextgen . the current structure has provided sufficient funding for faa 's activities to date , and both faa and the congressional budget office ( cbo ) have estimated that revenues will continue to increase . according to cbo projections through 2017 , the current structure , if maintained , could support about $ 22 billion in additional spending over current spending levels ( adjusted for inflation ) . congress could also raise more revenue for faa by raising excise tax rates or by increasing the general fund contribution . however , contributions from the general fund may be limited by the federal government 's long - term fiscal imbalance , and policy choices , structural changes in the aviation industry , and external events could affect trust fund revenues . furthermore , the current funding structure raises concerns about equity and efficiency because users may pay more or less than the costs of the air traffic control services they receive , and therefore they may lack incentives to use the national airspace system as efficiently as possible . issues that could affect the overall cost of nextgen are primarily related to the content and cost of its infrastructure and research and development . jpdo is developing and has issued some key planning documents that will provide more insights into some of these issues , but questions remain over which entities will perform activities such as research and development . other issues include the cost savings that could result from more efficient faa operations and acquisition processes , which could reduce the need for new nextgen funding , and the extent to which public - private partnerships and leasing can be used to acquire nextgen infrastructure as flexibly and cost - effectively as possible . selected proposals for funding aviation activities could generate more revenue , but could also lead to unintended consequences . for example , a house committee recommendation to raise general aviation fuel tax rates could increase trust fund revenue , but might reduce fuel purchases , which would limit the amount of the revenue increase . h.r . 2881 would raise airport passenger facility charges , mainly benefiting larger airports , and would establish or increase fees for certain faa certification and registration activities . however , when fees are imposed for aviation activities , care must be taken to ensure that efforts to avoid the fees do not compromise safety . s. 1300 would authorize a surcharge of $ 25 per flight on many flights to help pay for nextgen capital projects . while a surcharge would create an incentive for efficient use of air traffic services , some stakeholders raise the possibility that such a fee could lead to reduced air service for small communities . s. 1300 would also allow faa to seek debt financing for capital projects in the private capital market -- a proposal designed to create a stable revenue source but resulting in higher interest costs than borrowing from the u.s. treasury .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , a component within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is responsible for overseeing the medicare and medicaid programs -- the nation 's largest health insurance programs -- which benefit about one in every four americans . cms relies on a contractor - owned and operated network to facilitate communication and data transmission among cms business related entities . effective information security controls are essential to protecting the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of this sensitive information . at congress 's request , gao assessed the effectiveness of information security controls over the communication network used by cms by conducting a technical assessment of the information security controls that are currently in place . although cms had many key information security controls in place -- which had been designed to safeguard the communication network -- some were missing , and existing ones had not always been effectively implemented . significant weaknesses in electronic access and other system controls threatened the confidentiality and availability of sensitive cms financial and medical information when it was transmitted across the network . cms did not always ensure that its contractor effectively implemented electronic access controls designed to prevent , limit , and detect unauthorized access to sensitive computing resources and devices used to support the communication network . gao discovered numerous vulnerabilities in several areas : user identification and authentication , user authorization , system boundary protection , cryptography , and auditing and monitoring of security - related events . there were also weaknesses in controls that had been designed to ensure that secure configurations would be implemented on network devices and that incompatible duties would be sufficiently segregated . a key reason for these weaknesses is that cms did not always ensure that its security policies and standards were implemented effectively . as a result , sensitive , personally identifiable medical data traversing the network is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure and these weaknesses could lead to disruptions in cms services .
from 1987 through 2003 , the united states provided more than $ 2 billion in economic assistance to the federated states of micronesia ( fsm ) and the rmi under a compact of free association ; approximately $ 579 million of this economic assistance went to the rmi . in 2003 , the u.s. government approved an amended compact with the rmi that provides an additional 20 years of assistance , totaling about $ 1.5 billion from 2004 through 2023. the department of the interior 's office of insular affairs ( oia ) is responsible for administering and monitoring this u.s. assistance . the amended compact with the rmi identifies the additional 20 years of grant assistance as intended to assist the rmi government in its efforts to promote the economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance of its people . the assistance is provided in the form of annually decreasing grants that prioritize health and education , paired with annually increasing contributions to trust funds intended as a source of revenue for the country after the grants end in 2023. the amended compact also contains several new funding and accountability provisions that strengthen reporting and bilateral interaction . these provisions include requiring the establishment of a joint economic management committee and a trust fund committee to , respectively , among other things , review the rmi 's progress toward compact objectives and to assess the trust fund 's effectiveness in contributing to the country 's long - term economic advancement and budgetary self - reliance . in 2003 , we testified that these provisions could improve accountability over assistance but that successful implementation will require appropriate resources and sustained commitment from both the united states and the rmi . drawing on several reports that we have published since 2005 , i will discuss the rmi 's economic prospects , implementation of its amended compact to meet long - term goals , and potential trust fund earnings . the rmi has limited prospects for achieving its long - term development objectives and has not enacted policy reforms needed to enable economic growth . the rmi depends on public sector spending of foreign assistance rather than on private sector or remittance income ; public sector expenditure accounts for more than half of its gross domestic product ( gdp ) . the rmi government budget largely depends on foreign assistance and , despite annual decrements in compact funding to support budgetary expenditures , is characterized by a growing wage bill . meanwhile , the two private sector industries identified as having growth potential -- fisheries and tourism -- face significant barriers to expansion because of the rmi 's remote geographic locations , inadequate infrastructure , and poor business environment . in addition , rmi emigrants lack marketable skills that are needed to increased revenue from remittances . moreover , progress in implementing key policy reforms necessary to improve the private sector environment has been slow . foreign investment regulations remain burdensome , and rmi government involvement in commercial activities continues to hinder private sector development . the rmi has made progress in implementing compact assistance , but it faces several challenges in allocating and using this assistance to support its long - term development goals . rmi grant allocations have reflected compact priorities by targeting health , education , and infrastructure -- for example , funding construction of nine new schools . the rmi also has not planned for long - term sustainability of services that takes into account the annual funding decrement . capacity limitations have further affected its ability to ensure the effective use of grant funds . the rmi currently lacks the capacity to adequately measure progress , owing to inadequate baseline data and incomplete performance reports . moreover , although accountability -- as measured by timeliness in single audit reporting and corrective action plans to single audit findings -- has improved , insufficient staff and skills have limited the rmi 's ability to monitor day - to - day sector grant operations as the compacts require . inadequate communication about grant implementation may further hinder the u.s. and rmi governments from ensuring the grants ' effective use . the rmi trust fund may not provide sustainable income for the country after compact grants end , potential sources for supplementing trust fund income have limitations , and the trust fund committee has experienced management challenges . market volatility and the choice of investment strategy could cause the rmi trust fund balance to vary widely , and there is increasing probability that in some years the trust fund will not reach the maximum disbursement level allowed -- an amount equal to the inflation - adjusted compact grants in 2023- - or be able to disburse any income . the trust fund committee 's reporting has not analyzed the fund 's potential effectiveness in helping the rmi achieve its long - term economic goals . although the rmi has supplemented its trust fund income with a contribution from taiwan , other sources of income are uncertain or entail risk . as of june 2007 , for example , the rmi trust fund committee had not appointed an independent auditor or a money manager to invest the fund according to the proposed investment strategy .
to support the education and training of health professionals , the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , administers health professions education programs authorized under title vii of the public health service act . one of these programs , the health careers opportunity program ( hcop ) , provides grants to health professions schools and other entities to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds prepare for health professions education and training . funding preference is given to grant applications that demonstrate a comprehensive approach involving other educational or health - related partners . congressional committees have encouraged hrsa to give priority to applications from schools with a historic mission of educating minority students for health professions . in 2004 , the appropriations conference committee asked gao to review hrsa 's process for awarding grants . this report addresses , for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 , hrsa 's process for awarding hcop grants and the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees . gao reviewed data from hrsa , interviewed hrsa officials , and reviewed relevant federal laws and agency documents from hhs and the department of education . hrsa followed a standard process to award hcop grants , distributing funds on a noncompetitive basis to continue funding existing hcop grants within their approved project periods , and then awarding the remaining funds on a competitive basis . for each of fiscal years 2002-05 , hrsa competitively awarded between $ 4 million and $ 15 million from the approximately $ 34 million annually available for hcop . to award competitive grants , hrsa used independent reviewers who assessed applications against published criteria , scored applications that met minimum criteria , and determined if they qualified for the funding preference . hrsa ranked the applications from highest to lowest score -- putting those with the funding preference first -- and awarded grants in decreasing rank order until the available funds were exhausted . although hrsa had discretion to award grants out of rank order , the agency did not do so for fiscal years 2002-05. for fiscal years 2002-05 , hrsa awarded a total of 99 competitive hcop grants from 439 grant applications reviewed . overall , minority - serving institutions submitted about 25 percent of the applications reviewed and received about 30 percent of the competitive grants ; historically black colleges and universities were the most numerous grantees among minority - serving institutions , followed by hispanic - serving institutions . hrsa commented that a draft of this report met the goals of describing the award process and outlining the number and characteristics of hcop applicants and grantees .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) continues to respond to hurricanes katrina and rita . gao 's previous work identified suspected fraud , waste , and abuse resulting from control weaknesses associated with fema 's individuals and households program ( ihp ) and the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) purchase card program . congress asked gao to follow up on this previous work to determine whether potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments continued to be made . gao testified on the results of our audit and investigative efforts on december 6 , 2006. this report summarizes the results of our follow - up work . in our december 6 , 2006 , testimony , gao stated that fema made tens of millions of dollars of potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments associated with both hurricanes katrina and rita . these payments include $ 17 million in rental assistance paid to individuals to whom fema had already provided free housing through trailers or apartments . in one case , fema provided free housing to 10 individuals in apartments in plano , texas , while at the same time it sent these individuals $ 46,000 to cover out - of - pocket housing expenses . in addition , several of these individuals certified to fema that they needed rental assistance . fema made nearly $ 20 million in duplicate payments to thousands of individuals who claimed damages to the same property from both hurricanes katrina and rita . fema also made millions in potentially improper and / or fraudulent payments to nonqualified aliens who were not eligible for ihp . for example , fema paid at least $ 3 million to more than 500 ineligible foreign students at four universities in the affected areas . this amount likely understates the total payments to ineligible foreign students because it does not cover all colleges and universities in the area . fema also provided potentially improper and / or fraudulent ihp assistance to other ineligible non - u.s. residents , despite having documentation indicating their ineligibility . finally , fema 's difficulties in identifying and collecting improper payments further emphasized the importance of implementing an effective fraud , waste , and abuse prevention system . for example , gao previously estimated improper and potentially fraudulent payments related to the ihp application process to be $ 1 billion through february 2006. as of november 2006 , fema identified about $ 290 million in overpayments and collected about $ 7 million . finally , gao 's work on dhs purchase cards showed continuing problems with property accountability , including items gao investigated that could not be located 1 year after they were purchased .
foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies can pose a significant challenge for the u.s. government because of the need to balance the benefits of foreign investment with national security concerns . the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions of u.s. companies that may harm national security . to better understand how other countries deal with similar challenges , gao was asked to identify how other countries address the issues that exon - florio is intended to address . specifically , this report describes selected countries ' laws and policies enacted to regulate foreign investment to protect their national security interests and implementation of those laws and policies . this report updates a 1996 gao report that describes how four major foreign investors in the united states -- france , germany , japan , and the united kingdom -- monitored foreign investment in their own countries to protect national security interests . it also examines foreign investment in six additional countries : canada , china , india , the netherlands , russia , and the united arab emirates ( uae ) . gao reviewed selected laws and regulations and interviewed foreign government officials and others concerning their implementation and any planned changes to their foreign investment laws , regulations , and policies . as is the case in the united states , the countries we reviewed have enacted laws and instituted policies regulating foreign investment , often to address national security concerns . however , each of the 10 countries has its own concept of national security that influences which particular investments may be restricted . as a result of the differing concepts , restrictions range from requiring approval of investments in a narrowly defined defense sector to broad restrictions on the basis of economic security and cultural policy . in addition , some countries have recently made changes to their laws and policies to more explicitly identify national security as an area of concern , in some cases as the result of controversial investments . several countries have also introduced lists of strategic sectors in which foreign investment requires government review and approval . while there are many unique characteristics of the systems employed by the 10 countries to regulate foreign investment , in many ways the systems are similar to each other , and to the u.s. process under exon - florio . eight countries use a formal review process -- usually conducted by a government economic body with input from government security bodies -- to review a transaction . generally , national security is a primary factor or one of several factors considered in evaluating transactions . while the concepts of national security vary from country to country , all countries share concerns about a core set of issues . these include , for example , the defense industrial base , and more recently , investment in the energy sector and investment by state - owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds . most countries have established time frames for the review and can place conditions on transactions prior to approval . for example , a country may place national citizenship requirements on company board members . however , unlike the voluntary notification under exon - florio , most countries ' reviews are mandatory if the investment reaches certain dollar thresholds or if the buyer will obtain a controlling or blocking share in the acquired company . further , unlike the united states , five countries allow decisions to be appealed through administrative means or in court . two countries do not have a formal review process . the netherlands restricts entry into certain sectors such as public utilities , and the uae restricts the extent of ownership allowed in all sectors without a review . in addition to the formal mechanisms , there are unofficial factors that may influence investment in each of the 10 countries . for example , in some countries an informal government preapproval for sensitive transactions may be needed . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the treasury emphasized the united states ' commitment to an open investment policy .
a significantly greater proportion of african american children are in foster care than children of other races and ethnicities , according to hhs and other research . given this situation , gao was asked to analyze the major factors influencing the proportion of african american children in foster care , extent that states and localities have implemented promising strategies , and ways in which federal policies may have influenced african american representation in foster care . gao 's methodologies included a nationwide survey ; a review of research and federal policies ; state site visits ; analyses of child welfare data ; and interviews with researchers , hhs officials , and other experts . a higher rate of poverty is among several factors contributing to the higher proportion of african american children entering and remaining in foster care . families living in poverty have greater difficulty accessing housing , mental health , and other services needed to keep families stable and children safely at home . bias or cultural misunderstandings and distrust between child welfare decision makers and the families they serve are also viewed as contributing to children 's removal from their homes into foster care . african american children also stay in foster care longer because of difficulties in recruiting adoptive parents and a greater reliance on relatives to provide foster care who may be unwilling to terminate the parental rights of the child 's parent -- as required in adoption -- or who need the financial subsidy they receive while the child is in foster care . most states we surveyed reported using strategies intended to address these issues , such as involving families in decisions , building community supports , and broadening the search for relatives to care for children . hhs provides information and technical assistance , but states reported that they had limited capacity to analyze data and formulate strategies , and states we visited told us they relied on assistance from universities or others . states reported that the ability to use federal funding for family support services was helpful in keeping african american children safely at home and that federal subsidies for adoptive parents helped move children out of foster care . however , they also expressed concerns about the inability to use federal child welfare funds to provide subsidies to legal guardians . as an alternative to adoption , subsidized guardianship is considered particularly promising for helping african american children exit from foster care . states were also concerned about the lack of flexibility to use federal foster care funds to provide services for families , although states can use other federal funds for this purpose if they consider it a priority .
researchers at federal agencies disseminate their research results through a variety of approaches , including scientific publications , presentations , press releases , and media interviews . because of recent concerns about some federal researchers possibly being restricted from disseminating their research on controversial topics , gao determined the policies that guide the dissemination of federal research at the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) ; how effectively these agencies have communicated their policies to researchers ; and the extent to which researchers have been restricted in disseminating their research . gao conducted a survey of 1,811 researchers randomly selected at the three agencies , and had a 66 percent response rate . most of the nasa , nist , and noaa policies that guide the dissemination of federally funded research generally facilitate the dissemination process , but some do not . gao found that overall nasa 's policies , including its recently revised media policy , are clear and should help facilitate dissemination regardless of the dissemination approach used . at nist and noaa , gao found that the agencies ' policies for dissemination through publications and presentations were generally clear and should facilitate dissemination ; but their policies for disseminating research through media interviews and press releases may hinder it . for example , because both nist and noaa are part of commerce , researchers at these agencies must comply with department - level policies to disseminate their research results through media interviews or press releases , but commerce 's policies are outdated and can prevent researchers from meeting media schedules . moreover , requests by noaa researchers to share their research via media interviews and press releases may be further hampered because these researchers must also comply with their own agency 's media interview and press release policies in addition to the department of commerce 's . noaa officials told gao that because its media interview and press release policies lack clarity , they have been inconsistently interpreted by noaa public affairs officials . according to gao 's survey , nasa , nist , and noaa have made efforts to communicate their dissemination policies to their research staff , but many researchers are not confident that they know how to comply with some of the policies . the agencies have communicated their dissemination policies through staff meetings , on agency web sites , and in limited formal training . while 90 percent of researchers are confident that they understand the policies for publications , only about 65 percent are confident they understand their agency 's media interview and press release policies well enough to comply with them . similarly , almost half of the researchers across the agencies are unsure whether their agency 's policy allows them to discuss their personal views on the policy implications of their research . finally , only 25 percent of researchers across the agencies are aware of a process to follow to appeal denials of requests to disseminate their research . on the basis of responses to gao 's survey , 6 percent -- or about 200 researchers -- across nasa , nist , and noaa had dissemination requests denied during the last 5 years . one of the most common reasons researchers mentioned for these denials was that the topic of the research was sensitive or restricted for security reasons ; in some cases , no reason was given . most researchers at these agencies believe that their agency is more supportive of dissemination of research through publications and presentations , than dissemination through the media . most nist and noaa researchers believe that their agency consistently applies the dissemination policies for each route of dissemination , while more researchers at nasa believe the agency consistently applies its policies for publications than believe the agency consistently applies its policies for press releases and interviews .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and its contractors administer and implement the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) . gao designated nfip as a high - risk area in march 2006 , and as of december 2007 , fema owed more than $ 17.3 billion to the treasury for hurricane - related losses . concerns have been raised about the financial condition of nfip and fema 's efforts to mitigate losses and monitor nfip contractors . this report describes statistical and financial trends for nfip from 1997 through 2006 , assesses the extent to which flood - damaged properties were purchased to mitigate risk , and evaluates procedures for monitoring nfip - related contracts . for this study , gao analyzed financial and statistical data on the nfip and its mitigation programs , reviewed documentation of contract monitoring activities , and interviewed fema officials and contractors . the number of federal flood insurance policies in force nationwide increased 36 percent from 1997 through 2006 , but most homeowners at risk of flooding still lacked such insurance . while average insurance amounts ( per policy ) increased 78 percent from 1997 through 2006- - consistent with rising home values -- the average premium decreased 3 percent from 1997 through 2006 , likely driven in part by the increase in policies sold in moderate - to low - risk areas . conversely , loss amounts fluctuated by year , peaking at more than $ 17.7 billion in 2005. seventy - nine percent of the funds paid out through nfip from 1997 through 2006 were for hurricane - related claims , but the percentages in individual years varied widely ( correlating with hurricane activity ) . finally , the extent of claim payments attributed to repetitive loss properties ( those with two or more claims in a rolling 10-year period ) increased from 1997 through 2006 , from $ 3.7 billion to nearly $ 8 billion , with the most significant increases resulting from the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes . because of data limitations , gao was not able to determine the actual number of properties acquired through fema mitigation programs , which are intended to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods . information on completed mitigation projects ( which encompass multiple properties ) indicates that about one - third of properties approved for acquisition from 1997 to 2006 were acquired . however , these data are limited because they do not include a count of properties acquired in ongoing projects . projects may take several years to complete , and fema does not report properties acquired until a project is complete . further , fema collected property acquisition data ( for completed projects ) in an ad hoc manner because fema 's grants management system lacks the capability to record acquisition data . as a result , fema can not readily determine the extent to which flood - damaged and repetitive loss properties have been acquired through its mitigation programs . lack of monitoring records , inconsistent application of procedures , and lack of coordination have diminished the effectiveness of fema monitoring of nfip - related contracts . while federal internal control standards state that records should be properly maintained , fema did not consistently follow its monitoring procedures for preparing or maintaining monitoring reports and was unable to provide copies of the majority of monitoring reports gao requested . further , fema offices did not coordinate information and actions relating to contractor deficiencies and payments . in some cases , key officials were unaware of decisions on contractor performance . as a result , fema can not consistently ensure adherence to contract requirements and lacks information critical for effective oversight of key contractors . given the reliance of nfip upon contractors , it is important that fema have in place adequate controls that are consistently applied to all contracts .
the u.s. department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) , fish and wildlife service , and national park service , and the u.s. department of agriculture 's forest service manage about 628 million acres of public land , mostly in the 11 western states and alaska . under the federal land transaction facilitation act ( fltfa ) , revenue raised from selling blm lands is available to the agencies , primarily to acquire nonfederal land within the boundaries of land they already own -- known as inholdings , which can create significant land management problems . to acquire land , the agencies can nominate parcels under state - level interagency agreements or the secretaries can use their discretion to initiate acquisitions . fltfa expires in 2010. gao was asked to determine fltfa revenue generated , challenges to future sales , fltfa expenditures , and challenges to future acquisitions . to address these issues , gao interviewed officials and examined the act , agency guidance , and fltfa sale and acquisition data . since fltfa was enacted in 2000 , through may 2007 blm has raised $ 95.7 million in revenue , mostly from selling about 17,000 acres . about 92 percent of the revenue raised , or $ 88 million , has come from land transactions in nevada -- 1 of the 11 western states . nevada accounts for the lion 's share of the sales because of a rapidly expanding population , plentiful blm land , and experience with federal land sales in southern nevada . most blm field offices have not generated sales revenue under fltfa . blm faces several challenges to raising revenue through future fltfa sales . in particular , blm state and field officials most frequently cited the limited availability of knowledgeable realty staff to conduct the sales . these staff are often not available because they are working on higher priority activities , such as reviewing and approving energy rights - of - way . we identified two additional issues hampering land sales activity under fltfa . first , while blm has identified land for sale in its land use plans , it has not made the sale of this land a priority during the first 7 years of the program . furthermore , blm has not set goals for sales or developed a sales implementation strategy . second , gao found that some of the additional land blm has identified for sale since fltfa was enacted would not generate revenue for acquisitions because the act only allows the deposit of revenue from the sale of lands identified for disposal on or before the date of the act . the four land management agencies have spent $ 13.3 million of the $ 95.7 million in revenue raised under fltfa : $ 10.1 million using the secretaries ' discretion to acquire nine parcels of land and $ 3.2 million for administrative expenses to prepare land for fltfa sales . the agencies acquired the land between august 2007 and january 2008- - more than 7 years after fltfa was enacted , and blm spent the administrative funds between 2000 and 2007 , primarily for preparing fltfa sales in nevada . as of october 2007 , no land had been purchased through the state - level interagency nomination process , which the agencies envisioned as the primary mechanism for acquiring land . agencies face several challenges to completing future land acquisitions under fltfa . most notably , the act requires that the agencies use most of the funds to purchase land in the state in which the funds were raised ; this restriction has had the effect of making little revenue available for acquisitions outside of nevada . furthermore , progress in acquiring priority lands has been hampered by weak agency performance in identifying inholdings and setting priorities for acquiring them , as required by the act . in addition , gao found that the agencies have not established procedures to track implementation of the act 's requirement that at least 80 percent of fltfa revenue raised in each state be used to acquire inholdings in that state or the extent to which blm is complying with agreed - upon fund allocations among the four participating agencies . of the revenue generated by fltfa sales , the agencies have agreed to allocate 60 percent to blm , 20 percent to the forest service , and 10 percent each to the fish and wildlife service and the park service .
catastrophic disasters , such as hurricane katrina , may result in trauma and other psychological consequences for the people who experience them . the federal government provides states with funding and other support to help them prepare for and respond to disasters . because of congressional interest in these issues , gao examined federal agencies ' actions to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters and states ' experiences obtaining and using grants from the crisis counseling assistance and training program ( ccp ) to respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters . ccp is a program of the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . gao reviewed documents and interviewed program officials from federal agencies and conducted additional work in six states with experience responding to catastrophic disasters : florida , louisiana , mississippi , new york , texas , and washington . federal agencies have awarded grants and conducted other activities to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic and other disasters . for example , in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) provided grants to mental health and substance abuse agencies in 35 states for disaster planning . in 2007 , samhsa completed an assessment of mental health and substance abuse disaster plans developed by states that received a preparedness grant . samhsa found that , for the 34 states with plans available for review , these plans generally showed improvement over those that had been submitted by states as part of their application for its preparedness grant . the agency also identified several ways in which the plans could be improved . for example , about half the plans did not indicate specific planning and response actions that substance abuse agencies should take . similarly , gao 's review of the plans available from six states found varying attention among the plans to covering substance abuse issues . samhsa officials said the agency is exploring methods of determining states ' individual technical assistance needs . other federal agencies -- the centers for disease control and prevention , the health resources and services administration , and dhs -- have provided broader preparedness funding that states may use for mental health or substance abuse preparedness , but these agencies ' data - reporting requirements do not produce information on the extent to which states used funds for this purpose . states in gao 's review experienced difficulties in applying for ccp funding and implementing their programs following catastrophic disasters . ccp , a key federal postdisaster response grant program to help states deliver crisis counseling services , is administered by fema in collaboration with samhsa . state officials said they had difficulty collecting information needed for their ccp applications and experienced lengthy application reviews . fema and samhsa officials said they have taken steps to improve the application submission and review process . state officials also said they experienced problems implementing their ccps . for example , they said that fema 's policy of not reimbursing states and their ccp service providers for indirect costs , such as certain administrative expenses , led to problems recruiting and retaining service providers . other fema postdisaster response grant programs allow reimbursement for indirect costs . a fema official said the agency had been considering since 2006 whether to allow indirect cost reimbursement under ccp but did not know when a decision would be made . states also cited difficulties assisting people who needed more intensive crisis counseling services than those traditionally provided through state ccps . fema and samhsa officials said they plan to consider options for adding other types of crisis counseling services to ccp , based in part on states ' experiences with ccp pilot programs offering expanded crisis counseling services . the officials did not know when they would complete their review and reach a decision .
in recent years , many entities in the private , public , and government sectors have reported the loss or theft of sensitive personal information . these breaches have raised concerns in part because they can result in identity theft -- either account fraud ( such as misuse of credit card numbers ) or unauthorized creation of new accounts ( such as opening a credit card in someone else 's name ) . many states have enacted laws requiring entities that experience breaches to notify affected individuals , and congress is considering legislation that would establish a national breach notification requirement . gao was asked to examine the incidence and circumstances of breaches of sensitive personal information ; the extent to which such breaches have resulted in identity theft ; and the potential benefits , costs , and challenges associated with breach notification requirements . to address these objectives , gao reviewed available reports on data breaches , analyzed 24 large data breaches , and gathered information from federal and state government agencies , researchers , consumer advocates , and others . while comprehensive data do not exist , available evidence suggests that breaches of sensitive personal information have occurred frequently and under widely varying circumstances . for example , more than 570 data breaches were reported in the news media from january 2005 through december 2006 , according to lists maintained by private groups that track reports of breaches . these incidents varied significantly in size and occurred across a wide range of entities , including federal , state , and local government agencies ; retailers ; financial institutions ; colleges and universities ; and medical facilities . the extent to which data breaches have resulted in identity theft is not well known , largely because of the difficulty of determining the source of the data used to commit identity theft . however , available data and interviews with researchers , law enforcement officials , and industry representatives indicated that most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft , particularly the unauthorized creation of new accounts . for example , in reviewing the 24 largest breaches reported in the media from january 2000 through june 2005 , gao found that 3 included evidence of resulting fraud on existing accounts and 1 included evidence of unauthorized creation of new accounts . for 18 of the breaches , no clear evidence had been uncovered linking them to identity theft ; and for the remaining 2 , there was not sufficient information to make a determination . requiring affected consumers to be notified of a data breach may encourage better security practices and help mitigate potential harm , but it also presents certain costs and challenges . notification requirements can create incentives for entities to improve data security practices to minimize legal liability or avoid public relations risks that may result from a publicized breach . also , consumers alerted to a breach can take measures to prevent or mitigate identity theft , such as monitoring their credit card statements and credit reports . at the same time , breach notification requirements have associated costs , such as expenses to develop incident response plans and identify and notify affected individuals . further , an expansive requirement could result in notification of breaches that present little or no risk , perhaps leading consumers to disregard notices altogether . federal banking regulators and the president 's identity theft task force have advocated a notification standard -- the conditions requiring notification -- that is risk based , allowing individuals to take appropriate measures where the risk of harm exists , while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level of risk warrants such action . should congress choose to enact a federal notification requirement , use of such a risk - based standard could avoid undue burden on organizations and unnecessary and counterproductive notifications of breaches that present little risk .
to increase the range of options available to the president , the department of defense ( dod ) is taking steps to develop a portfolio of capabilities , referred to as global strike , to rapidly plan and deliver limited duration and extended range precision strikes against highly valued assets . gao was asked to assess whether dod has clearly defined and instilled a common understanding and approach for global strike throughout the department , the extent to which dod has developed capabilities needed for global strike , and the extent to which dod has identified the funding requirements and developed an investment strategy for acquiring new global strike capabilities . gao reviewed and analyzed plans and studies within dod , the services , and several commands on global strike implementation and capabilities development . dod has taken a number of steps to implement its global strike concept and has generally assigned responsibilities for the planning , execution , and support of global strike operations . however , key stakeholders , particularly the geographic combatant commanders , have different interpretations of the concept , scope , range , and potential use of capabilities needed to implement global strike . several factors affect the understanding and communication of dod 's global strike concept among key stakeholders , including the extent to which dod has defined global strike , incorporated global strike into joint doctrine , conducted outreach and communication activities with key stakeholders , and involved stakeholders in joint exercises and other training involving global strike . gao 's prior work examining successful organizational transformations shows the necessity to communicate to stakeholders often and early with clear and specific objectives on what is to be achieved and what roles are assigned . without a complete and clearly articulated concept that is well communicated and practiced with key stakeholders , dod could encounter difficulties in fully implementing its concept and building the necessary relationships for carrying out global strike operations . dod has underway or completed several global strike assessments to identify potential conventional offensive strike weapons systems , particularly those for prompt global strike , which would provide capabilities sometime after 2018. however , dod has not fully assessed the requirements or coordinated improvements for related enabling capabilities that are critical to the planning and execution of successful global strike operations . these critical enabling capabilities include intelligence collection and dissemination , surveillance and reconnaissance , and command and control , communications , and battlefield damage assessment . furthermore , dod has not coordinated its efforts to improve these capabilities with potential offensive systems it intends to develop . without fully assessing the enabling capabilities required or coordinating with other dod studies , dod might not make the best decision of which enabling capability to pursue in meeting global strike requirements . dod has not yet established a prioritized investment strategy that integrates its efforts to assess global strike options and makes choices among alternatives given the department 's long - term fiscal challenges . gao 's prior work has shown that a long - term and comprehensive investment approach is an important tool in an organization 's decision - making process to define direction , establish priorities , assist with current and future budgets , and plan the actions needed to achieve goals . while dod studies and officials recognize a need for a broad , holistic view of global strike development , dod has not identified and assessed all global - strike - related capabilities and technologies and has not explained how its plans to link long - term studies to identify potential weapons systems will result in a comprehensive prioritized investment strategy for global strike .
the department of defense ( dod ) uses contractors to meet many of its logistical and operational support needs . with the global war on terrorism , there has been a significant increase in deployment of contractor personnel to areas such as iraq and afghanistan . in its fiscal year 2007 report , the house appropriations committee directed gao to examine the link between the growth in dod 's operation and maintenance costs and dod 's increased reliance on service contracts . gao determined the extent to which costs for selected contracts increased and the factors causing the increases , the extent to which dod provided oversight for selected contracts , and the reasons for dod 's use of contractors to support contingency operations . to address these objectives , gao reviewed a nonprobability sample of seven dod contracts for services that provide vital support to contingency operations in iraq and afghanistan . gao reviewed contract requirements , funding documents and dod guidance for these contracts and interviewed dod and contractor personnel . costs for six of the seven contracts gao reviewed increased from an initial estimate of $ 783 million to about $ 3.8 billion , and one consistent and primary factor driving the growth was increased requirements associated with continued military operations in iraq and afghanistan . for example , the army awarded a $ 218.2 million task order for equipment maintenance and supply services in kuwait in october 2004. since then , approximately $ 154 million of additional work was added to this task order for vehicle refurbishment , tire assembly and repair , and resetting of prepositioned equipment . other factors that increased individual contract costs include the use of short - term contract extensions and the government 's inability to provide contractually required equipment and services . for example , in three of the contracts gao reviewed , short - term contract extensions ( 3 to 6 months ) increased costs because the contractor felt it was too risky to obtain long - term leases for vehicles and housing . the actual cost of one contract we reviewed did not exceed the estimated cost for reasons such as lower than projected labor rates . gao has frequently reported that inadequate staffing contributed to contract management challenges . for some contracts gao reviewed , dod 's oversight was inadequate because it had a shortage of qualified personnel and it did not maintain some contract files in accordance with applicable guidance . for five contracts , dod had inadequate management and oversight personnel . in one case , the office responsible for overseeing two contracts was short 6 of 18 key positions , all of which needed specialized training and certifications . in addition , for two other contracts , proper accounting of government owned equipment was not performed because the property administrator position was vacant . second , dod did not always follow guidance for maintaining contract files or its quality assurance principles . for four contracts , complete contract files documenting administration and oversight actions taken were not kept and incoming personnel were unable to determine how contract management and oversight had been performed and if the contractor had performed satisfactorily prior to their arrival . in addition , oversight was not always performed by qualified personnel . for example , quality assurance officials for the linguist contract were unable to speak the language so they could not judge the quality of the contractor 's work . without adequate levels of qualified oversight personnel , proper maintenance of contract files , and consistent implementation of quality assurance principles , dod may not be able to determine whether contractors are meeting their contract requirements , which raises the potential for waste . dod used contractors to support contingency operations for several reasons , including the need to compensate for a decrease in force size and a lack of capability within the military services . for example , an army contract for linguist services had a requirement for more than 11,000 linguists because dod did not have the needed linguists . according to army officials , the army phased out many interpreter positions years ago and did not anticipate a large need for arabic speakers .
hospitals must meet certain conditions of participation established by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) in order to receive medicare payments . in 2003 , most hospitals -- over 80 percent -- demonstrated compliance with most of these conditions through accreditation from the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations ( joint commission ) . established in 1986 , joint commission resources , inc. ( jcr ) , a nonprofit affiliate of the joint commission , provides consultative technical assistance services to hospitals . both organizations acknowledge the need to ensure that jcr 's services do not -- and are not perceived to -- affect the independence of the joint commission 's accreditation process . gao was asked to provide information on the relationship between the joint commission and jcr . this report describes their organizational relationship , and the significant steps they have taken to prevent the improper sharing of information , obtained through their accreditation and consulting activities , respectively , since jcr was established . gao reviewed pertinent documents , including conflict - of - interest policies and information about the organizations ' financial relationship , and interviewed staff and board members from both organizations , jcr clients , and cms officials . the joint commission and jcr have a close relationship as demonstrated through their governance structure and operations . the joint commission has substantial control over jcr and the two organizations provide operational services to one another . for example , jcr manages all joint commission publications , while the joint commission provides support services to jcr . despite the joint commission 's control over jcr , the two organizations have taken steps designed to protect facility - specific information . in 1987 , the organizations created a firewall -- policies designed to establish a barrier between the organizations to prevent improper sharing of this information . for example , the firewall is intended to prevent jcr from sharing the names of hospital clients with the joint commission . beginning in 2003 , both organizations began taking steps intended to strengthen this firewall , such as enhancing monitoring of compliance . ensuring the independence of the joint commission 's accreditation process is vitally important . to prevent the improper sharing of facility - specific information , it would be prudent for the joint commission and jcr to continue to assess the firewall and other related mechanisms . the joint commission agreed with gao 's concluding observations . cms did not comment on gao 's findings or concluding observations . both provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) and the department of defense ( dod ) have a long history of partnering to achieve more cost - effective use of health care resources . their partnerships have evolved to include joint ventures -- joint efforts to construct or share medical facilities . va has maintained eight joint ventures with dod across the country . va has also developed partnerships , or affiliations , with university medical schools to obtain health care services for veterans and provide training to medical residents . va has not entered into a joint venture with an academic affiliate to date . however , several proposals for such joint ventures have surfaced in the last decade . this congressionally requested report discusses the potential benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures and the extent to which they are documented and measured , lessons learned from existing and proposed va joint ventures , and steps va has taken to evaluate proposed joint ventures . to address these issues , gao conducted site visits to and interviews with officials from all existing and proposed joint venture sites . va and dod officials identified a number of potential benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures , but they have not routinely or comprehensively documented and measured them . among the potential benefits , va and dod officials and academic affiliate representatives cited improved access to care , lower or avoided costs , and improved training opportunities . while the identified benefits are many , these officials and representatives also cited a number of concerns associated with joint ventures , such as potential conflicts of missions and cultures , a loss of organizational identity and control , staffing uncertainties , and financial risks . although able to provide anecdotal information of the benefits and concerns associated with joint ventures , officials at the joint ventures do not use performance measures to routinely or comprehensively document and assess the outcomes of the joint ventures . without such efforts , it is difficult to know to what extent these benefits and concerns have materialized . va also does not use performance measures at the department level to determine what is being achieved through the joint ventures -- thereby making it difficult to determine the overall outcomes of the joint ventures and to hold joint venture partners accountable for results . officials from va and dod and representatives from academic affiliates identified several lessons they have learned from their experiences with the existing and proposed joint ventures . these lessons include the importance of establishing joint committees to work through issues , communicating frequently with their partners , securing leadership buy - in and support at all levels , developing contingency plans , allowing adequate time to implement change , and establishing clear roles and responsibilities . for example , at most va - dod joint venture sites , officials have created jointly staffed committees to tackle specific issues , such as clinical , financial , and information management . also , in new orleans , louisiana , va and its academic affiliate signed a memorandum of understanding that , among other things , identifies the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the proposed joint venture negotiations . va has taken steps to enhance its process for evaluating proposed joint ventures , but additional efforts are warranted . in response to our previous recommendations , va developed and issued criteria for evaluating joint venture proposals in november 2007. in addition , va established working groups in charleston , south carolina , and new orleans to examine joint venture proposals with academic affiliates . however , va 's criteria for evaluating joint venture proposals are not sufficiently specific , in terms of both the definition and the application of the criteria . as a result , va 's evaluations of joint venture proposals could be inconsistent and , therefore , may not serve as a reliable guide for federal investments in joint ventures . in addition , the criteria are not tailored to take into account differences in prospective joint venture partners to ensure that va applies the appropriate level of review and scrutiny to proposals .
the legal services corporation ( lsc ) was created as a private nonprofit to support legal assistance for low - income people to resolve their civil legal matters and relies heavily on federal appropriations . in 2006 , lsc distributed most of its $ 327 million in grants to support such assistance . effective internal controls over grants and oversight of grantees are critical to lsc 's mission . gao was asked to determine whether lsc 's internal controls over grants management and oversight processes provide reasonable assurance that grant funds are used for their intended purposes . gao analyzed key records and interviewed agency officials to obtain an understanding of lsc 's internal control framework , including the monitoring and oversight of grantees , and performed limited reviews of internal controls and compliance at 14 grantees . gao found weaknesses in lsc 's internal controls over grants management and oversight of grantees that negatively affect lsc 's ability to provide assurance that grant funds are being used for their intended purposes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations . effective internal controls over grants and grantee oversight are critical to lsc as its very mission and operations rely extensively on grantees to provide legal services to people who otherwise could not afford to pay for adequate legal counsel . gao also found poor fiscal practices and improper and potentially improper expenditures at grantees it visited . weaknesses in lsc 's control environment include the lack of clear definition in the responsibilities of two of the three organizational units that oversee the work of grantees . gao also found that communication between oversight units and coordination of grantee site visits is not sufficient to prevent gaps or duplication of effort , or both . the timing and scope of site visits is not based on a systematic analysis of the risk of noncompliance or financial control weakness across lsc 's 138 grantees , so lsc can not determine whether its resources are being used effectively and efficiently to mitigate risk among its grantees . lsc control activities performed in the monitoring of grantee internal control were not sufficient in scope to achieve effective oversight , and gao noted implementation weaknesses . for example , in the site visits gao observed , staff did not follow up on questionable transactions and relied heavily on information obtained through interviews . feedback to grantees was often delayed , preventing grantees from correcting deficiencies in a timely manner . as of september 2007 , lsc had not yet issued reports to grantee management for about 19 percent ( 10 out of 53 ) of the 2006 site visits . lsc grantee reviews missed potential control deficiencies at grantees that could have been detected with more effective oversight as evidenced by weaknesses gao found at 9 of the 14 grantee sites it visited . while control deficiencies at the grantees were the immediate cause of the problems gao found , weaknesses in lsc 's controls over its oversight of grantees did not assure effective monitoring of grantee controls and compliance . among the questionable expenditures gao found were grantee use of funds for expenditures with insufficient supporting documentation , unusual contractor arrangements , alcohol purchases , employee interest - free loans , lobbying fees , late fees , and earnest money .
the national nanotechnology initiative ( nni ) , administered by the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , is a multiagency effort intended to coordinate the nanotechnology - related activities of 25 federal agencies that fund nanoscale research or have a stake in the results . nanotechnology is the ability to control matter at the scale of a nanometer -- one billionth of a meter . a key research area funded by some federal agencies relates to potential environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) risks that may result from exposure to nanoscale materials . because of concerns about federal efforts to fund and prioritize ehs research , gao was asked to determine the extent to which selected agencies conducted such research in fiscal year 2006 ; the reasonableness of the agencies ' and the nni 's processes to identify and prioritize such federal research ; and the effectiveness of the agencies ' and the nni 's process to coordinate this research . gao reviewed quantitative and qualitative data from five federal agencies that provided 96 percent of fiscal year 2006 funding for ehs research . the nni reported that in fiscal year 2006 , federal agencies devoted $ 37.7million -- or 3 percent of the $ 1.3 billion total nanotechnology research funding -- to research that was primarily focused on the ehs risks of nanotechnology . however , about 20 percent of this total can not actually be attributed to this purpose ; gao found that 22 of the 119 projects identified as ehs - related by five federal agencies in fiscal year 2006 were not focused on determining the extent to which nanotechnology poses an ehs risk . instead , the focus of many of these projects was to explore how nanotechnology could be used to remediate environmental damage or to detect a variety of hazards . gao determined that this mischaracterization is rooted in the current reporting structure which does not allow these types of projects to be easily categorized and the lack of guidance for agencies on how to apportion funding across multiple topics . in addition to the ehs funding totals reported by the nni , federal agencies conduct other research that is not captured in the totals . this research was not captured by the nni because either the research was funded by an agency not generally considered to be a research agency or because the primary purpose of the research was not to study ehs risks . federal agencies and the nni are currently in the process of identifying and prioritizing ehs risk research needs ; the process they are using appears reasonable overall . for example , identification and prioritization of ehs research needs is being done by the agencies and the nni . the nni also is engaged in an iterative prioritization effort through its nanotechnology environmental and health implications ( nehi ) working group . nehi has identified five specific research priorities for five general research categories , but it has not yet completed the final steps of this process , which will identify ehs research gaps , determine specific research needed to fill those gaps , and outline a long - term , overarching ehs research strategy . gao found that the focus of most ehs research projects underway in fiscal year 2006 was generally consistent with agency priorities and nehi research categories and that the projects focused on the priority needs within each category to varying degrees . the anticipated ehs research strategy is expected to provide a framework to help ensure that the highest priority needs are met . agency and nni processes to coordinate activities related to potential ehs risks of nanotechnology have been generally effective . the nehi working group has convened frequent meetings that have helped agencies identify opportunities to collaborate on ehs risk issues , such as joint sponsorship of research and workshops to advance knowledge and facilitate information - sharing among the agencies . in addition , nehi has incorporated several practices that are key to enhancing and sustaining interagency collaboration , such as leveraging resources . finally , agency officials gao spoke with expressed satisfaction with the coordination and collaboration on ehs risk research that has occurred through nehi . they cited several factors they believe contribute to the group 's effectiveness , including the stability of the working group membership and the expertise and dedication of its members .
senate report no . 110-77 directed gao to review the department of defense 's ( dod ) procedures for antideficiency act ( ada ) violations . gao focused on whether existing dod funds control systems , processes , and internal controls provide reasonable assurance that ada violations will be prevented or detected and whether key funds control personnel are trained ; investigations of ada violations are processed in accordance with applicable dod regulations ; and dod tracks and reports metrics pertaining to its ada investigations and what disciplinary actions are taken when ada violations have occurred . gao 's review included all 54 ada military service case files closed in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. gao did not assess the appropriateness of the conclusions reached or of the disciplinary actions taken for the ada cases . dod 's complex and inefficient payment processes , nonintegrated business systems , and weak internal controls impair its ability to maintain proper funds control , leaving the department at risk of overobligating or overspending its appropriations in violation of the ada . dod comptroller and military service financial management and comptroller officials responsible for the department 's ada programs have stated that because of weaknesses in dod 's business operations , knowledgeable personnel are critical to improving the department 's funds control , and these officials have or are developing training courses . however , only the army has attempted to identify and determine whether key funds control personnel have received appropriate training to provide them with the knowledge and skills to fulfill their responsibilities , including the ada , required by dod regulations . gao 's analysis of the 54 ada cases and other documentation provided by the military services disclosed that the military services did not fully comply with dod regulations intended to ensure that ada reviews and investigations were conducted by qualified and independent personnel and were completed in a timely manner . more specifically , gao found the following : only 6 of the 66 investigating officers assigned to the 54 ada cases reviewed had received all of the required training . nineteen of the 54 ada cases lacked documentation needed to determine whether the investigating officer was organizationally independent . further , because the military services focused on organizational independence , they could not be assured that investigating officers were free of personal or external impairments to independence . ? . ada investigations were generally not completed within the 15 months and 25 days set forth by dod . of the 54 ada cases reviewed , 22 cases took over 30 months to complete and only 16 were completed on time . gao also noted that dod , as required , reported the 34 cases in which it had concluded that an ada violation had occurred to the president and the congress , with a copy to gao . for the remaining 20 cases , dod concluded that an ada violation had not occurred and therefore external reporting was not required . further , dod has taken steps to improve transparency over the ada investigation process by requiring dod components to report status information when an ada investigation is initiated . additionally , for the 34 ada cases in which dod concluded that an ada violation had occurred , the nature of the disciplinary actions taken and reported to the president and the congress was consistent with the criteria set forth in the dod regulations . the ada requires that employees who are responsible for ada violations be subject to appropriate administrative discipline . the dod regulations specify that administrative discipline can range from no action to the termination of the individual 's employment .
for many years , gao has reported that weaknesses in information security are a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences -- such as intrusions by malicious users , compromised networks , and the theft of personally identifiable information -- and has identified information security as a governmentwide high - risk issue . concerned by reports of significant vulnerabilities in federal computer systems , congress passed the federal information security management act of 2002 ( fisma ) , which permanently authorized and strengthened the information security program , evaluation , and reporting requirements for federal agencies . in this testimony , gao discusses security incidents reported at federal agencies , the continued weaknesses in information security controls at major federal agencies , agencies ' progress in performing key control activities , and opportunities to enhance fisma reporting and independent evaluations . to address these objectives , gao analyzed agency , inspectors general ( ig ) , and gao issued and draft reports on information security . federal agencies have recently reported a spate of security incidents that put sensitive data at risk . personally identifiable information about millions of americans has been lost , stolen , or improperly disclosed , thereby exposing those individuals to loss of privacy , identity theft , and financial crimes . the wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft , computer intrusions , and privacy breaches underscore the need for improved security practices . as illustrated by these security incidents , significant weaknesses in information security controls threaten the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations , assets , and personnel of federal agencies . almost all of the major federal agencies had weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls . most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent , limit , or detect access to computer networks , systems , or information . for example , agencies did not consistently identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access , apply encryption to protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices , and restrict physical access to information assets . in addition , agencies did not always manage the configuration of network devices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity , such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely manner ; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction ; and maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information systems . an underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully or effectively implemented agencywide information security programs . nevertheless , federal agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements . however , igs at several agencies sometimes disagreed with the agency 's reported information and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities . further , opportunities exist to enhance reporting under fisma and the independent evaluations completed by igs .
the upcoming 2009 transition will be a unique and critical period for the u.s. government . it marks the first wartime presidential transition in 40 years . it will also be the first administration change for the relatively new department of homeland security operating in the post 9 / 11 environment . the next administration will fill thousands of positions across government ; there will be a number of new faces in congress as well . making these transitions as seamlessly as possible is pivotal to effectively and efficiently help accomplish the federal government 's many essential missions . while the government accountability office ( gao ) , as a legislative branch agency , has extensive experience helping each new congress , the presidential transition act points to gao as a resource to incoming administrations as well . the act specifically identifies gao as a source of briefings and other materials to help presidential appointees make the leap from campaigning to governing by informing them of the major management issues , risks , and challenges they will face . gao has traditionally played an important role as a resource for new congresses and administrations , providing insight into the issues where gao has done work . this testimony provides an overview of gao 's objectives for assisting the 111th congress and the next administration in their all - important transition efforts . gao will highlight issues that the new president , his appointees , and the congress will confront from day one . these include immediate challenges ranging from national and homeland security to oversight of financial institutions and markets to a range of public health and safety issues . gao will synthesize the hundreds of reports and testimonies it issues every year so that new policy makers can quickly zero in on critical issues during the first days of the new administration and congress . gao 's analysis , incorporating its institutional memory across numerous administrations , will be ready by the time the election results are in and transition teams begin to move out . gao will provide congressional and executive branch policy makers with a comprehensive snapshot of how things are working across government and emphasize the need to update some federal activities to better align them with 21st century realities and bring about government transformation . in keeping with its mission , gao will be providing congress and the executive branch with clear facts and constructive options and suggestions that elected officials can use to make policy choices in this pivotal transition year . gao believes the nation 's new and returning leaders will be able to use such information to help meet both the nation 's urgent issues and long - term challenges so that our nation stays strong and secure now and for the next generation . gao 's transition work also will highlight the need to modernize the machinery of government through better application of information technology , financial management , human capital , and contracting practices . gao also will underscore the need to develop strategies for addressing the government 's serious long - term fiscal sustainability challenges , driven on the spending side primarily by escalating health care costsand changing demographics .
responders to the world trade center ( wtc ) attack were exposed to many hazards , and concerns remain about long - term health effects of the disaster and the availability of health care services for those affected . in 2006 , gao reported on problems with the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) wtc federal responder screening program and on the centers for disease control and prevention 's ( cdc ) distribution of treatment funding . gao was asked to update its 2006 testimony . gao assessed the status of services provided by the wtc federal responder screening program , efforts by cdc 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area , and niosh 's awards to grantees for treatment services and efforts to estimate service costs . gao reviewed program documents and interviewed hhs officials , grantees , and others . hhs 's wtc federal responder screening program has had difficulties ensuring the uninterrupted availability of services for federal responders . from january 2007 to may 2007 , the program stopped scheduling screening examinations because there was a change in the administration of the wtc federal responder screening program , and certain interagency agreements were not established in a timely way to keep the program fully operational . in april 2006 the program also stopped scheduling and paying for specialty diagnostic services because a contract with the program 's new provider network did not cover these services . almost a year later , the contract was modified , and the program resumed scheduling and paying for these services in march 2007. niosh is considering expanding the wtc federal responder screening program to include monitoring -- follow - up physical and mental health examinations -- and is assessing options for funding and service delivery . if federal responders do not receive monitoring , health conditions that arise later may not be diagnosed and treated , and knowledge of the health effects of the wtc disaster may be incomplete . niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it recently took steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 , niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in 7 states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in may 2007 , it took steps toward expanding the provider network . however , these efforts are incomplete . niosh has awarded treatment funds to four nyc - area programs , but does not have a reliable cost estimate of serving responders . in fall 2006 , niosh awarded $ 44 million for outpatient treatment and set aside $ 7 million for hospital care . the new york / new jersey wtc consortium and the new york city fire department wtc program , which received the largest awards , used niosh 's funding to continue outpatient services , offer full coverage for prescriptions , and cover hospital care . program officials expect that niosh 's outpatient treatment awards will be spent by the end of fiscal year 2007. niosh lacks a reliable estimate of service costs because the estimate that niosh and its grantees developed included potential costs for certain program changes that may not be implemented , and in the absence of actual treatment cost data , they relied on questionable assumptions . it is unclear whether the estimate overstates or understates the cost of serving responders . to improve future cost estimates , hhs officials have required the two largest grantees to report detailed cost data .
for decades , gao has assisted congress in its oversight role and helped federal departments and agencies with disparate missions to improve the economy , efficiency , and effectiveness of their operations . gao 's work provides important insight on matters such as best practices to be shared and benchmarked and how government and nongovernmental partners can become better aligned to achieve important outcomes for the nation . in addition , gao provides congress with foresight by highlighting the long - term implications of today 's decisions and identifying key trends and emerging challenges facing our nation before they reach crisis proportions . for this hearing , gao was asked to highlight governmentwide issues where it has made a major contribution to oversight and could assist the intelligence and other congressional committees in their oversight of the intelligence community , and comment on the potential impact on gao 's access to perform audit work on personnel security clearances if the office of the director of national intelligence ( odni ) were to assume management of this issue from the office of management and budget ( omb ) . given historical challenges to gao 's ability to audit the intelligence community 's programs and activities , this testimony also discusses gao 's views on senate bill s. 82 , known as the intelligence community audit act of 2007. gao has considerable experience in addressing governmentwide management challenges , including such areas as human capital , acquisition , information technology , strategic planning , organizational alignment , and financial and knowledge management , and has identified many opportunities to improve agencies ' economy , efficiency , and effectiveness , and the need for interagency collaboration in addressing 21st century challenges . for example , over the years , gao has addressed the human capital issues , such as acquiring , developing , and retaining talent ; strategic workforce planning ; building results - oriented cultures ; pay for performance ; contractors in the workforce ; and personnel security clearances , which affect all federal agencies , including the intelligence community . furthermore , gao identified delays and other impediments in the department of defense 's ( dod ) personnel security clearance program , which also maintains clearances for intelligence agencies within dod . gao designated human capital transformation and personnel security clearances as high - risk areas . gao also recently issued reports addressing intelligence community - related management issues , including intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ; space acquisitions ; and the space acquisition workforce . if odni were to assume management responsibilities over security clearances across the federal government , gao 's ability to continue monitoring this area and provide congress information for its oversight role could be adversely affected . in 2006 , omb 's deputy director for management suggested that omb 's oversight role of the governmentwide security clearance process might be transferred to the odni . gao has established and maintained a relatively positive working relationship with the odni , but limitations on gao 's ability to perform meaningful audit and evaluation work persist . while gao has the legal authority to audit the personnel security clearance area , if the odni were to assume management responsibilities over this issue , then it may be prudent to incorporate some legislative provision to reinforce gao 's access to information needed to conduct such audits and reviews . gao supports s. 82 and believes that if it is enacted , the agency would be well - positioned to assist congress in oversight of intelligence community management reforms . s. 82 would reaffirm gao 's existing statutory authority to audit and evaluate financial transactions , programs , and activities of elements of the intelligence community , and to access records necessary for such audits and evaluations . gao has clear audit and access authority with respect to elements of the intelligence community , subject to a few limited exceptions . however , for many years , the executive branch has not provided gao the level of cooperation needed to conduct meaningful reviews of elements of the intelligence community . this issue has taken on new prominence and is of greater concern in the post - 9 / 11 context , especially since the odni 's responsibilities extend well beyond traditional intelligence activities . the reaffirmation provisions in the bill should help to ensure that gao 's audit and access authorities are not misconstrued in the future .
over the past 15 years , legislative and executive branch reform efforts have attempted to shift the focus of federal government management from a preoccupation with activities to the results or outcomes of those activities . based on over a decade of work in this area , gao has found a transformation in the capacity of the federal government to manage for results , including an infrastructure of outcome - oriented strategic plans , performance measures , and accountability reporting that provides a solid foundation for improving the performance of federal programs . however , agencies have made less progress in getting their managers ' to use performance information in their decision making . gao was asked to testify on the preliminary results of ongoing work looking at trends in federal managers ' use of performance information to manage , both governmentwide and at the agency level ; how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve results ; and lessons learned from prior management reforms for the next administration . our statement is based on prior gao reports and surveys we conducted in 1997 , 2000 , 2003 , and 2007. for the results of our 2007 survey , see e - supplement gao - 08-1036sp . gao will be issuing a report at a later date that will explore the use of performance results in management decision making at selected agencies . according to gao surveys , since 1997 significantly more federal managers report having performance measures for the programs they manage . however , despite having more performance measures available , federal managers ' reported use of performance information in management decision making has not changed significantly . for the collection of performance information to be considered more than meaningless paperwork exercises , it must be useful to and used by federal decision makers at all levels -- including congress . to reach this state , gao believes that the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last 10 years : demonstrate leadership commitment to results - oriented management ; develop a clear `` line of sight '' linking individual performance with organizational results ; and build agency capacity to collect and use performance information . in addition to encouraging agencies to employ these practices , the next administration should : adopt a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance ; improve the relevance of performance information to congress ; and build agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making .
the smithsonian institution ( smithsonian ) is the world 's largest museum complex . its funding comes from its own private trust fund assets and federal appropriations , with the majority of funds for facilities coming from federal appropriations . in 2005 , gao reported that the smithsonian 's current funding would not be sufficient to cover its estimated $ 2.3 billion in facilities projects through 2013 and recommended that the smithsonian board of regents , its governing body , develop and implement a funding plan . recently , problems related to a lack of adequate oversight of executive compensation and other issues have raised concerns about governance at the smithsonian . this testimony discusses gao 's recently issued work on the smithsonian 's real property management efforts and its efforts to develop and implement strategies to fund its facilities projects . in addition , it describes preliminary results of gao 's ongoing work on the smithsonian 's governance challenges . the work for this testimony is based on gao 's september 2007 report , smithsonian institution : funding challenges affect facilities ' conditions and security , endangering collections , which included recommendations . for ongoing governance work , gao reviewed smithsonian documents and interviewed smithsonian officials , academics , and representatives of nonprofit associations . while the smithsonian has made some improvements to its real property management , the continued deterioration of many smithsonian facilities has caused problems , and the smithsonian 's real property management efforts face challenges . the deterioration of facilities has caused access restrictions and threatened collections . in addition , the smithsonian 's estimate for facilities projects increased to $ 2.5 billion . while the smithsonian follows key security practices , communication of security information and funding constraints pose challenges . the smithsonian has made significant strides in improving its real property portfolio management . however , the smithsonian omitted privately funded projects from its capital plan , making it challenging to assess the total funding and scope of projects . gao 's september 2007 report recommended that the smithsonian increase awareness of security issues and include privately funded projects in its capital plan . the smithsonian concurred . to address gao 's 2005 recommendation that the smithsonian develop a funding plan for facilities projects , the board of regents created an ad - hoc committee that reviewed nine options and chose to request increased federal funding . some of the smithsonian 's evaluations of the nine funding options were limited in that they did not always provide complete analysis , fully explain assumptions , benchmark with other organizations , or consider combining options to increase revenue . gao 's september 2007 report recommended that the smithsonian more comprehensively analyze funding options and report to congress and the office of management and budget on a funding strategy . the smithsonian concurred . the board of regents recently established a prioritized list of funding options . preliminary results of gao 's ongoing work on broader governance issues indicate that the board of regents has made some changes to strengthen governance , such as more clearly defining the regents ' oversight responsibilities and improving access between the board and key members of senior management . the board is also studying whether changes to its size and composition would strengthen governance . gao 's preliminary work suggests that the board appears to have taken some positive steps toward governance reform , but that success will depend in part on how regents embrace their new responsibilities and on their level of engagement .
gao has for many years warned that our nation is on an imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path . during the past 3 years , the comptroller general has traveled to 25 states as part of the fiscal wake - up tour . members of this diverse group of policy experts agree that finding solutions to the nation 's long - term fiscal challenge will require bipartisan cooperation , a willingness to discuss all options , and the courage to make tough choices . at the request of chairman conrad and senator gregg , the comptroller general discussed the long - term fiscal outlook , our nation 's huge health care challenge , and the shrinking window of opportunity for action . as we enter 2008 , what we call the long - term fiscal challenge is not in the distant future . already the first members of the baby boom generation have filed for early social security retirement benefits -- and will be eligible for medicare in only 3 years . simulations by gao , the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , and others all show that despite a 3-year decline in the budget deficit , we still face large and growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and known demographic trends . under any plausible scenario , the federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path . rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem ; they are our nation 's number one fiscal challenge . growth in health - related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local governments . unsustainable growth in health care spending is a systemwide challenge that also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercut our ability to compete in a global marketplace . addressing the unsustainability of health care costs is a societal challenge that calls for us as a nation to fundamentally rethink how we define , deliver , and finance health care in both the public and the private sectors . the passage of time has only worsened the situation : the size of the challenge has grown and the time to address it has shrunk . the longer we wait the more painful and difficult the choices will become , and the greater the risk of a very serious economic disruption . it is understandable that the congress and the administration are focused on the need for a short - term fiscal stimulus . however , our long - term challenge increases the importance of careful design of any stimulus package -- it should be timely , targeted , and temporary . at the same time , creating a capable and credible commission to make recommendations to the next congress and the next president for action on our longer - range and looming fiscal imbalance is called for .
given a large - scale organizational change initiative , such as the department of defense 's ( dod ) national security personnel system ( nsps ) , is a substantial commitment that will take years to complete , it is important that dod and congress be kept informed of the full cost of implementing nsps . under the comptroller general 's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , gao analyzed the extent to which dod has fully estimated total costs associated with the implementation of nsps and expended or obligated funds to design and implement nsps through fiscal year 2006. gao interviewed department officials and analyzed the nsps program executive office 's ( peo ) , and the military services ' and the washington headquarters services ' ( hereafter referred to as the components ) cost estimates and reports of expended and obligated funds . dod 's november 2005 estimate that it will cost $ 158 million to implement nsps does not include the full cost that the department expects to incur as a result of implementing the new system . federal financial accounting standards state that reliable information on the costs of federal programs and activities is crucial for effective management of government operations and recommend that full costs of programs and their outputs be provided to assist congress and executives in making informed decisions on program resources and to ensure that programs get expected and efficient results . the full cost includes both those costs specifically identifiable to carry out the program , or direct costs , and those costs that are common to multiple programs but can not be specifically identified with any particular program , or indirect costs . while the standards emphasize that full cost information is essential for managing federal programs , their activities , and outputs , the standards also provide that items may be omitted from cost information if that omission would not change or influence the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the cost information . based on gao 's review of documentation provided by dod and discussions with department officials , gao found that dod 's estimate includes some direct costs , such as the start - up and operation of the nsps peo and the development and delivery of new nsps training courses , but it does not include other direct costs such as the full salary costs of all civilian and military personnel who directly support nsps activities departmentwide . before developing its estimate , dod had not fully defined all the direct and indirect costs needed to manage the program . without a better estimate , decision makers -- within dod and congress -- will not have complete information about whether adequate resources are being provided for implementing nsps . the total amount of funds dod has expended or obligated to design and implement nsps during fiscal years 2005 through 2006 can not be determined because dod has not established an oversight mechanism to ensure that these costs are fully captured . in may 2005 , the nsps senior executive established guidance for tracking and reporting nsps implementation costs that requires the components to develop mechanisms to capture these costs and to report quarterly their costs to the nsps peo . however , this guidance does not define the direct and indirect costs dod requires that the components capture . dod 's pervasive financial management deficiencies have been the basis for gao 's designation of this as a high - risk area since 1995. gao 's review of submitted reports from the components found that their official accounting systems do not capture the total funds expended or obligated to design and implement nsps . without an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that the official accounting systems capture all appropriate costs , dod and congress do not have visibility over the actual cost to design and implement nsps .
within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , the transportation security administration 's ( tsa ) mission is to protect the nation 's transportation network . since its inception in 2001 , tsa has developed and implemented a variety of programs and procedures to secure commercial aviation . gao examined the progress dhs and tsa have made in securing the nation 's commercial aviation system , and challenges that have impeded the department 's efforts to implement its mission and management functions . this testimony is based on issued gao reports and testimonies addressing the security of the nation 's commercial aviation system , including a recently issued report ( gao - 07-454 ) that highlights the progress dhs has made in implementing its mission and management functions . in august 2007 , gao reported that dhs had made moderate progress in securing the commercial aviation system , but that more work remains . specifically , dhs generally achieved 17 of the 24 performance expectations that gao identified in the area of aviation security but had generally not achieved 7 of them . dhs and tsa have made progress in many areas related to securing commercial aviation . for example , to meet congressional mandates to screen airline passengers and 100 percent of checked baggage , tsa initially hired and deployed a federal workforce of over 50,000 passenger and checked baggage screeners and installed equipment at the nation 's more than 400 commercial airports to provide the capability to screen all checked baggage using explosive detection systems . tsa has since turned its attention to , among other things , strengthening passenger prescreening ; more efficiently allocating , deploying , and managing the transportation security officer ( tso ) -- - -- - formerly known as screener -- - -- - workforce ; strengthening screening procedures ; developing and deploying more effective and efficient screening technologies ; and improving domestic air cargo security . while these efforts have helped strengthen the security of the commercial aviation system , dhs and tsa still face a number of key challenges in further securing this system . for example , tsa has faced difficulties in developing and implementing its advanced passenger prescreening system , known as secure flight , and has not yet completed development efforts . in addition , dhs 's efforts to enhance perimeter security at airports may not be sufficient to provide for effective security . tsa has also initiated efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of security - related technologies , such as biometric identification systems , but has not developed a plan for implementing new technologies to meet the security needs of individual airports . tsa has also not yet effectively deployed checkpoint technologies to address key existing vulnerabilities , and has not yet developed and implemented technologies needed to screen air cargo . gao also reported that a number of issues have impeded dhs 's efforts in implementing its mission and management functions , including not always implementing effective strategic planning or fully adopting and applying a risk management approach with respect to commercial aviation security .
social security covers about 96 percent of all u.s. workers ; the vast majority of the remaining 4 percent are public employees . although these noncovered workers do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings , they may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses ' or their own earnings from other covered employment . social security has provisions -- the government pension offset ( gpo ) and the windfall elimination provision ( wep ) -- that attempt to take noncovered employment into account when calculating the social security benefits for public employees . however , these provisions have been difficult to administer and critics contend that the provisions themselves are often unfair . the committee asked gao to discuss the issues regarding the coverage of public employees under social security , the provisions to take noncovered employment into account , and the proposals to modify those provisions . there are no easy answers to the difficulties of equalizing social security 's treatment of covered workers and noncovered public employees . about one - fourth of public employees -- primarily state and local government workers -- are not covered by social security and do not pay social security taxes on their government earnings . nevertheless , these workers may still be eligible for social security benefits through their spouses ' or their own earnings from other covered employment . to address concerns with how noncovered workers are treated compared with covered workers , social security has provisions in place to take noncovered employment into account and reduce social security benefits for public employees . to be administered fairly and accurately , both these provisions require complete and accurate reporting of government pension income , which is not currently available . the resulting disparity in the application of the provisions is a continuing source of confusion and frustration for affected workers . thus , various changes that would affect the gpo and wep provisions have been proposed , such as : eliminate the gpo and wep provisions . this would simplify administration and avoid concerns about unfair treatment among public employees . however , any reductions in the gpo or the wep would widen social security 's financial gap and would raise concerns about unfair treatment of public employees compared with other workers . extend mandatory coverage . if all newly hired state and local government employees who are not currently covered were to become covered , the need for the gpo and wep could be phased out over time . in 2005 , social security actuaries estimated that mandating coverage for these employees would reduce the 75-year actuarial deficit by about 11 percent . while mandatory coverage could enhance retirement benefits for the affected workers , it could also result in significant costs to the affected state and local governments . as long as the gpo and the wep remain in effect , it will be important to administer the provisions effectively and equitably based on accurate and complete information on both covered and noncovered employment .
events such as the recent shootings by armed intruders in schools across the nation , natural disasters , the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and potential pandemics have heightened awareness for the need for school districts to be prepared to address a range of emergencies within and outside of schools buildings . congress has raised concerns over school preparedness , with a particular interest in how federal agencies provide assistance to school districts . this testimony discusses preliminary findings related to gao 's review of emergency management in school districts , including the roles of federal and state governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to school districts for emergency management planning , what school districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies , and the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for emergencies , and communicating and coordinating with first responders , parents , and students . to obtain this information , gao interviewed federal officials , surveyed a stratified random sample of all public school districts , surveyed state agencies that administer federal grants that can be used for school emergency management planning , conducted site visits to school districts , and reviewed relevant documents . federal and state governments have a role in supporting emergency management in school districts . while no federal laws require school districts to have emergency management plans , 32 states reported having laws or policies requiring school districts to have such plans . the departments of education and homeland security ( dhs ) provide funding for emergency management planning in schools . however , some dhs program guidance , for specific grants , does not clearly identify school districts as entities to which state and local governments may disburse grant funds . thus , states receiving this funding may be uncertain as to whether such funding can be allocated to school districts or schools and therefore may not have the opportunity to benefit from this funding . states also provide funding and other resources to school districts to assist them in planning for emergencies . school districts have taken steps to plan for a range of emergencies , as most have developed multi - hazard emergency management plans ; however some plans and activities do not address federally recommended practices . for example , based on gao 's survey of a sample of public school districts , an estimated 56 percent of all school districts have not employed any procedures in their plans for continuing student education in the event of an extended school closure , such as might occur during a pandemic , and many do not include procedures for special needs students . fewer than half of districts with emergency plans involve community partners when developing and updating these plans . finally , school districts are generally not training with first responders or community partners on how to implement their school district emergency plans . many school district officials said that they experience challenges in planning for emergencies and some school districts face difficulties in communicating and coordinating with first responders and parents , but most said that they do not experience challenges in communicating with students . for example , in an estimated 62 percent of districts , officials identified challenges stemming from a lack of equipment , training for staff , and personnel with expertise in the area of emergency planning as obstacles to implementing recommended practices .
for the past 10 years , since gao 's first audit of the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) , certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices have prevented gao from expressing an opinion on the cfs . gao has consistently reported that the u.s. government did not have adequate systems , controls , and procedures to properly prepare the cfs . gao 's december 2006 disclaimer of opinion on the fiscal year 2006 cfs included a discussion of continuing weaknesses related to the preparation of the cfs . the purpose of this report is to provide details of continuing and new weaknesses , recommend improvements , and describe the status of corrective actions on 143 open recommendations related to the preparation of the cfs that gao reported in april 2006. gao identified continuing and new weaknesses during its audit of the federal government 's process for preparing the fiscal year 2006 cfs . such weaknesses impair the u.s. government 's ability to ensure that the cfs is consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements , properly balanced , and in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles . the weaknesses gao identified during its tests of the fiscal year 2006 cfs preparation process involved the following areas : reconciling and reporting undistributed offsetting receipts ( component of the budget deficit ) ; directly linking audited federal agencies ' financial statements to the cfs ; reporting unexpended budget balances ; reporting operating cash ; reporting and disclosing legal contingencies ; reconciling intragovernmental activity and balances ; preparing and auditing certain information in federal agencies ' closing packages ; conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; and various other internal control weaknesses that were identified in previous years ' audits but remained in fiscal year 2006. of the 143 open recommendations gao reported in april 2006 regarding the process for preparing the cfs , 70 remained open as of december 1 , 2006 , when gao completed its fieldwork for the audit of the fiscal year 2006 cfs . of the 73 recommendations that were closed , 53 were closed based on the issuance in fiscal year 2006 of statement of federal financial accounting standards no . 32 , consolidated financial report of the united states government requirements : implementing statement of federal financial accounting concepts 4 `` intended audience and qualitative characteristics for the consolidated financial report of the united states government . . this standard eliminated or lessened the disclosure requirements for the consolidated financial statements related to certain information that the department of the treasury ( treasury ) had not been reporting . gao will continue to monitor the status of corrective actions to address the 11 new recommendations and the new remaining balance of 81 open recommendations during its fiscal year 2007 audit of the cfs .
gao was asked to discuss -- based on medicare : focus on physician practice patterns can lead to greater program efficiency , gao - 07-307 ( apr . 30 , 2007 ) -- the importance in medicare of providing feedback to physicians on how their use of health care resources compares with that of their peers . gao 's report discusses an approach to analyzing physicians ' practice patterns in medicare and ways the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) could use the results . in a related matter , medicare 's sustainable growth rate system of spending targets used to moderate physician spending growth and annually update physician fees has been problematic , acting as a blunt instrument and lacking in incentives for physicians individually to be attentive to the efficient use of resources in their practices . gao 's statement focuses on the results of its analysis estimating the prevalence of inefficient physicians in medicare and the potential for cms to profile physicians in traditional fee - for - service medicare for efficiency and use the results in ways that are similar to other purchasers ' efforts to encourage efficiency . having considered efforts of 10 private and public health care purchasers that routinely evaluate physicians for efficiency and other factors , gao conducted its own analysis of physician practices in medicare . gao focused the analysis on generalists -- physicians who described their specialty as general practice , internal medicine , or family practice -- and selected metropolitan areas that were diverse geographically and in terms of medicare spending per beneficiary . although gao did not include specialists in its analysis , its method does not preclude profiling specialists , as long as enough data are available to make meaningful comparisons across physicians . based on 2003 medicare claims data , gao 's analysis found outlier generalist physicians -- physicians who treat a disproportionate share of overly expensive patients -- in all 12 metropolitan areas studied . outlier generalists and other generalists saw similar numbers of medicare patients and their respective patients averaged the same number of office visits . however , after taking health status and location into account , gao found that medicare patients who saw an outlier generalist -- compared with those who saw other generalists -- were more likely to have been hospitalized , more likely to have been hospitalized multiple times , and more likely to have used home health services . by contrast , they were less likely to have been admitted to a skilled nursing facility . gao concluded that outlier generalists were likely to practice medicine inefficiently . cms has tools available to evaluate physicians ' practices for efficiency , including a comprehensive repository of medicare claims data to compute reliable efficiency measures and substantial experience adjusting for differences in patients ' health status . the agency also has wide experience in conducting educational outreach to physicians with respect to improper billing practices and potential fraud -- providing individual physicians , in some cases , comparative information on how the physician varies from other physicians in the same specialty or in other ways . a physician education effort based on efficiency profiling would therefore not be a foreign concept in medicare . for example , cms could provide physicians a report that compares their practice 's efficiency with that of their peers , enabling physicians to see whether their practice style is outside the norm . as for implementing other strategies to encourage efficiency , such as the use of certain financial incentives , cms would likely need additional legislative authority . cms agreed with the need to measure physician resource use in medicare but raised concerns about the costs involved in reporting the results and was silent on other strategies discussed beyond physician education . gao concurs that resource use measurement and reporting activities would require adequate funding ; however , gao is concerned that efforts to achieve efficiency that rely solely on physician education without financial or other incentives for physicians to curb inefficiencies will be suboptimal .
key practices of effective performance management for the senior executive service ( ses ) include the linkage or `` line of sight '' between individual performance and organizational success , the importance of linking pay to individual and organizational performance , and the need to make meaningful distinctions in performance . gao identified certain principles for executive pay plans that should be considered to attract and retain the quality and quantity of executive leadership necessary to address 21st century challenges , including that they be sensitive to hiring and retention trends ; reflect knowledge , skills , and contributions ; and be competitive . this testimony focuses on the department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) process for awarding bonuses to ses members , the amount and percentage of bonuses awarded for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 based on data reported by va , and the office of personnel management 's ( opm ) and the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) roles in certifying federal agencies ses performance appraisal systems . gao analyzed va 's policies and procedures for awarding bonuses and data provided by va on the amount and percentages of bonuses and interviewed knowledgeable va officials . information on opm 's and omb 's certification process was based on our 2007 report on opm 's capacity to lead and implement reform va requires that each senior executive have an executive performance plan or contract in place for the appraisal year that reflects measures that balance organization results with customer satisfaction , employee perspectives , and other appropriate measures . va uses four performance review boards ( prb ) to review and make recommendations on ses ratings , awards , and pay adjustments based on these performance plans . va 's secretary appoints members of three of the four boards on the basis of the position held within the agency , and consideration is given to those positions where the holder would have knowledge about the broadest group of executives . members of the fourth board are appointed by va 's inspector general . va 's prbs vary in size , composition , and number of ses members considered for bonuses , and each prb , within the scope of va 's policies , develops its own procedures and criteria for making bonus recommendations . according to va policy , bonuses are generally awarded only to those rated outstanding or excellent and who have demonstrated significant individual and organizational achievements during the appraisal period . according to data reported by opm , in fiscal year 2005 , va awarded higher bonus amounts to its career ses than any other cabinet - level department ; however , according to opm 's data , six other cabinet - level departments awarded bonuses to a higher percentage of their career ses . opm and omb evaluate agencies ' ses performance appraisal systems against nine certification criteria jointly developed by the two agencies and determine that agencies merit full , provisional , or no certification . va has been granted provisional certification in each of the years 2004 through 2006. our review of va 's requirements for ses performance plans as represented in both its 2006 submission and 2007 draft submission to opm show that va made changes to the requirements for its performance plans to reflect greater emphasis on measurable results .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) is responsible for addressing the threat of nuclear smuggling . radiation detection portal monitors are key elements in our national defenses against such threats . dhs has sponsored r & d and testing activities to develop a `` next generation '' portal monitor , known as the advanced spectroscopic portal monitor . however , each one costs 6 times more than a current portal monitor . in march 2006 , we recommended that dhs conduct a cost - benefit analysis to determine whether the new portal monitors are worth the additional cost . in june 2006 , dhs issued its analysis . in october 2006 , we issued our report that assessed the dhs study . gao 's statement , based on our october 2006 report , addresses whether dhs 's cost - benefit analysis provides an adequate basis for its decision to purchase and deploy the next generation portal monitors . dhs 's cost - benefit analysis does not provide a sound analytical basis for its decision to purchase and deploy the new portal monitor technology . our review of the analysis determined that it had the following problems . regarding the performance of the portal monitors : instead of using the results of its own portal monitor tests conducted in 2005 , dhs assumed that the new portal monitor technology would correctly detect and identify highly enriched uranium ( heu ) 95 percent of the time -- a performance level that far exceeds the new technology 's current capabilities . to determine the performance of the current generation of portal monitors in detecting heu , dhs used data from limited tests carried out in 2004 that test officials concluded were unreliable for such purposes . dhs 's analysis of the new technology portal monitors was incomplete because the analysis focused on identifying heu , but did not fully consider how well the new portal monitor technology could correctly detect or identify other dangerous radiological or nuclear materials . regarding cost estimates : in comparing the costs of the new and current technologies , the procurement costs of the current generation portal monitors were highly inflated because dhs assumed a unit cost of about $ 131,000 . however , the contract price at the time of the analysis was about $ 55,000 . according to officials who manage the contract , it was to expire and they expected portal monitor prices to increase , but not nearly as much as dhs assumed . dhs stated that the primary benefit of deploying the new portal monitors is reducing unnecessary secondary inspections . however , dhs 's analysis does not fully estimate today 's baseline costs for secondary inspections , which makes it impossible to determine whether the use of the new portal monitors as currently planned , will result in significant cost savings for these inspections . the new portal monitor contract price has exceeded dhs 's total cost estimate by about $ 200 million . the cost - benefit analysis shows the total cost for deploying both current and new portal monitors to be about $ 1 billion . however , in july 2006 , dhs announced that it had awarded contracts to develop and purchase up to $ 1.2 billion worth of the new portal monitors over 5 years . dhs 's cost - benefit analysis omitted many factors that could affect the cost of new portal monitors , such as understating the life - cycle costs for operating and maintaining the equipment over time . for these reasons , dhs 's cost - benefit analysis does not meet the intent of our march 2006 report recommendation to fully assess the costs and benefits before purchasing any new equipment .
los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) is one of three national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) laboratories that designs and develops nuclear weapons for the u.s. stockpile . lanl employees rely on sensitive and classified information and assets that are protected at different levels , depending on the risks posed if they were lost , stolen , or otherwise compromised . however , lanl has experienced several significant security breaches during the past decade . this testimony provides gao 's views on physical security at lanl , as discussed in los alamos national laboratory : long - term strategies needed to improve security and management oversight , gao - 08-694 ( june 13 , 2008 ) ; preliminary observations on physical security at lawrence livermore national laboratory ; and views on cyber security at lanl as discussed in information security : actions needed to better protect los alamos national laboratory 's unclassified computer network , gao - 08-1001 ( sept. 9 , 2008 ) . to conduct this work , gao analyzed data , reviewed policies and procedures , interviewed laboratory officials , and conducted site visits to the two laboratories . physical security at lanl is in a period of significant improvement , and lanl is implementing over two dozen initiatives to better protect its classified assets . however , while lanl 's current initiatives address many physical security problems previously identified in external security evaluations , other significant security problems have received insufficient attention . in addition , the management approaches that lanl and nnsa intend to use to sustain security improvements over the long term are in the early stages of development or contain weaknesses . furthermore , lanl 's ability to sustain its improved physical security posture is unproven because the laboratory appears not to have done so after a significant security incident in 2004 , with another significant security breach in 2006 , and nnsa 's los alamos site office -- which is responsible for overseeing security at lanl -- may not have enough staff or the proper training to execute a fully effective security oversight program . gao 's report made recommendations to help further improve physical security at lanl and ensure that these improvements are sustained over the long term . as a result of poor performance on an april 2008 physical security evaluation conducted by the department of energy 's ( doe ) office of independent oversight , gao is reviewing physical security at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( livermore ) . gao 's preliminary observations are that livermore appears to experience difficulties similar to lanl 's in sustaining security performance . furthermore , it appears that nnsa has not always provided effective oversight of livermore . specifically , an nnsa security survey conducted only 6 months prior to the april 2008 doe evaluation gave livermore the highest possible rating on its security program 's performance . these results differ markedly from those documented by doe 's office of independent oversight . lanl has implemented measures to enhance cyber security , but weaknesses remain in protecting information on its unclassified network . this network possesses sensitive information such as unclassified controlled nuclear information , export control information , and personally identifiable information about lanl employees . gao found vulnerabilities in critical areas , including identifying and authenticating users , encrypting sensitive information , and monitoring and auditing security policy compliance . a key reason for these information security weaknesses is that the laboratory has not fully implemented an information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained . furthermore , deficiencies in lanl 's policies and procedures raise additional concern , particularly with respect to foreign nationals ' accessing the network from the laboratory and remotely . finally , lanl cyber security officials told gao that funding to address some of their security concerns with the laboratory 's unclassified network has been inadequate . however , nnsa officials asserted that lanl had not adequately justified its requests for additional funds . gao made 52 recommendations to help strengthen lanl 's information security program and controls over the unclassified network .
six years after the attack on the world trade center ( wtc ) , concerns persist about health effects experienced by wtc responders and the availability of health care services for those affected . several federally funded programs provide screening , monitoring , or treatment services to responders . gao has previously reported on the progress made and implementation problems faced by these wtc health programs . this testimony is based primarily on gao 's testimony , september 11 : improvements needed in availability of health screening and monitoring services for responders ( gao - 07-1229t , sept. 10 , 2007 ) , which updated gao 's report , september 11 : hhs needs to ensure the availability of health screening and monitoring for all responders ( gao - 07-892 , july 23 , 2007 ) . in this testimony , gao discusses efforts by the centers for disease control and prevention 's national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) to provide services for nonfederal responders residing outside the new york city ( nyc ) area . for the july 2007 report , gao reviewed program documents and interviewed department of health and human services ( hhs ) officials , grantees , and others . gao updated selected information in august and september 2007 and conducted work for this statement in january 2008. in july 2007 , following a reexamination of the status of the wtc health programs , gao recommended that the secretary of hhs take expeditious action to ensure that health screening and monitoring services are available to all people who responded to the wtc attack , regardless of where they reside . as of january 2008 , the department has not responded to this recommendation . as gao testified in september 2007 , niosh has not ensured the availability of screening and monitoring services for nonfederal responders residing outside the nyc area , although it has taken steps toward expanding the availability of these services . in late 2002 , niosh arranged for a network of occupational health clinics to provide screening services . this effort ended in july 2004 , and until june 2005 niosh did not fund screening or monitoring services for nonfederal responders outside the nyc area . in june 2005 , niosh funded the mount sinai school of medicine data and coordination center ( dcc ) to provide screening and monitoring services ; however , dcc had difficulty establishing a nationwide network of providers and contracted with only 10 clinics in seven states . in 2006 , niosh began to explore other options for providing these services , and in 2007 it took steps toward expanding the provider network .
annual appropriations to prepare for and respond to wildland fires have increased substantially over the past decade , in recent years totaling about $ 3 billion . the forest service within the department of agriculture and four agencies within the department of the interior ( interior ) are responsible for responding to wildland fires on federal lands . gao determined what steps federal agencies have taken to address key operational areas that could help contain the costs of preparing for and responding to wildland fires and improve their management of their cost - containment efforts . this testimony is based on gao 's june 2007 report , wildland fire management : lack of clear goals or a strategy hinders federal agencies ' efforts to contain the costs of fighting fires ( gao - 07-655 ) . the forest service and interior agencies have initiated a number of steps to address key operational areas previously identified as needing improvement to help federal agencies contain wildland fire costs , but the effects on containing costs are unknown , in part because many of these steps are not yet complete . first , federal firefighting agencies are developing a system to help them better identify and set priorities for lands needing treatment to reduce fuels , but they have yet to decide how they will keep data in the system current . second , federal agencies have taken some steps to improve how they acquire and use personnel , equipment , and other firefighting assets -- such as implementing a computerized system to more efficiently dispatch and track available firefighting assets -- but have not yet completed the more fundamental step of determining the appropriate type and quantity of firefighting assets needed for the fire season . third , the agencies have clarified certain policies and are improving analytical tools that assist officials in identifying and implementing an appropriate response to a given fire , but several other policies limit the agencies ' use of less aggressive firefighting strategies , which typically cost less . fourth , federal agencies , working with nonfederal entities , have recently taken steps to clarify guidance to better ensure that firefighting costs are shared consistently for fires that threaten both federal and nonfederal lands and resources , but it is unclear how the agencies will ensure that this guidance is followed . the agencies have also taken steps to address previously identified weaknesses in their management of cost - containment efforts , but they have neither clearly defined their cost - containment goals and objectives nor developed a strategy for achieving them -- steps that are fundamental to sound program management . although the agencies have established a broad goal of suppressing wildland fires at minimum cost -- considering firefighter and public safety and resources and structures to be protected -- they have no defined criteria by which to weigh the relative importance of these often - competing priorities . as a result , according to agency officials and reports , officials in the field lack a clear understanding of the relative importance the agencies ' leadership places on containing costs and , therefore , are likely to select firefighting strategies without due consideration of the costs of suppression . the agencies have also yet to develop a vision of how the various cost - containment steps they are taking relate to one another or to determine the extent to which these steps will be effective . the agencies are working to develop a better cost - containment performance measure , but the measure may take a number of years to fully refine . finally , the agencies have taken , or are beginning to take , steps to improve their oversight and increase accountability -- such as requiring agency officials to evaluate firefighting teams according to how well they contained costs -- although the extent to which these steps will assist the agencies in containing costs is unknown .
federal and other decision makers have had a renewed interest in how high speed rail might fit into the national transportation system and address increasing mobility constraints on highways and at airports due to congestion . gao was asked to review the factors affecting the economic viability -- meaning whether total social benefits offset or justify total social costs -- of high speed rail projects , including difficulties in determining the economic viability of proposed projects ; the challenges in developing and financing high speed rail systems ; and the federal role in the potential development of u.s. high speed rail systems . gao reviewed federal legislation ; interviewed federal , state , local , and private sector officials , as well as u.s. project sponsors ; and reviewed high speed rail development in france , japan , and spain . factors affecting the economic viability of high speed rail lines include the level of expected riders , costs , and public benefits ( i.e . , benefits to non - riders and the nation as a whole from such things as reduced congestion ) , which are influenced by a line 's corridor and service characteristics . high speed rail tends to attract riders in dense , highly populated corridors , especially where there is congestion on existing transportation modes . costs largely hinge on the availability of rail right - of - way and on a corridor 's terrain . to stay within financial or other constraints , project sponsors typically make trade - offs between cost and service characteristics . while some u.s. corridors have characteristics that suggest economic viability , uncertainty associated with rider and cost estimates and the valuation of public benefits makes it difficult to make such determinations on individual proposals . research on rider and cost forecasts has shown they are often optimistic , and the extent that u.s. sponsors quantify and value public benefits varies . once projects are deemed economically viable , project sponsors face the challenging tasks of securing the up - front investment for construction costs and sustaining public and political support and stakeholder consensus . in the three countries gao visited , the central government generally funded the majority of the up - front costs of high speed rail lines . by contrast , federal funding for high speed rail has been derived from general revenues , not from trust funds or other dedicated funding sources . consequently , high speed rail projects must compete with other nontransportation demands on federal funds ( e.g . , national defense or health care ) as opposed to being compared with other alternative transportation investments in a corridor . available federal loan programs can support only a fraction of potential high speed rail project costs . without substantial public sector commitment , private sector participation is difficult to secure . the challenge of sustaining public support and stakeholder consensus is compounded by long project lead times , by numerous stakeholders , and by the absence of an established institutional framework . the recently enacted passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 will likely increase the federal role in the development of high speed rail , as will the newly enacted american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009. in the united states , federal involvement with high speed rail to date has been limited . the national rail plan required by the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2008 is an opportunity to identify the vision and goals for u.s. high speed rail and how it fits into the national transportation system , an exercise that has largely remained incomplete . accountability can be enhanced by tying the specific , measurable goals required by the act to performance and accountability measures . in developing analytical tools to apply to the act 's project selection criteria , it will be important to address optimistic rider and cost forecasts and varied public benefits analyses .
the united states enacted legislation in may 2008 applying federal immigration law to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands ( cnmi ) subject to a transition period . the cnmi is subject to most u.s. laws but has administered its own immigration system , including admitting foreign workers , tourists , and foreign investors . the secretary of homeland security , in consultation with the secretaries of the interior , labor , and state , and the attorney general , has the responsibility to establish a transition program . gao was asked to review how the legislation 's implementation may affect the cnmi economy , in particular the cnmi 's labor market , including foreign workers ; tourism sector ; and foreign investment . this report is based on gao 's march 2008 report ( gao - 08-466 ) and analysis of data on the cnmi 's labor market , tourism sector , and foreign investment . the potential impact on the cnmi 's labor market of the recent legislation applying u.s. immigration law will largely depend on decisions that the u.s. departments of homeland security ( dhs ) and labor ( dol ) make in implementing a required permit program for foreign workers . the interaction of dhs and dol decisions about , respectively , the number of permits to allocate annually and whether and when to extend the permit program past 2014 will significantly affect employers ' access to foreign workers . however , federal agencies have not yet identified an interagency process to coordinate such decisions . further , the agencies may have difficulty obtaining relevant data on the cnmi labor market . given foreign workers ' prominence in key cnmi industries , any substantial and rapid decline in permits for foreign workers would have a negative effect on the cnmi economy . however , federal agencies may reduce permits more modestly , resulting in minimal effects on the economy . at the same time , continuing declines in the garment industry , challenges to the tourism industry , and the scheduled increases in the minimum wage may reduce demand for foreign workers , lessening any potential adverse impact of the legislation on the economy . although the legislation and the cnmi government have stated goals of preparing cnmi residents to replace foreign workers , factors such as the limited number of available cnmi residents may impede these efforts ' effectiveness . any impact of the recent legislation on the cnmi 's tourism sector will depend largely on federal regulations specifying the countries to be included in a joint cnmi - guam visa waiver program required by the legislation . for countries likely to be included in this program , such as japan and south korea , the impact is likely to be minimal . for countries that may not be part of the joint visa waiver program , possibly including china and russia , applying for a visa from u.s. embassies or consulates will likely be more costly and more time - consuming than obtaining a visitor entry permit under cnmi immigration law . to the extent that any increase in the cost and time required to obtain a visa discourages tourists from visiting the cnmi , the legislation could negatively affect cnmi tourism . the recent legislation 's impact on cnmi foreign investment will depend in part on dhs decisions regarding the application of u.s. nonimmigrant treaty investor status -- `` grandfathering '' -- for investors with cnmi foreign investor entry permits . however , lack of data on foreign investment in the cnmi makes it difficult to assess the likely impact of these decisions and may hamper dhs 's ability to make informed decisions . because long - term business entry permits account for a large proportion of cnmi foreign investor entry permits , more cnmi foreign investors will be grandfathered if dhs applies the status to these permit holders . any impact on foreign investment in the cnmi will likely affect the labor market and tourism sector , and any impact on the labor market or tourism sector may also affect foreign investment .
the national wildlife refuge system , which is administered by the fish and wildlife service in the department of the interior , comprises 585 refuges on more than 96 million acres of land and water that preserve habitat for waterfowl and other migratory birds , threatened and endangered species , and other wildlife . refuges also provide wildlife - related activities such as hunting and fishing to nearly 40 million visitors every year . gao was asked to describe changing factors that the refuge system experienced from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 , including funding and staffing changes , and examine how habitat management and visitor services changed during this period . we surveyed all refuges ; visited 19 refuges in 4 regions ; and interviewed refuge , regional , and national officials . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of the interior made technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate . gao is not making recommendations in this report . between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 , the refuge system experienced funding and staffing level fluctuations , the introduction of several new policy initiatives , and the increased influence of external factors such as extreme weather that threaten wildlife habitat and visitor infrastructure . although core funding -- measured as obligations for refuge operations , maintenance , and fire management -- increased each year , inflation - adjusted core funding peaked in fiscal year 2003 at about $ 391 million -- 6.8 percent above fiscal year 2002 funding . inflation - adjusted core funding ended the period 2.3 percent below peak levels , but 4.3 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels by fiscal year 2007. core refuge staffing levels peaked in fiscal year 2004 at 3,610 full - time equivalents -- 10.0 percent above the fiscal year 2002 level -- and then declined more slowly than funding levels . by fiscal year 2007 , staffing levels fell to 4.0 percent below peak levels , but 5.5 percent above fiscal year 2002 levels . through fiscal year 2007 , the number of permanent employees utilized by the refuge system declined to 7.5 percent below peak levels . during this period , refuge system officials initiated new policies that : reduced staff positions and reallocated funds and staff among refuges to better align staff levels with funding ; required refuge staff to focus on a legislative mandate to complete refuge conservation plans by 2012 ; shifted to constructing a larger number of smaller visitor structures , such as informational kiosks , and fewer large visitor centers to spread visitor service funds across more refuges ; increased the number of full - time law enforcement officers and their associated training and experience requirements ; and resulted in additional administrative work . during this period , external factors that complicate refuge staffs ' ability to protect and restore habitat quality also increased , including severe storms and development around refuges . our survey showed that the quality of habitat management and visitor service programs varied across refuges during our study period . habitat conditions for key types of species improved about two times more often than they worsened , but between 7 percent and 20 percent of habitats were of poor quality in 2007. certain habitat problems increased at more than half of refuges during this period , and managers reported that they increased the time spent on certain habitat management activities , such as addressing invasive plants , despite declining staffing levels . however , several managers we interviewed told us that staff were working longer hours without extra pay to get work done , and managers expressed concern about their ability to sustain habitat conditions . while the quality of four key visitor service programs was reported to be stable or improving between fiscal years 2002 and 2007 at the vast majority of refuges , the other two key programs -- environmental education and interpretation -- were considered poor quality at one - third of refuges in 2007. changes in the time spent on visitor services varied considerably across refuges , and managers noted that visitor services generally are cut before habitat management activities when resources are limited . managers are concerned about their ability to provide high - quality visitor services in the future given staffing and funding constraints .
prescription drug abuse is a growing public health problem . in particular , methadone - associated overdose deaths -- those in which methadone may have caused or contributed to the death -- have risen sharply . before the late 1990s , methadone was used mainly to treat opioid addiction but has since been increasingly prescribed to manage pain . taken too often , in too high a dose , or with other drugs or alcohol , methadone can cause serious side effects and death . methadone - associated overdose deaths can occur under several different scenarios , including improper dosing levels by practitioners , misuse by patients who may combine methadone with other drugs , or abuse -- using the drug for nontherapeutic purposes . this report examines the regulation of methadone , factors that have contributed to the increase in methadone - associated overdose deaths , and steps taken to prevent methadone - associated overdose deaths . gao reviewed documents , laws and regulations , data , and research from relevant state and federal agencies , including the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) and the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) . gao also interviewed federal officials , officials in five selected states , officials from professional associations and advocacy groups , and experts in pain management , addiction treatment , and forensic sciences . methadone is regulated as a controlled substance , under federal and state laws and regulations , when used for pain management and addiction treatment . when methadone is used for pain management , it is regulated under federal and state laws and regulations that apply to controlled substances generally and that do not impose requirements unique to methadone . for addiction treatment , however , federal and state laws and regulations impose additional requirements that are specific to the use of methadone in opioid treatment programs ( otp ) , which treat and rehabilitate people addicted to heroin or other opioids . gao , however , only reviewed relevant state laws and regulations for five selected states . although information on methadone - associated overdose deaths is limited , available data suggest that methadone 's growing use for pain management has made more of the drug available , thus contributing to the rise in methadone - associated overdose deaths . methadone prescriptions for pain management grew from about 531,000 in 1998 to about 4.1 million in 2006- - nearly eightfold . methadone has unique pharmacological properties that make it different from other opioids , and as a result , a lack of knowledge about methadone among practitioners and patients has been identified as a factor contributing to these deaths . dea data suggest that abuse of methadone diverted from its intended purpose has also contributed to the rise in overdose deaths as the number of methadone drug items seized by law enforcement and analyzed in forensic laboratories increased 262 percent , from 2,865 in 2001 to 10,361 in 2007. nonetheless , data and research from five states gao reviewed suggest that the specific circumstances of these deaths are variable because of drug combinations and unknown sources of methadone . gao identified selected efforts to prevent methadone abuse and overdose deaths that focused on education , safety , and monitoring . for example , to educate practitioners about using methadone for pain management and addiction treatment , samhsa is establishing a physician clinical support system for methadone . to improve safety , in 2006 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) approved a revised label for methadone tablets that included new safety information regarding the use of methadone for pain and modified dosage instructions for those beginning pain management treatment with methadone . additionally , to prevent diversion and abuse of controlled substances such as methadone , dea reports that as of february 2009 , 31 states have established prescription monitoring programs . some officials and experts cautioned that any prevention efforts focused on methadone alone might unintentionally shift similar problems to a different drug . gao received comments from the department of health and human services stating that fda recently notified manufacturers of certain opioid drug products , such as methadone , that they must take certain steps to ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks . the department of justice provided gao with technical comments .
in march 2004 , the office of management and budget ( omb ) launched the financial management line of business ( fmlob ) initiative , in part , to reduce the cost and improve the quality and performance of federal financial management systems by leveraging shared service solutions and implementing other reforms . in march 2006 , gao reported that omb 's approach did not fully integrate certain fundamental system implementation - related concepts and recommended omb take specific actions . this report discusses omb 's progress in addressing gao 's prior fmlob recommendations and implementation challenges and the effectiveness of omb 's monitoring of financial management system modernization projects and their costs . gao 's methodology included reviewing omb 's fmlob - related guidance and reports and interviewing omb and financial systems integration office ( fsio ) staff . omb has made progress toward implementing the fmlob initiative . in march 2006 , gao recommended that omb place a high priority on fully integrating four key concepts into its approach . as shown in the table , omb has completed actions to fully address 5 of gao 's 18 recommendations . although omb has made progress toward completing the remaining 13 recommendations , extensive work remains before the goals of the fmlob initiative are achieved . for example , omb has yet to finalize a financial management system concept of operations , the first and foremost critical building block on which the remaining three concepts will be built . in addition , development of a migration timeline reflecting agencies ' commitment for migrating to shared service providers has not yet been completed . further , agencies are not required to consider migrating until the next major release of their core financial system and much work remains before the software used by shared service providers will incorporate the standard business processes currently under development . accordingly , fsio officials stated it could take 15 years or more before software that incorporates these standard business processes is in use governmentwide . we recognize that the fmlob initiative represents a long - term effort ; however , expediting efforts to address our prior recommendations could help achieve more effective and timely benefits . until omb fully integrates the four key concepts into its approach , the extent to which fmlob goals will be achieved is uncertain . the chief financial officers act of 1990 and other information technology ( it ) reform legislation contain requirements related to omb 's oversight of agency financial management systems modernization and other it projects . achieving fmlob goals requires effective omb oversight of agency modernization projects , but omb has yet to fully address gao 's previously reported oversight - related recommendations such as taking actions to define and ensure that agencies effectively implement disciplined processes and develop a more structured review of agency efforts . in addition , omb does not obtain and report complete and accurate data concerning agencies ' spending on financial management system modernization projects . the lack of sufficient information and processes to effectively monitor agency modernization efforts and their costs limits omb 's ability to evaluate and help reduce the risks associated with financial management system implementations as well as achieve fmlob goals .
for more than two decades , the u.s. government has been broadcasting to cuba to break the cuban government 's information blockade and promote democracy in cuba . over this period , questions have been raised regarding the quality and effectiveness of these broadcasts . gao was asked to examine the office of cuba broadcasting 's ( ocb ) broadcasting approach and what is known about its audience ; how the broadcasting board of governors ( bbg ) -- which oversees u.s. government broadcasting -- and ocb ensure compliance with journalistic principles ; steps taken to ensure adherence to domestic and international broadcasting laws , agreements , and standards ; and steps bbg and ocb have taken to address management challenges . gao analyzed documentation related to strategic planning , audience research , oversight , and operations and interviewed officials from bbg , bbg 's international broadcasting bureau ( ibb ) , ocb , state , and other agencies . ocb broadcasts radio and tv marti through multiple transmission methodsthat face varying levels of jamming by the cuban government . while there are no nationally representative data and some surveys of recent cuban emigres suggest a larger audience , the best available research suggests that radio and tv marti 's audience is small . specifically , less than 2 percent of respondents to telephone surveys since 2003 reported tuning in to radio or tv marti during the past week . despite the importance of audience research , we found minimal sharing of such research among available sources . because of limitations in the audience research data , decisionmakers lack basic information to help assess the relative success or return on investment from each of ocb 's transmission methods . bbg 's ibb -- which directly oversees ocb -- has established an annual program review process that serves as the main mechanism for assessing ocb 's compliance with journalistic standards . while ibb officials report that the quality of ocb programming has improved in recent years , ibb reviews since 2003 have recommended improving adherence to certain journalistic standards , particularly in the areas of balance and objectivity . ibb 's process provides useful feedback , but we found weaknesses such as limited training and operational guidance for staff conducting the reviews . ocb and ibb have taken steps to ensure that u.s. broadcasting adheres to relevant laws and standards , but some concerns remain . to comply with u.s. law , they have taken steps to minimize the domestic dissemination of ocb programming ; however , ocb broadcasts reach u.s. audiences in several ways , such as through the internet . in addition , a commercial tv station contracted to broadcast ocb programming showed some inappropriate advertisements during ocb programs . furthermore , an international body found that ocb 's tv broadcasts cause harmful interference to cuban broadcasts , but the u.s. government has not taken steps to address this issue . despite some efforts by bbg and ocb , oversight entities have identified problems such as poor communication by ocb management and low employee morale . for example , ocb lacks formal mechanisms for communicating with or obtaining information from employees .
the department of defense ( dod ) personnel security clearance program has been on gao 's high - risk list since 2005 , due to delays in the process and incomplete documentation . the office of personnel management ( opm ) conducts most of dod 's clearance investigations , which dod adjudicators use to make clearance decisions . the deputy director for management at the office of management and budget ( omb ) chairs a performance accountability council that is responsible for reforming the clearance process . conducted under the authority of the comptroller general , gao 's report addresses the reporting on timeliness for dod clearances , documentation completeness for making initial top - secret clearance decisions for dod personnel , and reporting on the quality of the clearance process . to assess these issues , gao analyzed data on most dod clearances granted in fiscal year 2008 , randomly sampled and analyzed 100 opm investigative reports and dod adjudicative files for clearances granted in july 2008 , and analyzed 2006-09 executive branch annual clearance reports . dod and opm met statutory timeliness requirements for personnel security clearances in fiscal year 2008 , but the executive branch 's 2009 required report to congress did not reflect the full range of time to make all initial clearance decisions . currently , 80 percent of initial clearance decisions are to be made within 120 days , on average , and by december 2009 , a plan is to be implemented in which , to the extent practical , 90 percent of initial clearance decisions are made within 60 days , on average . under both requirements , the executive branch can exclude the slowest percent , and then report on an average of the remaining clearances . the most recent report stated that the average time to complete the fastest 90 percent of initial clearances for military and dod civilians in fiscal year 2008 was 124 days , on average . however , without taking averages or excluding the slowest clearances , gao analyzed 100 percent of initial clearances granted in 2008 and found that 39 percent still took more than 120 days . the absence of comprehensive reporting limits full visibility over the timeliness of initial clearance decisions . with respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in july 2008 , documentation was incomplete for most opm investigative reports and some dod adjudicative files . gao independently estimated that 87 percent of about 3,500 investigative reports that adjudicators used to make clearance decisions were missing required documentation , and the documentation most often missing was employment verification . although dod leadership asserted that adjudicators follow a risk - managed approach , dod has not issued formal guidance clarifying if and under what circumstances adjudicators can adjudicate incomplete investigative reports . for dod adjudicative files , gao estimated that 22 percent were missing required documentation of the rationale for granting clearances to applicants with security concerns , and the documentation most often missing was related to foreign influence . neither opm nor dod measures the completeness of its investigative reports or adjudicative files . as a result , both are limited in their ability to explain the extent or the reasons why some documents are incomplete . incomplete documentation may lead to increases in both the time needed to complete the clearance process and in overall process costs and may reduce the assurance that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent dod from granting clearances to untrustworthy individuals . the executive branch 's annual reports to congress on the personnel security clearance process have provided decision makers with limited data on quality . the 2009 report did not provide any data on quality but , unlike previous reports , identified quality metrics that the executive branch proposes to collect . gao has stated that timeliness alone does not provide a complete picture of the clearance process and emphasized that attention to quality could increase reciprocity -- accepting another federal entity 's clearances . the executive branch , though not required to include information on quality in its annual reports , has latitude to report appropriate information and has missed opportunities to make the clearance process transparent to congress .
the federal workforce , like the nation 's workforce as a whole , is aging , and increasingly large percentages are becoming eligible to retire . eventually baby boomers will leave the workforce and when they do , they will leave behind gaps in leadership , skills , and knowledge due to the slower - growing pool of younger workers . gao and others have emphasized the need for federal agencies to hire and retain older workers to help address these shortages . building upon earlier testimony , gao was asked to examine age and retirement eligibility trends of the current federal workforce and the extent to which agencies hire and retain older workers ; workforce challenges selected agencies face and the strategies they use to hire and retain older workers ; and actions taken by the office of personnel management ( opm ) to help agencies hire and retain experienced workers . to address these questions , gao analyzed data from opm 's central personal data file , interviewed officials at three agencies with high proportions of workers eligible to retire , and identified agencies ' promising practices to hire and retain older workers . what gao recommends the proportion of federal employees eligible to retire is growing . while this proportion varies across agencies , in four agencies -- the agency for international development ( usaid ) , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the small business administration , and the department of transportation -- 46 percent of the workforce will be eligible to retire by 2012 , well above the governmentwide average of 33 percent . while these eligibility rates suggest that many will retire , the federal government has historically enjoyed relatively high retention rates , with 40 percent or more of federal employees remaining in the workforce for at least 5 years after becoming eligible . beyond retaining older workers , in fiscal year 2007 , federal agencies hired almost 14,000 new workers who were 55 years of age or older and brought back about 5,400 federal retirees to address workforce needs . the increasing numbers of retirement - eligible federal workers present challenges and opportunities . the three agencies we reviewed ( hud , ssa , and usaid ) share common challenges . all have large proportions of employees nearing retirement , and according to officials , due to past hiring freezes all have relatively few midlevel staff to help pass down knowledge and skills to less experienced employees . officials from all three agencies also told us that they have difficulty attracting qualified staff with specialized skills . to address these challenges , the three agencies rely on older workers in different ways . usaid brings back its knowledgeable and skilled retirees as contractors to fill short - term job assignments and to help train and develop the agency 's growing number of newly hired staff . ssa uses complex statistical models to project potential retirements in mission critical occupations and uses these data to develop recruitment efforts targeted at a broad pool of candidates , including older workers . while all three agencies rely on older workers to pass down knowledge and skills to junior staff , hud officials told us this is the primary way they involve older workers , due in part to the agency 's focus on recruiting entry - level staff . in addition , some federal agencies have developed practices that other agencies might find useful in tapping older workers to meet short - term needs . for example , the department of state has developed databases to match interested retirees with short - term assignments requiring particular skills . to help agencies hire and retain an experienced workforce , opm provides guidance , including support tools and training , and has taken steps to address areas of concern to older workers . for example , opm has initiated actions to streamline the federal application process and to eliminate barriers that deter some federal retirees from returning to federal service or from working part - time at the end of their careers . however , although some federal agencies have developed strategies that could be used effectively by other agencies to hire and retain experienced workers to meet workforce needs , this information is not widely available . and , while opm has other methods available -- such as its human capital and electronic government practices web sites -- that could be used to efficiently package and broadly disseminate this information to a much larger audience , it currently has no plans to do so .
institutions that serve large proportions of low - income and minority students may receive funding under titles iii and v of the higher education act . in fiscal year 2008 , $ 667 million in grants were awarded to over 500 institutions . gao was asked to determine the characteristics of institutions eligible to receive grants under titles iii and v and characteristics of students served ; any challenges grantees face , and how they spent title iii and v funds to address these challenges ; and the extent to which the department of education ( education ) monitors the financial and programmatic performance of grantees , and uses this information to target its technical assistance . to address these objectives , gao analyzed data from a representative sample of grant applications and annual performance reports for the entire population of fiscal year 2006 grantees . gao also interviewed officials from education and 27 grantee institutions , and conducted financial site visits at other 7 grantee institutions . twenty - eight percent of all 2-year and 4-year public and private , not - for - profit institutions are eligible to receive title iii and v grants . eligible institutions had fewer resources , including endowment holdings and revenue from tuition and fees , and lower per student spending on equipment than ineligible institutions . eligible institutions also served more students who were minority , low - income , and attended part - time . in their grant applications , title iii and v grantees reported challenges in all four grant focus areas : academic quality , student support , institutional management , and fiscal stability . grantees reported spending almost $ 385 million in fiscal year 2006 grant funds to address challenges in these areas , primarily to strengthen academic quality and student support services . specifically , grantees reported using 43 percent of grant funds on efforts designed to improve academic quality , such as using the latest technology in the classroom and improving academic space . efforts to improve student support services , including remedial courses , tutoring , and academic counseling represented about one - third of grantee expenditures . while nearly all grantees reported challenges related to strengthening institutional management and fiscal stability , expenditures in these areas represented less than one - quarter of all grant funds spent . since gao reported and made recommendations on the management of these programs in 2004 and 2007 , education has continued to take steps to improve monitoring , but many of its initiatives have not been completed . education has made recent progress in developing an electronic monitoring system and risk - based criteria to improve monitoring , but it discontinued the use of annual plans to guide its efforts . also , limited progress in addressing staff skill gaps and substantial declines in site visits to grantees has impeded education 's ability to adequately monitor grantees . because education lacks a comprehensive approach to target monitoring , it lacks assurance that grantees appropriately manage federal funds , increasing the potential for fraud , waste , or abuse . for example , gao identified more than $ 100,000 in questionable expenditures at one grantee institution , including student trips to locations such as resorts and amusement parks , and an airplane global positioning system . education provides limited technical assistance to grantees , but it has not developed a systematic approach that targets the needs of grantees . for example , some grantees told gao that education could strengthen grantee performance by sharing more information regarding common implementation challenges and successful projects . additionally , gao found that education 's ability to target technical assistance is limited because its current approach for obtaining feedback does not encourage candor , and it does not use the feedback it currently receives from grantees .
the department of defense ( dod ) has stewardship over an unprecedented amount of taxpayer money -- with about $ 546 billion in discretionary budget authority provided thus far in fiscal year 2008 , and total reported obligations of about $ 492 billion to support ongoing operations and activities related to the global war on terrorism from september 11 , 2001 , through september 2007. meanwhile , dod is solely responsible for 8 high - risk areas identified by gao and shares responsibility for another 7 high - risk areas . gao designated dod 's approach to business transformation as high risk in 2005. dod 's business systems modernization and financial management have appeared on the list since 1995. deficiencies in these areas adversely affect dod 's ability , among other things , to assess resource requirements ; control costs ; ensure accountability ; measure performance ; prevent waste , fraud , and abuse ; and address pressing management issues . based on previously issued gao reports and testimonies , this testimony focuses on the progress dod has made and the challenges that remain with respect to overall business transformation , business systems modernization , and financial management capabilities improvements . gao has made recommendations to improve dod 's business transformation efforts and dod 's institutional and program - specific management controls . dod has largely agreed with these recommendations . dod 's senior leadership has shown a commitment to transforming dod 's business operations and taken steps that have yielded progress in many respects , especially during the past two years . to sustain its efforts , dod still needs a strategic planning process and a comprehensive , integrated , and enterprisewide plan or set of plans to guide transformation and a full - time , term - based , senior management official to provide focused and sustained leadership . congress has clearly recognized the need for executive - level attention and , through the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 , has designated the deputy secretary of defense as dod 's chief management officer ( cmo ) , created a deputy cmo position , and designated a cmo for each military department . among other things , dod will need to clearly define roles and responsibilities , accountability , and performance expectations . however , dod still faces the challenge of ensuring that its cmo can give the position full - time focus and continuity of leadership . in that respect , gao continues to believe the cmo should be codified in statute as a separate position with the appropriate term to span administrations . to comply with legislative requirements aimed at improving business systems modernization , dod continues to update its business enterprise architecture and has established and begun to implement corporate investment review structures and processes . however , dod has not achieved the full intent of the legislative requirements . the business enterprise architecture updates are not complete enough to effectively and efficiently guide and constrain business system investments across all levels of dod . although dod issued a strategy for `` federating '' or extending its architecture to the dod components , the components ' architecture programs are not fully mature to support this . with respect to investment review structures and processes , dod lacks policies and procedures for aligning investment selection decisions and relevant corporate - and component - level guidance . for example , dod 's business systems investment policies and procedures do not link investment selection decisions with investment funding decisions . meanwhile , dod components continue to invest billions of dollars in thousands of new and existing business system programs . dod has taken steps towards developing and implementing a framework for improving its capability to provide timely , reliable , and relevant financial information for analysis , decisionmaking , and reporting . specifically , dod is defining and implementing a standard dod - wide financial management data structure and enterprise - level capabilities to facilitate reporting and comparison of financial data across dod . in 2007 , dod refined its strategy for achieving auditable financial statements , emphasizing verification and validation of sustained improvements and assessments of new systems to identify risks that , if not mitigated , may impede the achievement of clean financial statement audit opinions . while these efforts may improve the consistency and comparability of dod 's financial reports , a great deal of work to ensure the reliability of the data itself remains before financial management transformation will be achieved .
increasingly , the federal government relies on networks and partnerships to achieve its goals , and many of these involve nonprofit organizations . gao was asked to assess the mechanisms through which federal dollars flow to nonprofits and what is known about federal dollars flowing through them to nonprofit organizations in fiscal year 2006. to address these objectives , gao conducted a literature review of funding ; analyzed data from several sources , including the federal procurement data system -- next generation ( fpds - ng ) and the federal awards and assistance data system ( faads ) ; and analyzed nonprofit organizations ' roles in 19 federal programs . the federal government uses a variety of funding mechanisms to achieve national priorities through partnerships with nonprofit organizations , and the relationships are sometimes complex and multidirectional . nonprofit organizations receive federal grant and contract funds both directly and through other entities , such as states , for performing activities or providing services to particular beneficiaries . federal funds paid to nonprofit organizations as fees for services follow a somewhat more complex path . credit through loan and loan guarantee mechanisms facilitate nonprofit organizations ' access to capital . similarly , some tax policies result in benefits to nonprofit organizations by either reducing their costs or increasing their revenues . with direct federal grants and contracts , and with some loans and loan guarantees , federal agencies generally select the nonprofit participant , directly control the amount of funding provided , and monitor nonprofit performance . with other mechanisms , such as tax expenditures and fee - for - service programs , the federal government sets criteria for acceptable recipients but does not directly select or monitor nonprofit performance . due to limitations and reliability concerns with tracking systems ' data , the data presently collected provide an incomplete , unreliable picture of the federal government 's funds reaching the nonprofit sector through various mechanisms , although they suggest these funds were significant . no central source tracks federal funds passed through an initial recipient , such as a state , and the nonprofit status of recipients was not reliably identified in fpds - ng or faads . factors contributing to data limitations include the nonprofit status of recipients being self - reported and no consistent definition of nonprofit across data systems . the development of a system to report funding through subawards , currently underway , may enable more complete estimates of funding to the sector in the future . however , until the accuracy of nonprofit status is improved , accurately determining the extent of federal funds reaching the sector is not possible , leaving policy makers without a clear understanding of the extent of funding to , and importance of , key partners in delivering federal programs and services . funding data sources identified the following as the approximate amounts of federal funds flowing to nonprofits in 2006 under different mechanisms , although most sources did not reliably classify nonprofit status of recipients : $ 135 billion in fee - for - service payments under medicare ; $ 10 billion in other types of fee - for - service payments ; $ 25 billion in grants paid directly to nonprofits ; $ 10 billion paid directly to nonprofits for contracts ; and $ 55 billion in federal funds paid to nonprofits by states from two grant programs , including medicaid . ( gao could not assess other programs . ) . in addition , approximately $ 2.5 billion in loan guarantees and $ 450 million in loans were issued to nonprofits , and approximately $ 50 billion in federal tax revenues were foregone due to tax expenditures related to nonprofits .
federal law restricts noncitizens ' access to public benefits , including temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , medicaid , the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , and supplemental security income ( ssi ) . further , when noncitizens who legally reside in this country through sponsorship of a family member apply for these benefits , they are subject to sponsor deeming , which requires benefit agencies to combine noncitizens ' incomes with those of their sponsors to determine eligibility . sponsors are also financially liable for benefits paid to the noncitizen , and benefit agencies must seek repayment for these costs . gao was asked to analyze what is known about the size of the noncitizen population potentially affected by the sponsor deeming requirements for tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi ; to what extent have agencies implemented sponsor deeming ; to what extent have agencies implemented sponsor repayment . to address these , gao analyzed federal data , surveyed states , and interviewed federal , state , and local officials . the number of sponsored noncitizens potentially affected by sponsor deeming is unknown ; however , federal restrictions on their eligibility for tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , as well as other factors , likely limit the number affected . the most recent data available suggest that 11 percent ( 473,000 ) of sponsored noncitizens applied for tanf , medicaid , or snap during the course of 2007 , and less than 1 percent ( 29,000 ) applied for ssi . in addition to federal restrictions , benefit agency officials reported that applicants ' reluctance or inability to obtain sponsor income information further reduces instances of deeming . nationwide , most benefit administering agencies have established sponsor deeming policies for tanf , snap , and ssi . however , agencies in 20 states have not done so for medicaid , due in part to the lack of federal guidance for medicaid on this requirement . yet , even among administering agencies that have established policies , many expressed the desire for more federal guidance on various aspects of deeming . for example , over 60 percent of state officials reported that additional clarification on applying an exception to deeming when noncitizen applicants are indigent would be useful . local officials also reported difficulties accessing information from the department of homeland security needed to determine whether an applicant is sponsored -- an essential part of the deeming process . few agencies have taken steps to implement sponsor repayment of tanf , medicaid , snap , and ssi , due in part to inconsistent federal guidance . while law requires that agencies administratively pursue repayment , federal regulations and guidance suggest it is optional . in total , only two states have pursued sponsor repayment . benefit agency officials reported that several factors discourage pursuit of repayment . specifically , they reported that the process involves high relative costs since noncitizens who receive benefits after deeming only qualify because both they and their sponsors have very low incomes . officials also reported that local staff who pursue repayment for these benefits sometimes have competing priorities .
in 2007 , the department of state ( state ) reported that some foreign diplomats may be abusing the household workers they brought to the united states on a - 3 or g - 5 visas . gao was asked to determine the number of a - 3 or g - 5 visa holders who have alleged abuse by foreign diplomats with immunity since 2000 , review the u.s. government 's process for investigating these allegations , and assess how state ensures that its policies for issuing a - 3 and g - 5 visas are implemented correctly and consistently . gao analyzed documents , interviewed officials , and conducted fieldwork at four consular posts that issue large numbers of a - 3 or g - 5 visas . gao identified 42 household workers with a - 3 or g - 5 visas who alleged that they were abused by foreign diplomats with immunity from 2000 through 2008 , but the total number is likely higher . the total number of alleged incidents since 2000 is likely higher for four reasons : household workers ' fear of contacting law enforcement , nongovernmental organizations ' protection of victim confidentiality , limited information on some cases handled by the u.s. government , and federal agencies ' challenges identifying cases . for example , state has several offices that receive allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats , but no single office maintains information on all allegations . the u.s. government 's process for investigating alleged abuse of household workers by foreign diplomats is complicated by three factors . first , immunity can pose constraints for law enforcement in collecting evidence . second , the status of foreign diplomats can heighten their workers ' sense of vulnerability , causing the workers to fear cooperating with investigators . third , the length of time it takes to obtain a legal opinion from state on the permissibility of using certain investigative techniques can hamper investigations . according to state , although some techniques are clearly prohibited by international law ( such as searching certain diplomats ' residences ) , the permissibility of others under international law is less clear . in advising on the use of investigative techniques , state considers legal and policy issues , such as reciprocity -- assessing how u.s. diplomats abroad might be affected by actions taken toward a foreign diplomat on u.s. soil . state may ask justice to provide information to help determine the permissibility of certain techniques , but the process of obtaining this information can be difficult and time consuming for justice . although both state and justice have discussed creating a process to avoid delays , no formal actions have , thus far , been taken to establish one . weaknesses exist in state 's process for ensuring correct and consistent implementation of policies and procedures for issuing a - 3 and g - 5 visas . gao 's review of employment contracts submitted at four consular posts by a - 3 and g - 5 visa applicants showed that they often did not include state 's required components , such as a guarantee of the minimum or prevailing wage . gao also found that officers at the four posts were unclear about or unfamiliar with certain aspects of state 's guidance . few of the officers were aware that they should inform a - 3 and g - 5 visa applicants of their rights under u.s. law during their interview . some officers at the four posts also were uncertain about the reasons for refusing a - 3 or g - 5 visas . state is considering adding provisions to its guidance that would more clearly stipulate reasons for refusing these visas , such as if an a - 3 or g - 5 applicant seeks to work for a foreign diplomat who is linked to a pattern of employee disappearance , abuse allegations , or other irregularities . however , state has not reached internal agreement on these provisions and has set no timetable for doing so . state headquarters officials said they rely on individual posts to monitor implementation of a - 3 and g - 5 visa policies and procedures and do not routinely assess posts ' complianc .
department of defense ( dod ) officials who serve in senior and acquisition positions and then leave for jobs with defense contractors are subject to the restrictions of post - government employment laws , in order to protect against conflicts of interest . congress required gao to report on employment of such officials by contractors who received more than $ 500 million in dod 's 2005 contract awards . in response , this report provides information on how many former dod employees worked for contractors in 2006 and estimates how many worked on contracts that were related to their former agencies or to their direct responsibilities and identifies the practices used to monitor restrictions and information challenges in monitoring post - dod employment . to do this work , gao matched data from dod for all employees who left dod over a 6 year period with data from the internal revenue service ( irs ) and from 52 contractors ; conducted surveys ; and interviewed dod and contractor officials . in 2006 , 52 contractors employed 2,435 former dod senior and acquisition officials who had previously served as generals , admirals , senior executives , program managers , contracting officers , or in other acquisition positions which made them subject to restrictions on their post - dod employment . most of the 2,435 former dod officials were employed by seven contractors . on the basis of a stratified random sample of contractor - supplied information , gao estimates that at least 422 former dod officials could have worked on defense contracts related to their former agencies and that at least nine could have worked on the same contracts for which they had oversight responsibilities or decision - making authorities while at dod . the information gao obtained from contractors was not designed to identify violations of the restrictions . while contractors could have employed quite a few former dod officials on assignments related to their prior dod positions , there could be appropriate justification for each of these situations . most of the contractors who responded to our survey reported using a range of practices to ensure awareness and compliance with post - government employment restrictions , although gao 's request proved challenging for contractors to provide accurate information identifying their former dod officials . according to the surveyed contractors , they can identify former dod officials with post - government employment restrictions and track their assignments during their cooling - off periods . however , gao 's analysis found a significant under - reporting of the contractors ' employment of former dod officials . specifically , contractor - supplied data showed they employed 1,263 former dod officials in 2006 , while irs data showed the contractors employed 2,435. new post - government employment requirements enacted in january 2008 are likely to make written ethics opinions for former dod officials more readily available to contractors . dod also must now keep ethics opinions in a central database . this information was not designed to provide a mechanism for dod to effectively monitor former dod officials ' post - government employment compliance after they begin working for contractors on specific contracts .
the integrated wireless network ( iwn ) was intended to be a collaborative effort among the departments of justice ( doj ) , homeland security ( dhs ) , and the treasury to provide secure , seamless , interoperable , and reliable nationwide wireless communications in support of federal agents and officers engaged in law enforcement , protective services , homeland defense , and disaster response missions . gao was asked to determine the extent to which the three departments are developing a joint radio communications solution . to address this objective , gao reviewed and analyzed relevant documentation and interviewed department officials about the extent to which they are collaborating with the other departments on iwn or an alternative joint radio communications solution . the departments of justice , homeland security , and the treasury had originally intended iwn to be a joint radio communications solution to improve communication among law enforcement agencies ; however , iwn is no longer being pursued as a joint development project . instead of focusing on a joint solution , the departments have begun independently modernizing their own wireless communications systems . while the departments of justice and the treasury ( and later the department of homeland security ) collaborated on a pilot demonstration of iwn in the seattle / blaine area that continues to provide service to multiple agencies , the departments have determined that this specific system design can not be implemented on a nationwide scale , and they have not acted collaboratively to identify an alternative approach for a jointly coordinated communications solution . in addition , the formal governance structure that was established among the three departments has been disbanded , and the contract for developing a new iwn design , awarded over a year and a half ago , is not being used jointly by the departments for this purpose . currently , the department of justice is planning to implement a nationwide network for its component agencies , and the department of homeland security and its components are pursuing numerous independent solutions . a primary reason why the collaboration on a joint communications solution has not been successful is that the departments did not effectively employ key cross - agency collaboration practices . specifically , they could not agree on a common outcome or purpose to overcome their differences in missions , cultures , and established ways of doing business ; they have not established a collaborative governance structure with a process for decision making and resolving disputes ; and they have not developed a joint strategy for moving forward . while the department of homeland security considers improving radio communications at the nation 's borders to be a major priority , the department of justice 's priorities are in other areas . program officials from both departments acknowledged that these differing priorities led to an inability to resolve conflicts . as a result , they now have several initiatives aimed at high - level coordination , none of which are focused on developing a joint communications solution . while department officials have signed an updated memorandum of understanding related to coordinating their radio communications projects , they have not made any progress on reestablishing a joint governance structure and decision - making procedures to address the challenges of collaborating on a joint communications solution . in abandoning collaboration on a joint solution , the departments risk duplication of effort and inefficient use of resources as they continue to invest significant resources in independent solutions . further , these efforts will not ensure the interoperability needed to serve day - to - day law enforcement operations or a coordinated response to terrorist or other events .
the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma ) established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit , known as medicare part d. the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) contracts with private companies to serve as part d sponsors and administer the part d prescription drug benefit plans . to protect beneficiaries and the fiscal integrity of the program , the mma requires part d sponsors to implement programs to control for fraud and abuse in part d. subsequent regulations and guidance from cms contain requirements and recommended measures for these programs . this report examines the extent to which certain part d sponsors have implemented programs to control fraud , waste , and abuse and the extent of cms 's oversight of part d sponsors ' programs to control fraud , waste , and abuse . gao conducted on - site reviews of five of the largest part d sponsors ' fraud and abuse programs . gao also interviewed officials from cms and reviewed cms documents . the five part d sponsors in gao 's review had not completely implemented all of cms 's required compliance plan elements and selected recommended measures for part d fraud and abuse programs . all part d sponsors had completely implemented the requirements and selected recommendations for three of the seven required compliance plan elements . however , part d sponsors varied in their implementation of the remaining required elements and selected recommended measures . cms oversight of part d sponsors ' fraud and abuse programs has been limited . to date , cms 's activities have been limited to the review and approval of sponsors ' fraud and abuse program plans submitted as part of the initial part d applications . for example , cms officials reported that they worked with sponsors to help them develop fraud and abuse program plans that met the agency 's compliance plan requirements and recommendations specific to fraud and abuse . however , cms has not conducted oversight to assess part d sponsors ' implementation of fraud and abuse programs . officials from cms stated that the agency had not audited sponsors ' implementation of fraud and abuse programs in 2007 , and as of april 2008 , no audits of these programs had been conducted .
as a separately organized agency within the department of energy , the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) administers the stockpile life extension program , whose purpose is to extend , through refurbishment , the operational lives of the weapons in the nuclear stockpile . nnsa encountered significant management problems with its first refurbishment for the w87 warhead . gao was asked to assess the extent to which nnsa and the department of defense ( dod ) have effectively managed the refurbishment of two other weapons -- the b61 bomb and the w76 warhead . this report summarizes the findings of gao 's classified report on the refurbishment of the b61 bomb and w76 warhead . nnsa and dod have not effectively managed cost , schedule , and technical risks for either the b61 or w76 life extension program . regarding the b61 program , although nnsa completed the refurbishment of the strategic variants of the b61 bomb -- the mods 7 and 11- - on schedule in november 2008 , the refurbished weapons do not meet all refurbishment objectives . according to nnsa and dod officials , nnsa established an unrealistic schedule and failed to fully implement its refurbishment guidance , known as the phase 6.x process . nnsa was able to meet its refurbishment schedule and avoid significant cost overruns for the b61 program only because some of the refurbishment objectives were changed , nnsa was able to reuse , rather than manufacture , a critical component when b61 bombs were decommissioned , and the nuclear weapons council significantly reduced the number of b61 bombs in the stockpile . despite dod concerns about the adequacy of nnsa testing of the b61 bombs under certain conditions , nnsa continued refurbishing the weapons . some of the b61 refurbishment problems could have been avoided if dod had fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in overseeing nnsa 's life extension program activities . for example , the air force did not adequately review nnsa 's design , engineering , and testing activities -- a review that would have alerted dod that nnsa was missing some of its refurbishment objectives . regarding the w76 program , nnsa did not effectively manage a high risk associated with manufacturing an essential material , known as fogbank , needed to refurbish the w76 warhead . nnsa had developed a risk mitigation strategy to avoid potential cost overruns and schedule delays related to the manufacture of this key material but failed to effectively implement this strategy . as a result , nnsa 's original plans to produce the first refurbished w76 weapon in september 2007 slipped to september 2008 ; nnsa spent $ 69 million to address fogbank production problems ; and the navy faced logistical challenges owing to the delay . furthermore , nnsa did not have a consistent approach to developing a cost baseline for the w76 program , which makes it difficult to track refurbishment costs over time and to know the actual cost of the program .
this testimony discusses gao 's january 8 , 2009 , report that provides a framework for modernizing the outdated u.s. financial regulatory system . gao prepared this work under the authority of the comptroller general to help policymakers weigh various regulatory reform proposals and consider ways in which the current regulatory system could be made more effective and efficient . this testimony describes how regulation has evolved in banking , securities , thrifts , credit unions , futures , insurance , secondary mortgage markets and other important areas ; describes several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades that have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system ; and presents an evaluation framework that can be used by congress and others to shape potential regulatory reform efforts . the current u.s. financial regulatory system has relied on a fragmented and complex arrangement of federal and state regulators -- put into place over the past 150 years -- that has not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and products in recent decades . today , almost a dozen federal regulatory agencies , numerous self - regulatory organizations , and hundreds of state financial regulatory agencies share responsibility for overseeing the financial services industry . as the nation finds itself in the midst of one of the worst financial crises ever , it has become apparent that the regulatory system is ill - suited to meet the nation 's needs in the 21st century . several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system . first , regulators have struggled , and often failed , to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large and interconnected financial conglomerates and to ensure they adequately manage their risks . second , regulators have had to address problems in financial markets resulting from the activities of large and sometimes less - regulated market participants -- such as nonbank mortgage lenders , hedge funds , and credit rating agencies -- some of which play significant roles in today 's financial markets . third , the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors , and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products . fourth , standard setters for accounting and financial regulators have faced growing challenges in ensuring that accounting and audit standards appropriately respond to financial market developments , and in addressing challenges arising from the global convergence of accounting and auditing standards . finally , as financial markets have become increasingly global , the current fragmented u.s. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators . these significant developments have outpaced a fragmented and outdated regulatory structure , and , as a result , significant reforms to the u.s. regulatory system are critically and urgently needed . the current system has significant weaknesses that , if not addressed , will continue to expose the nation 's financial system to serious risks . our report offers a framework for crafting and evaluating regulatory reform proposals consisting of nine characteristics that should be reflected in any new regulatory system . by applying the elements of the framework , the relative strengths and weaknesses of any reform proposal should be better revealed , and policymakers should be able to focus on identifying trade - offs and balancing competing goals . similarly , the framework could be used to craft proposals , or to identify aspects to be added to existing proposals to make them more effective and appropriate for addressing the limitations of the current system .
since 2001 , congress has appropriated nearly $ 700 billion for the global war on terrorism . the majority of these funds have supported u.s. efforts in iraq . congressional oversight is crucial to improve performance , ensure accountability , and protect u.s. programs from fraud , waste , and abuse . since 2003 , gao has issued nearly 130 iraq - related reports and testimonies . this testimony addresses factors contributing to poor contracting outcomes and accountability , long - standing issues in the department of defense 's ( dod ) management and oversight of contractors supporting deployed forces , and efforts to improve the capacity of the iraqi government . gao reviewed u.s. agency documents and interviewed officials from state , dod , and other agencies ; the united nations ( un ) ; and the iraqi government . we also made multiple trips to iraq . u.s. efforts in iraq have relied extensively on contractors to undertake reconstruction projects and provide support to u.s. forces . however , a lack of well - defined requirements , poor business arrangements , and inadequate oversight and accountability have negatively affected reconstruction and support efforts . for example , in a july 2007 report , gao found that dod completed negotiation for task orders on an oil contract more than 6 months after the work commenced and most costs were incurred . dod paid nearly all of the $ 221 million in costs questioned by auditors . also in july 2007 , gao found that unclear dod guidance , inadequate staff , and insufficient technology resulted in poor accountability over more than 190,000 weapons provided to iraqi forces . dod concurred with gao 's recommendation to determine what dod accountability procedures apply or should apply to the program . however , as of march 2008 , dod had not made a determination . the need to effectively manage and oversee contractors supporting deployed forces is equally important . dod pays billions of dollars each year for contracted goods and services in locations such as iraq and elsewhere . however , several long - standing and systemic problems continue to hinder dod 's management and oversight of contractors at deployed locations , including the failure to follow planning guidance , provide an adequate number of contract oversight personnel , systematically collect and distribute lessons learned , and provide predeployment training for military commanders and contract oversight personnel on the use and role of contractors . gao 's work has identified instances where poor oversight and management of contractors led to negative financial and operational impacts . gao has made a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening dod 's management and oversight of contractor support at deployed locations , and the department has agreed to implement many of those recommendations . however , gao has found that dod has made limited progress in implementing some key recommendations . the united states has made available nearly $ 6 billion to rebuild iraq 's energy sector and $ 300 million to develop its government ministries but lacks integrated strategic plans for both efforts . building the capacity of the ministries is critical to ensure that iraq can effectively govern , rebuild , and stabilize the country . rebuilding iraq 's energy sector is necessary to ensure that iraq can pay for these tasks and provide essential services to the iraqi people . however , in the absence of a comprehensive and integrated strategic plan , u.s. efforts to build the capacity of the iraqi government have been hindered by multiple u.s. agencies pursuing individual efforts without overarching direction . the creation of a plan for the energy sector is also essential for iraq to meet energy production and export goals . gao recommended that state work with iraqi ministries to develop an integrated energy plan . state commented that the iraqi government , not the u.s. government , should act on gao 's recommendations . given the billions of dollars provided to rebuild iraq 's energy sector and the limited capacity of iraqi ministries , gao believes that its recommendations are still valid .
congress has enacted post - government employment restrictions and foreign agent registration requirements with the objectives of protecting the u.s. government against the improper use of government information by former federal employees and ensuring the american people know the identity of persons trying to influence u.s. government policy in the united states on behalf of foreign entities . this report discusses the extent to which selected agencies have information on the post - government employment activities of former senior federal employees who represent foreign principals and the challenges the agencies face in enforcing these requirements . we reviewed federal ethics guidance , laws , and other documents , and interviewed officials at the departments of state and the treasury , the u.s. agency for international development and the u.s. trade representative . executive branch agencies are not required to and do not collect and maintain information on the post - government employment activities of former senior federal employees who represent foreign principals . post - government employment restrictions prohibit former senior federal employees from engaging in certain activities , such as lobbying or other advocacy communications , for a specified period of time after leaving federal service . the agencies we reviewed undertake a variety of activities , including providing training and advice , to promote compliance with the restrictions . the foreign agents registration act ( fara ) requires that all persons in the united states working as agents of a foreign government , foreign political party , or other foreign principal disclose to the department of justice ( justice ) such connections as well as the activities they perform on behalf of such principals in the united states . justice provides information on fara registration requirements to the public . it also collects information on all entities that register with justice as foreign agents . however , the registration information does not identify individuals who are former senior federal employees . nevertheless , of the nearly 8,000 senior federal employees who left government service between calendar years 2000 and 2007 , we identified 29 who registered as foreign agents and engaged in activities that ranged from promoting tourism to lobbying on behalf of foreign principals such as the governments of argentina and saudi arabia . this number may not include all former senior federal employees who represent foreign entities because individuals engaged in exempted activities under fara , such as diplomatic , commercial , and legal activities , and those registered under the lobbying disclosure act , are not required to register . the agencies we reviewed face information , legal , and resource challenges in promoting compliance with the post - government employment restrictions and monitoring fara . one challenge is inconsistent documentation of advice provided to senior federal employees on post - government employment restrictions . while agencies document information such as ethics training courses given , subject matters covered , and counseling services offered , they do not consistently keep records of what advice was given to specific employees . the office of government ethics ( oge ) has encouraged the executive branch agencies to document such advice . for example , a 2005 oge memorandum to all designated agency ethics officials discussed the advantages of documenting advice and offered suggestions on when to document ethics advice . documentation of advice is useful for proving intent , which can help to prosecute violations of the restrictions . in addition , a lack of clear legal authority and a lack of resources have been cited by justice as barriers to increased monitoring of fara compliance . for example , justice officials said the department does not have clear legal authority to inspect the records of persons that it believes should be registered and that the department does not have the authority to require advance written notification from persons claiming to be exempt from fara requirements . without advance written notification , justice has no way of knowing whether persons exempting themselves should in fact be registered .
medicare advantage ( ma ) plans are an alternative to the original medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) program . private fee - for - service ( pffs ) plans -- one type of ma plan -- give beneficiaries an option that is more like medicare ffs than other ma plans , with a wider choice of providers and less plan management of services and providers . pffs enrollment increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in june 2004 to about 2.3 million in june 2008. this report compares pffs plans to other ma plans and medicare ffs in three areas : characteristics of beneficiaries , financial risks for beneficiaries who do not contact their plans before receiving services , and disenrollment rates . to do this work , gao reviewed materials from a selected sample of nine pffs plan sponsors , analyzed medicare data , and interviewed officials from cms , which administers the medicare program , and other organizations . in april 2007 , beneficiaries in pffs plans tended to be healthier and generally younger than beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs . specifically , projected health care expenditures for pffs beneficiaries were 7 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in other ma plans and 10 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in medicare ffs . beneficiaries in pffs plans also generally were more likely than beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs to reside in rural areas where fewer other ma plans were available . in addition , about 81 percent of beneficiaries who were new enrollees in pffs plans were in medicare ffs before enrolling in their plan , compared to 65 percent in other ma plans . pffs beneficiaries may have faced certain financial risks if they did not contact their plan before receiving services . these risks were generally not assumed by beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs . specifically , if beneficiaries or their providers did not contact their pffs plans before obtaining a service to make sure it would be covered , beneficiaries unexpectedly may have had to pay for the entire cost of the service if coverage was later denied by their plan . cms officials told gao they did not have data on the extent to which pffs beneficiaries were faced with such costs . furthermore , some beneficiaries likely experienced higher out - of - pocket costs for covered services if they did not contact their plan before obtaining the services . for example , one sponsor of pffs plans increased the share of the cost for which beneficiaries were responsible from 30 percent to 70 percent if the beneficiaries did not contact the plan before obtaining certain durable equipment . gao found that some pffs plans were inappropriately using the term prior authorization , which can involve denying service coverage if prior plan approval is not obtained , in their informational materials . cms officials stated that pffs plans should not have used this term because these plans were not permitted to deny service coverage due to lack of prior plan approval . however , cms guidance on this issue has been inconsistent and sometimes incorrect . from january through april 2007 , beneficiaries in pffs plans disenrolled at an average rate of 21 percent compared to 9 percent for other ma plans , and gao concludes that cms has not complied with statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to medicare beneficiaries . disenrollment rates can reflect factors such as beneficiary satisfaction and cms is required by law to mail this information to medicare beneficiaries to help them compare available ma plans in their area . although cms has not mailed disenrollment rates to beneficiaries since 2000 , the agency did provide disenrollment rates through medicare 's web site . however , this information was based on disenrollment in 2004 and 2005 and , given the enrollment growth since then , may not accurately reflect plans available to beneficiaries in 2008 .
since september 11 , 2001 , congress has provided about $ 808 billion to the department of defense ( dod ) for the global war on terrorism ( gwot ) in addition to funding in dod 's base budget . prior gao reports have found dod 's reported gwot cost data unreliable and found problems with transparency over certain costs . in response , dod has made several changes to its cost - reporting procedures . congress has shown interest in increasing the transparency of dod 's cost reporting and funding requests for gwot . under the comptroller general 's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative , gao assessed dod 's progress in improving the accuracy and reliability of its gwot cost reporting , and dod 's methodology for reporting gwot costs by contingency operation . for this engagement , gao analyzed gwot cost data and applicable guidance , as well as dod 's corrective actions . while dod and the military services continue to take steps to improve the accuracy and reliability of some aspects of gwot cost reporting , dod lacks a sound approach for identifying costs of specific contingency operations , raising concerns about the reliability of reported information , especially on the cost of operation iraqi freedom . specifically , the department has undertaken initiatives such as requiring components to sample and validate their gwot cost transactions and launching a new contingency cost - reporting system that will automate the collection of gwot cost data from components ' accounting systems and produce a new report comparing reported obligations and disbursements to gwot appropriations data . also , the military services have taken several steps to correct weaknesses in the reliability of their cost data . limitations in dod 's approach to identifying the costs of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom may , in some cases , result in the overstatement of costs , and could lead to these costs being included in dod 's gwot funding requests rather than the base budget . dod guidance emphasizes the importance of accurately reporting the cost of contingency operations . however , while the army and marine corps are capturing totals for procurement and certain operation and maintenance costs , they do not have a methodology for determining what portion of these gwot costs are attributable to operation iraqi freedom versus operation enduring freedom and have reported all these costs as attributable to operation iraqi freedom . in addition , the military services have reported some costs , such as those for navy forward - presence missions , as part of operation iraqi freedom or operation enduring freedom , even though they are not directly attributable to either operation . in september 2005 , dod expanded the definition of incremental costs for large - scale contingencies , such as those for gwot , to include expenses beyond direct incremental costs . this expanded definition provides no guidance on what costs beyond those attributable to the operation can be considered incremental and reported . consequently , the military services have made their own interpretations as to whether and how to include costs not directly attributable to gwot contingency operations . without a methodology for determining what portion of gwot costs is attributable to operation iraqi freedom or operation enduring freedom , reported costs for operation iraqi freedom may be overstated . furthermore , unless dod reconsiders whether expenses not directly attributable to specific gwot operations should be included as incremental costs , the military services may continue to include these expenses as part of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom , reported costs for both operations may be overstated , and dod may continue to request funding for these expenses in gwot funding requests instead of including them as part of the base budget . expenses beyond those directly attributable to either operation may be more reflective of the enduring nature of gwot and its cost implications should be part of the annual budget debate .
in carrying out its mission to ensure that securities markets are fair , orderly , and efficiently maintained , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) relies extensively on computerized systems . effective information security controls are essential to ensure that sec 's financial and sensitive information is protected from inadvertent or deliberate misuse , disclosure , or destruction . as part of its audit of sec 's financial statements , gao assessed the status of sec 's actions to correct previously reported information security weaknesses and the effectiveness of sec 's controls for ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of its information systems and information . to do this , gao examined security policies and artifacts , interviewed pertinent officials , and conducted tests and observations of controls in operation . sec has made important progress toward correcting previously reported information security control weaknesses . specifically , it has corrected or mitigated 18 of 34 weaknesses previously reported as unresolved at the time of our prior audit . for example , sec has adequately validated electronic certificates from connections to its network , physically secured the perimeter of its operations center and put in place a process to monitor unusual and suspicious activities , and removed network system accounts and data center access rights from separating employees . in addition , the commission has made progress in improving its information security program . to illustrate , it has developed , documented , and implemented a policy on remedial action plans to ensure that deficiencies are mitigated in an effective and timely manner , and provided individuals with training for incident handling . nevertheless , sec has not completed actions to correct 16 previously reported weaknesses . for example , it did not adequately document access privileges granted to users of a key financial application , and did not always implement patches on vulnerable workstations and enterprise database servers . in addition to the 16 previously reported weakness that remain uncorrected , gao identified 23 new weaknesses in controls intended to restrict access to data and systems , as well as weaknesses in other information security controls , that continue to jeopardize the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of sec 's financial and sensitive information and information systems . the commission has not fully implemented effective controls to prevent , limit , or detect unauthorized access to computing resources . for example , it did not always consistently enforce strong controls for identifying and authenticating users , sufficiently restrict user access to systems encrypt network services , audit and monitor security - relevant events for its databases , and physically protect its computer resources . sec also did not consistently ensure appropriate segregation of incompatible duties or adequately manage the configuration of its financial information systems . a key reason for these weaknesses is that the commission has not yet fully implemented its information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating as intended . specifically , sec has not effectively or fully implemented key program activities . for example , it has not filled the vacancy for a senior agency information security officer , fully reported or assessed risks , sufficiently tested and evaluated the effectiveness of its information system controls , and certified and accredited a key intermediary subsystem . although progress has been made , significant and preventable information security control deficiencies create continuing risks of the misuse of federal assets , unauthorized modification or destruction of financial information , inappropriate disclosure of other sensitive information , and disruption of critical operations .
the fiscal year 2009 budget request for the internal revenue service ( irs ) is a road map for how irs plans to allocate resources and achieve ambitious goals for improving enforcement , improving taxpayer service , increasing research , and continuing to invest in modernized information systems . one complicating factor in implementing irs 's plans in the immediate future is the recent passage of the economic stimulus act of 2008 , which creates additional , unanticipated workload for irs . gao was asked to assess how the president 's budget request for irs allocates resources and justifies proposed initiatives ; determine the status of irs 's efforts to develop and implement its business systems modernization ( bsm ) program ; and determine the total costs of administering the economic stimulus legislation . to meet these objectives , gao drew upon and updated recently issued reports . the president 's fiscal year 2009 budget request for irs is $ 11.4 billion , 4.3 percent more than last year 's enacted amount . the request proposes to maintain taxpayer service at recent levels , in part by realizing efficiency gains from electronic filing , despite a decrease in staffing . it also proposes a 7 percent increase in enforcement spending , including spending for 21 legislative and nonlegislative initiatives . the legislative proposals are projected to cost $ 23 million in fiscal year 2009 , funding that irs would not need if the proposals are not enacted . similarly , if irs were to fall behind in its proposed enforcement hiring efforts , it would not need all $ 226 million of the associated funding . irs justified its nonlegislative enforcement initiatives with return on investment ( roi ) analyses , which are useful , despite limitations , for making resource allocation decisions . the budget request does not provide roi information for activities that constitute a large part of the budget request -- activities other than the proposed initiatives . the request for bsm is over $ 44 million lower than the fiscal year 2008 enacted amount . irs said this funding level will allow it to continue its primary modernization projects , but it did not describe how specific projects or benefits to taxpayers would be affected . irs has continued to make progress in implementing bsm projects and improving modernization management controls and capabilities . however , further improvements are needed . for example , the agency has yet to develop long - term plans for completing bsm and consolidating and retiring legacy systems . irs estimated that the costs of implementing the economic stimulus legislation may be up to a total of $ 767 million -- including a $ 202 million supplemental appropriation . in addition to the supplemental appropriation , irs is reallocating hundreds of collections staff to answering taxpayer telephone calls , resulting in up to $ 565 million in foregone enforcement revenue . in addition , irs expects some deterioration in telephone service because of the increased call volume . for example , irs is expecting its assistor level of service to drop to as low as 74 percent compared to its goal of 82 percent .
to help ensure that veterans are properly compensated for disabilities , va is required to perform disability reevaluations for specific disabilities . va also performs reevaluations whenever it determines there is a need to verify either the continued existence or current severity of veterans ' disabilities . vba completed about 17,700 reevaluations in fiscal year 2005. gao was asked to review the veterans benefits administration 's ( vba ) disability reevaluation program . this report assesses the operational controls va uses to ensure the effectiveness of the disability reevaluation process and the management information va collects and uses to manage the disability reevaluation process . to conduct this study , gao analyzed vba data , reviewed federal regulations and vba procedures , conducted site visits , and interviewed vba officials . vba 's operational controls do not adequately ensure that staff schedule or conduct disability reevaluations as necessary ; however , vba is planning to improve some of the controls . vba claims processing software does not automatically establish or prompt regional office staff to schedule a time - known as a diary date - to determine whether a disability reevaluation should proceed . consequently , some cases that require a reevaluation may never receive it . after the diary date matures , staff perform a preliminary review of a veteran 's claim file to determine if a more comprehensive reevaluation should be conducted . if staff determine during this review that a reevaluation is no longer needed , the reevaluation is cancelled . however , cancellations are not tracked or subject to quality assurance reviews to ensure adherence to program policies and procedures . vba plans on improving some of its control mechanisms through its new claims management system , the veterans service network ( vetsnet ) , including developing the ability to track cancellations . however , vba has no plans to include a prompt for scheduling reevaluation diary dates in vetsnet . vba can not effectively manage the disability reevaluation process because some of the data it collects are inconsistent and it does not systematically collect and analyze key management data . while vba collects data on the amount of time regional offices take to conduct disability reevaluations , these data are not consistentbecause regional offices use different starting points for measuring timeliness . also , vba does not know the types of disabilities being reevaluated , the length of time before reevaluations are conducted , or the results of the reevaluations . as a result , vba can not ensure that it is effectively and appropriately using its resources .
a diverse senior executive service ( ses ) , which generally represents the most experienced segment of the federal workforce , can be an organizational strength by bringing a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to policy development and implementation , strategic planning , problem solving , and decision making . in a january 2003 report ( gao - 03-34 ) , gao provided data on career ses members by race , ethnicity , and gender as of october 2000 and a statistically estimated projection of what the profile of the ses would be in october 2007 if appointment and separation trends did not change . in response to a request for updated information on the diversity in the ses , gao is providing information from the office of personnel management 's ( opm ) central personnel data file on the representation of women and minorities in the ses and the ses developmental pool ( i.e . , gs - 15 and gs - 14 positions ) for the executive branch as of fiscal year 2007 and comparing this representation to fiscal year 2000 levels and to levels gao projected for october 2007 in its 2003 report ; for fiscal years 2000 and 2007 , the average age at which women and minorities were appointed to and retired from the ses as well as information on those in the ses reporting targeted disabilities ; and on the overall processes used in executive branch agencies for selecting and certifying members into the ses . the representation of women and minorities in the ses and the ses developmental pool increased governmentwide from october 2000 through september 2007 , but increases did not occur in all agencies . over these 7 years , increases occurred in more than half of the 24 major executive branch agencies , but in both 2000 and 2007 the representation of women and minorities continued to vary significantly at those agencies . in 2003 , we projected that increases would occur in the representation of women and minorities in the ses and ses developmental pool by 2007. these increases generally did occur . looking beyond racial , ethnic , and gender profiles , gao also reviewed the average age at appointment to and retirement from the career ses as well as the disability status reported by career ses employees for fiscal years 2000 and 2007. for the most part , career ses members were , on average , about age 50 at the time of their appointment to the ses and about age 60 at the time of their retirement . the average age at appointment to and retirement from the career ses generally did not vary much by race , ethnicity , or gender . gao also calculated how long , on average , individuals served in the ses , and found that the length of their stay in the ses did vary . for example , women stayed in the ses longer than men ; women who voluntarily retired stayed , on average , for 11.4 years , and men who voluntarily retired stayed , on average , for 8.8 years . the average length of service among minorities ranged from 4.1 years for asian / pacific islander women to 12 years for american indian / alaska native men . governmentwide less than 1 percent of the career ses in 2000 and 2007 had self - reported targeted disabilities , and their representation declined slightly over this time . executive branch agencies have established processes for selecting members into the ses and have developmental programs that are designed to create pools of candidates from which new members can be selected . these agencies use executive resources boards to review the executive and technical qualifications of eligible candidates for initial ses career appointments and make recommendations based on the best qualified . an opm - administered board reviews candidates ' qualifications before appointment to the ses .
certified registered nurse anesthetists ( crna ) , registered nurses who have completed a master 's degree program in nurse anesthesia , provide the majority of anesthesia care in the department of veterans affairs ( va ) medical facilities . there are approximately 500 va - employed crnas ( va crna ) who provide care to veterans in va medical facilities . while the demand for crnas has increased , many employed by va are nearing retirement eligibility age . concerns have been raised about the challenges va may face in making va crna salaries competitive in order to maintain its va crna workforce , particularly in local markets that can be highly competitive . this testimony is based on gao work reported in va health care : many medical facilities have challenges in recruiting and retaining nurse anesthetists , ( gao - 08-56 , dec. 13 , 2007 ) . this testimony identifies workforce challenges that va medical facilities experience related to va crnas , and identifies a key mechanism that va medical facilities have to help make va crna salaries competitive and the extent to which va facilities use this mechanism . for the december 2007 report , gao analyzed surveys sent to va chief anesthesiologists , va human resources officers , and va crnas . gao also visited eight va medical facilities and interviewed facility officials about efforts to recruit and retain va crnas . gao reported in december 2007 that va medical facilities had challenges recruiting and retaining va crnas . in gao 's report , most surveyed officials said that they had difficulty recruiting va crnas at their facilities . the challenge of recruiting va crnas affected the ability of va officials to reduce existing va crna vacancy rates -- the number of unfilled va crna positions -- at their medical facilities . vacancy rates varied across va and , according to gao 's survey , impacted the delivery of services at va medical facilities . on the basis of its survey results , gao also found that in addition to their current recruiting challenges , va medical facilities would likely face a challenge retaining va crnas in the next 5 years due to the number of va crnas projected to either retire from or leave va. va medical facility officials reported in gao 's survey that the recruitment and retention challenges were caused primarily by the low level of va crna salaries when compared with crna salaries in local market areas . gao also reported that va 's locality pay system ( lps ) is a key mechanism va medical facilities can use to determine whether to adjust va crna salaries to help the facilities remain competitive with crna salaries in local market areas . gao also reported that the majority of va medical facilities that employ va crnas used lps . however , at the eight va medical facilities it visited , gao found that although the facilities used va 's lps , the majority of them did not fully follow va 's lps policy correctly in either 2005 or 2006. the problems some va medical facilities had fully following va 's lps policy , along with the explanations of facility officials , indicated that va had not provided adequate training on its lps policy . as a result , va medical facility officials can not ensure that va crna salaries have been adjusted as needed to be competitive in local market areas . training on the lps is necessary to help ensure that va medical facilities are competitive as an employer . in december 2007 , gao recommended that va expedite the development and implementation of a training course for va medical facility officials responsible for compliance with the policy . va agreed with gao 's recommendation and in comments on gao 's draft report stated that it had developed a draft action plan for training staff on its lps policy . va anticipated that the online training course would be available by the end of fiscal year 2008 .
other transaction authority was created to enhance the federal government 's ability to acquire cutting - edge science and technology by attracting nontraditional contractors that have not typically pursued government contracts . the homeland security act of 2002 granted the department the temporary authority to enter into other transactions for research and prototype projects for a period of 5 years . the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 extended this authority until september 30 , 2008. this testimony discusses the extent to which dhs has used its other transaction authority , the status of dhs 's implementation of gao 's previous recommendations , and the accountability challenges associated with the use of these agreements . dhs entered into 37 other transaction agreements between fiscal years 2004 and 2007 , most of which were entered into in the first 2 years . though it has since used this authority less frequently , it continues to obligate funds for its earliest agreements . furthermore , about 77 percent of the dollars spent on these agreements have been for 7 of dhs 's 37 agreements . contracting representatives also told us that all of the agreements to date were for prototype projects and that each agreement included at least one nontraditional contractor . gao plans further review of dhs 's use of other transaction agreements as required by the homeland security act of 2002. dhs has made efforts to improve its use of other transaction agreements and to prevent conflicts of interest . the department has taken the following steps to address prior gao recommendations including : creating guidance on when to include audit provisions in other transaction agreements ; creating a training program on using these agreements ; and improving controls over conflicts of interest . gao also recommended that dhs capture knowledge gained from the agreements it has entered into . the department has compiled lessons learned from the department of defense , but the document is not related to dhs 's experience . furthermore , while dhs created guidance on when to include audit provisions in agreements , its guidance only applies to certain prototype projects and only in certain circumstances . risks inherent with the use of other transaction agreements create several accountability challenges . these challenges include attracting and ensuring the use of nontraditional contractors , acquiring intellectual property rights , ensuring financial control , and maintaining a skilled acquisition workforce with the expertise to create and maintain these agreements .
the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has relied on service acquisitions to meet its expansive mission . in fiscal year 2006 , dhs spent $ 12.7 billion to procure services . to improve service acquisition outcomes , federal procurement policy establishes a preference for a performance - based approach , which focuses on developing measurable outcomes rather than prescribing how contractors should perform services . this testimony focuses on how contract outcomes are influenced by how well dhs components have defined and developed contract requirements and performance standards , as well as the need for improved assessment and oversight to ensure better acquisition outcomes . gao 's statement is based on its report being released today , which reviewed judgmentally selected contracts for eight major investments at three dhs components -- the coast guard , customs and border protection ( cbp ) , and the transportation security administration ( tsa ) -- totaling $ 1.53 billion in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 ; prior gao and dhs inspector general reviews ; management documents and plans ; and related data , including 138 additional contracts , primarily for basic services from the coast guard , cbp , tsa , and immigration and customs enforcement . over the past several years , gao has found that appropriate planning , structuring , and monitoring of agency service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based , can help minimize the risk of cost overruns , delayed delivery , and unacceptably quality . several prior gao and dhs inspector general reviews of major dhs investments using a performance - based approach point to such shortcomings . while all of the contracts gao reviewed at the coast guard , cbp , and tsa had outcome - oriented requirements , contracts for four of the eight investments did not have well - defined requirements , or a complete set of measurable performance standards , or both at the time of contract award or start of work . these service contracts experienced cost overruns , schedule delays , or did not otherwise meet performance expectations . in contrast , contracts for the other four investments had well - defined requirements linked to measurable performance standards and met the standards for contracts that had begun work . in managing its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based , dhs has faced oversight challenges that have limited its visibility over service acquisitions and its ability to make informed acquisition management decisions . notably , the department lacks reliable data on performance - based service acquisitions . about half of the 138 contracts identified by dhs as performance - based had none of the elements dhs requires for such contracts : a performance work statement , measurable performance standards , or a quality assurance surveillance plan . such inaccurate data limit dhs 's ability to perform management assessments of these acquisitions . in addition , the chief procurement officer , who is responsible for departmentwide procurement oversight , has not conducted management assessments of performance - based service acquisitions . to help dhs improve outcomes for its service acquisitions , including those that are performance - based , gao recommended that dhs routinely assess requirements for complex investments to ensure that they are well - defined , and develop consistently measurable performance standards linked to those requirements . gao also recommended that dhs systematically evaluate the outcomes of major investments and relevant contracting methods and improve the quality of data to facilitate identifying and assessing the use of various contracting methods . dhs generally concurred with gao 's recommendations , noting some departmental initiatives to improve acquisition management .
biennially , the judicial conference , the federal judiciary 's principal policymaking body , assesses the need for additional judges . the assessment is based on a variety of factors , but begins with quantitative case - related workload measures . this testimony focuses on whether the judiciary 's quantitative case - related workload measures from 1993 were reasonably accurate ; and the reasonableness of any proposed methodologies to update the 1993 workload measures . the comments in this testimony are based on a report gao issued in may 2003. in 2003 , gao reported that the 1993 district court case weights were reasonably accurate measures of the average time demands that a specific number and mix of cases filed in a district court could be expected to place on the district judges in that district . at the time of gao 's 2003 report , the judicial conference was using case weights approved in 1993 to assess the need for additional district court judgeships . the weights were based on data judges recorded about the actual in - court and out - of - court time spent on specific cases from filing to disposition . this methodology permitted the calculation of objective , statistical measures of the accuracy of the final case weights . in 2003 , gao reviewed the research design the judicial conference 's subcommittee on judicial statistics had approved for updating the 1993 district court case weights , and had two concerns about the design . first , the design assumed that the judicial time spent on a case could be accurately estimated by viewing the case as a set of individual tasks or events in the case . information about event frequencies and , where available , time spent on the events would be extracted from existing databases and used to develop estimates of the judge - time spent on different types of cases . however , for event data , the research design proposed using data from two data bases that had yet to be integrated to obtain and analyze the data . second , unlike the methodology used to develop the 1993 case weights , the design for updating the case weights included limited data on the time judges actually spent on specific types of cases . specifically , the proposed design included data from judicial databases on the in - court time judges spent on different types of cases , but did not include collecting actual data on the noncourtroom time that judges spend on different types of cases . instead , estimates of judges ' noncourtroom time were derived from the structured , guided discussions of about 100 experienced judges meeting in 12 separate groups ( one for each geographic circuit ) . noncourtroom time was likely to represent the majority of judge time used to develop the revised case weights . the accuracy of case weights developed on such consensus data can not be assessed using standard statistical methods , such as the calculation of standard errors . thus , it would not be possible to objectively , statistically assess how accurate the new case weights are -- weights on whose reasonable accuracy the judicial conference relies in assessing judgeship needs . the case - related workload measure for courts of appeals judges is adjusted case filings in which all cases are considered to take an equal amount of judge time except for pro se cases -- those in which one or more of the parties is not represented by an attorney -- which are discounted . in our 2003 review , we found no empirical basis on which to assess the accuracy of this workload measure . although a number of alternatives to the adjusted filings measure have been considered , the judicial conference has been unable to agree on a different approach that could be applied to all courts of appeal .
the current economic downturn has brought significant financial stress to the auto manufacturing industry . recent deteriorating financial , real estate , and labor markets have reduced consumer confidence and available credit , and automobile purchases have declined . while auto manufacturers broadly have experienced declining sales in 2008 as the economy has worsened , sales of the `` big 3 '' ( general motors , chrysler , and ford ) have also declined relative to those of some other auto manufacturers in recent years because higher gasoline prices have particularly hurt sales of sport utility vehicles . in addition to causing potential job losses at auto manufacturers , failure of the domestic auto industry would likely adversely affect other sectors . officials from the big 3 have requested , and congress is considering , immediate federal financial assistance . this testimony discusses principles that can serve as a framework for considering the desirability , nature , scope , and conditions of federal financial assistance . should congress decide to provide financial assistance , we also discuss how these principles could be applied in these circumstances . the testimony is based on gao 's extensive body of work on previous federal rescue efforts that dates back to the 1970s . from our previous work on federal financial assistance to large firms and municipalities , we have identified three fundamental principles that can serve as a framework for considering future assistance . these principles are identifying and defining the problem , determining the national interests and setting clear goals and objectives that address the problem , and protecting the government 's interests . first , problems confronting the industry must be clearly defined -- separating out those that require an immediate response from those structural challenges that will take more time to resolve . second , congress should determine whether the national interest will be best served through a legislative solution , or whether market forces and established legal procedures , such as bankruptcy , should be allowed to take their course . should congress decide that federal financial assistance is warranted , it is important that congress establish clear objectives and goals for this assistance . third , given the significant financial risk the federal government may assume , the structure congress sets up to administer any assistance should provide for appropriate mechanisms , such as concessions by all parties , controls over management , compensation for risk , and a strong independent board , to protect taxpayers from excessive or unnecessary risks . these principles could help the congress in deciding whether to offer financial assistance to the domestic auto manufacturers . if congress determines that a legislative solution is in the national interest , a two - pronged approach could be appropriate in these circumstances . specifically , congress could 1 ) authorize immediate , but temporary , financial assistance to the auto manufacturing industry and 2 ) concurrently establish a board to approve , disburse , and oversee the use of these initial funds and provide any additional federal funds and continued oversight . this board could also oversee any structural reforms of the companies . among other responsibilities , congress could give the board authority to establish and implement eligibility criteria for potential borrowers and to implement procedures and controls in order to protect the government 's interests .
for the past 11 years , since gao 's first audit of the consolidated financial statements of the u.s. government ( cfs ) , certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and financial reporting practices have prevented gao from expressing an opinion on the cfs . gao has consistently reported that the u.s. government did not have adequate systems , controls , and procedures to properly prepare the cfs . gao 's december 2007 disclaimer of opinion on the fiscal year 2007 accrual basis consolidated financial statements included a discussion of continuing control deficiencies related to the preparation of the cfs . the purpose of this report is to provide details of continuing material weaknesses , recommend improvements , and provide the status of corrective actions taken to address the 81 open recommendations related to the preparation of the cfs that gao reported in july 2007. gao identified continuing and new control deficiencies during its audit of the fiscal year 2007 cfs that relate to the federal government 's processes used to prepare the cfs . these control deficiencies contribute to material weaknesses in internal control regarding the u.s. government 's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies ; ensure that the cfs was consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements , properly balanced , and in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ; and identify and either resolve or explain material differences that exist between certain components of the budget deficit reported in the department of the treasury 's records , used to prepare the reconciliation of net operating cost and unified budget deficit and statement of changes in cash balance from unified budget and other activities , and related amounts reported in federal agencies ' financial statements and underlying financial information and records . the control deficiencies gao identified during its tests of the processes used to prepare the fiscal year 2007 cfs involved the following areas : documenting a key standard operating procedure for preparing the cfs , reporting in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles , reconciling distributed offsetting receipts , maintaining adequate control over spreadsheets used in preparing the cfs , monitoring internal control over the processes used to prepare the cfs , using interim financial information in the cfs preparation process , and various other control deficiencies that were identified in previous years ' audits but remained in fiscal year 2007. of the 81 open recommendations gao reported in july 2007 regarding the processes used to prepare the cfs , 35 were closed and 46 remained open as of december 10 , 2007 , the date of our report on our audit of the fiscal year 2007 cfs . gao will continue to monitor the status of corrective actions taken to address the 10 new recommendations and the new remaining balance of 56 open recommendations during its fiscal year 2008 audit of the cfs .
in its role as the nation 's tax collector , the internal revenue service ( irs ) has a demanding responsibility to annually collect trillions of dollars in taxes , process hundreds of millions of tax and information returns , and enforce the nation 's tax laws . since its first audit of irs 's financial statements in fiscal year 1992 , gao has identified a number of weaknesses in irs 's financial management operations . in related reports , gao has recommended corrective actions to address those weaknesses . each year , as part of the annual audit of irs 's financial statements , gao makes recommendations to address any new weaknesses identified and follows up on the status of irs 's efforts to address the weaknesses gao identified in previous years ' audits . the purpose of this report is to provide the status of audit recommendations and actions needed to fully address them and demonstrate how the recommendations relate to control activities central to irs 's mission and goals . irs has made significant progress in improving its internal controls and financial management since its first financial statement audit in 1992 , as evidenced by 9 consecutive years of clean audit opinions on its financial statements , the resolution of several material internal control weaknesses , and actions resulting in the closure of over 200 financial management recommendations . this progress has been the result of hard work throughout irs and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency . however , irs still faces financial management challenges . at the beginning of gao 's audit of irs 's fiscal year 2008 financial statements , 81 financial management - related recommendations from prior audits remained open because irs had not fully addressed the issues that gave rise to them . during the fiscal year 2008 financial audit , irs took actions that gao considered sufficient to close 35. at the same time , gao identified additional internal control issues resulting in 16 new recommendations . in total , 62 recommendations remain open . to assist irs in evaluating and improving internal controls , gao categorized the 62 open recommendations by various internal control activities , which , in turn , were grouped into three broad control categories . the continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle that irs needs to overcome . effective implementation of gao 's recommendations can greatly assist irs in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management and can help enable it to more effectively carry out its tax administration responsibilities . most can be addressed in the short term ( the next 2 years ) . however , a few recommendations , particularly those concerning irs 's automated systems , are complex and will require several more years to effectively address .
under the superfund program , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) places the most seriously contaminated sites on the national priorities list ( npl ) . epa may compel site cleanups by parties responsible for contamination , or conduct cleanups itself and have these parties reimburse its costs . the program is funded by a trust fund , which is largely supported by general fund appropriations . gao was asked to examine epa 's enforcement action outcomes and the factors parties consider in reaching these outcomes ; any trends in litigation to resolve superfund liability ; and the program 's status and costs . gao obtained and analyzed superfund program data from epa , as well as data on superfund litigation from cases filed in u.s. district courts . gao also interviewed epa officials and other superfund experts through fiscal year 2007 , 80 percent of epa 's completed enforcement actions resulted in agreements with responsible parties , and these actions yielded an estimated $ 29.9 billion in recovered costs , work commitments , and other results . while most of this value came from work commitments , responsible parties more often agreed to reimburse epa for its cleanup costs than to conduct site work . epa , the department of justice , and responsible parties make settlement decisions on the basis of site - specific characteristics , but generally also take into account site cleanup costs , the strength of the evidence of a party 's liability for site contamination , and the number and types of responsible parties identified , among other considerations . superfund litigation -- as measured by the number , duration , and complexity of cases -- decreased from fiscal years 1994 through 2007 , the period for which data were available . over this period , the number of superfund cases filed annually in u.s. district courts decreased by almost 50 percent . also , litigation in federally - initiated cases decreased as settlements prior to filing cases in court were reached more often , shortening court time . furthermore , cases became less complex as fewer defendants were involved . litigation costs can be substantial , according to experts , and such costs may have decreased as a result of these trends . litigation decreased because fewer sites were listed on the npl , and , as cleanups progressed , fewer sites required cleanup and parties had less reason to go to court ; epa promoted settlements with responsible parties ; and the courts clarified several legal uncertainties . as of fiscal year 2007 , epa or responsible parties completed construction of remedial actions at about 70 percent of the nonfederal npl sites , with program appropriations averaging about $ 1.2 billion annually . however , gao identified superfund program trends that make it difficult to predict future program costs . the number of sites added to the npl each year has declined ; epa added over 400 sites in fiscal year 1983 , but only 20 sites a year , on average , for fiscal years 1998 through 2007. the types of sites have also changed , as mining sites -- among the most expensive sites to clean up -- have been added to the npl in greater numbers . at the same time , because of limitations in epa 's data , the extent to which npl sites do not have viable parties to assist with cleanups and how this may impact epa 's cost recovery efforts are unclear . further , while remedial actions have been completed or are underway at most npl sites , data limitations make it difficult to quantify the amount of work remaining . also , npl sites that have not yet been cleaned up may be more complex and expensive . finally , program appropriations and expenditures are declining , while epa 's costs for individual sites are increasing . however , epa does not provide the congress with sufficient information to make program funding decisions . for example , epa does not provide aggregated information on the status and cost of work at sites not yet cleaned up or the extent to which it can not identify viable parties . as a result , it is unclear how much funding for future cleanup activities will have to come from trust fund appropriations rather than from responsible parties .
as demand for transit and competition for available federal funding increases , transit project sponsors are increasingly looking to alternative approaches , such as public - private partnerships , to deliver and finance new , large - scale public transit projects more quickly and at reduced costs . gao reviewed the role of the private sector in u.s. public transit projects as compared to international projects ; the benefits and limitations of and barriers , if any , to greater private sector involvement in transit projects and how these barriers are addressed in the department of transportation 's ( dot ) pilot program ; and how project sponsors and dot can protect the public interest when these approaches are used . gao reviewed regulations , studies , and contracts and interviewed u.s. , canadian , and united kingdom officials ( identified by experts in the use of these approaches ) . in the united states , the private sector role in delivering and financing transit projects through alternative approaches , such as public - private partnerships , has been more limited than in international projects . the private sector role in u.s. projects has focused more on how they are delivered rather than how they are financed , while the private sector role in international projects has focused on both project delivery and financing . since 2000 , seven new large - scale construction projects funded through fta 's fixed guideway capital investment program -- new starts program -- have been completed using one of two alternative project delivery approaches , and none of these projects included private sector financing . in 2005 , congress authorized fta to establish a pilot program to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative approaches and how the new starts program could better allow for them . alternative approaches can offer potential benefits such as a greater likelihood of completing projects on time and on budget , but also involve limitations such as less project sponsor control over operations . the sequential and phased new starts process is a barrier because it is incompatible with alternative approaches and thus does not allow for work to be completed concurrently , which can lead to delays and increased costs . under its pilot program , fta can grant major streamlining modifications to the new starts process for up to three project sponsors , but has not yet granted any such modifications because fta has found that none of the projects has transferred enough risk , in particular financial responsibilities , to the private sector . fta has the ability within its pilot program to further experiment with the use of long - standing existing tools that could encourage a greater private sector role while continuing to balance the need to protect the public interest . this includes forms of conditional funding approvals used by other dot agencies and international governments . fta also lacks an evaluation plan to accurately and reliably assess the pilot program 's results , including the effect of its efforts to streamline the new starts process for pilot project sponsors . without such a plan , agencies and congress will be limited in their decision making regarding the pilot program . transit project sponsors protect the public interest in alternative approaches through , for example , the use of performance standards and financial assessments to evaluate the costs and benefits of proposed approaches . other governments have established entities to assist project sponsors in protecting the public interest . these entities have better equipped project sponsors to implement alternative approaches by creating a uniform approach to developing project agreements and serving as a repository of institutional knowledge . dot can serve as a valuable resource for transit project sponsors by broadening its current efforts , including providing technical assistance and encouraging the use of additional financial assessments , among other measures .
in response to concerns about the nation 's energy dependence on imported oil , climate change , and other issues , the federal government has encouraged the use of biofuels . water plays a crucial role in all stages of biofuel production -- from cultivation of feedstock through its conversion into biofuel . as demand for water from various sectors increases and places additional stress on already constrained supplies , the effects of expanded biofuel production may need to be considered . to understand these potential effects , gao was asked to examine the known water resource effects of biofuel production in the united states ; agricultural conservation practices and technological innovations that could address these effects and any barriers to their adoption ; and key research needs regarding the effects of water resources on biofuel production . to address these issues , gao reviewed scientific studies , interviewed experts and federal and state officials , and selected five states to study their programs and plans related to biofuel production . gao is not making any recommendations in this report . a draft of this report was provided to the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , energy ( doe ) , and the interior ( doi ) ; and the environmental protection agency ( epa ) . usda , doe , and doi concurred with the report and , in addition to epa , provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . the extent to which increased biofuels production will affect the nation 's water resources depends on the type of feedstock selected and how and where it is grown . for example , to the extent that this increase is met from the cultivation of conventional feedstocks , such as corn , it could have greater water resource impacts than if the increase is met by next generation feedstocks , such as perennial grasses and woody biomass , according to experts and officials . this is because corn is a relatively resource - intensive crop , and in certain parts of the country requires considerable irrigated water as well as fertilizer and pesticide application . however , experts and officials noted that next generation feedstocks have not yet been grown on a commercial scale and therefore their actual effects on water resources are not fully known at this time . water is also used in the process of converting feedstocks to biofuels , and while the efficiency of biorefineries producing corn ethanol has increased over time , the amount of water required for converting next generation feedstocks into biofuels is still not well known . finally , experts generally agree that it will be important to take into account the regional variability of water resources when choosing which feedstocks to grow and how and where to expand their production in the united states . the use of certain agricultural practices , alternative water sources , and technological innovations can mitigate the effects of biofuels production on water resources , but there are some barriers to their widespread adoption . according to experts and officials , agricultural conservation practices can reduce water use and nutrient runoff , but they are often costly to implement . similarly , alternative water sources , such as brackish water , may be viable for some aspects of the biofuel conversion process and can help reduce biorefineries ' reliance on freshwater . however , the high cost of retrofitting plants to use these water sources may be a barrier , according to experts and officials . finally , innovations -- such as dry cooling systems and thermochemical processes -- have the potential to reduce the amount of water used by biorefineries , but many of these innovations are currently not economically feasible or remain untested at the commercial scale . many of the experts gao spoke with identified several areas where additional research is needed . these needs fall into two broad areas : feedstock cultivation and biofuel conversion and data on water resources . for example , some experts noted the need for further research into improved crop varieties , which could help reduce water and fertilizer needs . in addition , several experts identified research that would aid in developing next generation feedstocks . for example , several experts said research is needed on how to increase cultivation of algae for biofuel to a commercial scale and how to control for potential water quality problems . in addition , several experts said research is needed on how to optimize conversion technologies to help ensure water efficiency . finally , some experts said that better data on water resources in local aquifers and surface water bodies would aid in decisions about where to cultivate feedstocks and locate biorefineries .
the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) overarching mission is to protect human health and the environment by implementing and enforcing environmental laws intended to improve the quality of the nation 's air and water and to protect its land . epa 's policies and programs affect virtually all segments of the economy , society , and government . as such , it operates in a highly complex and controversial regulatory arena . in recent years , gao has identified several key challenges epa faces and corrective actions that would enable the agency to more effectively accomplish its mission . gao was asked to identify challenges at epa that hinder its ability to implement its programs effectively , based on prior gao work . these challenges include improving agencywide management , transforming epa 's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals , improving implementation of the clean air act , reducing pollution in the nation 's waters , speeding the pace of cleanup at superfund and other hazardous waste sites , and addressing emerging climate change issues . epa faces the following challenges that hinder its ability to implement its programs effectively : improving agencywide management , transforming epa 's processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals , improving implementation of the clean air act , reducing pollution in the nation 's waters , speeding the pace of cleanup at superfund and other hazardous waste sites , and addressing emerging climate change issues . epa has launched various initiatives to address crosscutting general management issues , including environmental enforcement and compliance , human capital management , and the development and use of environmental information . however , these initiatives have generally fallen considerably short of their intended results . epa has failed to develop sufficient chemical assessment information to limit public exposure to many chemicals that may pose substantial health risks . in january 2009 , gao added a new issue -- the need to transform epa 's process for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals -- to its list of high - risk areas warranting increased attention by congress and the executive branch . epa faces many important challenges related to implementation of the clean air act , including those highlighted by gao regarding its coordination with other federal agencies , analyses of health impacts from air pollution , and delays in regulating mercury and other air toxics . epa also faces challenges relating to numerous regulatory proposals that have been overturned or remanded by the courts . epa partners with federal , state , and local agencies and others to reduce pollution in the nation 's waters . among the most daunting water pollution control problems , the nation 's water utilities face billions of dollars in upgrades to aging and deteriorating infrastructures that left unaddressed can affect the quality of our water . epa will receive $ 6 billion in additional water infrastructure funding from the recently passed stimulus bill . congress passed the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act , better known as superfund , in 1980 , giving the federal government the authority to ensure the cleanup of hazardous waste sites both on private and public lands . nonetheless , several key management problems have not been resolved since that time . for example , citing competing priorities and lack of funds , epa has not implemented a 1980 statutory mandate under superfund to require businesses handling hazardous substances to provide financial assurances to pay for potential environmental cleanups . in gao 's view , the federal government 's approach to climate change has been ad hoc and is not well coordinated across government agencies . for example , the federal government lacks a comprehensive approach for targeting federal research dollars toward the development and deployment of low - carbon technologies .
state juvenile justice systems face critical problems when it comes to juvenile delinquency issues such as reentry -- when offenders return home from incarceration -- and substance abuse . gao was asked to review juvenile reentry and substance abuse program research and efforts by the department of justice 's ( doj ) office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) to provide information on effective programs ( i.e . , whether a program achieves its intended goal ) and cost - beneficial programs ( i.e . , whether the benefits of programs exceeded their costs ) . this report addresses expert opinion and available research on these types of reentry and substance abuse programs , the extent to which ojjdp assesses its efforts to disseminate information on effective programs , and ojjdp 's plans to accomplish its research and evaluation goals . gao , among other things , reviewed academic literature , and ojjdp 's dissemination efforts and research goals . gao also interviewed ojjdp officials and a nonprobability sample of 26 juvenile justice experts selected based on their experience with juvenile reentry and substance abuse issues . the majority of the juvenile justice reentry and substance abuse experts gao interviewed cited evidence that shows cognitive behavioral therapy -- programs that help individuals change their beliefs in order to change their behavior -- and family therapy -- programs that treat juveniles by focusing on improving communication with family members -- are effective and cost beneficial when addressing reentry and substance abuse issues . for example , two juvenile reentry experts cited studies showing that 1 year after participating in a cognitive behavioral therapy program , participants were less likely to commit another offense than nonparticipants . additionally , experts cited a study that reported that a family therapy program provides about $ 80,000 in savings per participant when accounting for savings from a decline in crime , such as the cost the police would have incurred . most experts indicated that there was limited evidence on the effectiveness and cost benefits of reentry programs , such as aftercare -- programs that assist juvenile offenders in returning to their communities during the reentry process -- and substance abuse programs , such as drug courts -- specialized courts that provide programs for substance - abusing juveniles and their families . gao reviewed two ojjdp efforts that provide information on effective programs across the range of juvenile justice issues , the national training and technical assistance center ( nttac ) and the model programs guide . ojjdp has mechanisms in place to regularly assess the utility of the information provided by nttac , but does not have such a mechanism for the guide . ojjdp ensures the utility of nttac 's information through evaluations in accordance with federal guidelines that highlight the importance of regularly soliciting feedback from users . however , ojjdp could better ensure the utility of the information disseminated by the model programs guide by having a mechanism in place to solicit regular feedback from members of the juvenile justice field -- for example , program practitioners -- that is specifically related to the guide . ojjdp has articulated research and evaluation goals to support its mission of improving the juvenile justice system and is developing plans to assist in meeting these goals . ojjdp is required under the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act , as amended , to publish an annual program plan that describes planned activities under accounts authorized for research and evaluation activities , among other things . additionally , the office of management and budget ( omb ) recommended that ojjdp develop a comprehensive evaluation plan for juvenile justice programs . while ojjdp has not published an annual program plan since 2002 , in december of 2009 , it issued a proposed plan for public comment and aims to publish the final program plan once public comments are incorporated . additionally , although the office has considered developing a comprehensive evaluation plan to address omb recommendations , it had not previously done so because of a lack of resources . however , ojjdp is committed to developing a comprehensive evaluation plan once the program plan is finalized .
pakistan 's federally administered tribal areas ( fata ) has been a recognized safe haven for al qaeda leadership and a base for the taliban to launch cross - border attacks into afghanistan . the united states , in an effort to assist pakistan in addressing this threat , pledged $ 750 million between 2007 and 2011 to support development activities in the fata region . this report focuses on the extent u.s. development objectives align with u.s. national security goals and pakistan 's objectives , u.s. efforts to track the pledge , u.s. efforts to measure program performance in the fata , and efforts to monitor assistance in the fata . gao reviewed u.s. and pakistani documents and interviewed u.s. and pakistani officials in washington , d.c. , and pakistan . gao has prepared this report under the comptroller general 's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative . u.s. national security goals call for development assistance to aid the pakistani government in addressing terrorist threats emanating from the fata . gao found that u.s. development objectives in the fata are generally aligned with u.s. national security goals and pakistan 's fata development plans . in september 2007 , usaid and pakistan signed an agreement regarding development activities in the fata including the creation of joint strategic implementation plans for the seven fata geographic areas . we found , however , that the u.s. and pakistan have not yet completed such plans . the u.s. government has implemented two efforts to track its $ 750 million pledge in accordance with good management practices . state is tallying allocations of u.s. programs in pakistan 's western frontier region ( which includes the fata ) , and the usaid controller in islamabad has undertaken an effort to track most , but not all , u.s. development - related obligations and expenditures in the fata . as of the end of fiscal year 2009 , the u.s. government has reportedly allocated over $ 728 million toward the pledge . usaid and state collect reports on the performance of their fata - specific programs . however , key elements , such as identification of evaluation efforts and a timeline for reviewing implementing partner reports required by usaid 's regulations are missing in its performance management plan for the fata . also , state did not collect all the required project performance documentation . long - term development programs for which performance could be measured against annual targets generally did not achieve targets . although hampered by security challenges that prevent direct monitoring called for in its guidance , usaid has taken steps to apply a set of indirect monitoring procedures . this includes collecting information from implementing partners and locally employed staff , and the use of a geographic information system . while usaid officials told gao they use these methods , gao found that usaid did not always document the use of these monitoring procedures . gao also found that state has several monitoring procedures , but had not fully documented their use of these procedures .
because marine mammals , such as whales and dolphins , often inhabit waters where commercial fishing occurs , they can become entangled in fishing gear , which may injure or kill them -- this is referred to as `` incidental take . . the 1994 amendments to the marine mammal protection act ( mmpa ) require the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to establish take reduction teams for certain marine mammals to develop measures to reduce their incidental takes . gao was asked to determine the extent to which nmfs can accurately identify the marine mammal stocks -- generally a population of animals of the same species located in a common area -- that meet the mmpa 's requirements for establishing such teams , has established teams for those stocks that meet the requirements , has met the mmpa 's deadlines for the teams subject to them , and evaluates the effectiveness of take reduction regulations . gao reviewed the mmpa , and nmfs data on marine mammals , and take reduction team documents and obtained the views of nmfs officials , scientists , and take reduction team members . significant limitations in available data make it difficult for nmfs to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams . for most stocks , nmfs relies on incomplete , outdated , or imprecise data on stocks ' population size or mortality to calculate the extent of incidental take . as a result , the agency may overlook some marine mammal stocks that meet the mmpa 's requirements for establishing teams or inappropriately identify others as meeting them . nmfs officials told gao they are aware of the data limitations but lack funding to implement their plans to improve the data . on the basis of nmfs 's available information , gao identified 30 marine mammal stocks that have met the mmpa 's requirements for establishing a take reduction team , and nmfs has established six teams that cover 16 of them . for the other 14 stocks , the agency has not complied with the mmpa 's requirements . for example , false killer whales , found off the hawaiian islands , have met the statutory requirements since 2004 , but nmfs has not established a team for them because , according to nmfs officials , the agency lacks sufficient funds . nmfs officials told gao that the agency has not established teams for the other stocks that meet the mmpa 's requirements for reasons such as the following : data on these stocks are outdated or incomplete , and the agency lacks funds to obtain better information and causes other than fishery - related incidental take , such as sonar used by the u.s. navy , may contribute to their injury or death , therefore changes to fishing practices would not solve the problem . for the five take reduction teams subject to the mmpa 's deadlines , the agency has had limited success in meeting the deadlines for establishing teams , developing draft take reduction plans , and publishing proposed and final plans and regulations to implement them . for example , nmfs established three of the five teams -- the atlantic large whale , pelagic longline , and bottlenose dolphin -- from 3 months to over 5 years past the deadline . nmfs officials attributed the delays in establishing one of the teams to a lack of information about stock population size and mortality , which teams need to consider before developing draft take reduction plans . nmfs does not have a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of take reduction plans and implementing regulations that have been implemented . nmfs has taken some steps to define goals , monitor compliance , and assess whether the goals have been met , but shortcomings in its approach and limitations in its performance data weaken its ability to assess the success of its take reduction regulations . for example , without adequate information about compliance , if incidental takes continue once the regulations have been implemented , it will be difficult to determine whether the regulations were ineffective or whether the fisheries were not complying with them .
in 2008 , the department of state ( state ) estimated nearly 5 million u.s. citizens lived overseas , and 64 million trips were taken overseas by u.s. citizens . since protecting and serving u.s. citizens abroad are among state 's chief priorities , state must be prepared to provide emergency assistance to americans abroad . this report describes what services state provides to u.s. citizens who are the victims of crimes , suffer accidents , or otherwise need emergency services ; how state is prepared to assist u.s. citizens who are in need of emergency services ; and how state monitors the assistance it provides to u.s. citizens in need of emergency services . state provides a number of emergency services to american citizens abroad through its network of 267 embassies and consulates in 174 countries . state 's emergency services cover circumstances including deaths , arrests , medical or financial concerns , crime , and missing persons ' cases . state provides emergency assistance to americans at all hours , and provides information such as travel warnings to travelers and u.s. citizens living overseas through a variety of mechanisms , including the department 's embassy and consulate web sites . however , our review of a random sample of posts ' web sites found that only 14 percent had emergency phone numbers on the web sites ' main page . state also maintains a warden system to disseminate information from the embassy to u.s. citizens living in the country , and can send messages directly to americans who provide contact information to the department . state has trained staff dedicated to providing emergency assistance overseas as well as in washington , d.c. depending on the size of the post , american citizen services ( acs ) may be provided by multiple staff , or a single consular officer serving as the sole provider of all consular services including emergency services . locally engaged staff are a key component of posts ' provision of emergency services , as is state 's ability to deploy staff where needed when emergencies arise . state provides guidance , largely through the foreign affairs manual , formal on - the - job training , and other resources to ensure staff are able to carry out these services . the bureau of consular affairs has a variety of mechanisms to monitor its provision of emergency services ; however , all of these mechanisms have limitations and , as a result , consular affairs can not be assured it is allocating its resources effectively . the acs system , which is intended to track emergency services provided by posts , and the consular package , which provides post - specific workload information to guide consular resource allocations , both contain unreliable data . for example , reporting weaknesses and unclear guidance associated with the acs system prevent posts from accurately monitoring and evaluating their workload or using the data to make management decisions . although state shifts its consular resources to meet emergency demands , absent current and reliable data on the worldwide demand for emergency services , consular affairs may not make decisions based on a clear understanding of the global workload .
in december 2003 , gao reported that most of alaska 's more than 200 native villages were affected to some degree by flooding and erosion ( gao - 04-142 ) . since 2003 , state officials have identified the growing impacts of climate change , increasing the urgency of federal and state efforts to identify imminently threatened villages and assess their relocation options . gao was asked to report on the flooding and erosion threats that alaska native villages currently face , the federal programs that are available to assist villages facing potential disasters , the status of village relocation efforts , and how federal assistance to relocating villages is prioritized . gao interviewed and gathered documentation from federal and state agency officials as well as regional organizations and village representatives . while the flooding and erosion threats to alaska native villages have not been completely assessed , since 2003 , federal , state , and village officials have identified 31 villages that face imminent threats . the u.s. army corps of engineers ' ( corps ) march 2009 alaska baseline erosion assessment identified many villages threatened by erosion , but did not assess flooding impacts . at least 12 of the 31 threatened villages have decided to relocate -- in part or entirely -- or to explore relocation options . federal programs to assist threatened villages prepare for and recover from disasters and to protect and relocate them are limited and unavailable to some villages . the federal emergency management agency has several disaster preparedness and recovery programs , but villages often fail to qualify for them , generally because they may lack approved disaster mitigation plans or have not been declared federal disaster areas . although there is no single comprehensive proactive federal program to assist villages with their relocation efforts , individual federal agencies can assist villages on specific projects , such as funding the construction or relocation of homes . however , 64 villages do not qualify for affordable housing and relocation assistance from the department of housing and urban development 's community development block grant program because the federal law governing the program does not recognize unincorporated alaska native villages in alaska 's unorganized borough as eligible units of general local government . of the 12 villages exploring relocation options , newtok has made the most progress in its relocation efforts . the newtok planning group , formed in 2006 by federal , state , regional , and village partners , has helped to accelerate the relocation process that the village proactively initiated in 1994. the 3 other villages that will likely need to relocate all at once -- kivalina , shaktoolik , and shishmaref -- have yet to identify sites that federal , state , and village officials agree are safe , sustainable , and desirable for the subsistence lifestyle of the villagers . eight other villages have begun to gradually migrate to new locations over time or are evaluating options for doing so . in the absence of a lead entity , federal agencies individually prioritize assistance to villages on the basis of their programs ' criteria . these criteria do not necessarily ensure that the villages in greatest peril get the highest priority , and although the corps has assessed erosion threats , there is no lead federal entity to prioritize and coordinate assistance using this information . in 2007 , the newtok planning group reported that the lack of designated federal and state lead entities to guide , coordinate , and fund assistance impeded village relocation efforts and created uncertainty regarding the fulfillment of environmental analysis requirements under the national environmental policy act . in 2008 , the state designated a lead agency for village relocation assistance , and federal , state , and village officials told gao that a similar lead federal entity is needed . lead authority could be provided to an existing agency or commission , or a new entity could be formed for this purpose .
the federal transit administration ( fta ) oversees about $ 5.5 billion in federal funds each year to transit agencies serving urban areas ( grantee ) , in part through its triennial review program , which evaluates grantee adherence to federal requirements at least once every 3 years . gao recommended in a 1998 oversight report that fta improve the program . the subcommittee requested that gao review this program . gao identified the extent to which triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008 ; the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process ; and fta 's performance measures for the triennial review and the extent to which they meet key attributes of successful performance measures . gao addressed these objectives by analyzing oversight data on 424 grantees that had three triennial reviews , reviewing triennial review reports and guidance , assessing fta 's performance measures ; and interviewing fta headquarters and regional officials , contractors who conduct the reviews , and grantees . gao 's analysis of fta 's triennial review oversight data found that over two - thirds of the 424 grantees analyzed have not consistently improved overall performance in terms of meeting more federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008. fifty - one percent of grantees had mixed results in meeting requirements and 17 percent consistently met fewer requirements ; while 31 percent consistently met more requirements -- one of the goals of the triennial review program . executives from three grantees that met most requirements attributed their performance to , among other things , having job descriptions that link employee responsibilities to the triennial review -- a practice they said contributed to a culture of accountability . during the same time , grantees had the greatest number of findings in 5 of 23 triennial review areas , including the procurement and drug and alcohol testing areas . while fta helps grantees address findings , additional efforts to identify the underlying causes and the severity of findings could further benefit grantees . fta 's triennial review program uses some strong management practices -- having a well - defined process , using an information system to monitor grantees , and issuing reports timely . still , two areas could be strengthened . first , while fta is legislatively required to conduct a complete review of grantees ' adherence to federal requirements at least once every 3 years , gao identified a few instances where documentation does not clearly show that fta reviewed all requirement areas . for example , 10 triennial review reports for 2008 showed that the drug and alcohol program area was `` not reviewed . . fta 's practice is to review all areas , regardless of documentation , but because fta 's guidance is not clear about how to document the review of areas where fta has conducted a related special review in the prior two years , a few grantees may not be reviewed for 5 years . fta plans to revise its guidance to avoid ambiguity . second , fta is aware of the burden oversight reviews place on grantees and works to limit this burden . however , in a limited number of cases , fta did not coordinate its special oversight reviews with the triennial review schedule , which may place undue burden on a few grantees receiving multiple oversight reviews in the same fiscal year . fta 's two timeliness performance measures for assessing the triennial review program -- closing 80 percent of grantees ' deficient findings within 30 days of their due date and issuing 95 percent of the final triennial review reports within 30 days of completing a review -- meet some , but not all key attributes of successful measures . although both measures link throughout the organization , have measurable targets , are clearly stated , and do not overlap , the `` close findings '' measure does not meet the objectivity and reliability attribute . for example , data inaccuracies in past `` close findings '' data raised questions about the reliability of the measure . also , both measures do not assess the core program activity to evaluate grantees ' performance or governmentwide priorities , such as the quality of the triennial review program , and thus , as a whole , are not balanced , making it difficult for managers to not overemphasize one priority at the expense of others .
the new starts program is an important source of new capital investment in mass transportation . to be eligible for federal funding , a project must advance through the different project development phases of the new starts program , including alternatives analysis , preliminary engineering , and final design . the federal transit administration ( fta ) evaluates projects as a condition for advancement into each project development phase of the program . fta has acted recently to streamline the process . this report discusses the time it has generally taken for projects to move through the new starts process and what congress and fta have done to expedite the process and options that exist to expedite the process . in response to a legislative mandate , gao reviewed statutes , fta guidance and regulations , and project data . gao also interviewed department of transportation ( dot ) officials , projects sponsors , and industry stakeholders . insufficient data are available to describe the time it has taken for all projects to move through the new starts process . nevertheless , 9 of 40 projects that have received full funding grant agreements since 1997 , and had complete data available , had milestone dates that ranged from about 4 to 14 years to complete the project development phases . however , the data from these 9 projects are not generalizeable to the 40 new starts projects . fta has not historically retained all milestone data for every project , such as the dates that project sponsors apply to enter preliminary engineering and fta 's subsequent approval . although not required by its records retention policy , fta has retained milestone data from some projects longer than 2 years . however , gao was unable to obtain complete and reliable project milestone data from fta . fta officials acknowledged that , while not historically perfect , the agency has retained sufficient milestone data to help manage the new starts program . nevertheless , recognizing the importance of having complete milestone data , fta has taken several steps in recent years to more consistently collect and retain such data . in addition , gao found that project sponsors do not consistently retain milestone data for projects that have completed the new starts process . congress and fta have taken action to expedite projects through the new starts process . for example , legislative action created the public - private partnership pilot program ( penta - p ) to study the benefits of using public - private partnerships for certain new fixed - guideway capital projects , such as accelerating project delivery . in addition , fta has implemented administrative changes to expedite the new starts process . for example , fta has developed and offered training workshops for project sponsors and has introduced project delivery tools . these tools include checklists for project sponsors to improve their understanding of the requirements of each phase of the new starts process . project sponsors and industry stakeholders gao interviewed identified options to help expedite project development within the new starts program . these options include tailoring the new starts evaluation process to risks posed by the projects , using letters of intent more frequently , and applying policy and guidance changes only to future projects . each option has advantages and disadvantages to consider . in addition , fta must also strike the appropriate balance between expediting project delivery and maintaining the accountability of the program . for example , by signaling early federal support of projects , letters of intent could help project sponsors use potentially less costly and time - consuming alternative project delivery methods , such as design - build . however , such early support poses some risk . it is possible that with more frequent use of letters of intent , fta 's commitment authority could be depleted earlier than expected , which could affect the anticipated funding stream for future projects . furthermore , some options , like combining one or more statutorily required project development phases , would require legislative action .
the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) filing season is an enormous undertaking that includes processing tax returns , issuing refunds , and responding to taxpayer questions . irs 's efforts to ensure compliance begin during the filing season . gao was asked to assess irs 's 2009 filing season performance , identify ways to reduce taxpayers ' use of short - term , high - interest refund anticipation loans ( ral ) offered by paid preparers or banks , and identify ways to enhance compliance during processing . gao analyzed irs performance data , reviewed irs operations , interviewed irs officials , and reviewed its compliance programs and relevant statutes . irs processed 139 million returns and issued $ 298 billion in refunds as of october 2 , 2009. electronic filing , which provides irs with significant cost savings and taxpayers with faster refunds , increased to 68 percent of all returns filed . while taxpayers ' access to telephone assistors was better than last year , it remained lower than in 2007 in part because of calls about tax law changes . compared to 2005 through 2007 , irs reduced its goal for assistor answered calls in 2009 and set its 2010 goal at 71 percent . despite heavy call volume , the accuracy of irs responses to taxpayers ' questions remained above 90 percent . irs started a major data collection effort on why taxpayers call , but lacks a plan to analyze the data and improve telephone service . according to irs , issuing refunds faster reduces taxpayers ' use of rals , high - interest loans made by paid tax preparers or banks in anticipation of a refund . issuing refunds is a joint effort by irs , treasury 's financial management service , which checks for non - tax debt owed to the federal government , and the automated clearing house , which distributes funds . however , irs has not coordinated extensively with them to expedite refunds . further , irs has not studied the use of debit cards for unbanked taxpayers , which could also reduce taxpayers ' use of rals by providing faster and more secure refunds . irs automatically identifies and corrects select types of errors while processing tax returns . it could also correct tax returns that claim the hope credit , a tax credit to help offset qualified education expenses , for longer than the number of years allowed . however , irs lacks the authority to use prior years ' tax return information for this purpose . also , information reported by education institutions to taxpayers and irs about qualifying educational expenses on the form 1098-t is confusing for taxpayers and not useful for irs . many institutions report the total amount billed to students , but not what is actually paid after taking into account scholarships and grants . this results in some taxpayers under - claiming benefits , while others over - claim . finally , because form 1098-t can show the amount billed , which may not be the amount paid , irs is unable to use the information to automatically verify taxpayers ' claims for the credit through its computerized matching program .
to meet urgent needs , dod can issue undefinitized contract actions ( uca ) , which authorize contractors to begin work before reaching a final agreement on contract terms . such actions are considered to be a risky contract vehicle for the government because contractors lack incentives to control costs during this period . defense regulations provide that the government determination of contractors ' allowable profit or fee should reflect any reduced cost risk . pursuant to the 2008 national defense authorization act , gao assessed whether dod actions taken as required by the act have improved departmental insight and oversight of uca use and resulted in local commands meeting dod 's standards for documenting the basis for negotiating the contractor profit or fee , definitization timelines , and obligation amounts . gao reviewed relevant dod regulations and policies , and contract files for 83 randomly - selected ucas totaling $ 6.1 billion at eight local commands . the findings from this contract file review can not be generalized across dod . dod has taken several actions since august 2008 to enhance departmental insight into and oversight of ucas ; however data limitations hinder its full understanding of the extent to which they are used . dod issued policy that requires centralized , semi - annual reporting of undefinitized actions to gain insight in uca use , including information on reason for award , obligation amounts at award , and definitization timelines . over time , reporting requirements have evolved as dod has taken steps to clarify guidance on the types of contract actions to be reported . dod has also required components to submit management plans to describe actions taken for improved uca use . although these actions have helped enhance insight and oversight of uca use , not all ucas are included in the reports . of the 24 ucas gao reviewed that should have been included in the april 2009 semi - annual report , 8 actions valued at $ 439 million were unreported by the local commands to dod . implementation of dod 's recent policies and guidance on the use of ucas has varied at the local commands gao visited and the associated management standards were not fully met . for the 66 ucas gao reviewed that were eventually definitized , contracting officers generally did not document their consideration of cost risk to the contractor during the undefinitized period of work as required . in 34 cases , the weighted guideline worksheets were not used when required , nor any other documentation of how any reduced cost risk during the undefinitized period of performance was considered in determining the negotiation objective . this was particularly the case for cost - plus - award fee contracts where defense regulations are not clear about how any cost risks are to be considered and documented . even for the remaining 32 cases in which weighted guideline worksheets were used , the contracting officers ' basis for risk calculations were often not clear due to limitations of the weighted guideline documentation . other management standards were not always met . only 41 ucas -- about 50 percent of the actions gao reviewed -- met the 180-day definitization requirement . moreover , 66 of the 83 ucas gao reviewed were awarded with obligations near or above the 50 percent maximum .
in 2004 , the u.s. consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) estimated that 29,400 deaths in the united states were related to consumer products . as required under section 107 of the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 , this study reviews what is known about the relative incidence of preventable injuries and deaths among minority children associated with products intended for children 's use and also examines what actions cpsc has taken through its public information and education initiatives to minimize these injuries and deaths . to address these issues , we assessed injury and death data sources used by cpsc , compared cpsc 's consumer education efforts with key practices , and interviewed federal officials and groups representing the health and consumer interests of minority populations . few studies have assessed racial and ethnic differences in child death rates from injuries related to consumer products , and cpsc has not analyzed whether specific racial or ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by product hazards because of data limitations . these limitations include incomplete and inconsistent race and ethnicity data on emergency room reports and the inconsistent presence of product - related information on death certificates . in 2007 , race and ethnicity data were not coded in about 31 percent of cases in cpsc 's national electronic injury surveillance system ( neiss ) , which collects data from a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency rooms . in addition , the hospitals that do record race and ethnicity information in cpsc 's neiss system do so inconsistently , in part because of limited cpsc guidance . while death certificates may include more complete race and ethnicity information compared with nonfatal injury data from hospitals , related product information is not consistently documented on the certificates . despite this lack of data , cpsc has developed or modified some consumer information efforts to reach specific minority populations , but it has not assessed the results of these efforts . cpsc provides information in spanish for many of its outreach efforts , including its telephone hotline , web site , television , radio , and print publications . cpsc has also identified and established relationships with other organizations to help disseminate consumer safety information to minority communities . and while cpsc has used some consumer input to develop safety information , it has not assessed outreach efforts for specific audiences . cpsc has also established goals for its overall consumer information efforts , but not for its messages targeted to specific populations . in addition , cpsc relies on its neighborhood safety network , a group of organizations that have expressed interest in receiving product safety information , to share information with audiences that can be hard to reach , but the agency has not assessed whether these populations are receiving and using the information . organizations we contacted for this report , including neighborhood safety network members and children 's safety groups , generally reported using safety information provided by cpsc , but some offered suggestions for improvement of efforts to reach minority communities , such as providing safety information in other languages and additional exposure through broadcast media .
nasa 's constellation program is developing the ares i crew launch vehicle and the orion crew exploration vehicle as the agency 's first major efforts in a plan to return to the moon and eventually send humans to mars . gao has issued a number of reports and testimonies on various aspects of this program , and made several recommendations . gao was asked to assess nasa 's progress in implementing gao 's recommendations for the ares i and orion projects , and identify risks the program faces . gao analyzed nasa plans and schedules , risk mitigation information , and contract performance data relative to knowledge - based acquisition practices identified in prior gao reports , and interviewed government officials and contractors . nasa is still struggling to develop a solid business case -- including firm requirements , mature technologies , a knowledge - based acquisition strategy , a realistic cost estimate , and sufficient funding and time -- needed to justify moving the constellation program forward into the implementation phase . gaps in the business case include significant technical and design challenges for the orion and ares i vehicles , such as limiting vibration during launch , eliminating the risk of hitting the launch tower during lift off , and reducing the mass of the orion vehicle , represent considerable hurdles that must be overcome in order to meet safety and performance requirements ; and a poorly phased funding plan that runs the risk of funding shortfalls in fiscal years 2009 through 2012 , resulting in planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones . this approach has limited nasa 's ability to mitigate technical risks early in development and precludes the orderly ramp up of workforce and developmental activities . in response to these gaps , nasa delayed the date of its first crewed - flight and changed its acquisition strategy for the orion project . nasa acknowledges that funding shortfalls reduce the agency 's flexibility in resolving technical challenges . the program 's risk management system warned of planned work not being completed to support schedules and milestones . consequently , nasa is now focused on providing the capability to service the international space station and has deferred the capabilities needed for flights to the moon . though these changes to the overarching requirements are likely to increase the confidence level associated with a march 2015 first crewed flight , these actions do not guarantee that the program will successfully meet that deadline . nevertheless , nasa estimates that ares i and orion represent up to $ 49 billion of the over $ 97 billion estimated to be spent on the constellation program through 2020. while the agency has already obligated more than $ 10 billion in contracts , at this point nasa does not know how much ares i and orion will ultimately cost , and will not know until technical and design challenges have been addressed .
u.s. government agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) and the united states agency for international development ( usaid ) have spent billions of dollars to develop afghanistan . from fiscal years 2004 to 2008 , dod has reported obligations of about $ 1 billion for its commander 's emergency response program ( cerp ) , which enables commanders to respond to urgent humanitarian and reconstruction needs . as troop levels increase , dod officials expect the program to expand . under the authority of the comptroller general , gao assessed dod 's capacity to manage and oversee the cerp in afghanistan and coordination of projects with usaid . accordingly , gao interviewed dod and usaid officials , and examined program documents to identify workload , staffing , training , and coordination requirements . in afghanistan , gao interviewed key military personnel on the sufficiency of training , and their ability to execute assigned duties . although dod has used cerp to fund projects that it believes significantly benefit the afghan people , it faces significant challenges in providing adequate management and oversight because of an insufficient number of trained personnel . gao has frequently reported that inadequate numbers of management and oversight personnel hinders dod 's use of contractors in contingency operations . gao 's work also shows that high - performing organizations use data to make informed decisions about current and future workforce needs . dod has not conducted an overall workforce assessment to identify how many personnel are needed to effectively execute cerp . rather , individual commanders determine how many personnel will manage and execute cerp . personnel at all levels , including headquarters and unit personnel that gao interviewed after they returned from afghanistan or who were in afghanistan in november 2008 , expressed a need for more personnel to perform cerp program management and oversight functions . due to a lack of personnel , key duties such as performing headquarters staff assistance visits to help units improve contracting procedures and visiting sites to monitor project status and contractor performance were either not performed or inconsistently performed . per dod policy , dod personnel should receive timely and effective training to enable performance to standard during operations . however , key cerp personnel at headquarters , units , and provincial reconstruction teams received little or no training prior to deployment which commanders believed made it more difficult to properly execute and oversee the program . also , most personnel responsible for awarding and overseeing cerp contracts valued at $ 500,000 or less received little or no training prior to deployment and , once deployed , received a 1-hour briefing , which did not provide detailed information on the individual 's duties . as a result , frequent mistakes occurred , such as the omission of key clauses from contracts , which slowed the project approval process . as gao has reported in the past , poorly written contracts and statements of work can increase dod 's cost risk and could result in payment for projects that do not meet project goals or objectives . while mechanisms exist to facilitate coordination , dod and usaid lack information that would provide greater visibility on all u.s. government development projects . dod and usaid generally coordinate projects at the headquarters and unit level as well as through military - led provincial reconstruction teams which include usaid representatives . in addition , in november 2008 , usaid , dod and the department of state began participating in an interagency group composed of senior u.s. government civilians and dod personnel in afghanistan to enhance planning and coordination of development plans and related projects . however , complete project information is lacking , because dod and usaid use different databases . usaid has been tasked to develop a common database and is coordinating with dod to do so , but development is in the early stages and goals and milestones have not been established . without clear goals and milestones , it is unclear how progress will be measured or when it will be complete .
historically , the vast majority of va patients have been men , but that is changing . va provided health care to over 281,000 women veterans in 2008- - an increase of about 12 percent since 2006- - and the number of women veterans in the united states is projected to increase by 17 percent between 2008 and 2033. women veterans seeking care at va medical facilities need access to a full range of health care services , including basic gender - specific services -- such as cervical cancer screening -- and specialized gender - specific services -- such as treatment of reproductive cancers . this testimony , based on ongoing work , discusses gao 's preliminary findings on the on - site availability of health care services for women veterans at va facilities , the extent to which va facilities are following va policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans , and key challenges that va facilities are experiencing in providing health care services for women veterans . gao reviewed applicable va policies , interviewed officials , and visited 19 medical facilities -- 9 va medical centers ( vamc ) and 10 community - based outpatient clinics ( cboc ) -- and 8 vet centers . these facilities were chosen based in part on the number of women using services and whether facilities offered specific programs for women . the results from these site visits can not be generalized to all va facilities . gao shared this statement with va officials , and they generally agreed with the information presented . the va facilities gao visited provided basic gender - specific and outpatient mental health services to women veterans on site , and some facilities also provided specialized gender - specific or mental health services specifically designed for women on site . basic gender - specific services , including pelvic examinations , were available on site at all nine vamcs and 8 of the 10 cbocs gao visited . almost all of the medical facilities gao visited offered women veterans access to one or more female providers for their gender - specific care . the availability of specialized gender - specific services for women , including treatments after abnormal cervical cancer screenings and breast cancer , varied by service and facility . all va medical facilities refer female patients to non - va providers for obstetric care . some of the vamcs gao visited offered a broad array of other specialized gender - specific services on site , but all contracted or fee - based at least some services . among cbocs , the two largest facilities gao visited offered an array of specialized gender - specific care on site ; the other eight referred women to other va or non - va facilities for most of these services . outpatient mental health services for women were widely available at the vamcs and most vet centers gao visited , but were more limited at some cbocs . while the two larger cbocs offered group counseling for women and services specifically for women who have experienced sexual trauma in the military , the smaller cbocs tended to rely on vamc staff , often through videoconferencing , to provide mental health services . the extent to which the va medical facilities gao visited were following va policies that apply to the delivery of health care services for women veterans varied , but none of the facilities had fully implemented these policies . none of the vamcs and cbocs gao visited were fully compliant with va policy requirements related to privacy for women veterans in all clinical settings where those requirements applied . for example , many of the medical facilities gao visited did not have adequate visual and auditory privacy in their check - in areas . further , the facilities gao visited were in various stages of implementing va 's new initiative to provide comprehensive primary care for women veterans , but officials at some vamcs and cbocs reported that they were unclear about the specific steps they would need to take to meet the goals of the new policy . officials at facilities that gao visited identified a number of challenges they face in providing health care services to the increasing numbers of women veterans seeking va health care . one challenge was that space constraints have raised issues affecting the provision of health care services . for example , the number , size , or configuration of exam rooms or bathrooms sometimes made it difficult for facilities to comply with va requirements related to privacy for women veterans . officials also reported challenges hiring providers with specific training and experience in women 's health care and in mental health care , such as treatment for women veterans with post - traumatic stress disorder or who had experienced military sexual trauma .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 ( ndaa 2008 ) requires the departments of defense ( dod ) and veterans affairs ( va ) to jointly develop and implement comprehensive policies on the care , management , and transition of recovering servicemembers . the senior oversight committee ( soc ) -- jointly chaired by dod and va leadership -- has assumed responsibility for these policies . the ndaa 2008 also requires gao to report on the progress dod and va make in developing and implementing the policies . this statement provides preliminary information on the progress dod and va have made in jointly developing the comprehensive policies required in the ndaa 2008 and the challenges dod and va are encountering in the joint development and initial implementation of these policies . gao determined the current status of policy development by assessing the status reported by soc officials and analyzing supporting documentation . to identify challenges , gao interviewed the acting under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness , the executive director and chief of staff of the soc , the departmental co - leads for most of the soc work groups , the acting director of dod 's office of transition policy and care coordination , and other knowledgeable officials . dod and va have made substantial progress in jointly developing policies required by sections 1611 through 1614 of the ndaa 2008 in the areas of care and management , medical and disability evaluation , return to active duty , and transition of care and services received from dod to va. overall , gao 's analysis showed that as of march 2009 , 60 of the 76 requirements gao identified have been completed and the remaining 16 requirements are in progress . dod and va have completed all of the policy development requirements for medical and disability evaluations , including issuing a report on the feasibility and advisability of consolidating the dod and va disability evaluation systems , although the pilot for this approach is still ongoing . dod has also completed establishing standards for returning recovering servicemembers to active duty . more than two - thirds of the policy development requirements have been completed for the remaining two policy areas -- care and management and the transition of recovering servicemembers from dod to va. most of these requirements were addressed in a january 2009 dod directive - type memorandum that was developed in consultation with va. dod officials reported that more information will be provided in a subsequent policy instruction , which will be issued in june 2009. va also plans to issue related policy guidance in june 2009. dod and va officials told gao that they have experienced numerous challenges as they worked to jointly develop policies to improve the care , management , and transition of recovering servicemembers . according to officials , these challenges contributed to the length of time required to issue policy guidance , and in some cases the challenges have not yet been completely resolved . for example , the soc must still standardize key terminology relevant to policy issues affecting recovering servicemembers . dod and va agreement on key definitions for what constitutes `` mental health , '' for instance , is important for developing policies that define the scope , eligibility , and service levels for recovering servicemembers . recent changes affecting the soc may also pose future challenges to policy development . some officials have expressed concern that dod 's recent changes to staff supporting the soc have disrupted the unity of command because soc staff now report to three different officials within dod and va. however , it is too soon to determine how dod 's staffing changes will work . additionally , according to dod and va officials , the soc 's scope of responsibilities appears to be in flux . while the soc will remain responsible for policy matters for recovering servicemembers , a number of policy issues may now be directed to the dod and va joint executive council . despite this uncertainty , dod and va officials told gao that the soc 's work groups continue to carry out their responsibilities . gao shared the information contained in this statement with dod and va officials , and they agreed with the information gao presented .
the national weather service 's ( nws ) weather products are a vital component of the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) air traffic control system . in addition to providing aviation weather products developed at its own facilities , nws also provides staff onsite at each of faa 's en route centers -- the facilities that control high - altitude flight outside the airport tower and terminal areas . over the last few years , faa and nws have been exploring options for enhancing the efficiency of the aviation weather services provided at en route centers . gao was asked to summarize its draft report that determines the status and plans of efforts to restructure the center weather service units , evaluates efforts to establish a baseline of the current performance provided by these units , and evaluates challenges to restructuring them . nws and faa are considering plans to restructure the way aviation weather services are provided at en route centers , but it is not yet clear whether and how these changes will be implemented . in 2005 , faa requested that nws restructure its services by consolidating operations to a smaller number of sites , reducing personnel costs , and providing services 24 hours a day , seven days a week . nws developed two successive proposals , both of which were rejected by faa -- most recently because the costs were too high . faa subsequently requested that nws develop another proposal by late december 2008. in response , nws developed a third proposal that involves consolidating 20 of 21 existing center weather service units into 2 locations . nws sent this proposal to faa in early june 2009. faa officials stated that they plan to respond to nws 's proposal in early august 2009. in response to gao 's prior concerns that nws and faa lacked performance measures and a baseline of current performance , the agencies have agreed on five measures and nws has proposed eight others . in addition , the agencies initiated efforts to establish a performance baseline for 4 of 13 potential performance measures . however , the agencies have not established baseline performance for the other 9 measures . nws officials stated that they are not collecting baseline information on the 9 measures for a variety of reasons , including that some of the measures have not yet been approved by faa , and that selected measures involve products that have not yet been developed . while 4 of the 9 measures are tied to new products or services that are to be developed if nws 's latest restructuring proposal is accepted , the other 5 could be measured in the current operational environment . for example , both forecast accuracy and customer satisfaction measures are applicable to current operations . it is important to obtain an understanding of the current level of performance in these measures before beginning any efforts to restructure aviation weather services . without an understanding of the current level of performance , nws and faa may not be able to measure the success of any changes they make to the center weather service unit operations . as a result , any changes to the current structure could degrade aviation operations and safety -- and the agencies may not know it . nws and faa face challenges in their efforts to improve the current aviation weather structure . these include challenges associated with interagency collaboration , defining faa 's requirements , and aligning any changes with the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) -- a long - term initiative to increase the efficiency of the national airspace system . if the restructuring proposal is accepted , the agencies face three additional challenges in implementing it : developing a feasible schedule that includes adequate time for stakeholder involvement , undertaking a comprehensive demonstration to ensure no services are degraded , and effectively reconfiguring the infrastructure and technologies to the new structure . unless and until these challenges are addressed , the proposed restructuring of aviation weather services at en route centers has a reducedchance of success .
the institute of medicine ( iom ) estimated in 1999 that preventable medical errors cause as many as 98,000 deaths a year among hospital patients in the united states . congress passed the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 ( the patient safety act ) to encourage health care providers to voluntarily report information on medical errors and other events -- patient safety data -- for analysis and to facilitate the development of improvements in patient safety using these data . the patient safety act directed gao to report on the law 's effectiveness . this report describes progress by the department of health and human services , agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) to implement the patient safety act by creating a list of patient safety organizations ( pso ) so that these entities are authorized under the patient safety act to collect patient safety data from health care providers to develop improvements in patient safety , and implementing the network of patient safety databases ( npsd ) to collect and aggregate patient safety data . these actions are important to complete before the law 's effectiveness can be evaluated . to do its work , gao interviewed ahrq officials and their contractors . gao also conducted structured interviews with officials from a randomly selected sample of psos . ahrq has made progress listing 65 psos as of july 2009. however , at the time of gao 's review , few of the 17 psos randomly selected for interviews had entered into contracts to work with providers or had begun to receive patient safety data . pso officials told gao that some psos were still establishing aspects of their operations ; some were waiting for ahrq to finalize a standardized way for psos to collect data from providers ; and some psos were still engaged in educating providers about the confidentiality protections offered by the patient safety act . ahrq is in the process of developing the npsd and its associated components -- the common formats psos and providers will be required to use when submitting patient safety data to the npsd and a method for making patient safety data non - identifiable , or removing all information which could be used to identify a patient , provider , or reporter of patient safety information . if each of these components is completed on schedule , ahrq officials expect that the npsd could begin receiving patient safety data from hospitals by february 2011. ahrq officials could not provide a time frame for when they expect the npsd to be able to receive patient safety data from other providers . ahrq also has preliminary plans for how to allow the npsd to serve as an interactive resource for providers and psos and for how ahrq will analyze npsd data to help meet certain reporting requirements established by the patient safety act . according to ahrq officials , plans for more detailed analyses that could be useful for identifying strategies to reduce medical errors will be developed once the npsd begins to receive data .
many federal assistance programs are funded by formula grants that have historically relied at least in part on population data from the decennial census and related data to allocate funds . in june 2009 , the census bureau reported that in fiscal year 2007 the federal government obligated over $ 446 billion through funding formulas that rely at least in part on census and related data . funding for federal assistance programs continues to increase . government accountability office ( gao ) was asked to determine how much the federal government obligates to the largest federal assistance programs based on the decennial census and related data , and how the recovery act changed that amount ; and what factors could affect the role of population in grant funding formulas . to answer these objectives , gao identified the 10 largest federal assistance programs in each of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 based on data from the president 's fiscal year 2010 budget . gao reviewed statutes , agency reports , and other sources to obtain illustrative examples of how different factors could affect the role of population data in grant funding . gao 's analysis showed that each of the 10 largest federal assistance programs in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 relied at least in part on the decennial census and related data -- that is , data from surveys with designs that depend on the decennial census , or statistics , such as per capita income , that are derived from these data . for fiscal year 2008 , this totaled about $ 334.9 billion , representing about 73 percent of total federal assistance . for fiscal year 2009 , the estimated obligations of the 10 largest federal assistance programs totaled about $ 478.3 billion , representing about 84 percent of total federal assistance . this amount included about $ 122.7 billion funded by the recovery act and about $ 355.6 billion funded by other means . several factors can affect the role of population in grant funding formulas . when a formula includes variables in addition to total population , the role of population in the grant funding formula is less than if the formula relies solely on total population . all of the programs in gao 's review included one or more grants with formulas containing variables other than total population , such as the level of transit service provided . in addition , other factors can modify the amount that a state or local entity would have otherwise received under the formula . these factors include hold harmless provisions and caps ; small state minimums ; and funding floors and ceilings . with the application of these factors , grant funding may be affected less or entirely unaffected by changes in population .
the judicial conference of the united states , the federal judiciary 's principal policymaking body , uses 1,500 annual weighted case filings per authorized judgeship ( judgeship position ) in a bankruptcy court as an indicator of the need for additional bankruptcy judgeships for that court . total annual weighted case filings for any specific bankruptcy court is the sum of the weights associated with each of the cases filed in the court in a year . total annual weighted case filings per judgeship represent the estimated average amount of judge time that would be required to complete the cases filed in a specific bankruptcy court in a year . in may 2003 gao testified on whether weighted case filings were a reasonably accurate measure of the case - related workload of bankruptcy judges . the accuracy of weighted case filings rests in turn on the soundness of the methodology used to develop them . gao 's work focused on whether the methodologies used to develop the current case weights and to revise and update those weights were likely to result in reasonably accurate measures of bankruptcy judges ' case - related workload . this statement is based on gao 's may 2003 testimony on weighted case filings as a measure of bankruptcy judges ' case - related workload and documentation provided by the federal judicial center ( fjc ) in june 2009 on subsequent efforts to update the current weighted filings measure . in may 2003 gao reported that the methodology used to develop the case - related workload measure for federal bankruptcy judges -- weighted case filings -- were likely to result in reasonably accurate workload measures . the current study to revise those weights , begun in 2008 , uses the same methodology as the study used to develop the current case weights and , as designed , is also likely to result in reasonably accurate workload measures . the time demands on bankruptcy judges are largely a function of the number and complexity of the cases on their dockets , with some cases taking more time than others . to measure these differences , the judicial conference uses weighted case filings , which are a statistical measure of the average estimated judge time that specific types of bankruptcy cases are expected to take . each case filed is assigned a weight , and the total weight of all cases filed in a bankruptcy court divided by the number of judgeships for that court provides a measure of the total average case - related workload per judgeship . in assessing the need for new bankruptcy judgeships , the judicial conference relies on the weighted case filings to be a reasonably accurate measure of case - related bankruptcy judge workload . whether the weighted filings are reasonably accurate depends in turn upon the soundness of the methodology used to develop the case weights . on the basis of the documentation provided for our review and discussions with fjc and administrative office of the u.s. courts officials , gao concluded in 2003 that the case weights , as approved by the judicial conference in 1991 and 1996 , were likely to be reasonably accurate . the original case weights are now 18 years old . changes in the intervening years in case characteristics , case management practices , and the implementation of new statutory or procedural requirements , such as the many changes in 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , may have affected the continued accuracy of the current case weights . to the extent that the case weights now understate or overstate the total time demands on bankruptcy judges , use of the weights could potentially result in the judicial conference understating or overstating the need for additional bankruptcy judgeships . in 2008 , the federal judicial center began a study to revise the current case weights that is designed to collect data on the time bankruptcy judges spend on cases filed during 5 , 10-week data collection periods from may 2008 through may 2009. each active and recalled bankruptcy judge is to participate during one of the five reporting periods . this study design permits the development of new case weights based on the same type of objective time data as the current weights , which we found to be reasonable .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 required the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) to accelerate their exchange of health information and to develop systems or capabilities that allow for interoperability ( generally , the ability of systems to exchange data ) by september 30 , 2009. it also required compliance with federal standards and the establishment of a joint interagency program office to function as a single point of accountability for the effort . further , the act directed gao to semiannually report on the progress made in achieving these requirements . for this third report , gao evaluated the departments ' progress and plans toward sharing fully interoperable electronic health information that comply with federal standards and whether the interagency program office is positioned to function as a single point of accountability . to do so , gao analyzed agency documentation on project status and conducted interviews with agency officials . dod and va have taken steps to meet six objectives that they identifiedforachieving full interoperability in compliance with applicable standards ( see table ) by september 30 , 2009. specifically , the departments have achieved planned capabilities for three of the objectives -- refine social history data , share physical exam data , and demonstrate initial network gateway operation . for the remaining three objectives , the departments have partially achieved planned capabilities , with additional work needed to fully meet the objectives . regarding the objective to expand questionnaires and self - assessment tools , this additional work is intended to be completed by the deadline . the departments ' officials have stated that they intend to meet the objectives to expand dod 's inpatient medical records system and demonstrate initial document scanning ; however , additional work will be required beyond september to perform all the activities necessary to meet clinicians ' needs for health information . the dod / va interagency program office is not yet effectively positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of fully interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities between dod and va. while the departments have made progress in setting up the office by hiring additional staff , they continue to fill key leadership positions on an interim basis . further , while the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter , it is not yet fulfilling key information technology management responsibilities in the areas of performance measurement ( as gao previously recommended ) , project planning , and scheduling , which are essential to establishing the office as a single point of accountability for the departments ' interoperability efforts .
the nation 's wildland fire problems have worsened dramatically over the past decade , with more than a doubling of both the average annual acreage burned and federal appropriations for wildland fire management . the deteriorating fire situation has led the agencies responsible for managing wildland fires on federal lands -- the forest service in the department of agriculture and the bureau of indian affairs , bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , and national park service in the department of the interior -- to reassess how they respond to wildland fire and to take steps to improve their fire management programs . this testimony discusses progress the agencies have made in managing wildland fire and key actions gao believes are still necessary to improve their wildland fire management . this testimony is based on issued gao reports and reviews of agency documents and interviews with agency officials on actions the agencies have taken in response to previous gao findings and recommendations . the forest service and interior agencies have improved their understanding of wildland fire 's ecological role on the landscape and have taken important steps toward enhancing their ability to cost - effectively protect communities and resources by seeking to make communities and resources less susceptible to being damaged by wildland fire and respond to fire so as to protect communities and important resources at risk while also considering both the cost and long - term effects of that response . to help them do so , the agencies have reduced potentially flammable vegetation in an effort to keep wildland fires from spreading into the wildland - urban interface and to help protect important resources by lessening a fire 's intensity ; sponsored efforts to educate homeowners about steps they can take to protect their homes from wildland fire ; and provided grants to help homeowners carry out these steps . the agencies have also made improvements that lay important groundwork for enhancing their response to wildland fire , including adopting new guidance on how managers in the field are to select firefighting strategies , improving the analytical tools that assist managers in selecting a strategy , and improving how the agencies acquire and use expensive firefighting assets . despite the agencies ' efforts , much work remains . gao has previously recommended several key actions that , if completed , would substantially improve the agencies ' management of wildland fire . specifically , the agencies should : develop a cohesive strategy laying out various potential approaches for addressing the growing wildland fire threat , including estimating costs associated with each approach and the trade - offs involved . such information would help the agencies and congress make fundamental decisions about an effective and affordable approach to responding to fires . establish a cost - containment strategy that clarifies the importance of containing costs relative to other , often - competing objectives . without such clarification , gao believes managers in the field lack a clear understanding of the relative importance that the agencies ' leadership places on containing costs and are therefore likely to continue to select firefighting strategies without duly considering the costs of suppression . clarify financial responsibilities for fires that cross federal , state , and local jurisdictions . unless the financial responsibilities for multijurisdictional fires are clarified , concerns that the existing framework insulates nonfederal entities from the cost of protecting the wildland - urban interface from fire -- and that the federal government would thus continue to bear more than its share of the cost -- are unlikely to be addressed . take action to mitigate the effects of rising fire costs on other agency programs . the sharply rising costs of managing wildland fires have led the agencies to transfer funds from other programs to help pay for fire suppression , disrupting or delaying activities in these other programs . better methods of predicting needed suppression funding could reduce the need to transfer funds from other programs .
the missile defense agency ( mda ) has spent about $ 56 billion and will spend about $ 50 billion more through 2013 to develop a ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) . this testimony is based on two reviews gao was directed to conduct in 2008. in addition to our annual review assessing the annual cost , testing , schedule , and performance progress mda made in developing bmds , we have also reported on mda 's targets program . in this testimony we discuss the productivity of mda 's recent test program , the consequences of the testing shortfalls , and key factors that should be considered as mda revises its approach to testing . gao assessed contractor cost , schedule , and performance ; tests completed ; and the assets fielded during 2008. gao also reviewed pertinent sections of the u.s. code , acquisition policy , and the activities of a new missile defense board . the scale , complexity , cost and safety associated with testing the missile defense system constitute a unique challenge for mda , test agencies and other oversight organizations . this challenge is heightened by the fact that missile defense assets are developed , produced , and fielded concurrently . overall , during fiscal year 2008 , testing has been less productive than planned . while mda completed several key tests that demonstrated enhanced performance of bmds , all elements of the system had test delays and shortfalls , in part due to problems with the availability and performance of target missiles . gmd in particular was unable to conduct either of its two planned intercept attempts in fiscal year 2008. while it did subsequently conduct one in december 2008 , it was not able to achieve all primary objectives because the target failed to release its countermeasures . as a result , aspects of the fielded ground - launched kill vehicles may not be demonstrated since no more flight tests have been approved . target missiles continue as a persistent problem in fiscal year 2008 as poor target performance caused several tests to either fail in part or in whole . testing shortfalls have had several consequences . first , they have delayed the validation of models and simulations , which are needed to assess the system 's overall performance . as a result , the performance of the fielded bmds as a whole can not yet be determined . second , the production and fielding of assets has continued and in some cases has gotten ahead of testing . for example , enhanced exoatmospheric kill vehicles will now be produced and delivered before they are flight tested . third , mda has relied on a reduced basis -- fewer test , model , and simulation results -- to declare capabilities as operational in the field . mda has undertaken a three - phase review of the entire bmds test program that involves identifying critical variables that have not been proven to date , determining what test scenarios are needed to collect the data , and developing an affordable , prioritized schedule of flight and ground tests . this review , as long as it continues to involve test and evaluation organizations , appears to offer a sound approach for closing the gaps that exist between testing , modeling , and simulation . critical to being able to implement the approach will be addressing the factors that have limited the productivity of the current test approach , such as the availability and performance of targets . an additional consideration in a new testing approach must be to ensure that assets are sufficiently tested before they are produced and fielded . an important consideration in this regard is for modeling , simulation , and testing events to be re - synchronized so that they properly inform decisions on producing , fielding , and declaring assets operational . contingency plans could then be formed for adjusting the pace of these decisions should shortfalls occur in modeling , simulation , or testing . because mda has indicated implementation will take time , managing the transition may need to include reassessing the ambitious fiscal year 2009 test plan . in the mean time , mda will have to be prudent in making decisions to produce and field assets .
in 1995 , the department of defense ( dod ) began an effort to implement a standard departmentwide travel system -- the defense travel system ( dts ) . as part of its ongoing monitoring , gao 's april 2008 testimony before this subcommittee highlighted challenges confronted by the department in its implementation efforts . gao 's testimony today is based on its current follow - up work conducted at the request of this subcommittee , as well as the subcommittee on readiness . gao 's testimony today focuses on the actions dod has taken to implement previous gao recommendations regarding implementation of dts and related travel policies , phase out legacy travel systems and their associated costs , and implement electronic travel voucher processing . to address these objectives , gao analyzed specific documentation , such as test documentation , travel policies , and budget data , and interviewed appropriate dod travel personnel . gao has made 14 recommendations aimed at improving dod 's management oversight and implementation of dts and related travel policies to make dts the standard departmentwide travel system . gao considers 7 of the 14 recommendations closed and the remaining 7 recommendations as being open . the 7 closed recommendations pertained to premium - class travel , unused airline tickets , use of restricted airfare , proper testing of system interfaces , and streamlining of certain travel processes , such as the process for approving travel voucher expenses . gao 's analysis of the 7 closed recommendations found that the actions taken by the department responded to the intent of the recommendations . of the 7 open recommendations , 3 related to the adequacy of dts 's requirements management and system testing , 3 to dts underutilization , and 1 to developing an approach that will permit the use of automated methods to reduce the need for hard copy receipts to substantiate travel expenses . in the area of requirements management and testing , gao found that while dts 's requirements management and testing process has improved , problems still persist . the problems were generally related to missing documentation , the limited scope of requirements testing performed , or both . in the area of dts utilization , gao found that the department still does not have in place the metrics to determine the number of manual travel vouchers that should have been processed through dts . further , dod does not have accurate and complete information on the number of legacy travel systems that are still in use by the military services . defense travel management office ( dtmo ) data indicates that there are 23 legacy travel systems , but military services ' data identify 12- - 10 of which are on the dtmo list . in addition , gao found that the department lacks visibility of the cost to operate and maintain these legacy systems . the dtmo and the military services could only provide limited cost data for each identified legacy travel system and the department 's fiscal year 2009 information technology budget contained cost data for only 3 of the 23 systems on the dtmo list . according to the military services , some of the legacy systems will be needed even after dts has been deployed to all intended locations because dts will not include certain functionality , such as the processing of civilian permanent duty travel . without a valid inventory of legacy travel systems , it is unlikely that dod management or the congress will receive reliable reports regarding when duplicative systems are likely to be eliminated and the annual savings available from avoiding the associated operating and maintenance costs . finally , gao found that there is a significant difference between the costs of processing a travel voucher manually and electronically . based upon departmental data , the fee charged to process a travel voucher manually is about 15 times greater than electronic voucher processing -- approximately $ 37 manually and $ 2.50 electronically . shutting down legacy travel systems , which require manual processing , would provide cost savings to the department related to the processing of travel vouchers .
the small business innovation development act of 1982 established the small business innovation research program ( sbir ) to stimulate technological innovation , use small businesses to meet federal research and development ( r & d ) needs , foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r & d . since the program 's inception , gao has conducted numerous reviews of the sbir program . this statement summarizes gao 's past findings on the sbir program 's successes and challenges , data collection issues that affect program monitoring and evaluation , and how agencies make eligibility determinations for the program . gao is not making any new recommendations in this statement . between july 1985 and june 1999 , gao found that the sbir program was achieving its goals to enhance the role of small businesses in federal r & d , stimulate commercialization of research results , and support the participation of small businesses owned by women and / or disadvantaged persons . more specifically , gao found that throughout the life of the program , awards have been based on technical merit and are generally of good quality . in addition , the sbir program successfully attracts many qualified companies , has had a high level of competition , consistently has had a high number of first - time participants , and attracts hundreds of new companies annually . further , sbir has helped serve agencies ' missions and r & d needs ; although gao found that agencies differ in the emphasis they place on funding research to support their mission versus more generalized research . during these reviews gao also identified areas of weakness and made recommendations that could strengthen the program further . many of these recommendations have been either fully or partially addressed by the congress in various reauthorizations of the program or by the agencies themselves . for example , in 2005 , gao found that the issue of how to assess the performance of the sbir program remains somewhat unresolved after almost two decades , and identified data and information gaps that make assessment of the sbir program a challenge . many of the solutions to improve the sbir program could be addressed , in part , by collecting better data and establishing a government - use database , so that sba and participating agencies can share information and enhance their efforts to monitor and evaluate the program . however , in 2006 , gao reported that sba was 5 years behind schedule in complying with a congressional mandate to develop a government - use database that could facilitate agencies ' monitoring and evaluation efforts . moreover , the information that sba was collecting for the database was incomplete and inconsistent , thereby limiting its usefulness . in 2006 , sba told gao that it expected to have the government - use database operational early in fiscal year 2007. however , the database did not become operational until october 2008 and currently contains 2 years of new data , according to an sba official . the database also does not permit information to be entered in an inconsistent format . in 2006 , gao also found that sba , nih , and dod focus on a few select criteria to determine the eligibility of applicants for sbir awards . gao reported that both nih and dod largely relied on applicants to self - certify that they met all of the sbir eligibility criteria as part of their sbir applications , although both made additional efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information when they observed discrepancies in the applications . when the agencies were unable to verify the eligibility of an applicant , they referred the application to sba for an eligibility determination . gao found that when sba finds an applicant to be ineligible for the sbir program , it places this information on its web site but does not consistently identify that the ineligibility determination was made for the sbir program .
the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) financial condition has worsened this year , with the recession and changing mail use causing declines in mail volume and revenues despite postal rate increases . gao testified in may to this subcommittee that usps expects these declines to lead to a record net loss and an unprecedented cash shortfall even if ambitious cost cutting is achieved . gao reported that maintaining usps 's financial viability as the provider of affordable , high - quality universal postal service will require actions in a number of areas , such as rightsizing its retail and mail processing networks by consolidating operations and closing unnecessary facilities and reducing the cost and size of its workforce , which generates about 80 percent of its costs . today gao is releasing its report on usps efforts to improve the efficiency of delivery . delivery accounts for nearly half of usps salary and benefit costs . this testimony updates usps 's financial condition and outlook and explains gao 's decision to place usps 's financial condition on the high - risk list and discusses the need for usps to restructure its mail processing , retail , and delivery networks and its efforts to improve their efficiency . it is based on gao 's past and ongoing work and updated usps information . usps 's financial condition and outlook continue to deteriorate with a worsening outlook for mail volume and revenue . usps now projects mail volume to decline by about 28 billion pieces to about 175 billion pieces in fiscal year 2009 , a decline of 13.7 percent . as a result , usps projects a net loss of about $ 7 billion even with record savings of about $ 6 billion ; an increase in outstanding debt by the annual $ 3 billion limit ; and , despite this borrowing , an unprecedented $ 1 billion cash shortfall . thus , usps recently reported to congress that , due to the need to maintain sufficient cash to cover costs , it will not fully make its mandated payment of $ 5.4 billion for future retiree health benefits due by september 30 , 2009 , even if it receives $ 2 billion in relief under pending house legislation . gao added usps 's financial condition to the high - risk list this week . gao reported usps urgently needs to restructure to address its current and long - term financial viability . accordingly , gao calls for usps to develop and implement a broad restructuring plan -- with input from the postal regulatory commission and other stakeholders , and approval by congress and the administration -- that includes key milestones and time frames for actions , addresses key issues , and identifies what steps congress and other stakeholders may need to take . usps needs to optimize its retail , mail processing , and delivery networks to eliminate growing excess capacity and maintenance backlogs , reduce costs , and improve efficiency . usps has a window of opportunity to reduce the cost and size of its workforce through attrition and the large number of upcoming retirements to minimize the need for layoffs . although usps has begun efforts to realign and consolidate some mail processing , retail , and delivery operations , much more is urgently needed . gao recognizes that usps would face formidable resistance to restructuring with many facility closures and consolidations because of concerns that these actions would affect service , employees , and communities . usps management will need to provide leadership and work with stakeholders to overcome resistance for its actions to be successfully implemented . usps must use an open , transparent , fair , and consistent process ; engage with its unions , management associations , the mailing industry , and political leaders ; and demonstrate results . in turn , these stakeholders and congress need to recognize that major restructuring is urgently needed for usps to be financially viable . to its credit , usps recently began a national initiative to consolidate some of its 3,200 postal retail stations and branches in urban and suburban areas . usps has begun efforts to consolidate some mail processing operations but has closed only 1 of 400 major mail processing facilities . usps is realigning city carrier routes to remove excess capacity and improve efficiency , which is expected to save nearly $ 1 billion annually ; has begun to install automated equipment to reduce costly manual sorting of flat - sized mail ; and is studying how it could shift to 5-day delivery and the potential savings .
the smithsonian institution ( smithsonian ) is the world 's largest museum complex . its funding comes from its own private trust fund assets and federal appropriations . the smithsonian board of regents , the smithsonian 's governing body , is responsible for the long - term stewardship of the smithsonian . in recent years , gao and others have documented significant governance and accountability breakdowns at the smithsonian , which could ultimately put funding and the organization 's credibility at risk , and the deterioration of the smithsonian 's facilities and the threat this deterioration poses to the smithsonian 's collections . this testimony discusses the smithsonian 's status in implementing governance reforms recommended by its governance committee and by gao in a 2008 report ( gao - 08-632 ) -- as discussed in a gao report being released today ( gao - 10-190r ) -- and the smithsonian 's progress in implementing facilities and funding recommendations gao made in a 2007 report ( gao - 07-1127 ) . the work for this testimony is based on gao - 10-190r and an analysis of documentary and testimonial evidence from smithsonian officials . gao is not making recommendations in this testimony and did not make new recommendations in gao - 10-190r . the smithsonian and the board of regents concurred with the findings of gao - 10-190r . since may 2008 the smithsonian has implemented 9 reforms recommended by the board of regents governance committee -- in addition to the 30 it had implemented prior to may 2008- - and 1 of 4 gao recommendations , but work remains on 3 reforms and 3 recommendations . the 9 governance committee reforms implemented since may 2008 include efforts such as revising policies related to travel and expense reimbursement and event expenses , creating a regents ' annual public forum , completing a review and revision of board of regents committees ' charters , and developing an assessment process for the board of regents . the smithsonian has not completed implementation of 3 governance committee reforms related to the smithsonian 's contracting policy , a comprehensive review of financial reporting and internal controls , and enhancing the role of advisory boards . regarding gao 's may 2008 recommendations , the smithsonian implemented gao 's recommendation to evaluate what actions it can take in the event of persistent neglect of duties by a regent , but has not completed implementation of the following three recommendations : the board of regents has not fully implemented gao 's recommendation to develop and make public its process for the selection , use , and evaluation of nonregents . the board of regents posted on its web site the process for selecting nonregent committee members but did not make a final decision regarding a proposed bylaw to give nonregent members of committees the same roles and responsibilities as regents . the board of regents took steps to improve its relationship with stakeholders , including advisory boards . however , because of limitations of the efforts thus far -- such as the informal nature of the board of regents ' efforts and their focus on the dissemination of information from the regents rather than two - way communication -- several advisory board chairs with whom gao spoke expressed concern that the board of regents still lacked a sufficient understanding of smithsonian museums and other entities to govern as effectively as possible . the board of regents has not yet conducted a comprehensive evaluation of its reforms but plans to do so in fiscal year 2010. the smithsonian has implemented four of gao 's five 2007 recommendations related to facilities and funding . these include recommendations related to improving the smithsonian 's security communications and the comprehensiveness of its capital plan . furthermore , the smithsonian has implemented gao 's recommendation to more comprehensively analyze nonfederal funding options to meet the needs of its facilities projects . the smithsonian is planning to launch a national fund - raising campaign to raise private sector funds for its programs and facilities . it is unclear how much in funds will be raised or dedicated to facilities through such a campaign . the smithsonian has not implemented gao 's recommendation to submit a report to congress and the office of management and budget on its funding strategy , but it plans to do so as part of its national fund - raising campaign .
this testimony discusses the role of the u.s. export - import bank ( ex - im ) in promoting exports and achieving other u.s. policy goals . as congress considers policies to achieve more robust growth in the u.s. economy , it must consider the full range of tools available to further growth and create new jobs for u.s. workers . some of these tools are related to promoting exports , which can have broad benefits to the u.s. economy . as the official export credit agency of the united states , ex - im has a key role in helping many u.s. firms achieve sales in foreign markets . in addition to establishing ex - im 's broad mandate of supporting u.s. employment through exports , congress has laid out specific , targeted goals for the bank in areas such as increasing financing for environmentally beneficial exports and expanding services to small and minority - owned businesses . this testimony provides some broad observations regarding ex - im 's contribution to the export promotion goals announced in the president 's national export initiative . it also describes progress ex - im has made in achieving the specific targets set by congress , as well as some challenges the bank faces in meeting those targets . the statement also provides some background information concerning the ways in which exports can enhance u.s. economic output . the president 's national export initiative has put forth an ambitious goal of doubling exports in the next 5 years . ex - im has been identified as having a key role in the initiative , and a recent administration report identifies a number of specific actions for ex - im . our work on ex - im 's financing with respect to small business found areas where ex - im needed to improve its data systems for accurate reporting as well as its tracking of efforts to increase small business financing . regarding ex - im 's environmentally beneficial exports financing , we found that the bank could benefit from more consistently following strategic planning practices . ex - im has taken a number of steps in response to gao recommendations , but opportunities for improvement remain . additional attention to these issues will enable ex - im to develop better communication with congress and other stakeholders regarding the balance between the small business and environmental export targets and the broader priorities in the national export initiative .
the community development financial institutions ( cdfi ) fund in the department of the treasury has awarded $ 21 billion of the $ 26 billion in new markets tax credits ( nmtc ) authorized to be awarded to community development entities ( cde ) between 2001 and 2009. cdes use the nmtc to make qualified investments in low - income communities . recent congressional interest has focused on participation by minority cdes . this testimony is based on a recent gao report ( gao - 09-536 ) . as requested , the report identified the number of minority and non - minority cdes that applied to the cdfi fund and received nmtc awards , explained the process by which the cdfi fund makes awards and summarized application scores , described challenges minority and non - minority cdes face in applying for and receiving awards and , identified efforts the cdfi fund and others have taken to assist minority cdes in applying for awards . gao analyzed cdfi fund application data and interviewed officials from minority and non - minority cdes , the cdfi fund , and industry groups . from 2005 through 2008 , minority - owned cdes were successful with about 9 percent of the nmtc applications that they submitted to the cdfi fund and received about $ 354 million of the $ 8.7 billion for which they applied , or about 4 percent . non - minority cdes were successful with about 27 percent of their applications and received $ 13.2 billion of the $ 89.7 billion for which they applied , or about 15 percent . since gao issued the report on which this statement is based , the cdfi fund made 32 nmtc awards totaling $ 1.5 billion under authority provided in the american recovery and reinvestment act . minority cdes received 3 of those awards , totaling $ 135 million . the cdfi fund relies primarily on its scoring of applications to determine which cdes receive awards . as the figure shows , minority cdes received lower scores than non - minority cdes in each of the four application sections . although a cde 's resources and experience in applying are important factors in a cde 's success rate with the nmtc program , when controlling for factors that gao could measure , minority status is associated with a lower probability of receiving an allocation . it is not clear from gao 's analysis why this relationship exists or whether any actions taken or not taken by the department of the treasury contributed to minority cdes ' lower probability of success . characteristics associated with minority status of some cdes for which data are unavailable may affect this relationship . if congress views increased participation by minority cdes as a goal for the nmtc program , options , such as providing certain preferences in the application process that may benefit minority cdes , could be considered . the cdfi fund provides assistance that is available to all cdes applying for awards , including a written debriefing to cdes that do not receive awards detailing some of the weaknesses in the applications . other stakeholders , including industry associations and consultants , hold conferences and offer services to help cdes submit competitive applications . should congress view additional assistance to minority cdes as important to increasing minority cdes ' participation in the nmtc program , it could consider requiring the cdfi fund to provide assistance to minority cdes .
this report responds to two ongoing gao mandates under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) . it is the latest in a series of reports on the uses of and accountability for recovery act funds in 16 selected states , certain localities in those jurisdictions , and the district of columbia ( district ) . these jurisdictions are estimated to receive about two - thirds of the intergovernmental assistance available through the recovery act . this report also responds to gao 's mandate to comment on the jobs estimated in recipient reports . gao collected and analyzed documents and interviewed state and local officials and other recovery act award recipients . gao also analyzed federal agency guidance and interviewed federal officials . as of september 3 , 2010 , about $ 154.8 billion of the approximately $ 282 billion of total funds made available by the recovery act in 2009 for programs administered by states and localities had been paid out by the federal government . of that amount , over 65 percent -- $ 101.9 billion -- had been paid out since the start of federal fiscal year 2010 on october 1 , 2009. as of july 31 , 2010 , the 16 states and the district had drawn down $ 43.9 billion in increased fmap funds . if current spending patterns continue , gao estimates that these states and the district will draw down $ 56.2 billion by december 31 , 2010- - about 95 percent of their initial estimated allocation . most states reported that , without the increased fmap funds , they could not have continued to support the substantial medicaid enrollment growth they have experienced , most of which was attributable to children . congress recently passed legislation to extend the increased fmap through june 2011 , although at lower rates than provided by the recovery act . as of august 27 , 2010 , the district and states covered in gao 's review had drawn down 72 percent ( $ 18.2 billion ) of their awarded state fiscal stabilization fund ( sfsf ) education stabilization funds ; 46 percent ( $ 3.0 billion ) for elementary and secondary education act , title i , part a ; and 45 percent ( $ 3.4 billion ) for individuals with disabilities education act , part b. in the spring of 2010 , gao surveyed a nationally representative sample of local educational agencies ( lea ) and found that job retention was the primary use of education recovery act funds in school year 2009-2010 , with an estimated 87 percent of leas reporting that recovery act funds allowed them to retain or create jobs . nationwide , the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) obligated $ 25.6 billion in recovery act funds for over 12,300 highway projects , andreimbursed $ 11.1 billion as of august 2 , 2010. the federal transit administration obligated $ 8.76 billion of recovery act funds for about 1,055 grants , and reimbursed $ 3.6 billion as of august 5 , 2010. highway funds were used primarily for pavement improvement projects , and public transportation funds were used primarily for upgrading transit facilities and improving bus fleets . the eecbg program provides about $ 3.2 billion in grants to implement projects that improve energy efficiency ; of this amount , approximately $ 2.8 billion has been allocated directly to recipients . as of august 2010 , doe has obligated about 99 percent of the $ 2.8 billion in direct formula grants to recipients , who have in turn , obligated about half to subrecipients . the majority of eecbg funds have been obligated for three purposes : energy efficiency retrofits to existing facilities , financial incentive programs , and buildings and facilities . as of august 7 , 2010 , housing agencies had obligated about 46 percent of the nearly $ 1 billion in recovery act public housing capital fund competitive grants allocated to them for projects such as installing energy - efficient heating and cooling systems in housing units . hud officials anticipate that some housing agencies may not meet the september 2010 obligation deadline , resulting in those funds being recaptured . gao believes hud should continue to closely monitor agencies ' progress in obligating remaining funds . as of july 31 , 2010 , hud had outlayed about $ 733 million ( 32.6 percent ) of tcap funds and treasury had outlayed about $ 1.4 billion ( 25.5 percent ) of section 1602 program funds . gao updates the status of agencies ' efforts to implement gao 's 58 previous recommendations and makes 5 new recommendations to improve management and strengthen accountability to the departments of transportation ( dot ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , the treasury , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
the postal accountability and enhancement act of 2006 required gao to evaluate strategies and options for reforms of the united states postal service ( usps ) . usps 's business model is to fulfill its mission through self - supporting , businesslike operations ; however , usps has experienced increasing difficulties . due to volume declines , losses , a cash shortage , and rising debt , gao added usps 's financial condition to its high - risk list in july 2009. gao 's objectives were to assess the viability of usps 's business model , strategies and options to address challenges to its business model , and actions congress and usps need to take to facilitate progress toward financial viability . gao primarily drew on its past work ; other studies ; usps data ; interviews with usps , unions , management associations , postal regulatory commission , and mailing industry officials ; and stakeholder input . usps 's business model is not viable due to usps 's inability to reduce costs sufficiently in response to continuing mail volume and revenue declines . mail volume declined 36 billion pieces ( 17 percent ) over the last 3 fiscal years ( 2007 through 2009 ) with the recession accelerating shifts to electronic communications and payments . usps lost nearly $ 12 billion over this period , despite achieving billions in cost savings by reducing its career workforce by over 84,000 employees , reducing capital investments , and raising rates . however , usps had difficulty in eliminating costly excess capacity , and its revenue initiatives have had limited results . usps also is nearing its $ 15 billion borrowing limit with the u.s. treasury and has unfunded pension and retiree health obligations and other liabilities of about $ 90 billion . in 2009 , congress reduced usps 's retiree health benefit payment by $ 4 billion to address a looming cash shortfall , but usps still recorded a loss of $ 3.8 billion . given its financial problems and outlook , usps can not support its current level of service and operations . usps projects that volume will decline by about 27 billion pieces over the next decade , while revenues will stagnate ; costs will rise ; and , without major changes , cumulative losses could exceed $ 238 billion . this report groups strategies and options that can be taken to address challenges in usps 's business model by better aligning costs with revenues ( see table on next page ) . usps may be able to improve its financial viability if it takes more aggressive action to reduce costs , particularly compensation and benefit costs that comprise 80 percent of its total costs , as well as increasing revenues within its current authority . however , it is unlikely that such changes would fully resolve usps 's financial problems , unless congress also takes actions to address constraints and legal restrictions . action by congress and usps is urgently needed to reach agreement on actions to achieve usps 's financial viability , provide financial relief through deferral of costs by revising usps retiree health benefit funding while continuing to fund these benefits over time to the extent that usps 's finances permit , and require that any binding arbitration resulting from collective bargaining would take usps 's financial condition into account . congress may also want assurance that any financial relief it provides is met with aggressive actions by usps to reduce its costs and increase revenues , and that usps is making progress toward addressing its financial problems . usps 's new business plan recognizes immediate actions are needed , but usps has made limited progress on some options , such as closing facilities . if no action is taken , risks of larger usps losses , rate increases , and taxpayer subsidies will increase . to facilitate progress in these difficult areas , congress could set up a mechanism , such as one similar to the military base realignment and closure commission , where independent experts could recommend a package of actions with time frames . key issues also need to be addressed related to what changes , if any , should be made to delivery or retail services ; to allow usps to provide new products or services in nonpostal areas ; and to realign usps operations , networks , and workforce .
in 1992 congress authorized the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to implement the delaware river deepening project , which would deepen the river 's shipping channel from 40 to 45 feet . in 2002 gao reviewed the corps ' economic analysis of the project , concluding that it contained significant limitations . gao recommended that the corps prepare a comprehensive economic reanalysis , which the corps completed in 2004. gao was asked to determine the extent to which the reanalysis addressed the limitations gao identified ; the reanalysis 's benefit projections , as updated , reflect current and anticipated market and industry conditions ; and the corps has accounted for other key issues that could affect the project . gao reviewed corps project documentation and interviewed federal officials along with representatives of affected states , firms , and environmental groups . the corps ' reanalysis addressed many of the limitations gao had identified in 2002 in the delaware river deepening project 's original economic analysis by using updated information to correct invalid assumptions and outdated data , recalculating benefits and costs to correct miscalculations , and accounting for some of the economic uncertainty associated with the project . for example , the corps revised its benefit estimates for transportation cost savings related to such commodities as crude oil , containerized cargo , and steel slabs . in addition , as gao recommended , the corps had independent experts review the reanalysis . although the corps ' efforts were responsive overall to gao 's 2002 recommendations , gao identified several additional limitations in the reanalysis . for example , in its analysis of economic uncertainty , the corps considered the effects of negative - growth scenarios only for crude oil and refined petroleum , but not for the remaining commodities . in the 6 years that have elapsed since the corps completed its reanalysis , current and anticipated future market and industry conditions have changed significantly . several of the assumptions that underlie the corps ' estimates of the project 's benefits are inconsistent with these changes . for example , the department of energy has lowered its long - term forecasts for growth in east coast refinery capacity and u.s. imports of crude oil . also , in the fall of 2009 , delaware river refinery firms closed two major facilities . further , steel imports have declined since 2006 according to the benefiting facility identified in the reanalysis , and were well below the reanalysis 's growth projection for 2009. however , the corps ' 2008 and 2009 economic updates for the project did not analyze the potential effect of these changes on the project 's benefit estimates . the updates also did not determine the current status of shipping services on two trade routes that provide all of the benefits related to containerized cargo . because of these and other omissions , decision makers do not have sufficient updated information to judge the extent to which market and industry changes would affect the project 's net benefits . gao identified three key outstanding issues that could affect the delaware river deepening project . first , the corps lowered its estimate of the volume of dredged material , which eliminated the need for new disposal sites in new jersey , but its disposal plan continues to face resistance from that state . second , delaware , new jersey , and several environmental groups filed separate lawsuits against the corps in the fall of 2009 , charging that the corps lacks the environmental approvals needed to proceed with the project , among other concerns . finally , new jersey and several environmental groups have challenged in court the corps ' national environmental policy act ( nepa ) process for the project . although the corps completed an environmental assessment ( ea ) in april 2009 , stakeholders believe that the process for soliciting public comment on its scope was unclear , did not allow enough time for comment , and that a new supplemental environmental impact statement is needed . also , at the army 's direction , the corps did not provide a public comment period for the draft ea as it had proposed to do .
the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) , estimated to cost $ 862 billion over 10 years , is intended to stimulate the economy and create jobs . the recovery act provides funds to federal agencies and states , which in turn may award contracts to private companies and other entities to carry out the purposes of the recovery act . contracts using recovery act funds are required to be awarded competitively to the maximum extent practicable . gao was asked to examine the use and oversight of noncompetitive recovery act contracts at the federal and state levels . gao determined the extent that federal contracts were awarded noncompetitively ; the reasons five selected federal agencies ( the departments of defense , energy , and health and human services ; the national aeronautics and space administration ; and the small business administration ( sba ) ) awarded noncompetitive contracts ; the oversight these agencies and their inspectors general ( ig ) provide for recovery act contracts ; and the level of insight five selected states ( california , colorado , florida , new york , and texas ) have into the use of noncompetitive recovery act contracts . more than two - thirds of the $ 26 billion obligated for recovery act federal contract actions through may 2010 were on contracts that were in place before the enactment of the recovery act . most of these contracts had been awarded competitively . for new federal recovery act contract actions , 89 percent of the dollars were obligated on competed actions . most of the recovery act dollars obligated noncompetitively on new contract actions went to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses under sba 's 8 program . the goal of using recovery act funds quickly on high - priority projects drove the contracting approaches of the five federal agencies , particularly their use of existing contracts . officials explained that whether an existing contract had been competed originally did not influence the decision to use a pre - existing contract because the level of competition had been established before recovery act funds were available . the selected federal agencies implemented additional review processes , internal reporting , and coordination efforts for the recovery act . some igs for these agencies focused initial recovery act oversight on areas the igs considered to be higher risk than contracts , such as grant programs . the ig reviews to date have not focused specifically on contracting , including the use of noncompetitive awards to 8 program businesses . gao 's recent reviews of the 8 program , however , have found that safeguards for ensuring that only eligible firms receive 8 contracts may not be working as intended . the five states varied on the type and amount of data routinely collected on noncompetitive recovery act contracts . gao could not determine the full extent to which such contracts are being used . the states generally rely on their pre - recovery act contracting policies and procedures , which generally require competition . the states do not routinely provide state - level oversight of contracts awarded at the local level , where a portion of recovery act contracting occurs . officials from the selected states ' audit organizations said that if they were to address recovery act contracting issues , it could be done through the annual single audit or other reviews of programs that involve recovery act funds . gao recommends that the five igs assess the need to allocate audit resources to noncompetitive 8 recovery act contracts . the igs concurred or had no comment .
congress created the troubled asset relief program ( tarp ) to restore liquidity and stability in the financial system . the department of the treasury ( treasury ) , among other actions , established the capital purchase program ( cpp ) as its primary initiative to accomplish these goals by making capital investments in eligible financial institutions . this report examines the characteristics of financial institutions that received cpp funding and how treasury implemented cpp with the assistance of federal bank regulators . gao analyzed data obtained from treasury case files , reviewed program documents , and interviewed officials from treasury and federal bank regulators .
agencies can use several different types of contracts to leverage the government 's buying power for goods and services . these include interagency contracts -- where one agency uses another 's contract for its own needs -- such as the general services administration ( gsa ) and the department of veterans affairs multiple award schedule ( mas ) contracts , multiagency contracts ( mac ) for a wide range of goods and services , and governmentwide acquisition contracts ( gwac ) for information technology . agencies spent at least $ 60 billion in fiscal year 2008 through these contracts and similar single - agency enterprisewide contracts . however , concerns exist about duplication , oversight , and a lack of information on these contracts , and pricing and management of the mas program . gao was asked to assess the reasons for establishing and the policies to manage these contracts ; the effectiveness of gsa tools for obtaining best mas contract prices ; and gsa 's management of the mas program . to do this , gao reviewed statutes , regulations , policies , contract documentation and data , and interviewed officials from omb and six agencies . gwacs , macs -- two types of interagency contracts -- and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to the government in buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services . however , data are lacking and there is limited governmentwide policy to effectively leverage , manage , and oversee these contracts . the total number of macs and enterprisewide contracts is unknown , and existing data are not sufficiently reliable to identify them . in addition , gwacs are the only interagency contracts requiring omb approval . agencies gao reviewed followed statutes , acquisition regulations , and internal policies to establish and use macs and enterprisewide contracts . avoiding fees associated with using other agencies ' contracts and more control over procurements are some of the reasons agencies cited for establishing macs and enterprisewide contracts . however , many of the same contractors provided similar products and services on multiple contracts -- a condition that increases costs to both the vendor and the government and misses opportunities to leverage the government 's buying power . recent legislation and omb 's office of federal procurement policy initiatives are expected to strengthen management of macs , but no such initiatives exist for enterprisewide contracts . gsa 's mas program -- the largest interagency contracting program -- uses several tools and controls to obtain best prices , but the limited application of certain tools hinders its ability to determine whether it achieves this goal . gsa has established two regulatory pricing controls for mas contracts : seek the best prices vendors provide to their most favored customers ; and a price reduction clause that provides the government a lower price if a vendor lowers the price for similarly situated commercial customers . gsa uses other pricing tools -- e.g . , pre - award contract audits by its inspector general and procurement management reviews -- on a limited basis . for example , the inspector general performs pre - award audits on a small sample of mas contracts annually , but has identified contract cost avoidance of almost $ 4 billion in recent years . in 2008 , gsa established a mas advisory panel that recommended changes to the pricing controls noted above ; concerns remain that such changes could adversely affect gsa 's ability to negotiate best prices . a lack of data , decentralized management , and limitations in assessment tools create challenges for gsa in managing the mas program . the agency lacks data about customer agencies ' use of the program , limiting its ability to determine how well the program meets customers ' needs . the mas program office lacks direct program oversight , as gsa has dispersed authority for managing mas among nine acquisition centers under three business portfolios . program stakeholders have identified concerns that this structure has impaired consistent policy implementation . shortcomings in assessment tools also result in management challenges . for example , performance measures are inconsistent , including inconsistent emphasis on pricing . gsa 's customer satisfaction survey has such a low response rate that its utility for evaluating program performance is limited .
the washington metropolitan area transit authority 's ( wmata ) public rail transit and bus systems are vital to the national capital region . however , the 35-year - old rail system has experienced safety and reliability problems , including fatal accidents . a 16-member board of directors governs wmata , setting policies and providing oversight . recent reports have noted weaknesses in wmata 's governance structure and recommended changing it . gao assessed wmata 's governance in terms of the board 's roles and responsibilities , oversight , and strategic planning . to do so , gao compiled leading practices from previous gao work on public and private sector governance , non - gao transit governance studies , and strategic planning standards ; then compared wmata 's approach to those practices . gao also spoke with six transit agencies selected based on board composition and ridership , among other things . although some requirements and guidance for board roles and responsibilities are provided in the wmata compact and board procedures , wmata board members , officials , and other stakeholders have reported that sometimes the board focuses on management 's day - to - day responsibilities rather than higher level board responsibilities such as oversight and strategic planning . this focus may have resulted from , for example , inadequate delineation and documentation of the board 's responsibilities as well as inadequate communication among board members . in addition , while leading governance practices state that effective transit boards monitor the effectiveness of the board 's organization , structure , and functioning through a regular board selfassessment , wmata 's board does not do so . as a result , the board lacks a key mechanism for regular , ongoing measurement of its performance . in april 2011 , the board released draft bylaws that clarify the roles and responsibilities for the board and propose that the board chair coordinate a board selfevaluation . these draft bylaws represent a good first step toward addressing some of the concerns discussed in this report but will need to be adopted and then effectively implemented to achieve their desired effect . the board 's oversight role is supported by the board 's committee structure , which provides a communication channel for information to reach the board . past board practices such as infrequent meetings of the audit and investigations subcommittee and the lack of routine briefings on outside safety recommendations may have impaired the ability of the board to use information about areas in need of improvement regarding the operations and finances of the agency . however , given the variety in other transit agencies ' practices and the lack of clear criteria on how often audit committees should meet , there is no clear standard against which to measure wmata 's practices . the board 's draft bylaws propose changes to the organization of the board 's committee structure . wmata has developed elements of strategic planning over the past 4 years , but the agency 's board and management could enhance their strategic focus and long - term planning processes to improve performance . wmata acknowledged several failed past efforts at strategic planning . wmata officials said that prior attempts failed due to a lack of management support , employee buy - in , and specific actions to execute the plans ; and a focus on tactical versus strategic decision making . wmata management has developed several elements of strategic planning , such as a mission statement , goals , objectives , and strategies . however , the agency 's strategic planning process could benefit from more board and stakeholder involvement , internal and external environmental assessments , longer time frames , program evaluations , and updated performance metrics . in june 2011 , the board launched an effort to overhaul its strategic planning process . gao recommends among other things that the wmata board of directors follow through with its efforts to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the board ; conduct a regular self - assessment of the board 's effectiveness ; and improve its strategic planning process by actions such as increasing the board 's involvement in the process and updating the agency 's performance metrics . wmata reviewed a draft of this report and noted that it has taken recent actions that begin to address some issues covered in this report .
children 's deaths from maltreatment are especially distressing because they involve a failure on the part of adults who were responsible for protecting them . questions have been raised as to whether the federal national child abuse and neglect data system ( ncands ) , which is based on voluntary state reports to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , fully captures the number or circumstances of child fatalities from maltreatment . gao was asked to examine the extent to which hhs collects and reports comprehensive information on child fatalities from maltreatment , the challenges states face in collecting and reporting this information to hhs , and the assistance hhs provides to states in collecting and reporting data on child maltreatment fatalities . gao analyzed 2009 ncands data -- the latest data available -- conducted a nationwide web - based survey of state child welfare administrators , visited three states , interviewed hhs and other officials , and reviewed research and relevant federal laws and regulations . more children have likely died from maltreatment than are counted in ncands , and hhs does not take full advantage of available information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment deaths . ncands estimated that 1,770 children in the united states died from maltreatment in fiscal year 2009. according to gao 's survey , nearly half of states included data only from child welfare agencies in reporting child maltreatment fatalities to ncands , yet not all children who die from maltreatment have had contact with these agencies , possibly leading to incomplete counts . hhs also collects but does not report some information on the circumstances surrounding child maltreatment fatalities that could be useful for prevention , such as perpetrators ' previous maltreatment of children . the national center for child death review ( nccdr ) , a nongovernmental organization funded by hhs , collects more detailed data on circumstances from 39 states , but these data on child maltreatment deaths have not yet been synthesized or published . states face numerous challenges in collecting child maltreatment fatality data and reporting to ncands . at the local level , lack of evidence and inconsistent interpretations of maltreatment challenge investigators -- such as law enforcement , medical examiners , and child welfare officials -- in determining whether a child 's death was caused by maltreatment . without medical evidence , it can be difficult to determine that a child 's death was caused by abuse or neglect , such as in cases of shaken baby syndrome , when external injuries may not be readily visible . at the state level , limited coordination among jurisdictions and state agencies , in part due to confidentiality or privacy constraints , poses challenges for reporting data to ncands . hhs provides assistance to help states report child maltreatment fatalities , although states would like additional help . for example , hhs hosts an annual ncands technical assistance conference , provides individual state assistance , and , through nccdr , has developed resources to help states collect information on child deaths . however , there has been limited collaboration between hhs and nccdr on child maltreatment fatality information or prevention strategies to date . state officials indicated a need for additional information on how to coordinate across state agencies to collect more complete information on child maltreatment fatalities . states are also increasingly interested in collecting and using information on near fatalities from maltreatment . gao recommends that the secretary of hhs take steps to further strengthen data quality , expand available information on child fatalities , improve information sharing , and estimate the costs and benefits of collecting national data on near fatalities . in its comments , hhs agreed with gao 's findings and recommendations and provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
about half of the seafood imported into the u.s. comes from farmed fish ( aquaculture ) . fish grown in confined aquacultured areas can have bacterial infections , which may require farmers to use drugs like antibiotics . the residues of some drugs can cause cancer and antibiotic resistance . the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) food and drug administration ( fda ) is charged with ensuring the safety of seafood against residues from unapproved drugs , and the department of commerce 's national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) provides inspection services on request . in 2009 , these agencies signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to enhance seafood oversight and leverage inspection resources . gao was asked to assess the extent to which fda 's program is able to ensure the safety of seafood imports against residues from unapproved drugs and fda and nmfs have implemented the 2009 mou . gao reviewed data and documents from each agency and interviewed agency officials and other key stakeholders . fda 's oversight program to ensure the safety of imported seafood from residues of unapproved drugs is limited , especially as compared with the european union ( eu ) . fda 's program is generally limited to enforcing the hazard analysis and critical control point -- the internationally recognized food safety management system -- by conducting inspections of foreign seafood processors and importers each year . these inspections involve fda inspectors reviewing records to ensure the processors and importers considered significant hazards , including those resulting from drug residues if the seafood they receive are from fish farms . the inspectors generally do not visit the farms to evaluate drug use or the capabilities , competence , and quality control of laboratories that analyze the seafood . in addition , fda has conducted foreign country assessments in five countries to gather information about those countries ' aquaculture programs . however , these assessments have been limited by fda 's lack of procedures , criteria , and standards . in contrast , the eu reviews foreign government structures , food safety legislation , the foreign country 's fish farm inspection program , and visits farms to ensure that imported seafood products come from countries with seafood safety systems equivalent to that of the eu . in addition , the scope of fda 's sampling program , which supplements its oversight program , is limited . specifically , the sampling program does not generally test for drugs that some countries and the eu have approved for use in aquaculture . consequently , seafood containing residues of drugs not approved for use in the united states may be entering u.s. commerce . further , fda 's sampling program is ineffectively implemented . for example , for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 , fda missed its assignment plan goal for collecting import samples by about 30 percent . in addition , in fiscal year 2009 , fda tested about 0.1 percent of all imported seafood products for drug residues . moreover , fda 's reliance on 7 of its 13 laboratories to conduct all its aquaculture drug residue testing raises questions about the agency 's use of resources . fda and nmfs have made limited progress in implementing their 2009 mou . the agencies have developed procedures for certain mou activities , such as notifying nmfs of pending fda regulatory actions . however , because fda believes nmfs inspectors need training to conduct inspections according to fda standards , it has not utilized nmfs ' inspection resources or results in a systematic manner . better leveraging available resources is critical , especially in places like china , where fda has inspected 1.5 percent of chinese seafood processing facilities in the last 6 years . gao recommends that fda study the feasibility of adopting practices used by other entities to better ensure the safety of imported seafood , enhance its import sampling program , and develop a strategic approach for enhancing collaboration with nmfs and better leveraging resources . hhs neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendations but cited actions in process or planned that are generally responsive to them .
to improve aviation safety , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) plans to have in place the initial capabilities of a risk - based approach to safety oversight , known as a safety management system ( sms ) , by the end of fiscal year 2010. faa is also implementing new procedures and technologies to enhance the safety , capacity , and efficiency of the national airspace system . data are central to sms and faa 's ability to test the impact of these changes on safety . this congressionally requested report addresses faa 's current and planned use of data to oversee aviation safety , access to data for monitoring aviation safety and the safety performance of various industry sectors , and efforts to help ensure data quality . to perform this work , gao reviewed 13 databases that contain data on key aviation safety events , assessed data quality controls for the databases , and interviewed agency and industry officials , as well as 10 experts in aviation safety and data . faa analyzes data on past safety events , such as engine failures , to prevent their recurrence and plans to use data to support a more proactive approach to managing risk . for example , weather and air traffic control data helped identify factors associated with injuries from turbulence . as part of sms , faa plans to analyze data proactively to support a risk - based approach to safety oversight . for example , faa plans to use data to model the impact of proposed changes in procedures and technologies on the safety of the national airspace system . experts said that identifying risks is necessary to maintain the current level of safety and possibly achieve a higher level of safety in the future . because sms relies on data to identify emerging risks , faa has an effort under way to enhance its access to industry data and improve its capability for automated analysis of multiple databases . according to faa , this effort will allow for more efficient safety analyses . faa is also developing a plan for managing data under sms , but the plan does not fully address data , analysis , or staffing requirements . without such requirements , the plan will not provide timely guidance for implementing sms . faa has access to some voluntarily reported data , which are important for sms , but not all carriers and aviation personnel participate in faa 's voluntary reporting programs . such data are gathered electronically by equipment on aircraft or reported by aviation personnel or carriers following noncriminal , unintentional violations or safety events . industry personnel have some incentives to participate in voluntary programs , such as promised immunity from disciplinary action , but concerns about sanctions and the cost of equipment have deterred full participation , especially by smaller carriers . while faa has some information on reasons for nonparticipation and has taken some steps to promote greater participation , it lacks carrier - specific information on why air carriers are not participating . faa also lacks data to assess the safety performance of certain industry sectors , such as air cargo and air ambulance operators . gao has previously made recommendations to address this lack of data . faa concurred with gao 's prior recommendations and is taking actions to address them . to help ensure data quality -- that is , data that are reliable ( complete and accurate ) and valid ( measure what is intended ) -- faa has implemented a number of data quality controls that are consistent with gao 's standards for data quality , but some weaknesses exit . for example , all the databases gao reviewed had at least some controls in place to ensure that erroneous data are identified , reported , and corrected . however , about half the databases lack an important control -- managers do not review the data prior to entry into the data system . faa is taking steps to address its data weaknesses , but vulnerabilities remain , potentially limiting the usefulness of faa 's data for the safety analyses planned to support sms .
major defense acquisition programs ( mdap ) are used to acquire , modernize , or extend the service life of the department of defense 's ( dod ) most expensive assets , primarily military equipment . the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-23 ) , section 304 , directed us to perform a review of weaknesses in dod 's operations that affect the reliability of financial information for assets acquired through mdap . to do so , gao identified and reviewed previously reported weaknesses that impair dod 's ability to provide reliable cost information for military equipment acquired through mdaps , and determined what actions dod has taken to address them . gao searched databases of audit reports issued during calendar years 2005 through 2009 to identify previously reported weaknesses . using applicable criteria , gao assessed whether the actions taken by dod adequately addressed these weaknesses . gao found that weaknesses that impaired the department 's ability to identify , aggregate , and account for the full cost of military equipment it acquires comprised seven major categories . specifically , dod had not maintained support for the existence , completeness , and cost of recorded assets ; structured its contracts at the level of detail needed to allocate costs to contract deliverables ; provided guidance to help ensure consistency for asset accounting ; implemented monitoring controls to help ensure compliance with department policies ; defined departmentwide cost accounting requirements ; developed departmentwide cost accounting capabilities ; and integrated its systems . although the department has acknowledged that it is primarily focused on verifying the reliability of information , other than cost , recorded in its property accountability systems , dod has begun actions to address these weaknesses and improve its capability to identify , aggregate , and account for the full cost of its military equipment . for example , dod is requiring that acquisition contracts be structured in a manner that facilitates application of the appropriate accounting treatment for contract costs , including the identification of costs that should be captured as part of the full cost of a deliverable . in addition , it has also begun to require that all contract deliverables that meet defined criteria be assigned a unique item identifier to facilitate asset tracking and aggregation of costs , and that electronic contract - related documentation , such as the invoice and receipt / acceptance documents , be maintained in a central data repository to ensure the availability of supporting documentation . moreover , the department has begun to identify cost accounting data elements within its standard financial information structure ( sfis ) and requires that its business - related enterprise resource planning ( erp ) systems support this structure . these efforts are intended to improve data sharing and integration between business areas . dod acknowledged that the actions taken to date do not yet provide the department with the capabilities it needs to identify , aggregate , and account for the full cost of its military equipment . for example , dod has begun to develop erps but has not yet defined the cost accounting requirements to be used to evaluate if these erps will provide the functionality needed to support cost accounting and management . dod stated that additional actions , sustained management focus , and the involvement of many functional groups across dod are needed before weaknesses that impair its ability to account for the full cost of the military equipment it acquires are addressed . until dod defines its cost accounting requirements and completes the other actions it has taken ( e.g . , defining data elements in sfis ) to support cost accounting and management , dod is at risk of not meeting its financial management objective to report the full cost of its military equipment . dod has stated that until these actions are completed it will continue to rely on its military equipment valuation ( mev ) methodology to estimate the cost of its military equipment for financial reporting purposes . gao is making 11 recommendations intended to strengthen actions dod has taken to begin improving its ability to identify , aggregate , and account for the cost of military equipment acquired through mdaps . specifically , our recommendations focused on the need to define departmentwide cost accounting requirements and develop the process and system capabilities needed to support cost accounting and management . dod concurred with our recommendations .
the department of defense ( dod ) spends billions of dollars annually to build and maintain information technology ( it ) systems intended to support its mission . for decades , dod has been challenged in modernizing its systems environment to reduce duplication and increase integration . such modernizations can be guided by an enterprise architecture -- a blueprint that describes an organization 's current and target state for its business operations and supporting it systems and a plan for transitioning between the two states . dod has long sought to employ enterprise architectures and has defined an approach for doing so that depends in large part on the military departments developing architectures of their own . in light of the critical role that military department enterprise architectures play in dod 's overall architecture approach , gao was requested to assess the status of the departments of the air force , army , and navy ( don ) enterprise architecture programs . to do so , gao obtained and analyzed key information about each department 's architecture relative to the 59 core elements contained in stages 1 through 6 of gao 's enterprise architecture management maturity framework . while air force , army , and don each have long - standing efforts to develop and use enterprise architectures , they have much to do before their efforts can be considered mature . gao 's enterprise architecture management framework provides a flexible benchmark against which to plan for and measure architecture program maturity and consists of 59 core elements arranged into a matrix of seven hierarchical stages . the air force has fully satisfied 20 percent , partially satisfied 47 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of gao 's framework elements . the army has fully satisfied 12 percent and partially satisfied 42 percent of the elements , with the remaining 46 percent not satisfied . finally , don has satisfied 27 percent , partially satisfied 41 percent , and not satisfied 32 percent of the framework elements . with respect to stages 1 through 6 of gao 's architecture framework , the military departments have generally begun establishing institutional commitments to their respective enterprise architecture efforts ( stage 1 ) , not established the management foundations necessary for effective enterprise architecture development and use ( stage 2 ) , begun developing initial enterprise architecture content ( stage 3 ) , not completed and used their initial enterprise architecture versions to achieve results ( stage 4 ) , not expanded and evolved the development and use of their respective architectures to support institutional transformation ( stage 5 ) , and taken limited steps to continuously improve their respective architecture programs and use their architectures to achieve corporate optimization ( stage 6 ) . officials at the military departments stated that they have been limited in their ability to overcome long - standing enterprise architecture management challenges , including receiving adequate funding and attaining sufficient senior leadership understanding . nevertheless , dod has been provided with considerable resources for its it systems environment , which consists of 2,324 systems . specifically , dod receives over $ 30 billion each year for this environment . without fully developed and effectively managed enterprise architectures and a plan , the air force , army , and don lack the necessary road maps for transforming their business processes and modernizing their hundreds of supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability . what this means is that dod , as a whole , is not as well positioned as it should be to realize the significant benefits that a well - managed federation of architectures can afford its systems modernization efforts , such as eliminating system overlap and duplication . because dod is provided with over $ 30 billion each year for its it systems environment , the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its it investments is significant . gao recommends that the military departments each develop a plan for fully satisfying the elements of gao 's framework . dod and army concurred and the air force and don did not . in this regard , dod stated that air force and don do not have a valid business case that would justify the implementation of all the elements . however , gao continues to believe its recommendation is warranted .
policymakers have raised questions about geoengineering -- large - scale deliberate interventions in the earth 's climate system to diminish climate change or its impacts -- and its role in a broader strategy of mitigating and adapting to climate change . most geoengineering proposals fall into two categories : carbon dioxide removal ( cdr ) , which would remove carbon dioxide ( co2 ) from the atmosphere , and solar radiation management ( srm ) , which would offset temperature increases by reflecting sunlight back into space . gao was asked to examine the state of geoengineering science , federal involvement in geoengineering , and the views of experts and federal officials about the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering , and any governance challenges . gao examined relevant scientific and policy studies , relevant domestic laws and international agreements , analyzed agency data describing relevant research for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 , and interviewed federal officials and selected recognized experts in the field . few geoengineering experiments or modeling studies have been conducted , and major uncertainties remain on the efficacy and potential consequences of geoengineering approaches . gao 's review of relevant studies and discussions with selected experts indicated that relatively more laboratory and field research relevant to certain cdr approaches exists , although most of this research was not designed to apply to geoengineering . in contrast , few modeling studies or field experiments have focused on srm approaches , according to experts and recent studies . experts identified only one srm field experiment with published results -- a 2009 russian experiment that injected aerosols into the middle troposphere to measure their reflectivity . experts , as well as relevant studies , identified several major uncertainties in need of further investigation for cdr and srm . federal agencies identified 52 research activities , totaling about $ 100.9 million , relevant to geoengineering during fiscal years 2009 and 2010. gao 's analysis found that 43 activities , totaling about $ 99 million , focused either on mitigation strategies or basic science . most of the research focused on mitigation efforts , such as geological sequestration of co2 , which were identified as relevant to cdr approaches but not designed to address them directly . gao found that nine activities , totaling about $ 1.9 million , directly investigated srm or less conventional cdr approaches . officials from interagency bodies coordinating federal responses to climate change indicated that their offices have not developed a coordinated strategy , and believe that , due to limited federal investment , it is premature to coordinate geoengineering activities . however , federal officials also noted that a large share of existing federal climate science research could be relevant to geoengineering . agencies requested roughly $ 2 billion for such activities in fiscal year 2010. without a coordinated federal strategy for geoengineering , it is difficult for agencies to determine the extent of relevant research , and policymakers may lack key information to inform subsequent decisions on geoengineering and existing climate science efforts . according to legal experts and federal officials , the extent to which federal laws and international agreements apply to geoengineering is unclear . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) has taken steps to regulate one cdr approach and has determined that it has sufficient authority to regulate two other approaches . epa officials said epa has not assessed the applicability of other laws because geoengineering research is in its initial stages . similarly , legal experts and department of state officials said that , except for three instances , parties to international agreements have not addressed their agreements ' applicability to geoengineering , largely due to limited geoengineering activity and awareness of the issue . legal experts ' and officials ' views differed on the best approach for international governance , but generally agreed that the federal government should take a coordinated , interagency approach on domestic regulation . experts and officials also identified governance challenges , such as the need to address liability . gao recommends that within the executive office of the president , the appropriate entities , such as the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) , establish a clear strategy for geoengineering research in the context of the federal response to climate change to ensure a coordinated federal approach . ostp neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation , but provided technical comments .
the drug enforcement administration 's ( dea ) diversion control program is responsible for enforcing the controlled substances act ( csa ) and ensuring the availability of prescription drugs such as pain relievers and stimulants while preventing their diversion for abuse . the csa requires entities handling controlled substances -- such as manufacturers , pharmacies , and physicians , among others -- to register with dea , which conducts regulatory investigations of registrants , as well as criminal investigations . gao was asked how dea manages diversion investigation efforts , and how dea ensures policies and procedures are followed for investigations and the extent to which it determines the results of its efforts . gao reviewed dea policies and procedures , and interviewed dea , state , and local officials at eleven locations which were selected on the basis of volume of cases handled , geographic diversity , and other considerations . these observations are not generalizable , but provided insights on dea operations . to respond to the increasing rate of criminal diversion of prescription drugs and a growing registrant population , dea has expanded its resources and targeted its investigation strategies to collaborate with state and local entities and enhance the effectiveness of its diversion investigations . specifically , the agency expanded its use of tactical diversion squads ( squads ) of dea personnel as well as other federal , state , and local partners investigating diversion schemes to maximize resources and improve efforts to investigate criminal diversion . dea currently has 40 squads across the country and plans to establish more . according to squad participants and dea officials gao contacted , the squads have improved communication and coordination and simplified information sharing for investigations . because of the growing registrant population and noncompliance by some with the csa and implementing regulations , dea renewed its focus on regulatory oversight of registrants to better ensure compliance . by using the squads to free up resources previously dedicated to both criminal and regulatory cases , dea used those resources to increase regulatory investigations of the registrants . as a result , the number of regulatory investigations more than tripled between fiscal years 2009 and 2010. dea also conducted outreach to specific registrant types to inform them of regulatory responsibilities and prepare them for regulatory investigations . dea has taken steps to ensure that investigators follow policies and procedures for such investigations , but could better assess how its efforts are reducing the diversion of prescription drugs . to ensure that diversion investigators and special agents have the necessary skills to carry out their responsibilities and that dea monitors the extent to which policies and procedures are followed during investigations , dea has established internal controls related to guidance , training , and oversight of investigations . these controls include providing and updating guidance to investigators to follow during investigations , providing initial and on - going training to investigators , and monitoring the quality of investigations through a combination of direct supervisory reviews , self - inspections , and on - site internal inspections by dea 's office of inspections . recent reports from on - site internal inspections of each of dea 's field divisions did not identify any widespread or systematic issues related to the timeliness and overall quality of diversion investigations . given dea 's increased focus on investigations in response to growing prescription drug diversion , it is critical for dea to determine the extent to which these additional efforts are reducing diversion . dea has established performance measures for the diversion control program , but these measures do not clearly demonstrate the effect the additional efforts are having on the diversion problem the program seeks to address . for example , for its overall performance measure of the diversion control program , dea is tracking the development and implementation of an internal information technology project . by more closely linking performance measures to the goal of reducing diversion , dea could better capture the results of the diversion control program to help inform decision makers in allocating resources . gao recommends dea reassess the program 's performance measures to better link them to the goal of reducing diversion . dea did not concur . gao continues to believe the measures could be enhanced as discussed in this report .
accounting standards require governments to account for the costs of other postemployment benefits ( opeb ) -- the largest of which is typically retiree health benefits -- when an employee earns the benefit . as such , governments are reporting their opeb liabilities -- the amount of the obligation to employees who have earned opeb . as state and local governments have historically not funded retiree health benefits when the benefits are earned , much of their opeb liability may be unfunded . amid fiscal pressures facing governments , this has raised concerns about the actions the governments can take to address their opeb liabilities . the government accountability office ( gao ) was asked to provide information on governments ' retiree health liabilities . gao described what has been reported in state and local governments ' comprehensive annual financial reports ( cafr ) regarding opeb liabilities , actions state and local governments have taken to address retiree health liabilities , and the overall fiscal pressures these governments face . gao reviewed the cafrs for 50 states and the 39 local governments with at least $ 2 billion in total revenue . gao also reviewed the actions taken to address retiree health liabilities by 10 state and local governments , selected based on geography and variation in approaches to address their liability . finally , gao simulated the fiscal outlook for the state and local sector and projected health care costs for state and local retirees . the total unfunded opeb liability reported in state and the largest local governments ' cafrs exceeds $ 530 billion . however , as variations between studies ' totals show , totaling unfunded opeb liabilities across governments is challenging for a number of reasons , including the way that governments disclose such data . the unfunded opeb liabilities for states and local governments gao reviewed varied widely in size . most of these governments do not have any assets set aside to fund them . the total for unfunded opeb liabilities is higher than $ 530 billion because gao reviewed opeb data in cafrs for the 50 states and 39 large local governments but not data for all local governments or additional data reported in separate financial reports . also , the cafrs we reviewed report data that predate the market downturn . finally , opeb valuations are based on assumptions about the health care cost inflation rate and discount rates for assets , which also affect the size of the unfunded liability . some state and local governments have taken actions to address liabilities associated with retiree health benefits by setting aside assets to prefund the liabilities before employees retire and reducing these liabilities by changing the structure of retiree health benefits . approximately 35 percent of the 89 governments for which gao reviewed cafrs reported having set aside some assets for opeb liabilities , but the percentage of the opeb liability funded varied . among the 10 selected governments whose actions gao reviewed in more detail , officials from the governments that were prefunding at least a portion of their retiree health liability reported using irrevocable trusts . however , these governments varied with regard to the source of the money used to prefund their retiree health liabilities and how they determined the level or amount to commit to prefunding each year . to address their retiree health liabilities , the governments gao selected made three key types of changes to their retiree health benefits : changes to the type of retiree health benefit plan , to the level of government contribution , and to the eligibility requirements employees need to meet to qualify for retiree health benefits . changes to the level of government contribution , such as reductions to the amount or proportion of health insurance premiums paid for by the government , was the most common benefit change reported . some of the selected governments made more than one change to their retiree health benefit structure . the changes were most often applied to the retiree health benefits of newly hired employees or currently active employees . state and local governments face unfunded opeb liabilities and decisions about addressing liabilities amid increasing fiscal pressure . assuming the continuation of current policies , by 2050 the size of the projected operating budget imbalance for the state and local government sector is 4.7 percent of gross domestic product , attributable largely to increases in health - related spending . though medicaid is the largest health - related expenditure , spending on state and local government retirees ' health benefits is projected to more than double as a share of total operating revenues to 2.1 percent by 2050 .
health care delivery in the united states often lacks coordination and communication across providers and settings . this fragmentation can lead to poor quality of care , medical errors , and higher costs . providers have formed integrated delivery systems ( ids ) to improve efficiency , quality , and access . the health care safety net act of 2008 directed gao to report on idss that serve underserved populations -- those that are uninsured or medically underserved ( i.e . , facing economic , geographic , cultural , or linguistic barriers to care , including medicaid enrollees and rural populations ) . in october 2009 , gao provided an oral briefing . in this follow - on report , gao describes organizational features idss use to support strategies to improve care ; approaches idss use to facilitate access for underserved populations ; and challenges idss encounter in providing care , including to underserved populations . gao selected a judgmental sample of 15 private and public idss that are clinically integrated across primary , specialty , and acute care ; they vary in their degree of integration , specific organizational features , and payer mix ( e.g . , extent to which they serve medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured ) . gao interviewed chief medical officers or other system officials at all 15 idss and conducted site visits at 4 idss , interviewing system executives and clinical staff . idss in gao 's sample reported that using electronic health records ( ehr ) , operating health insurance plans , and employing physicians all support strategies to improve patient care . an ehr contains patient and care information , such as progress notes and medications . some idss said that using ehrs supports their patient care strategies such as care coordination , disease management , and use of care protocols by increasing the availability of individual patient and patient population data and by improving communication among providers . idss also reported that operating a health insurance plan can support patient care strategies by providing to the ids both financial resources , such as savings from reducing avoidable hospitalizations for health insurance plan members , and data on plan members . for example , financial resources could be used to fund services such as care coordination -- which many insurers do not reimburse -- and the data could assist with strategies such as disease management . employment of physicians was reported to facilitate physician accountability for quality of care because physicians who are employed by the ids must meet certain performance indicators , and the idss collect data on and review physician performance . employment of physicians was also reported to increase adherence to care protocols and to facilitate provision of care to underserved populations through compensation that mitigates physicians ' concerns that they might not receive payment from uninsured patients . idss in the sample discussed several approaches they use to facilitate access to care for underserved populations . these approaches include using community - based settings , such as school - based health centers and federally qualified health centers ( fqhc ) ; conducting outreach ; helping patients apply for coverage programs such as medicaid ; providing financial assistance ; and collaborating with community organizations , including faith - based organizations . for example , some idss operate fqhcs within their system , and others collaborate with local fqhcs that are not part of their system . in addition , to improve access to mental health care services for patients , including those in underserved populations , some idss integrate mental health and primary care services . idss in the sample reported facing various operational challenges in providing care , including care for underserved populations . some reported that not receiving reimbursement from health care insurance companies for the care coordination services they provide to patients is a financial challenge . other operational challenges idss identified included finding specialty care for underserved patients , including mental health care ; sharing clinical information in patients ' ehrs with providers outside the system ; and changing management and physician cultures to adapt to organizational change . the department of health and human services reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
in march 2008 , gao designated the 2010 census a high - risk area in part because of information technology ( it ) shortcomings and uncertainty over the ultimate cost of the census , now estimated at around $ 15 billion . the u.s. census bureau ( bureau ) has since made improvements to various it systems and taken other steps to mitigate the risks to a successful census . however , last year , gao noted that a number of challenges and uncertainties remained , and much work remained to be completed under very tight time frames . as requested , this testimony provides an update on the bureau 's readiness for an effective headcount , covering the reliability of key it systems ; a broad range of activities critical to an effective headcount , some of which were problematic in either earlier 2010 operations or in the 2000 census , and the quality of the bureau 's cost estimates . the testimony is based on previously issued and ongoing gao work . overall , the bureau 's readiness for a successful headcount is mixed . on the one hand , performance problems continue to plague a work flow management system essential for the bureau 's field operations and a payroll processing system that will be used to pay more than 600,000 temporary workers . both systems have not yet demonstrated the ability to function reliably under full operational loads , and the limited amount of time that remains to address their shortcomings creates a substantial challenge for the bureau . aside from the mail response , which is outside of the bureau 's direct control , the difficulties facing these two automated systems represent the most significant risk , jeopardizing the cost and quality of the enumeration . on the other hand , the rollout of other key enumeration activities is generally on track , and the bureau has taken action to address some previously identified problems . for example , the bureau has taken steps to reduce the number of temporary workers with unreadable fingerprint cards , a problem that affected an earlier field operation . among other actions , the bureau plans to digitally capture a third and fourth set of fingerprints if the first two sets can not be read for background security checks . the bureau 's 2010 census communications campaign is also more robust than the one used in the 2000 census . key differences from the 2000 campaign include increased partnership staffing , expanded outreach to partner organizations , targeted paid advertising based on market and attitudinal research , and a contingency fund to address unexpected events . to increase participation rates , the bureau plans to mail a second , replacement questionnaire to census tracts that had low or moderate response rates in the 2000 census . to help ensure that hard - to - count populations are enumerated , the bureau plans to employ several initiatives . for example , service based enumeration is designed to count people who lack permanent shelter at soup kitchens , mobile food vans , and other locations where they receive services . the be counted program is designed to reach those who may not have received a census questionnaire . to help ensure a complete count of areas along the gulf coast , the bureau is hand delivering an estimated 1.2 million census forms in areas that were devastated by hurricanes katrina , rita , and ike . in addition , the bureau re - examined its cost estimate for nonresponse follow - up , the largest and most costly field operation where census workers follow up in person with nonresponding households . the bureau provided a range of estimates , with $ 2.3 billion as the mid - point . however , the bureau 's analyses of cost are not complete . according to the bureau , it continues to reexamine the cost of two other operations related to nonresponse follow - up . moving forward , it will be important for the bureau to quickly identify the problems affecting key it systems and test solutions . further , given the complexity of the census and the likelihood that other glitches might arise , it will be important for the bureau to stay on schedule , monitor operations , and have plans and personnel in place to quickly address operational issues .
with premiums increasing for private health insurance , questions have been raised about the extent to which increases are justified . oversight of the private health insurance industry is primarily the responsibility of states . in 2010 , the patient protection and affordable care act required the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to award grants to assist states in their oversight of premium rates . gao was asked to provide information on state oversight of premium rates . in this report , gao describes states ' practices for overseeing health insurance premium rates in 2010 , including the outcomes of premium rate reviews ; and changes that states that received hhs rate review grants have begun making to enhance their oversight of premium rates . gao surveyed officials from insurance departments in 50 states and the district of columbia ( referred to as states ) about their practices for overseeing premium rates in 2010 and changes they have begun making to enhance their oversight . gao received responses from all but one state . gao also interviewed officials from california , illinois , maine , michigan , and texas to gather additional information on state practices . gao selected these states based on differences in their authority to oversee premium rates , and proposed changes to their oversight , their size , and their geographic location . gao also interviewed officials from advocacy groups and two large carriers to obtain contextual information . gao found that oversight of health insurance premium rates -- primarily reviewing and approving or disapproving rate filings submitted by carriers -- varied across states in 2010. while nearly all -- 48 out of 50- - of the state officials who responded to gao 's survey reported that they reviewed rate filings in 2010 , the practices reported by state insurance officials varied in terms of the timing of rate filing reviews , the information considered in reviews , and opportunities for consumer involvement in rate reviews . specifically , respondents from 38 states reported that all rate filings reviewed were reviewed before the rates took effect , while other respondents reported reviewing at least some rate filings after they went into effect . survey respondents also varied in the types of information they reported reviewing . while nearly all survey respondents reported reviewing information such as trends in medical costs and services , fewer than half of respondents reported reviewing carrier capital levels compared with state minimums . some survey respondents also reported conducting comprehensive reviews of rate filings , while others reported reviewing little information or conducting cursory reviews . in addition , while 14 survey respondents reported providing consumers with opportunities to be involved in premium rate oversight , such as participation in rate review hearings or public comment periods , most did not . finally , the outcomes of states ' reviews of rate filings varied across states in 2010. specifically , survey respondents from 5 states reported that over 50 percent of the rate filings they reviewed in 2010 were disapproved , withdrawn , or resulted in rates lower than originally proposed , while survey respondents from 19 states reported that these outcomes occurred from their rate reviews less than 10 percent of the time . gao 's survey of state insurance department officials found that 41 respondents from states that were awarded hhs rate review grants reported that they have begun making changes in order to enhance their states ' abilities to oversee health insurance premium rates . for example , about half of these respondents reported taking steps to either review their existing rate review processes or develop new processes . in addition , over two - thirds reported that they have begun to make changes to increase their capacity to oversee premium rates , including hiring staff or outside actuaries , and improving the information technology systems used to collect and analyze rate filing data . finally , more than a third reported that their states have taken steps -- such as introducing or passing legislation -- in order to obtain additional legislative authority for overseeing health insurance premium rates . hhs and the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) reviewed a draft of this report . in its written comments , hhs highlighted the steps it is taking to improve transparency , help states improve their health insurance rate review , and assure consumers that any premium increases are being spent on medical care . hhs and naic provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate .
nonprofits are key partners in delivering federal services yet reportedly often struggle to cover their indirect costs ( costs not readily identifiable with particular programs or projects ) . this raises concerns about fiscal strain on the sector . to provide information on nonprofits ' indirect cost reimbursement , especially when funding flows through entities such as state and local governments , gao was asked to review , for selected grants and nonprofits , how indirect cost terminology and classification vary , how indirect costs are reimbursed , and if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed , steps taken to bridge gaps . gao selected six departments of health and human services and housing and urban development grants and 17 nonprofits in louisiana , maryland , and wisconsin . gao selected these agencies for their historical relationship with nonprofits . gao reviewed policies and documents governing indirect costs and interviewed relevant officials . gao also reviewed research on nonprofits ' indirect costs . depending on the grant program , nonprofits may be reimbursed for indirect costs ( generally costs such as rent or utilities ) , administrative costs ( generally cost activities such as accounting or personnel ) , both , or neither . omb officials said costs can be classified as either indirect or direct , and administrative cost activities are usually , but not always , classified as indirect costs . however , inconsistencies in the use and meaning of the terms indirect and administrative , and their relationship to each other , has made it difficult for state and local governments and nonprofits to classify costs consistently . this has resulted in varying interpretations of what activity costs are indirect versus administrative . as omb guidance on cost principles for nonprofits recognizes ( 2 cfr part 230 ) , because nonprofit organizations have diverse characteristics and accounting practices , it is not possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect in all situations . this increases the challenges of administering federal grants and , in some cases , makes it difficult for recipients to determine those activities eligible for indirect cost reimbursement under a particular federal grant and those that are not . gao found differences in the rate in which state and local governments reimburse nonprofits for indirect costs . these differences , including whether nonprofits are reimbursed at all , largely depend on the policies and practices of the state and local governments that award federal funds to nonprofits . federal grants often provide wide latitude in setting cost reimbursement policies and practices , and some state and local governments do not reimburse these costs at all . those that do can often choose the reimbursement rate . as a result , gao found that variations in indirect cost reimbursement exist not only among different grants , but also within the same grant across different states . gao found that nonprofits fund indirect costs with a variety of federal and nonfederal funding sources , and that when indirect cost reimbursement is less than the amount of indirect costs nonprofits determine they have incurred , most nonprofits gao interviewed take steps to bridge the gap . they may reduce the population served or the scope of services offered , and may forgo or delay physical infrastructure and technology improvements and staffing needs . because many nonprofits view cuts in clients served or services offered as unpalatable , they reported that they often compromise vital `` back - office '' functions , which over time can affect their ability to meet their missions . further , nonprofits ' strained resources limit their ability to build a financial safety net , which can create a precarious financial situation for them . absent a sufficient safety net , nonprofits that experience delays in receiving their federal funding may be inhibited in their ability to bridge funding gaps . when funding is delayed , some nonprofits said they either borrow funds on a line of credit or use cash reserves to provide services and pay bills until their grant awards are received . collectively , these issues place stress on the nonprofit sector , diminishing its ability to continue to effectively partner with the federal government to provide services to vulnerable populations .
in fiscal year 2011 , civilian agencies reported $ 161 billion in contract obligations , $ 126 billion ( almost 80 percent ) of which were for services such as professional management and information technology support . concerned about agencies ' reliance on contractors , congress included a requirement in the consolidated appropriations act of 2010 for civilian agencies to compile and review an annual inventory of service contracts to examine certain issues , such as contractors performing inherently governmental functions or functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions , which would require enhanced management oversight . it also required omb to develop guidance to assist agencies in meeting the act 's requirements and for gao to report on agency efforts . gao assessed agency efforts to compile their fiscal year 2011 inventories and review and report on their fiscal year 2010 inventories . to meet these objectives , gao analyzed agencies ' fiscal year 2011 service contract inventories and fiscal year 2010 service contract inventory review reports and compared them to legislative requirements , omb guidance , and federal procurement data . civilian agencies did not fully comply with statutory requirements for compiling fiscal year 2011 service contract inventories . for example , because the information is not currently readily available , the office of management and budget ( omb ) directed the 49 agencies that were required to submit inventories to defer the collection of three statutorily required data elements for each contract -- the role the services played in achieving agency objectives , the total dollar amount invoiced for services under the contracts , and the number and work locations of contractor and subcontractor personnel . progress , however , is being made to collect this information for future inventories . omb directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after march 1 , 2012. a proposed federal acquisition regulation rule was published in april 2011 to start collecting the remaining two data elements directly from contractors . we also found several instances where agencies significantly underreported obligations in their inventories , either because they misinterpreted or did not follow omb guidance . for example , the general services administration underreported obligations by approximately $ 6.4 billion . without complete and accurate service contract inventories , omb and congress can not meaningfully compare service contract obligations among agencies , or develop spending trends for agencies , thus limiting the overall utility of the inventories . nine of the 49 civilian agencies did not submit a report on their fiscal year 2010 inventory review to omb , as required . of the 40 agencies that submitted reports on their inventory reviews , 5 agencies identified 3 contracts where contractors could be performing inherently governmental functions and 104 instances where contractors were performing closely associated with inherently governmental functions . it is unclear , however , based on the 40 agency reports , whether these results were a real indication of the agencies ' effective and appropriate use of contractors or due to the different approaches agencies used to conduct the reviews . agencies did not include important context in their reports , such as the number of contracts or the percentage of their inventories reviewed . of the 25 agencies that reported the number of contracts they reviewed , most reviewed 50 or fewer contracts . omb intends to have agencies share lessons learned , including the use of cross - functional teams , to help future review efforts . gao recommends that omb work with agencies to improve how compliance with the act and with omb guidance is monitored and clarify guidance to agencies for compiling and reporting on their inventories . omb generally concurred with our recommendations .
the national nuclear security administration 's ( nnsa ) tritium readiness program aims to establish an assured domestic source of tritium -- a key isotope used in nuclear weapons -- in order to maintain the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile . because tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent annually , it must be periodically replenished in the stockpile . however , since 2003 , nnsa 's efforts to produce tritium have been hampered by technical challenges . in this context , gao was asked to determine the extent to which nnsa has been able to overcome technical challenges producing tritium , determine the extent to which nnsa is able to meet current and future nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , and assess the management of nnsa 's tritium readiness program . to do this , gao visited facilities involved in tritium production and reviewed tritium requirements established by nnsa and the department of defense , among other things . nnsa has been unable to overcome the technical challenges it has experienced producing tritium . to produce tritium , stainless steel rods containing lithium aluminate and zirconium -- called tritium - producing burnable absorber rods ( tpbar ) -- are irradiated in the tennessee valley authority 's ( tva ) watts bar 1 commercial nuclear power reactor . despite redesigns of several components within the tpbars , tritium is still leaking -- or `` permeating '' -- out of the tpbars into the reactor 's coolant water at higher - than - expected rates . because the quantities of tritium in the reactor coolant are approaching regulatory limits , tva has been significantly restricting the number of tpbars that it will allow nnsa to irradiate in each 18-month reactor fueling cycle , and , consequently , nnsa has not been producing as much tritium as it planned . nnsa and tva officials are continuing to develop plans to increase the number of tpbars that will be irradiated , as well as , if necessary , the number of reactors participating in the program . however , these plans have not been coordinated with the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) , which ultimately must approve any changes to the operation of the tva reactors . nnsa currently meets the nuclear weapons stockpile requirements for tritium , but its ability to do so in the future is in doubt . nnsa officials told us that they will be able to meet future requirements through a combination of harvesting tritium obtained from dismantled nuclear warheads and irradiating tpbars . although the number of nuclear weapons in the u.s. stockpile is decreasing , these reductions are unlikely to result in a significant decrease of tritium requirements and will not eliminate the need for a reliable source of new tritium because of the need to periodically replenish it in the remaining nuclear weapons stockpile due to tritium 's decay . while nnsa has not , to date , been required to use tritium from a reserve that it maintains , use of this reserve in the relatively near future may be necessary if nnsa is unable to increase tritium production beyond its current level . although nnsa has attempted to ensure a reliable long - term supply of tritium , gao 's review found two problems with nnsa 's management of the tritium readiness program . first , nnsa could not provide us with evidence that it adhered to the appropriate contracting procedures when purchasing components and services for the program . second , due to , among other things , the way the program 's contracts with its suppliers are structured , the program is spending its funds more slowly than planned and is accumulating large unexpended balances . the program is subject to thresholds established by the department of energy of acceptable levels of unexpended funds that may be carried over from one fiscal year to the next . however , the program exceeded these thresholds by more than $ 48 million in 2008 and by more than $ 39 million in 2009. while large unexpended balances are not necessarily an indication that the program is being mismanaged , it does indicate that the program is requesting more funding than it needs on an annual basis -- funds that could be appropriated for other purposes . gao recommends that nnsa develop a plan to manage tritium releases from reactors , analyze alternatives to its current tritium production strategy , ensure its contracting complies with appropriate contracting procedures , and ensure its future budget requests account for the program 's large unexpended balances . nnsa generally agreed with our recommendations .
the logistics modernization program ( lmp ) is an army business system that is intended to replace the aging army systems that manage inventory and depot repair operations . through 2009 , the army obligated more than $ 1 billion for lmp . lmp was originally scheduled to be completed by 2005 , but after the first deployment in july 2003 , the army delayed fielding because of significant problems . the army has since decided to field the system in two additional deployments : the second deployment occurred in may 2009 , and the third deployment is scheduled to occur in october 2010. gao was asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the army 's management processes in enabling the second deployment sites to realize the full benefits of lmp . the army 's management processes that were established prior to the second deployment of lmp were not effective in enabling the second deployment sites to realize the full benefits of lmp . when lmp becomes fully operational at the second deployment locations , the army expects that it will significantly enhance depot operations . however , the army was unable to ensure that the data used by lmp were of sufficient quality to enable the depots to perform their day - to - day missions after lmp became operational . as a result of these data quality issues , depot personnel had to develop and use manual work - around processes until they could correct the data in lmp , which prevented the army from achieving the expected benefits from lmp . data quality issues occurred despite improvements made by the army to address data issues experienced during the first deployment of lmp because the army 's testing strategy did not provide reasonable assurance that the data being used by lmp were accurate and reliable . instead , the army 's testing efforts focused on whether the software was functioning , but did not assess whether the data used by the depots to perform their repair missions were of sufficient quality to work in lmp . according to depot officials , the data problems are being corrected as they are identified . additionally , the army 's training strategy did not effectively provide lmp users the skills necessary to perform their new tasks . users at the depots stated that the training they received did not provide a realistic environment that showed them how to perform their expected duties , and did not always match their new responsibilities . however , users at the depots also stated that they had received additional training that resolved the issue . the army also lacked a comprehensive set of metrics with which to measure the success of lmp implementation . gao 's previous work has shown that successful performance measures should be aligned throughout the organization and cover the activities that an entity is expected to perform . however , the army did not have common metrics with which to measure success during the second deployment , and the army 's scorecard for measuring lmp implementation focused on the software , but did not assess whether the depots were able to perform their work using lmp as envisioned . despite these challenges , lmp has provided the army some benefits , and officials at the second deployment sites provided examples of how lmp had improved their day - to - day operations , for example , through the increased visibility of assets . the third deployment of lmp is scheduled to occur in october 2010 , and will involve more commands , occur at locations across the globe , and affect more users than the previous deployments . lmp program management officials stated that they are taking steps to address the issues discussed in this report for the third deployment and are adjusting plans related to data testing and training . however , because these plans are being developed , gao was unable to verify that the problems have been resolved . without correcting these issues prior to the third deployment , the army is likely to face similar , or potentially greater , problems that prevent it from realizing the full benefits of lmp .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides , or pays for , a range of mental health services for veterans . to effectively manage resources and ensure access to eligible veterans , va needs complete spending and workload information for mental health services . this information is also important for congressional oversight gao was asked to examine va 's mental health spending and workload . in this report , gao examined for fiscal year 2009 va 's spending for mental health services and va 's workload for mental health services . gao examined va 's reporting of mental health spending and workload data for fiscal year 2009 in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification and whether va reported these data in any other publicly available report . gao analyzed additional mental health spending and workload data and interviewed va officials . va reported in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification spending about $ 4.4 billion on mental health services in fiscal year 2009 in va settings primarily used for providing mental health services . however , va had additional spending in fiscal year 2009 for mental health services that va did not report as mental health spending in its budget justification or in any other publicly available report . specifically , va did not report as mental health spending the amounts it spent for those mental health services that it paid non - va providers to provide in community settings and provided in va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services , such as nursing homes . va also did not report as mental health spending the amount it spent for counseling services to address mental health issues provided by va vet centers . although va did not report this spending information , va does determine its spending for mental health services provided by non - va providers and for outpatient mental health services provided in va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services . according to va officials , va spent an additional $ 269 million for these services in fiscal year 2009. va does not have complete spending information for inpatient hospital mental health services provided by mental health providers in va settings not primarily used to provide mental health services nor does it have spending information for counseling services to address mental health issues provided by vet centers . in fiscal year 2009 , va provided mental health services to about 1.22 million unique patients in va settings primarily used for providing mental health services . however , va did not report this information in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification or in any other publicly available report . va officials said that the number of unique patients is not available until after va 's budget justification is published . additionally , va did not report other workload information that it has on the number of encounters for outpatient services and the average daily census for each of its inpatient hospital , residential , and domiciliary services provided in va settings primarily used for providing mental health services and the workload for mental health services provided in other settings -- community settings for which va paid non - va providers to provide mental health services and va settings not primarily used for providing mental health services . va also did not report the workload for counseling services to address mental health issues provided by vet centers , but va is able to estimate its workload for these services . va 's reporting of mental health spending and workload does not give congress a complete overview of va 's mental health services and limits information available for congressional oversight of va 's mental health services . reporting additional mental health spending and workload information could enhance information available for congressional oversight .
when sponsors terminate underfunded plans during bankruptcy , it can deplete resources of the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) , which protects the pensions of almost 44 million american workers and retirees who participate in over 29,000 defined benefit pension plans . in 2009 , pbgc reported an estimated deficit of over $ 30 billion . gao was asked to determine what pay and other compensation executives received in the years preceding their company 's termination of an underfunded defined benefit pension plan . to identify case study examples gao analyzed a listing of the 1,246 underfunded plans that were terminated from 1999 to 2008 and selected public companies with large unfunded liabilities , large unfunded liabilities per participant , and a large number of plan participants . gao reviewed documents provided by companies and executives , and interviewed pbgc and company officials . gao also reviewed securities and exchange commission ( sec ) filings and pbgc documents disclosing plan underfunding at the time of termination and missed contributions . executive compensation figures may be understated because some company executives could not be located , did not respond to document requests , declined interviews , and did not give gao access to their tax records . gao found that 40 executives for 10 companies received approximately $ 350 million in pay and other compensation in the years leading up to the termination of their companies ' underfunded pension plans . gao identified salaries , bonuses , and benefits provided to small groups of high - ranking executives at these companies during the 5 years leading up to the termination of their pension plans . for example , beyond the tens of millions in base salaries received , gao found that executives also received millions of dollars in stock awards , income tax reimbursements , retention bonuses , severance packages , and supplemental executive - only retirement plans . in some cases , plan participants had their benefits reduced due to the underfunding of the plan when it was terminated . for example , a retired pilot saw his monthly pension payment reduced by two - thirds . the reduction in benefits occurred because federal law caps the benefits pbgc can guarantee when it takes over an underfunded pension plan . in addition , pbgc has no oversight power with regard to executive compensation prior to a company 's bankruptcy . during bankruptcy , executive compensation must be approved by the bankruptcy court , and after this approval pbgc has extremely limited ability to recover those payments to executives . gao did not find any illegal activity with respect to executive compensation on the part of either the 10 companies or the 40 executives under review .
as congress considers the role and design of appropriate budget enforcement mechanisms in changing the government 's fiscal path , this testimony outlines some elements that could facilitate debate and contribute to efforts to place the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path . budgeting is the process by which we as a nation resolve the large number of often conflicting objectives that citizens seek to achieve through government action . the budget determines the fiscal policy stance of the government -- that is , the relationship between spending and revenues . and it is through the budget process that congress and the president reach agreement about the areas in which the federal government will be involved and in what way . because these decisions are so important , we expect a great deal from our budget and budget process . we want the budget to be clear and understandable . we want the process to be simple -- or at least not too complex . but at the same time we want a process that presents congress and the american people with a framework to understand the significant choices and the information necessary to make the best - informed decisions about federal tax and spending policy . this is not easy . since our first simulations in 1992 , we have continued to report on the nature and drivers of the long - term imbalance and on mechanisms to help address the challenge . focusing on the long term does not mean ignoring the near term . while concerns about the strength of the economy may argue for phasing in policy changes over time , the longer action to change the government 's long - term fiscal path is delayed , the greater the risk that the eventual changes will be more disruptive and more destabilizing . starting on the path to sustainability now offers many advantages . our increased awareness of the dangers presented by the long - term fiscal outlook leads to a focus on enforcement provisions within the budget process that can facilitate the debate and contribute to efforts to put the government on a more sustainable long - term fiscal path . the budget process is the framework within which enforcement mechanisms exist . no process can force choices congress and the president are unwilling to make . having an agreed - upon goal justifies and frames the choices that must be made . a budget process can facilitate or hamper substantive decisions , but it can not replace them . while no process can substitute for making the difficult choices , it can help structure the debate . the budget structure can make clear information necessary for important decisions or the structure can make some information harder to find . the process can highlight trade - offs and set rules for action . in our past work , we have identified four broad principles or criteria for a budget process that can help congress consider the design and structure of future budget enforcement mechanisms . a process should 1. provide information about the long - term effect of decisions , both macro -- linking fiscal policy to the long - term economic outlook -- and micro -- providing recognition of the long - term spending implications of government commitments , 2. provide information and be structured to focus on important trade - offs such as the trade - off between investment and consumption spending , 3. provide information necessary to make informed trade - offs between the different policy tools of government ( such as tax provisions , grants , and credit programs ) , and 4. be enforceable , provide for control and accountability , and be transparent , using clear , consistent definitions . first , selecting the appropriate time horizon in which the budgetary impact of policy decisions should be measured is not just an abstract question for analysts . if the time horizon is too short , congress may have insufficient information about the potential cost of a program . in addition , too short a time horizon may create incentives to artificially shift costs into the future rather than find a sustainable solution . second , the structure and rules can determine the nature of the trade - offs surfaced during the budget process . consumption may be favored over investment because the initial cost of an infrastructure project looks high in comparison to support for consumption . distinguishing between support for current consumption and investing in economic growth in the budget would help eliminate a perceived bias against investments requiring large up - front spending . the third principle focuses on the method through which the federal government provides support for any federal goal or objective . the budget and budget process should provide the information necessary to permit looking across federal agencies and policy tools -- which means across committee jurisdictions -- to make an informed choice . lastly , the budget process should be enforceable , provide for control and accountability , and be transparent .
federal agencies are increasingly using electronic means to create , exchange , and store information , and in doing so , they frequently create federal records : that is , information , in whatever form , that documents government functions , activities , decisions , and other important transactions . as the volume of electronic information grows , so does the challenge of managing electronic records . both federal agency heads and the national archives and records administration ( nara ) have responsibilities for managing federal records . as requested , after providing some context about records management in the federal government and the roles of federal agencies and nara , this testimony describes the challenges of electronic records management and potential means of addressing these challenges . in preparing this testimony , gao relied primarily on its previous work , supplemented by analysis of publicly available documents . under the federal records act , agencies are to manage the creation , maintenance , use , and disposition of records in order to achieve adequate and proper documentation of the policies and transactions of the federal government and effective and economical management of agency operations . if records are poorly managed , individuals might lose access to benefits for which they are entitled , the government could be exposed to legal liabilities , and records of historical interest could be lost forever . nara is responsible , among other things , for providing records management guidance , assistance , and oversight . however , as gao has previously reported , records management has received low priority within the federal government . prior reports have identified persistent weaknesses in federal records management , including a lack of policies and training . gao 's most recent report , in 2008 , found weaknesses in e - mail management at the four agencies reviewed due in part to insufficient oversight and training . this year , nara published the results of its first annual agency records management self - assessment survey , indicating that almost 80 percent of agencies were at moderate to high risk of improper disposition of records . electronic records are challenging to manage , especially as electronic information is being created in volumes that pose a significant technical challenge to the ability to organize and make it accessible . further , electronic records range in complexity from simple text files to highly complex formats with embedded computational formulas and dynamic content , and new formats continue to be created . finally , in a decentralized environment , it is difficult to ensure that records are properly identified and managed by end users on individual desktops ( the `` user challenge '' ) . e - mail is particularly problematic , because it combines all these challenges and is ubiquitous . technology alone can not solve the problem without commitment from agencies . electronic recordkeeping systems can be challenging to implement and can require considerable resources for planning and implementation , including establishing a sound records management program as a basis . in addition , the `` user problem '' is not yet solved , particularly for e - mail messages . further , automation will not solve the problem of lack of priority , which is of long standing . however , several developments may lead to increased senior - level attention to records management : nara 's use of public ratings as a spur to agency management , growing recognition of risks entailed in poor information and records management , the requirements and emphasis of the recent open government directive , and the influence of congressional oversight . senior management commitment , if followed through with effective implementation , could improve the governmentwide management of electronic and other records .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 required the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of veterans affairs ( va ) to accelerate their exchange of health information and to develop capabilities that allow for interoperability ( generally , the ability of systems to exchange data ) by september 30 , 2009. it also required compliance with federal standards and the establishment of a joint interagency program office to function as a single point of accountability for the effort . further , the act directed gao to semiannually report on the progress made in achieving these requirements . for this fourth report , gao determined the extent to which dod and va developed and implemented electronic health record systems or capabilities that allowed for full interoperability by september 30 , 2009 , and the interagency program office established by the act is functioning as a single point of accountability . to do so , gao analyzed agency documentation on project status and conducted interviews with agency officials . dod and va previously established six objectives that they identified as necessary for achieving full interoperability ; they have now met the remaining three interoperability objectives that gao previously reported as being partially achieved -- expand questionnaires and self - assessment tools , expand dod 's inpatient medical records system , and demonstrate initial document scanning . as a result of meeting the six objectives , the departments ' officials , including the co - chairs of the group responsible for representing the clinician user community , believe they have satisfied the september 30 , 2009 , requirement for full interoperability . nevertheless , dod and va are planning additional actions to further increase their interoperable capabilities and address clinicians ' evolving needs for interoperable electronic health records . specifically , dod and va plan to meet additional needs that have emerged with respect to social history and physical exam data ; dod plans to further expand the implementation of its inpatient medical records system to sites beyond those achieved as of september 2009 ; and dod and va plan to test the capability to scan documents , in follow - up to their demonstration of an initial document scanning capability . additionally , in response to a presidential announcement , the departments are beginning to plan for the development and implementation of a virtual lifetime electronic record , which is intended to further increase their interoperable capabilities . the interagency program office is not yet positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the implementation of interoperable electronic health record systems or capabilities . the departments have made progress in setting up their interagency program office by hiring additional staff , including a permanent director . in addition , consistent with gao 's previous recommendations , the office has begun to demonstrate responsibilities outlined in its charter in the areas of scheduling , planning , and performance measurement . however , the office 's effort in these areas does not fully satisfy the recommendations and are incomplete . specifically , the office does not yet have a schedule that includes information about tasks , resource needs , or relationships between tasks associated with ongoing activities to increase interoperability . also , key it management responsibilities in the areas of planning and performance measurement remain incomplete . among the reasons officials cited for not yet completing a schedule , plan , or performance measures were the office 's need to focus on verifying achievement of the six interoperability objectives and participating in the departments ' efforts to define the virtual lifetime electronic record . nonetheless , if the program office does not fulfill key management responsibilities as gao previously recommended , it may not be positioned to function as a single point of accountability for the delivery of future interoperable capabilities , including the development of the virtual lifetime electronic record .
a key mission of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) is promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy through its technical cooperation ( tc ) program , which provides equipment , training , fellowships , and other services to its member states . the united states provides approximately 25 percent of the tc program 's annual budget . while the vast majority of tc projects have not involved the transfer of sensitive nuclear materials and technology , tc assistance has been provided to countries of proliferation concern . in march 2009 , gao reported on potential proliferation and management concerns related to the program ( gao - 09-275 ) . this testimony discusses gao 's findings and recommendations to the department of state and iaea in that report and agency progress made to implement those recommendations to address these concerns . this testimony is based on gao 's 2009 report and updated in march 2011 by reviewing documentation on actions taken by state and iaea in response to the report 's recommendations and interviewing state and department of energy ( doe ) officials . as gao reported in 2009 , neither state nor iaea seeks to systematically limit tc assistance to countries that the united states has designated as state sponsors of terrorism -- cuba , iran , sudan , and syria ; are not party to the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons -- india , israel , and pakistan ; and have not completed comprehensive safeguards or additional protocol agreements with iaea . the former head of the tc program told gao that requests for tc assistance are evaluated strictly on technical merits . gao found that the lack of sufficient and timely information provided by iaea on project proposals limits the ability of doe and the national laboratories to fully assess potential proliferation concerns associated with the program . in addition , gao identified limitations in how the program is managed , including the failure of many member states to pay their full share of support to iaea 's technical cooperation fund ( tcf ) and the use of outdated program metrics . gao asked congress to consider directing state to withhold a proportionate share of the u.s. voluntary contribution to the tc program that is equivalent to the amounts of tcf funding that would otherwise be made available to u.s. - designated state sponsors of terrorism , as the united states currently does with cuba and has done in the past with other countries and territories . gao recommended that state , working with iaea , undertake eight actions to address proliferation and management concerns related to the program , such as establishing a mechanism to facilitate greater and more timely information sharing on proposals . gao made two additional recommendations to state , including enhancing its record - keeping on project proposals identified as having potential proliferation concerns , and developing formal guidance to evaluate requests from tc fellows to study nuclear issues in the united states . state and iaea have made some progress in implementing several of the recommendations in gao 's report . this progress includes , among other things , iaea providing proposal information to the united states and other member states earlier in the project approval process ; iaea pursuing efforts to promote results - based management of tc projects ; state doing better tracking of tc proposals that may contain proliferation concerns ; and state developing new guidance and criteria for accepting or denying requests by foreign tc fellows to study in the united states . state , however , continues to strongly oppose gao 's suggestion that congress consider requiring state to withhold a proportionate share of u.s. voluntary contributions to the fund for tc program assistance provided to u.s. - designated state sponsors of terrorism . gao continues to believe that congress should give serious consideration to this matter because there is a precedent for such a withholding and because such action would foster a more consistent and cohesive u.s. policy toward such nations that the united states chooses not to engage directly in trade , assistance , and other forms of cooperation . gao is making no new recommendations at this time and continues to believe that implementation of the recommendations in its march 2009 report could substantially reduce potential proliferation and management concerns related to the tc program .
participation in school sports can benefit children but also carries a risk of injury , including concussion . concussion is a brain injury that can affect memory , speech , and muscle coordination and can cause permanent disability or death . concussion can be especially serious for children , who are more likely than adults both to sustain a concussion and to take longer to recover . these factors may affect return - to - play decisions , which determine when it is safe for an athlete to participate in sports again . gao was asked to testify on concussion incurred in high school sports . this statement focuses on what is known about the nationwide occurrence of concussion , federal concussion prevention programs , the components of key state laws related to the management of concussion , and the recommendations of voluntary nationwide concussion management guidelines . to do this work , gao conducted literature searches ; reviewed injury databases , state laws , and documents from federal agencies and organizations that conduct work in high school athletics or sports medicine ; and interviewed federal officials and experts who identified key state laws and nationwide guidelines and provided other information . gao shared the information in this statement with the relevant federal agencies . gao identified three national databases that , as part of broader data collection efforts , collect information on the occurrence of concussion in high school sports , but they do not provide an overall national estimate of occurrence . although the high school reporting information online database provides national estimates of occurrence of concussion , it covers only 20 sports for high schools with certified athletic trainers . it may underestimate occurrence because some athletes may be reluctant to report symptoms of a possible concussion to avoid being removed from a game . the consumer product safety commission 's ( cpsc ) national electronic injury surveillance system provides national estimates only on concussions treated in an emergency room . the national center for catastrophic sports injury research database provides information only on cases of concussion with serious complications and can not provide national estimates of the occurrence of all concussions . the centers for disease control and prevention 's program , heads up : concussion in high school sports , which began in september 2005 , is the primary federal prevention program directed toward concussion . in addition , cpsc carries out prevention initiatives that include distributing educational materials , but these initiatives are directed more broadly at sports and recreation safety , such as appropriate helmets for football , baseball , and bicycling . the three key laws regarding the management of concussion in high school sports that were identified by federal officials and experts -- those of oregon , texas , and washington -- all address concussion education and return to play , but their specific requirements vary . the education requirements vary with respect to who is to receive the education . for example , the washington law targets coaches , athletes , and parents , while the oregon law targets coaches only . there is also variation with respect to the content and frequency of education . the return - to - play requirements vary in the conditions under which athletes may return to play and in who may authorize it . for example , the texas requirements apply specifically to athletes who lose consciousness , which excludes many concussions , and the washington law requires return - to - play authorizations to be made by health professionals specifically trained in the evaluation and management of concussion . gao found five sets of voluntary nationwide guidelines , which were developed by organizations that conduct work in high school athletics or sports medicine , that address the management of concussion in high school sports . all recommend monitoring an athlete with a concussion on the sidelines and assessing cognitive function regularly for signs of deterioration . all guidelines also recommend returning an athlete to play on a gradual basis , tailored to an individual 's recovery and based on symptoms and the results of memory , cognition , and balance test .
the u.s. census bureau ( bureau ) is tasked with conducting an accurate count of people living in dwellings known as group quarters as part of the 2010 census . group quarters consist of college dormitories , prisons , nursing homes , and other facilities typically owned or managed by an entity providing housing , services , or both for the residents . during the 2000 census , for a variety of reasons , group quarters were sometimes counted more than once , missed , or included in the wrong location . as requested , this testimony will focus on the extent to which the bureau has strengthened its procedures for counting group quarters compared to the 2000 census , and particular challenges and opportunities for an accurate group quarters count in brooklyn . the testimony is based on previously issued and ongoing gao work in new york and elsewhere . the bureau developed and tested new procedures to address the difficulties it had in identifying and counting group quarters during the 2000 census . for example , the bureau moved from manual to gps - generated map spots , which should reduce the chance of human error and of group quarters populations being counted in the wrong jurisdiction ; moved from a telephone interview to a field verification approach , which should increase accuracy ; and combined the conventional housing unit and group quarters address lists into a single address list , which should reduce the chance of double counting . moreover , the bureau implemented a three - pronged approach to locate and count group quarters . the approach consisted of group quarters validation , where temporary census workers visited each group quarter and interviewed its manager or administrator to determine whether the dwelling was a group quarters or some other type of residence . if the dwelling was in fact a group quarters , it was then determined what category it fit under , and its correct geographic location was confirmed . this was followed by the group quarters advance visit , which is currently under way . census workers are to verify the location of the group quarters ; identify contact officials ; and schedule the date , time and other information to help conduct the actual enumeration . the actual count of group quarters residents is conducted during the third phase of the approach , group quarter enumeration from the end of march to mid - may . the effort includes an operation known as service - based enumeration , during which people commonly referred to as homeless are counted . additional procedures to ensure a complete count of group quarters include a series of quality assurance procedures , such as supervisory review of workers ' assignments . brooklyn presents challenges as well as opportunities . for example , a planning database the bureau developed to help it target its resources placed brooklyn on a list of top 50 u.s. counties with the highest number of people living in hard - to - count areas , based on data from the 2000 census . factors that contribute to the hard - to - count designation include poverty levels , high levels of non - english speakers , complex household arrangements , as well as a high percentage of rental and vacant units , multi - unit buildings , and crowded housing . in light of these demographic and housing challenges , a successful group quarters count will , at a minimum , depend on how well the bureau executes the following activities : complete remaining group quarters activities on schedule , implement the group quarters quality assurance procedures as planned , and closely monitor key performance metrics to ensure that the group quarters count proceeds on track and quickly address any glitches . it will also be important for the bureau to ensure that census workers have knowledge of neighborhood culture and living arrangements , and possess the language skills to reach out to residents with limited english proficiency .
millions of americans rely on retirement savings plans for their financial well - being in retirement . plan sponsors are increasingly investing in assets such as hedge funds ( privately administered pooled investment vehicles that typically engage in active trading strategies ) and private equity funds ( privately managed investment pools that typically make long - term investments in private companies ) . given ongoing market challenges , it is important that plan fiduciaries apply best practices , and choose wisely when investing plans assets to ensure that plans are adequately funded to meet future promised benefits . this statement addresses what is known about the extent to which defined benefit plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , challenges that such plans face in investing in hedge funds and private equity , steps that plan sponsors can take to address these challenges , and the implications of these challenges for plan sponsors and the federal government . a growing number of private and public sector pension plans have invested in hedge funds and private equity , but such investments generally constitute a small share of total plan assets . according to a survey of large plans , the share of plans with investments in hedge funds grew from 11 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2010. over the same time period , investments in private equity were more prevalent but grew more slowly -- an increase from 71 percent of large plans in 2001 to 92 percent in 2010. still , the average allocation of plan assets to hedge funds was a little over 5 percent , and the average allocation to private equity was a little over 9 percent . available data also show that investments in hedge funds and private equity are more common among large pension plans , measured by assets under management , compared with midsize plans . survey information on smaller plans is unavailable , so the extent to which these plans invest in hedge funds or private equity is unknown . hedge funds and private equity investments pose a number of risks and challenges beyond those posed by traditional investments . for example , investors in hedge funds and private equity face uncertainty about the precise valuation of their investment . hedge funds may , for example , own thinly traded assets whose valuation can be complex and subjective , making valuation difficult . further , hedge funds and private equity funds may use considerable leverage -- the use of borrowed money or other techniques -- which can magnify profits , but can also magnify losses if the market goes against the fund 's expectations . also , both are illiquid investments -- that is they can not generally be redeemed on demand . finally , investing in hedge funds can pose operational risks -- that is , the risk of investment loss from inadequate or failed internal processes , people , and systems , or problems with external service providers rather than an unsuccessful investment strategy . plan sponsors gao spoke with address these challenges in a number of ways , such as through careful and deliberate fund selection , and negotiating key contract terms . for example , investors in both hedge funds and private equity funds may be able to negotiate fee structure and valuation procedures , and the degree of leverage employed . also , plans address various concerns through due diligence and monitoring , such as careful review of investment , valuation , and risk management processes . the department of labor ( labor ) has a role in helping to ensure that private plans fulfill their fiduciary duties , which includes educating employers and service providers about their fiduciary responsibilities under employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) . according to plan officials , state and federal regulators , and others , some pension plans , such as smaller plans , may have particular difficulties in addressing the various demands of hedge fund and private equity investing . in light of this , in 2008 , gao recommended that labor provide guidance on the challenges of investing in hedge funds and private equity and the steps plans should take to address these challenges . labor generally agreed with our recommendation , but has yet to take action . the agency explained that the lack of uniformity among these investments could complicate the development of comprehensive guidance for plan fiduciaries .
significant management challenges exist for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) as it continues to integrate its varied management processes , policies , and systems in areas such as financial management and information technology . these activities are primarily led by the under secretary for management ( usm ) , department management chiefs , and management chiefs in dhs 's seven components . this testimony summarizes a new gao report ( gao - 10-131 ) that examined the extent to which dhs has developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that includes the characteristics recommended in gao 's earlier 2005 report , how dhs is implementing management integration , and the extent to which the usm is holding the department and component management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships . gao reviewed dhs plans and interviewed dhs management officials . dhs has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration as required by the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 and with the characteristics gao recommended in a 2005 report . although dhs stated at that time that it was developing an integration strategy it has not yet done so , in part because it has focused on building operations capacity within functional management areas . in the absence of a comprehensive management integration strategy , dhs officials stated that documents such as strategic plans and management directives address aspects of a management integration strategy and can help the department to manage its integration efforts . however , they do not generally include all of the strategy characteristics gao identified , such as identifying the critical links that must occur among management initiatives . in addition , dhs has increased the number of performance measures for the management directorate , but has not yet established measures for assessing management integration across the department . without these measures , dhs can not assess its progress in implementing and achieving management integration . in the absence of a comprehensive strategy , dhs 's management directorate has implemented management integration through certain initiatives and mechanisms to communicate and consolidate management policies , processes , and systems . for example , dhs is in the process of consolidating its financial management , acquisition , and asset management systems . the directorate has also instituted a system of management councils and governance boards to communicate information and manage specific activities related to management initiatives . the usm and department and component management chiefs are held accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships at three levels -- between the secretary and the usm , the usm and department chiefs , and the department and component chiefs -- in which , among other things , the secretary of homeland security , usm , and department chiefs are required to provide input into performance plans and evaluations . performance management practices for management integration between dhs 's department and component management chiefs are not consistently in place . department chiefs are not consistently providing the guidance and input required by department management directives and in accordance with performance management leading practices . without ensuring that the management chiefs provide input into component chiefs ' performance plans and evaluations as required , the directorate can not be sure that component chiefs are fully implementing management integration .
the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) requires or authorizes various federal financial regulators to issue hundreds of rules to implement reforms intended to strengthen the financial services industry . gao is required to annually study financial services regulations . this report examines the regulatory analyses , including cost - benefit analyses , financial regulators have performed to assess the impact of selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; how financial regulators consulted with each other in implementing the selected final rules to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and what is known about the impact of the final rules . gao examined the 32 final dodd - frank act rules in effect as of july 21 , 2011 ; the regulatory analyses conducted for 10 of the 32 rules that allowed for some level of agency discretion ; statutes and executive orders requiring agencies to perform regulatory analysis ; and studies on the impact of the dodd - frank act . gao also interviewed regulators , academics , and industry representatives.. federal financial regulators are required to conduct a variety of regulatory analyses , but the requirements vary and none of the regulators are required to conduct benefit - cost analysis . all financial regulators must analyze the paperwork burden imposed by their rules and consider the impact of their rules on small entities as part of their rulemaking process . the commodity futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission are also required under their authorizing statutes to consider certain benefits and costs of their rules . as independent regulatory agencies , the federal financial regulators are not subject to executive orders requiring federal agencies to conduct detailed benefit - cost analysis in accordance with a guidance issued by the office of management and budget ( omb ) . financial regulators are not required to follow omb 's guidance , but most told gao that they attempt to follow the guidance in principle or spirit . gao 's review of regulators ' rulemaking policies and 10 final rules found inconsistencies in the extent to which omb 's guidance was reflected . gao recommends that to the extent the regulators strive to follow omb 's guidance , they should take steps to more fully incorporate the guidance into their rulemaking policies and ensure that it is consistently followed . although federal financial regulators have coordinated their rulemaking , they generally lacked formal policies to guide these efforts . the dodd - frank act establishes interagency coordination requirements for certain agencies and for specific rules or subject matters . however , for other rules , the regulators have discretion as to whether interagency coordination should occur . the financial stability oversight council ( fsoc ) is tasked with facilitating coordination among member agencies but , to date , has played a limited role in doing so beyond its own rulemakings as it continues to define its role . several regulators voluntarily coordinated with each other on some of the rules gao reviewed . however , most of the regulators , including the bureau of consumer financial protection , lacked written protocols for interagency coordination , a leading practice that gao has previously identified for interagency coordination . gao recommends that fsoc work with the financial regulators to develop such protocols for dodd - frank act rulemaking . little is known about the actual impact of the final dodd - frank act rules , given the short amount of time the rules have been in effect . regulators are required to conduct reviews of existing regulations to assess their impact , but some have not yet developed plans to review their dodd - frank act rules . to maximize the usefulness of these reviews , gao recommends that the regulators identify what data will be needed to retrospectively assess the impact of the rules in the future . fsoc is also required to examine , among other things , financial market and regulatory developments and make recommendations to enhance the efficiency , competitiveness , and stability of u.s. financial markets . although fsoc officials said that fsoc plans to include an impact analysis of the dodd - frank act rules in its future reports , it has not yet begun identifying and collecting the data needed for this type of analysis . gao recommends that fsoc direct the office of financial research , an entity created to support the research needs of fsoc , to work with the regulators to identify and begin collecting data needed for future analyses . gao is making four recommendations to the regulators and fsoc to strengthen the prospective and retrospective analyses of the impact of dodd - frank act regulations on financial markets and improve coordination among financial regulators on rulemaking . regulators and fsoc generally agreed with the report 's findings but most neither agreed nor disagreed with the report 's recommendations .
within dhs , tsa and uscg manage the twic program , which requires maritime workers to complete background checks and obtain biometric identification cards to gain unescorted access to secure areas of maritime transportation security act ( mtsa ) - regulated entities . tsa conducted a pilot program to test the use of twics with biometric card readers in part to inform the development of a regulation on using twics with card readers . as required by law , dhs reported its findings on the pilot to congress on february 27 , 2012. the coast guard authorization act of 2010 required that gao assess dhs 's reported findings and recommendations . thus , gao assessed the extent to which the results from the twic pilot were sufficiently complete , accurate , and reliable for informing congress and the proposed twic card reader rule . gao reviewed pilot test plans , results , and methods used to collect and analyze pilot data since august 2008 , compared the pilot data with the pilot report dhs submitted to congress , and conducted covert tests at four u.s. ports chosen for their geographic locations . the test 's results are not generalizable , but provide insights . gao 's review of the pilot test aimed at assessing the technology and operational impact of using the transportation security administration 's ( tsa ) transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) with card readers showed that the test 's results were incomplete , inaccurate , and unreliable for informing congress and for developing a regulation ( rule ) about the readers . challenges related to pilot planning , data collection , and reporting affected the completeness , accuracy , and reliability of the results . these issues call into question the program 's premise and effectiveness in enhancing security . planning . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) did not correct planning shortfalls that gao identified in november 2009. gao determined that these weaknesses presented a challenge in ensuring that the pilot would yield information needed to inform congress and the regulation aimed at defining how twics are to be used with biometric card readers ( card reader rule ) . gao recommended that dhs components implementing the pilot -- tsa and the u.s. coast guard ( uscg ) -- develop an evaluation plan to guide the remainder of the pilot and identify how it would compensate for areas where the twic reader pilot would not provide the information needed . dhs agreed and took initial steps , but did not develop an evaluation plan , as gao recommended . data collection . pilot data collection and reporting weaknesses include : installed twic readers and access control systems could not collect required data , including reasons for errors , on twic reader use , and tsa and the independent test agent ( responsible for planning , evaluating , and reporting on all test events ) did not employ effective compensating data collection measures , such as manually recording reasons for errors in reading twics . tsa and the independent test agent did not record clear baseline data for comparing operational performance at access points with twic readers . tsa and the independent test agent did not collect complete data on malfunctioning twic cards . pilot participants did not document instances of denied access . tsa officials said challenges , such as readers incapable of recording needed data , prevented them from collecting complete and consistent pilot data . thus , tsa could not determine whether operational problems encountered at pilot sites were due to twic cards , readers , or users , or a combination of all three . issues with dhs 's report to congress and validity of twic security premise . dhs 's report to congress documented findings and lessons learned , but its reported findings were not always supported by the pilot data , or were based on incomplete or unreliable data , thus limiting the report 's usefulness in informing congress about the results of the twic reader pilot . for example , reported entry times into facilities were not based on data collected at pilot sites as intended . further , the report concluded that twic cards and readers provide a critical layer of port security , but data were not collected to support this conclusion . for example , dhs 's assumption that the lack of a common credential could leave facilities open to a security breach with falsified credentials has not been validated . eleven years after initiation , dhs has not demonstrated how , if at all , twic will improve maritime security . congress should halt dhss efforts to promulgate a final regulation until the successful completion of a security assessment of the effectiveness of using twic . in addition , gao revised the report based on the march 22 , 2013 , issuance of the twic card reader notice of proposed rulemaking .
since 2007 , dod and va have jointly operated ides -- which is intended to expedite benefits for injured servicemembers . ides replaced the departments ' separate processes for evaluating servicemembers for fitness and disability . initially a pilot at 3 military treatment facilities , ides is now in place at military treatment facilities worldwide . in previous reports , gao identified a number of challenges as ides expanded to more facilities , including staffing shortages and difficultly meeting timeliness goals . in light of ides ' expansion , gao was asked to examine : the extent to which dod and va are meeting ides timeliness and servicemember satisfaction performance goals , and steps the agencies are taking to improve ides performance . gao analyzed ides timeliness and customer satisfaction data , visited six ides sites with varying performance , and interviewed dod and va officials . case processing times under the integrated disability evaluation system ( ides ) have increased over time , and measures of servicemember satisfaction have shortcomings . since 2008 , annual average processing times for ides cases have steadily climbed , while the percentage of cases meeting established timeliness goals declined . average case processing times reached 394 and 420 days for active and reserve component members in fiscal year 2011- - compared to goals of 295 and 305 days , respectively , and just 19 percent of active duty and 18 percent of guard or reserve servicemembers completed the process and received benefits within established goals . of the four phases comprising ides , the medical evaluation board phase increasingly fell short of timeliness goals , while the physical evaluation board phase , although meeting goals , was taking increasingly more time to complete . with respect to servicemember satisfaction with the ides process , gao found shortcomings in how these data are collected and reported , such as unduly limiting who is eligible to receive a survey and computing average satisfaction scores in a manner that may overstate them . department of defense ( dod ) officials told gao they are considering alternatives for gauging satisfaction with the process . dod and veterans affairs ( va ) are taking steps to improve ides performance , but progress to date is uneven and it is too early to assess their overall impact . for example , va increased resources for completing exams and disability ratings while the army is hiring additional staff for its medical evaluation boards . va has met exam timeliness goals in the past several months , but other resources have yet to translate into lower processing times . dod and va are pursuing system upgrades so that staff and managers at ides facilities can better track and manage the progress of servicemembers ' cases . ides officials have been working with the military services to correct case data that were inaccurately entered into va 's ides tracking system , but have not yet identified a permanent solution to improve the accuracy of data input . finally , dod , with va 's assistance , is in the early stages of an in - depth review of the entire ides process and its supporting it systems . this effort is intended to improve understanding of how each step contributes to overall processing times and identify opportunities to streamline the process and supporting systems . however , timeframes for completing the review or issuing recommendations have yet to be established . to improve monitoring of ides timeliness and satisfaction , gao recommends that dod and va work together to develop plans for completing the ongoing business process review and implementing any resulting recommendations and improve the accuracy of case information at the point of data entry ; and that dod consider alternative approaches to measuring satisfaction . dod and va concurred with gao 's recommendations .
congress established the enterprises to provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages and serve the mortgage credit needs of targeted groups . but in september 2008 , fhfa placed the enterprises in conservatorship out of concern that their deteriorating financial condition would destabilize the financial system . as congress and the executive branch have explored options for restructuring\ the enterprises , most of the discussion has focused on the single - family market . but the enterprises also play a large role in providing financing for\ multifamily properties ( those with five\ or more units ) . gao was asked to describe how the enterprises multifamily loan\ activities have changed , the financing marketplace and how they met affordable housing goals , and how the enterprises multifamily delinquency rates compare with those of other mortgage capital sources and how they have managed their credit risk . to address these objectives , gao analyzed loan - level data from 1994 ( the earliest period for which loan - level data were available ) through 2011 from the enterprises and data from the mortgage bankers association ; interviewed key multifamily housing stakeholders ; and reviewed fhfa examination reports . fhfa , fannie mae , and freddie mac provided technical comments , which gao incorporated where appropriate . from 1994 through 2011 , the multifamily loan activities of fannie mae and freddie mac ( the enterprises ) generally increased . in this period , fannie mae held a lower percentage of multifamily loans in its portfolio than freddie mac . while the enterprises multifamily business operations generally were profitable , both enterprises reported losses in 2008 and 2009. in recent years , fannie mae and freddie mac played a larger role in the multifamily marketplace , and their multifamily activities contributed considerably to meeting their affordable housing goals ( set by their regulator for the purchase of mortgages that serve targeted groups or areas ) . before 2008 , the enterprises financed about 30 percent of multifamily loans . their share increased to 86 percent in 2009 , but decreased to 57 percent in 2011 as other participants reentered the market . gao 's analysis showed that multifamily activities greatly contributed to the enterprises ' ability to meet affordable housing goals . for example , the enterprises ' multifamily activities constituted 4.5 percent of their total business in 2008 , but about a third of the units used to meet the goal of serving low - and moderate - income persons were multifamily units . the enterprises have purchased multifamily loans that generally performed as well as or better than those of other market participants , but the federal housing finance agency ( fhfa ) has identified deficiencies in their credit risk management . in 2005-2008 , the enterprises ' serious delinquency rates ( less than 1 percent ) were somewhat lower than the rates on multifamily loans made by commercial banks and much lower than rates for multifamily loans funded by commercial mortgage - backed securities . fhfa , through its examination and oversight of the enterprises , identified a number of credit risk deficiencies over the past few years . for example , fhfa found deficiencies in fannie mae 's delegated underwriting and servicing program , risk - management practices , and information systems ; and freddie mac 's management of its lower - performing assets . both enterprises have been taking steps to address these deficiencies .
there have been various reported incidents of individuals being potentially exposed to environmental hazards while on military installations . indeed , some incidents , such as contaminated air due to burn pits in afghanistan and iraq and contaminated water at camp lejeune , north carolina , have received considerable attention , and in the case of camp lejeune have resulted in claims seeking billions of dollars from the government . public law 111-383 , §314 directed gao to assess department of defense ( dod ) policies regarding environmental exposures . gaos objectives were to determine the extent to which dod has policies that identify and respond to environmental exposures , what programs exist to provide health care or compensation to individuals for environmental exposures , and which features of other federal programs may provide options in designing future compensation programs . gao briefed the armed services committees in december 2011 , to satisfy the mandate . to address these objectives , gao reviewed relevant documentation , visited installations , and interviewed relevant officials . dod relies on four types of policies to identify and respond to many but not all aspects of environmental exposures : environmental restoration policies address hazardous releases at military installations ; occupational and environmental health policies address workplace exposures ; deployment health policies address the collection of occupational and environmental health data for deployed individuals ; and public health emergency management policies . nonetheless , there are some limitations in the policies coverage . for example , dods environmental restoration policies do not specify when to conduct public health assessments at its sites beyond the initial assessment of certain priority sites required by the superfund law . in addition , dod has not fully documented its responses to recommendations that result from the assessments . dod officials responsible for oversight reported that they did not know what actions , if any , installations had taken on about 80 percent of the recommendations . without a comprehensive tracking system , dod has no assurance that it is addressing recommendations appropriately and could be missing opportunities to identify and resolve concerns about some health threats . further , dod has no policy guiding services and their installations on appropriate actions to address health risks from past exposures , which dod attributes to the superfund law not specifically requiring responsible parties to address such risks . although several programs potentially provide either health care or compensation to various types of individuals suffering from environmental exposures , the ability of some individuals to actually obtain benefitsparticularly compensationis often complicated by documentary , scientific , and legal factors . first , it is often difficult to document an environmental exposure because they are often not always identified at the time they occurred . second , it is often difficult to establish causation between an environmental exposure and a health condition , because scientific research has not always established a clear link . third , although under certain circumstances some individuals have legal standing under the federal tort claims act to file a lawsuit against the u.s. government for damages due to an environmental exposure , damages under the federal tort claims act are not available to other types of individuals , and for certain types of claims due to legal precedent or statutes . in several cases , congress has established alternative programs to provide compensation to specific populations exposed to specific environmental hazards , such as for individuals involved in the production of nuclear weapons and those who worked in coal mines . agency officials in charge of managing these alternative programs told us that certain features of these programs have proven to be beneficial to both claimants and administrators and should be considered for inclusion if any future programs are established to compensate individuals for environmental exposures on military installations . for example , department of labor and department of justice officials told gao a compensation program that resolves claims in a nonadversarial manner and provides outreach to potential claimants is more beneficial to both claimants and administrators . in contrast , a more adversarial with limited claimant assistance usually leads to delays and increased cost for both claimants and the agency adjudicating claims . gao is making recommendations to dod to identify and respond to limitations in its policies for responding to environmental exposures . dod generally disagreed with gaos recommendations , commenting that current policies are adequate . gao believes the recommendations remain valid , as discussed in the report .
paea required usps to prefund its future retiree health benefits as part of comprehensive postal reform by establishing the psrhbf along with an initial target period to fund the unfunded liability in 50 years . this requirement included annual payments to this fund from 2007 to 2016 of between $ 5.4 billion to $ 5.8 billion . usps , its employee groups , and others have argued that this prefunding requirement is a major source of usps 's financial woes -- reported by usps as contributing $ 32 billion toward its $ 41 billion of net losses over the past 6 years . usps defaulted on the last 2 years of psrhbf payments totaling $ 11.1 billion . as requested , this report addresses the status and financial outlook of the psrhbf , impact on future annual usps payments and unfunded liabilities of alternative approaches , and key considerations for policymakers . gao reviewed and summarized psrhbf financial data and analyzed and compared current law requirements with five alternative approaches by developing projections based on opm and usps data . the postal service retiree health benefits fund ( psrhbf ) covered about 49 percent of the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) $ 94 billion retiree health benefit liability at fiscal year - end 2012. usps 's deteriorating financial outlook , however , will make it difficult to continue the current prefunding schedule in the short term , and possibly to fully fund the remaining $ 48 billion unfunded liability over the remaining 44 years of the schedule on which the 2006 postal accountability and enhancement act ( paea ) was based . the liability covers the projected benefits for about 471,000 current postal retirees and a portion of the projected benefits for about 528,000 current employees ; it does not cover employees not yet hired . under paea , usps is responsible for contributing an additional $ 33.9 billion to the psrhbf by fiscal year 2017 , including the $ 11.1 billion usps has defaulted on over the past 2 years . paea also requires the office of personnel management ( opm ) to calculate the remaining unfunded liability in 2017 and develop an initial 40-year amortization payment schedule . usps , however , projects further declines in mail volume and revenues that may continue to limit its ability to prefund the remaining retiree health benefit liability . gao 's analysis of maintaining current law requirements compared to five alternative approaches showed differing impacts on usps 's future annual payments and unfunded liabilities . for example , three of the approaches -- 1 ) the administration 's approach , 2 ) senate bill ( s. 1789 ) and 3 ) `` pay - as - you - go '' ( no prefunding ) -- would reduce usps 's annual payments in the short term , thereby easing its immediate cash flow problems and financial losses . however , these approaches would increase usps 's unfunded liability , sometimes substantially , and require larger payments later . deferring funding could increase costs for future ratepayers and increase the possibility that usps may not be able to pay for some or all of its liability . conversely , a fourth approach -- the house bill ( h.r . 2309 ) -- and the current law requirement would reduce usps 's unfunded liabilities more aggressively but may result in significantly higher usps financial losses in the near future . if usps stopped prefunding and let the existing fund grow with interest , the unfunded liability is projected to significantly increase . under a fifth approach , if usps stopped prefunding and used the existing fund to pay current and future premiums , the fund is projected to be exhausted by 2026. private sector , state , local , and other federal entities are not required to prefund these benefits , though some do so to a limited extent , and most are required to recognize the future costs in their financial reporting . gao identified several key considerations including : the rationale and consequences of prefunding such benefits ; trade - offs affecting usps 's financial condition , such as sizes of the annual payments and unfunded liability ; fixed versus actuarially determined payments ; targeted funding levels ; and assumption criteria . usps is intended to be a self - sustaining entity funded almost entirely by postal ratepayers , but its financial losses are challenging its sustainability . gao has testified that usps should prefund its retiree health benefit liabilities to the maximum extent that its finances permit , but none of the funding approaches may be viable unless usps has the ability to make the payments . usps 's default on its last two required psrhbf payments and its inability to borrow further make the need for a comprehensive package of actions to achieve sustainable financial viability even more urgent . gao is not making new recommendations in this report , as it has already reported on strategies and options for usps to achieve sustainable financial viability .
gao has designated dod support infrastructure as an area of high risk and included one key related category -- installation support -- as an area for potential savings . in 2005 , dod recommended to the base realignment and closure commission combining 26 installations into 12 joint bases to generate efficiencies and cost savings and , in 2010 , completed this consolidation . gao assessed the extent to which dod developed and implemented a plan to achieve cost savings and efficiencies at the joint bases , joint base common standards provide a common framework to manage and plan for installation support services , and dod has a process to consistently identify and address any implementation challenges . gao reviewed dod policies and guidance on joint basing , visited 3 joint bases and obtained answers to written questions from the other 9 , interviewed osd and military service officials , and analyzed performance data on joint base support services . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) has not developed or implemented a plan to guide joint bases in achieving cost savings and efficiencies . the department of defense ( dod ) originally estimated saving $ 2.3 billion from joint basing over 20 years , but in the absence of a plan to drive savings , that estimate has fallen by almost 90 percent . osd also does not yet have a fully developed method for accurately collecting information on costs , savings , and efficiencies achieved specifically from joint basing . gao previously reported that organizational transformations such as merging components and transforming organizational cultures should be driven by top leadership , have implementation goals and a timeline to show progress , and include a communication strategy . although the joint bases anecdotally reported achieving some savings and efficiencies , without an implementation plan to drive savings and a means to collect reliable information on the specific costs , estimated savings , and efficiencies from joint basing , dod will not be able to facilitate achievement of the goals of cost savings and efficiencies , track the extent to which these goals have been achieved , or evaluate the continuation or expansion of joint basing . the joint bases implemented common standards for installation support services developed by osd , and in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 reported meeting the standards more than 70 percent of the time . however , three factors limited the usefulness of the reported standards as a common tool for managing installation support services : the lack of clarity in some standards , unclear standards that were not reviewed and changed in a timely manner , and data collection and reporting on the standards that in some cases adhered to individual service standards rather than the common standard . dod guidance states that the purpose of the joint base common standards framework was to provide a common language to serve as a basis for planning and management across the joint bases , and gao previously reported that performance measures should be clear and follow standard procedures . without a consistent interpretation and reported use of the standards , osd and the joint bases will not have reliable or comparable data with which to assess their service support levels . osd and the joint bases have various mechanisms in place to address challenges in achieving joint basing goals , such as a joint management oversight structure and annual osd - joint base review meetings , but none of these routinely facilitates communication among the joint bases to identify solutions to common challenges . the reported challenges cover a wide range of issues , from different expectations among military services as to how base support services should be provided to incompatible information technology networks . however , the absence of a formal method to routinely share information on common challenges and possible solutions , or guidance on developing and providing training for new personnel on how joint bases provide installation support , means dod is likely to miss opportunities to develop common solutions to common challenges . federal internal control standards state that for an entity to control its operations , it must have relevant and timely communications , and information is needed throughout the agency to achieve objectives . in addition , without processes to identify common challenges and share information across the joint bases , dod may miss opportunities for greater efficiencies and be unable to provide uniform policies across the joint bases . gao recommends that dod take six actions , such as developing a plan to achieve cost savings , prioritizing review and revision of unclear common standards , and developing a strategy to share solutions to common challenges . dod partially agreed with five recommendations and did not concur with the recommendation to develop a plan to achieve cost savings , because it stated that such goals are not appropriate at this time . gao continues to believe that the recommendations are valid as discussed further in the report .
according to dod , the u.s. militarys dependence on liquid fuel in countries like afghanistan creates an enormous logistics burden that exposes forces to enemy attack and diverts operational resources from other mission areas to support delivery of this critical resource . in 2011 , dod consumed almost 5 billion gallons of fuel in military operations worldwide , at a cost of approximately $ 17.3 billion . gao was asked to assess dods approach for fuel demand management , including at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan , determine the extent to which dod has initiatives to promote fuel efficiency at forward - deployed locations in afghanistan and efforts to coordinate and collaborate on such initiatives , and assess efforts to measure the results of its fuel demand management initiatives and establish a baseline measure of fuel consumption in afghanistan . to conduct this review , gao analyzed dod and service guidance and strategies related to fuel demand management and fuel demand management initiatives , visited locations in afghanistan , and met with dod officials . the department of defense ( dod ) has taken steps to establish an approach for managing dods overall fuel demand , but is still developing comprehensive guidance to address fuel demand management , including at forward - deployed locations in countries such as afghanistan . in 2009 , gao reported that dod lacked visibility and accountability for achieving fuel reduction , incentives and a viable funding mechanism to invest in the implementation of fuel demand reduction projects , and guidance and policies that addressed fuel demand at forward - deployed locations . in response to gao recommendations , dod has taken steps since 2009 to increase its visibility and accountability for fuel demand management at forward - deployed locations , including those located in afghanistan . in addition , with an increased focus on fuel demand management , dod has also provided funding and incentives to implement fuel demand management projects . further , dod has issued some guidance on fuel demand management at forward - deployed locations since 2009 and is developing more comprehensive guidance on how dod will incorporate energy efficiency considerations into operations , planning , and training decisions for current military operations in afghanistan and for future military operations . dods 2012 operational energy strategy implementation plan acknowledges the need for additional comprehensive guidance and directs the joint staff and military departments to report , by the end of fiscal year 2012 , on how operational energy considerations will be reflected in policy , doctrine , and professional military education . the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2009 requires dod to report to congress annually on its progress in implementing its operational energy strategy . dod has yet to submit its first report . multiple dod organizations are developing initiatives to decrease fuel demand at forward - deployed locations , including in afghanistan , and the department has worked to facilitate some coordination and collaboration among the services on fuel demand management efforts . however , it is still developing an approach to systematically identify and track all of the fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded , or are in the research and development phase throughout dod . gaos prior work found that utilizing a mechanism such as a database can help organizations enhance their visibility and oversight of dod programs . until dod finalizes its approach to systematically identify and track fuel demand management initiatives , it may be limited in its ability to foster collaboration , achieve efficiencies , and avoid unintended duplication or overlap of activities . dod has started to measure the results of some of the fuel demand management initiatives used in afghanistan , but is still in the process of collecting and assessing comprehensive baseline data needed to measure current fuel consumption at forward - deployed locations . the army and marine corps have begun collecting data on the amount of fuel consumed by their current assets in afghanistan . recognizing the need for additional information , dods 2012 implementation plan has tasked the services with developing and refining their fuel consumption baselines by mid - 2012 and dod has provided funding for this purpose . once collected , these data should enhance dods planning , programming , and operational decisions and help dod assess progress toward meeting its operational energy goals . gao recommends that dod finalize and implement a systematic approach that includes establishing a mechanism to identify and track fuel demand management initiatives that have been fielded , or are in the research and development phase . dod partially concurred with gaos recommendation , citing ongoing efforts to identify and track initiatives . until fully implemented , gao is unable to assess whether these efforts fully address the recommendatio .
since fiscal year 2007 fema has obligated $ 33 billion in disaster assistance payments . fema relies heavily upon its cadre of daes , a reserve workforce who interact with disaster survivors . gao was asked to review the management and training of daes . specifically , this report addresses the extent to which fema has policies and procedures in place to govern the dae program ; femas human capital controls over the dae workforce are consistent with internal control standards ; and femas dae training incorporates key attributes of effective training and development programs . in addition , gao describes femas initiative to transform the dae program announced in april 2012. gao reviewed management documents such as program - specific and human capital - related guidance , interviewed fema officials , and conducted 16 focus group sessions with daes in four selected joint field offices chosen to provide geographic dispersion , among other factors . the results of the focus groups are not generalizable , but provide valuable insight into dae experiences . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) has taken steps to enhance its management of the disaster assistance employee ( dae ) program , such as through the establishment of a credentialing program , the fema qualification system ( fqs ) ; however , management controls and training could be strengthened . for example , fema does not monitor how the regions implement dae policies and how daes implement disaster policies across regions to ensure consistency . femas administrator noted that due to differences in how regions operate , it is problematic to deploy someone based in one region to another during a disaster . establishing a mechanism to monitor both the regional implementation of dae policies and procedures and daes implementation of disaster policies could help provide fema with reasonable assurance that disaster assistance is conducted in accordance with policy and implemented consistently . femas human capital controls could be strengthened . femas regional dae managers are responsible for hiring daes , but fema has not established hiring criteria and has limited salary criteria . by establishing standardized criteria for making hiring and salary decisions , fema would be better positioned to hire people with requisite skills and better ensure consistency across regions . likewise , femas performance appraisal system for daes is not consistent with internal control standards . fema does not have criteria for supervisors to assign daes satisfactory or unsatisfactory ratings . thirteen of 16 regional dae managers gao interviewed stated that the appraisal process could be improved , such as implementing a rating scale instead of a pass / fail rating . fema officials noted that performance management is a critical component in dae supervision and must be improved in fiscal year 2012. establishing a more rigorous performance management system that includes criteria for given performance elements as well as guidance could help fema ensure that daes performance appraisals more accurately reflect performance and provide needed information to managers . femas dae training is not consistent with key attributes of effective training and development programs , such as a plan for training staff . fema does not have a plan to ensure daes receive necessary training such as fqs requirements . further , 13 of 16 regional dae managers gao spoke to said that they would like more opportunities for daes to receive training . a plan to ensure that all daes have opportunities for training and completing fqs requirements with related milestones would provide fema with a roadmap and ensure accountability for qualifying daes under fqs . in addition , fema does not track how much of the disaster relief fund is spent on training for daes . developing a systematic process to track training costs could provide fema with information to help it determine whether it is allocating its resources effectively . in an april 2012 memo , fema announced plans to transform the dae program beginning in june 2012 ; however , this effort is still in the early stages and as a result , it is too soon to evaluate the effectiveness of femas planned actions . gao recommends , among other things , that fema establish a mechanism to monitor both its regions implementation of dae policies and daes implementation of disaster policies ; criteria for hiring and compensating daes ; and a plan to train daes within a set time frame . dhs concurred with the recommendations .
federal agencies and state and local governments have established field - based entities ( e.g . , centers and task forces ) nationwide that share terrorism - related information , among other things . gao was asked to assess these entities . this report addresses the extent to which these entities are distinct , fragmented , overlapping , or duplicative ; the extent to which doj , dhs , and ondcp hold entities accountable for coordinating and have assessed coordination opportunities ; and how , if at all , doj , dhs , and ondcp incorporate information on the results entities achieve when making funding decisions . gao analyzed entities ' missions , activities , and coordination efforts in eight selected urban areas that range in geographic dispersion and risk . although not generalizable , this analysis provided insights . this is a public version of a sensitive report gao issued in march 2013. information the federal bureau of investigations ( fbi ) deemed sensitive has been redacted . five types of field - based information - sharing entities are supported , in part , by the federal government -- joint terrorism task forces , field intelligence groups , regional information sharing systems ( riss ) centers , state and major urban area fusion centers , and high intensity drug trafficking area ( hidta ) investigative support centers -- and have distinct missions , roles , and responsibilities . however , gao identified 91 instances of overlap in some analytical activities -- such as producing intelligence reports -- and 32 instances of overlap in investigative support activities , such as identifying links between criminal organizations . these entities conducted similar activities within the same mission area , such as counterterrorism , for similar customers , such as federal or state agencies . this can lead to benefits , such as the corroboration of information , but may also burden customers with redundant information . gao also found that riss centers and hidtas operate three different systems that duplicate the same function -- identifying when different law enforcement entities may be conducting a similar enforcement action , such as a raid at the same location , to ensure officer safety -- resulting in some inefficiencies . riss and hidta have taken steps to connect two of the systems , but hidta does not have target time frames to connect the third system . a commitment to time frames would help reduce risks to officer safety and potentially lessen the burden on law enforcement agencies that are currently using multiple systems . agencies have neither held entities accountable for coordinating nor assessed opportunities for further enhancing coordination to help reduce the potential for overlap and achieve efficiencies . the departments of justice ( doj ) and homeland security ( dhs ) , and the office of national drug control policy ( ondcp ) -- the federal agencies that oversee or provide support to the five types of field - based entities -- acknowledged that entities working together and sharing information is important , but they do not hold the entities accountable for such coordination . a mechanism that enables agencies to monitor the results of coordination efforts could encourage more coordination , help reduce any unnecessary overlap and leverage resources . officials in the eight urban areas said that practices such as having representatives from other agencies on governance boards and colocating entities where possible enhanced coordination , information sharing , and efficiencies -- in their view , reducing the potential of unnecessary overlap . federal agencies have not assessed the extent to which such practices could be further implemented and , therefore , may be missing opportunities to maximize benefits . the program manager for the information sharing environment ( pm - ise ) -- which manages efforts to enhance sharing governmentwide -- has not reported on specific coordination efforts across the entities . including agencies ' assessment progress in the annual reports to the congress would enhance accountability . the agencies collect information on entities ' results , but vary in the extent to which they consider the results when they make decisions about future funding . for example , agencies may consider other factors -- such as risk and threats -- rather than results , or funding decisions may be determined by state grant recipients or set in part by statutory or other requirements . gao recommends that ondcp work with hidta officials to establish time frames to connect systems ; dhs , doj , and ondcp develop measures to hold entities accountable for coordination and assess opportunities to enhance coordination ; and the pm - ise report on the results of the agencies efforts to assess coordination . dhs , ondcp , and the pm - ise concurred . doj generally agreed with the intent of the recommendations , but disagreed with their underlying premises that doj was not already taking such actions . gao believes these actions do not fully address the recommendations as discussed further in this report .
rising costs and fiscal challenges have slowed the multibillion - dollar courthouse construction program of the judiciary and the general services administration ( gsa ) . in 2006 , the judiciary developed amp to address increasing costs and incorporate best practices and has evaluated about 67 percent of its courthouses under the new system . as requested , gao assessed changes introduced with amp . gao examined : the extent to which the amp process aligns with leading practices and provides information needed for informed decision making and the extent to which courthouse projects recommended for funding in fiscal years 2014 to 2018 were assessed under the amp process . gao compared the judiciary 's capitalplanning practices with leading practices , analyzed courthouseplanning documents , and interviewed officials from the judiciary and gsa . gao visited three courthouses selected because they were highly ranked by the judiciary for replacement , although observations from these site visits can not be generalized . the asset management planning ( amp ) process represents progress by the federal judiciary ( judiciary ) in better aligning its capital - planning process with leading capitalplanning practices , but its 5-year plan for fiscal years 2014 to 2018- - the document the judiciary uses to request courthouse construction projects -- lacks transparency and key information on how projects qualify for new construction , alternatives the judiciary considered , and their cost . for example , the plan lists costs for the next phase of the 12 recommended courthouse projects , which have several phases , but does not list previous funding or ongoing annual costs for the projects . as a result , the plan lists about $ 1 billion in costs for the 12 projects , but the projects would actually cost the federal government an estimated $ 3.2 billion over the next 20 years . congress has appropriated a small share of the money needed for the projects , and most will need design changes before construction can begin . as a result , there is a risk that congressional funding decisions could be made without complete and accurate information . however , with this information , decision makers could weigh current - year budget decisions within the context of projects ' expected future costs , spur discussion and debate about actions to address them , and put the judiciary 's requests in context with other federal spending . ten of the 12 recommended projects were not evaluated under the amp process . judiciary officials said that they did not want to delay the current projects or force them to undergo a second capital - planning process after they had already been approved . two courthouse projects from a previous 5-year plan that were assessed under amp were removed from the list and are now ranked behind more than 100 other courthouse construction projects . furthermore , 10 of the 12 recommended construction projects do not qualify for a new courthouse under the amp criterion , which requires that new courthouses need two or more additional courtrooms . these conditions call into question the extent to which the projects remaining on the 5-year plan represent the judiciary 's most urgent projects and whether proceeding with these projects represents the most fiscally responsible proposal . while 10 additional amp evaluations would involve some additional costs , not conducting those evaluations could involve spending $ 3.2 billion over the next 20 years on courthouses that may not be the most urgent projects .
foreign nationals may apply for entry into the united states under dozens of different visa categories , depending on circumstances . states bureaus of consular affairs and diplomatic security share responsibility for the prevention of visa fraud , which is a serious problem that threatens the integrity of the process . some documents through illegal means , such as using counterfeit identity documents or making false claims to an adjudicating officer . visa fraud may facilitate illegal activities in the united states , including crimes of violence , human trafficking , and terrorism . this report examines countries and visa categories that are subject to the most fraud ; state 's use of technologies and resources to combat fraud ; and training requirements of state officials responsible for fraud prevention . gao examined state 's reports and data on fraud trends and statistics , examined resources and technologies to counter fraud , and observed visa operations and fraud prevention efforts overseas and domestically . certain countries and visa categories are subject to higher levels of fraud . in fiscal year 2010 , almost 60 percent of confirmed fraud cases ( 9,200 out of 16,000 ) involved applicants from brazil , china , dominican republic , india , and mexico . department of state ( state ) officials told gao that fraud most commonly involves applicants for temporary visits to the united states who submit false documentation to overcome the presumption that they intend to illegally immigrate . fraud is also perpetrated for immigrant visas and nonimmigrant visa categories such as temporary worker visas and student visas . in response to state efforts to combat visa fraud , unscrupulous visa applicants adapt their strategies , and as a result , fraud trends evolve over time . state has a variety of technological tools and resources to assist consular officers in combating fraud , but does not have a policy for their systematic use . for example , state recently implemented fraud prevention technologies such as a fraud case management system that establishes connections among multiple visa applications , calling attention to potentially fraudulent activity . overseas posts have fraud prevention units that consist of a fraud prevention manager ( fpm ) and locally employed staff who analyze individual fraud cases . in 2011 , the ratio of fraud prevention unit staff to fraud cases varied widely across overseas posts , causing disproportionate workloads . the kentucky consular center ( kcc ) is a domestic resource available to posts that verifies information on certain visa applications . however , kcc services are only provided on an ad - hoc basis , and state does not have a policy for posts to systematically utilize its resources . for example , an fpm at a high fraud post told gao that the post would like to utilize kcc anti - fraud services for screening certain visa categories , but did not know how to request kcc assistance . although state offers anti - fraud training courses at the foreign service institute and online , it does not require fpms to take them and does not track fpms enrollment . consular officers receive limited fraud training as part of the initial consular course , and fpms are not required to take advanced fraud training in new technologies . in addition , gao found that 81 percent of fpm positions were filled by entry - level officers and 84 percent of fpm positions were designated as either part - time or rotational . between october 2009 and july 2012 , entry - level officers made up about 21 percent of the total students who registered for a course on detecting fraudulent documents , and state could not guarantee that fpms were among them . four out of the five fpms with whom gao spoke had not been trained in state 's new fraud case management system . gao recommends that state formulate a policy to systematically utilize anti - fraud resources available at kcc , based on post workload and fraud trends , as determined by the department and establish requirements for fpm training in advanced anti - fraud technologies , taking advantage of distance learning technologies , and establishing methods to track the extent to which requirements are met . state concurred with these recommendations .
dod operates a large and complex health care system that employs more than 150,000 military , civilian , and contract personnel working in military treatment facilities . each military department operates its own facilities , and contracts separately for health care professionals to supplement care provided within these facilities . in fiscal year 2011 , these contracts totaled $ 1.14 billion . in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 , congress mandated that gao review the military departments ' acquisition of health care professional services . this report examines the contracting practices used by the departments and their cost effectiveness ; the extent to which the departments consolidate health care staffing requirements ; the percentage and associated costs of contract health care professionals working at on - base facilities versus offbase ; the training requirements for and experience of medical services contracting personnel ; and the extent to which the departments ' policies address legislated quality standards for contract civilian health care professionals and for staffing companies that provide these professionals . to conduct this review , gao reviewed military health care policies , analyzed dod 's fiscal year 2011 procurement and staffing data , and interviewed dod military health system officials . the military departments -- the army , navy , and air force -- generally use competition and fixed - price contracts when contracting for medical professionals . these practices can provide lower prices or reduced risk for the government . the military departments use a number of contract arrangements , including contracts awarded to multiple health care staffing companies , for health care professionals . military department analyses indicate that multiple - award contracts result in lower prices compared to other contract arrangements . the department of defense ( dod ) does not have a consolidated agency - wide acquisition strategy for medical services . in the absence of such a strategy , contracting for health care professionals is largely fragmented . for example , the military departments had not consolidated their staffing requirements by developing joint contracts beyond a limited number of instances amounting to about 8 percent of the fiscal year 2011 spending on health care professionals . the departments have made efforts to use multiple - award contracts to consolidate intraservice staffing requirements , but gao identified several instances where multiple task orders were placed for the same type of provider in the same area or facility . a more consolidated strategic sourcing strategy could allow dod to acquire medical services in a more cost - effective way . nearly all of the military departments ' 11,253 contract health care professionals -- 96 percent -- worked in 114 on - base military treatment facilities in fiscal year 2011 , while the remaining 4 percent worked in 8 off - base clinics . the costs associated with the contracted health care services provided at on - base facilities are not comparable to such costs at off - base facilities for a variety of reasons . for example , some military health system cost accounting data have been characterized as unreliable . in addition , according to dod officials , labor categories , labor costs , and full time equivalent calculations all vary by military department and in some cases by facility , contract , or geographic location , making a cost comparison problematic . dod medical services contracting personnel are subject to dod - wide training requirements . consistent with dod - wide training for all its contracting officers , dod does not require health care contracting officers to have specialized training or experience . the required training provides a foundation for career field knowledge and is not targeted to specific types of acquisitions , including contracts for health care professionals . health care experience among contracting personnel varied by location . air force contracting officers are not typically dedicated to medical services contracting , unlike their counterparts in the army and navy . the military departments provide contracting officers ' representatives , who provide contract oversight , with specialized training in contracting for health care . gao found that each of the departments has policies or procedures in place that generally address most of the legislated quality standards enacted in 2007 for contract health care professionals and the staffing companies that provide them . however , dod did not require the military departments to use consistent quality standards in response to this legislation because dod officials believed that the departments were already applying these standards as part of their contracting processes . gao recommends that the secretary of defense develop a dod - wide strategic approach to contracting for health care professionals . dod concurred with the recommendation .
farmers and other agricultural producers are exposed to natural disasters , such as droughts , floods , hurricanes , and tornadoes . in the aftermath of such events , fsa and sba disaster assistance programs can provide an important safety net for these producers . however , after past natural disasters , industry groups and others have raised concerns that some small agricultural producersparticularly aquaculture ( such as farmed fish and shellfish ) and nursery ( such as trees and plants ) producersreported being ineligible to obtain this assistance . gao was asked to examine fsa and sba disaster assistance programs and the coverage they provide to small producers ; identify the main factors , if any , that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers participation in these disaster assistance programs ; and examine fsa and sba efforts to collaborate in providing such assistance to these producers . gao reviewed the 10 fsa and sba disaster assistance programs that become available following a natural disaster and that provide direct financial assistance or loans to these producers , interviewed agency officials and industry representatives , and reviewed agency documents and regulations . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) and the small business administration ( sba ) have 10 disaster assistance programs that small agricultural producers and businesses that support agriculture can use to recover from natural disasters . these programs serve largely different populations but leave few gaps in the disaster assistance available to most small agricultural producers . aquaculture and nursery producers could be eligible for six of these programs , but their participation is limited by awareness and eligibility issues . gao identified three factors that may limit small aquaculture and nursery producers ' participation in the 6 disaster assistance programs for which they could be eligible . in particular , the producers are often not aware of the programs , have other options for assistance , or do not qualify because they do not meet certain program requirements . both fsa and sba conduct outreach related to their disaster assistance programs , but neither agency has specifically targeted its efforts toward small aquaculture and nursery producers . as a result , eligible producers are missing opportunities to obtain assistance that could help them maintain a viable business after experiencing a natural disaster . fsa and sba engaged in some informal efforts to collaborate in providing disaster assistance to small aquaculture and nursery producers . however , the efforts were limited because fsa field staff know little about sba 's disaster assistance programs , and sba staff know little about the factors that affect whether an agricultural loan will be repaid . gao has reported that agencies with complementary programs can enhance the value of these programs through interagency collaboration . without more formal collaboration , small producers may not be consistently referred by one agency to the other , leading to fewer opportunities for these small producers to get assistance for which they otherwise might qualify . gao recommends that usda and sba target outreach to small aquaculture and nursery producers , for example , by building on existing outreach , and develop a strategy to formally collaborate on disaster assistance for such producers . usda and sba generally concurred with gao 's recommendations .
as of january 3 , 2012 , the united states recognized 566 indian tribes . federal recognition confers specific legal status on tribes and imposes certain responsibilities on the federal government , such as an obligation to provide certain benefits to tribes and their members . some tribes are not federally recognized but have qualified for and received federal funding . some of these non - federally recognized tribes are state recognized and may be located on state reservations . gao was asked to address the key means by which non - federally recognized tribes have been eligible for federal funding and the amount of federal funding awarded to non - federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through 2010. gao also identified some eligibility and federal financial reporting issues related to non - federally recognized tribes . gao compiled a list of about 400 non - federally recognized tribes and reviewed information from federal agencies , usaspending.gov , states , and other sources to identify tribes federal funding and eligibility . of the approximately 400 non - federally recognized tribes that gao identified , 26 received funding from 24 federal programs during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. most of the 26 non - federally recognized tribes were eligible to receive this funding either because of their status as nonprofit organizations or state - recognized tribes . similarly , most of the 24 federal programs that awarded funding to non - federally recognized tribes during the 4-year period were authorized to fund nonprofit organizations or state - recognized tribes . in addition , some of these programs were authorized to fund other entities , such as tribal communities or community development financial institutions . for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 , 24 federal programs awarded more than $ 100 million to the 26 non - federally recognized tribes . most of the funding was awarded to a few non - federally recognized tribes by a small number of programs . specifically , 95 percent of the funding was awarded to 9 non - federally recognized tribes , and most of that funding was awarded to the lumbee tribe of north carolina . similarly , 95 percent of the funding was awarded by seven programs in four agencies , and most of that funding was awarded by one department of housing and urban development program . during the course of its review , gao identified some instances where federal agencies had provided funding to non - federally recognized tribes for which grant eligibility is disputed and one instance where an agency was in the process of better enforcing federal financial reporting requirements with one tribe . specifically : the department of education awarded american indian vocational rehabilitation services program funding to the united houma nation , the lumbee tribe of north carolina , and a consortium consisting of the choctaw - apache tribe of ebarb and the four winds cherokee . each of these four tribes is state recognized , but it appears that none of them has a reservation as required by the statute establishing the program . gao has substantial questions about whether educations interpretation of the term reservation is broader than the statutory definition supports . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) awarded funding to the nanticoke lenni - lenape indians of new jersey and the powhatan renape nationtwo non - federally recognized tribes in new jerseyunder programs authorized to fund state - recognized tribes . the state of new jersey , however , does not consider these entities to be state recognized . hhs has initiated action to enforce federal financial reporting requirements for the accohannock indian tribe . the accohannock indian tribe has not filed its required financial report for 2009 that was due no later than september 30 , 2010. in 2009 , the accohannock indian tribe reported spending over $ 1 million in federal funds from three different federal programs administered by the department . the department sent letters of inquiry about the delinquent financial report on march 8 , 2011 , and more recently , after gao inquired about the issue , on february 7 , 2012. gao recommends that education and hhs take specific actions to ensure that they are not making grants to ineligible tribes and to enforce federal financial reporting requirements . hhs agreed . education stated its commitment to review its practices , but disagreed with gaos finding on the statutory eligibility for the american indian vocational rehabilitation services program , which is discussed more fully in the report .
the department of defense ( dod ) has faced long - term challenges in managing and halting degradation of its portfolio of facilities and reducing unneeded infrastructure to free up funds to better maintain the facilities it still uses and to meet other needs . costs to build and maintain the defense infrastructure represent a significant financial commitment . dods management of its support infrastructure is on gaos high - risk list , in part because of the challenges dod faces in reducing its unneeded excess and obsolete infrastructure . dod plans to reduce force structure and the president will request that congress authorize the base realignment and closure ( brac ) process for 2013 and 2015. the secretary of defense stated that the brac process is the only effective way to achieve needed infrastructure savings . this testimony discusses key factors and challenges that contributed to brac 2005 implementation and results and the most recent estimated costs and savings attributable to brac 2005. to do this work , gao reviewed its previous work and selected documents related to brac 2005 such as brac business plans that laid out the requisite actions , timing of those actions , and dods estimated costs and savings associated with implementing each recommendation , briefings on brac implementation status prepared by the military services , and budget justification materials submitted to congress . gao also interviewed current and former officials from dod and the brac commission involved in the development , review , and implementation of brac recommendations . gao identified several factors and challenges that contributed to the department of defenses ( dod ) implementation of base realignment and closure ( brac ) 2005 and the results achieved . in contrast to other brac rounds that were primarily focused on achieving savings by reducing excess infrastructure , the secretary of defense identified three goals for brac 2005. specifically , brac 2005 was intended to transform the military , foster jointness , and reduce excess infrastructure to produce savings . these goals and the primary selection criterias focus on enhancing military value led dod to identify numerous recommendations that were designed to be transformational and enhance jointness , thereby adding to the complexity the brac commission and dod faced in finalizing and implementing the recommendations . some transformational - type recommendations needed sustained attention by dod and significant coordination and planning among multiple stakeholders . to improve oversight of implementation of the recommendations , the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) required business plans for each brac 2005 recommendation to better manage implementation . in addition , dod developed recommendations that were interdependent on each other . however , this led to challenges across multiple recommendations when delays in completing one recommendation led to delays in completing others . specifically , dod had to synchronize the relocations of over 123,000 people with about $ 24.7 billion in new construction or renovation at installations . given the complexity of some brac recommendations , osd directed the services to periodically brief it on implementation challenges . furthermore , the scale of brac 2005 posed a number of challenges to the commission as it conducted its independent review . for example , it reported that dods recommendations were of unprecedented scope and complexity , compounding the difficulty of its review . moreover , the interdependent nature of some recommendations made it difficult for the commission to evaluate the effect on installations that were both gaining and losing units simultaneously . finally , the effect on communities from installation growth has led to challenges . for example , communities experiencing growth were hindered in their ability to effectively plan for off - base support such as adequate roads and schools due to inconsistent information from dod around the 2007 time frame . dods fiscal year 2011 brac 2005 budget submission to congress shows that costs to implement the brac recommendations grew from $ 21 billion originally estimated by the brac commission in 2005 dollars to about $ 35.1 billion in current dollars , an increase of about $ 14.1 billion , or 67 percent . in constant 2005 dollars , costs increased to $ 32.2 billion , an increase of 53 percent . costs increased mostly due to military construction as dod identified the need for new and renovated facilities to enhance capabilities . in 2005 , the commission estimated net annual recurring savings of $ 4.2 billion and a 20-year net present value savings by 2025 of $ 36 billion . gaos analysis shows annual recurring savings are now about $ 3.8 billion , a decrease of 9.5 percent , while the 20-year net present value savings are now about $ 9.9 billion , a decrease of 73 percent . as such , dod will not recoup its up -

initiated in 2008 , secure communities is an ice program designed to identify potentially removable aliens , particularly those with criminal convictions , in state and local law enforcement custody . fingerprints checked against a federal bureau of investigation criminal database are checked against dhss immigration database to help determine whether an arrested individual is removable . gao was asked to review secure communities operations . this report addresses enforcement trends under secure communities , ices adherence to best practices in acquiring secure communitiesrelated technology , and ice safeguards to help protect against potential civil rights abuses under secure communities . gao analyzed ice data on removals from october 2008 through march 2012 , and arrest charges from october 2010 through march 2012 ; reviewed program guidance , policies , and reports ; and interviewed ices law enforcement support center and agency officials , local law enforcement and community groups in four locations selected for geographic diversity , among other factors . these perspectives are not generalizable , but provided insights into secure communities operations . data from the department of homeland securitys ( dhs ) immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) indicate that the percentage of its removals attributable to secure communities increased from about 4 percent in fiscal year 2009 to about 20 percent in fiscal year 2011. of about 183,000 aliens removed under the program from october 2008 through march 2012 , about 74 percent had a criminal conviction . ice did not have state or local arrest charges for about 56 percent of alien secure communities removals from october 2010 ( when ice began collecting arrest charges ) through march 2012 , so we were unable to determine the most frequent arrest charges under the program . for the 44 percent of aliens removed on whom ice collected arrest charge data , traffic offenses , including driving under the influence of alcohol , were the most frequent arrest charges . ice is taking steps to improve the collection of arrest charge data , but it is too early to assess the effectiveness of its efforts . ice has not consistently followed best practices in acquiring technology to help determine the immigration status of aliens identified by secure communities . ice awarded contracts to modernize its technology without fully defining requirements or developing an integrated master scheduletwo best practices for managing capital programs . as a result , ice encountered delays , cost increases , and products that did not meet ices needs . for example , ice spent $ 14.3 million for one contract to develop services that ice found to be unusable . establishing well - defined requirements and developing an integrated schedule for completing technology modernization could better position ice to prevent delays and cost increases . further , ice plans to develop a workforce plan after the systems are deployed . developing a workforce plan prior to full system deployment , consistent with internal controls , could better position ice to effectively use staff when it deploys the modernized technology . dhss office of civil rights and ice identified four safeguards to help protect aliens civil rights under secure communities , including providing detainees with a revised detainer form with telephone numbers to call when they feel their civil rights have been violated . officials are also developing briefing materials on how to protect aliens civil rights , statistically analyzing arrest and other information to identify potential civil rights abuses , and using an existing dhs complaint process for addressing secure communities concerns . gao recommends that ice develop well - defined requirements and an integrated master schedule that accounts for all activities for its technology contracts , and a plan for workforce changes in preparation for full technology deployment . dhs concurred with the recommendations .
competition is the cornerstone of a sound acquisition process and a critical tool for achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers . in fiscal year 2012 , dod obligated $ 359 billion through contracts and task orders , of which 57 percent was competed . dod also obligates billions of dollars annually on contracts that are awarded competitively , but for which the government received only one offer . dod implemented the better buying power initiative in 2010 , in an effort to increase competition . the conference report for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 directed gao to report on dods non - competitive and one - offer contracts . gao examined trends in dods use of noncompetitive awards ; factors influencing dods competition rate ; the extent to which justifications provided insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards ; and the impact of dods new requirement for competitive solicitations that only elicit one offer . gao analyzed federal procurement data for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 , reviewed dod policy and competition reports , examined nongeneralizable samples of awards , and interviewed dod officials . the department of defenses ( dod ) competition rate for all contract obligations declined over the past five fiscal years , from 62.6 percent in fiscal year 2008 to 57.1 percent in fiscal year 2012. gao also found that the competition rate in fiscal year 2012 varied by specific dod component with the air force having the lowest at 37.1 percent and the defense logistics agency the highest at 83.3 percent . the majority of the noncompetitive awards cited the availability of only one responsible source to meet the governments needs as the reason for using noncompetitive procedures . a number of factors affect dods competition rate , but these factors are not always considered when setting dods annual competition goals . for example , reliance on an original equipment manufacturer throughout the life cycle of a program has been a long - standing challenge for dod competition , and budget uncertainty can also hinder dods ability to compete . noncompetitive purchases that dod makes on behalf of foreign governments can also affect dods competition rate . dod does not systematically consider these and other factors when setting its annual competition goals . for example , it sets competition goals for individual dod components by simply adding two percentage points to the rate achieved in the previous year . without identifying and tracking the specific factors affecting competition dod can not set meaningful goals for improving competition or accurately gauge its progress toward achieving them . many of the noncompetitive justifications gao reviewed included the required elements as defined by the federal acquisition regulation ; however , the level of insight into the reasons for noncompetitive awards varied . for example , some justifications included clear descriptions of market environments where only one source was available to meet the governments needs or described planned actions that could help improve competition in the future . however , other justifications provided limited insight into the reasons for the noncompetitive award or did not fully describe actions that the agency could take to increase future competition . without this information , dod may be missing opportunities to gain a fuller understanding of why past acquisitions were not competitive and may be unable to apply those lessons to effectively facilitate competition for future acquisitions . in 2010 , dod introduced a new requirement that applies to competitive awards that elicit only one offer ( one - offer awards ) ; however , the impact of the requirement is unknown because of unreliable data . to address the risk associated with one - offer awards , the requirement established rules that were intended to help ensure adequate solicitation time , ensure that contract requirements are not unnecessarily restrictive , and verify that offers received are fair and reasonable . however , gaos analysis of 35 one - offer awards determined that contracting officers had incorrectly coded 10 of these awards in the procurement database that dod relies on to measure the impact of its new requirement . six of the 10 awards were noncompetitive awards and the remaining 4 had received multiple offers . as a result , gao determined that dods data can not be used to accurately calculate the amount obligated on one - offer awards during fiscal year 2012. without reliable data , dod can not accurately measure the impact of its new requirement . gao recommends that dod identify , track , and consider the specific factors that affect competition when setting competition goals ; develop guidance to apply lessons learned from past procurements to help achieve competition in the future ; and collect reliable data on one - offer awards . dod concurred with these recommendations .
in 2003 , the bush administration announced the proliferation security initiative ( psi ) to enhance u.s. efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) . psi is not a program housed in only one agency , but instead is a set of activities with participation by multiple u.s. agencies and other countries . congress recommended that the department of defense ( dod ) and department of state ( state ) establish policies , procedures , and indicators to measure results and required that they submit annual reports . it also mandated that gao report on psi effectiveness . in 2008 , gao likewise recommended that law enforcement agencies also establish policies , procedures , and performance indicators . this report assesses the progress relevant agencies have made since 2008 in establishing recommended psi policies and procedures and issuing required annual reports ; and the extent to which psi activities have enhanced and expanded u.s. counterproliferation efforts . gao reviewed and analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials from state , dod , and other agencies with psi responsibilities . u.s. agencies have adopted interagency guidance documents that establish psi policies and procedures and have submitted annual reports ; however , these reports do not contain expenditure data for all agencies as required by law . the agencies produced documents that contain general psi policies and procedures . in addition , dod and the department of homeland securitys customs and border protection ( cbp ) developed policies and procedures specifically to guide their agencies psi activities . the annual reports submitted in 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 met requirements to describe psi - related activities planned for future years and those that took place in the preceding year . although the reports included an account of dods psi expenditures , they did not contain all expenditures for other agencies for psi activities as required by law . u.s. officials participated in a range of psi activities since 2008 to meet their objective of expanding and enhancing counterproliferation efforts , but it is unclear to what extent these activities have achieved the objective because agencies lack measures of results . the agencies either led or participated in 22 psi activities from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011 including multilateral meetings and exercises . officials stated that their outreach efforts contributed to increased support for psi since gaos 2008 report , such as the increase from 93 to 98 countries endorsing psi . in addition , they have extended access to psi activities to more countries that are not part of the group of 21 psi operational experts group countries , for example by holding regional planning meetings . despite recommendations of congress and gao that agencies develop psi performance indicators , dod , state , cbp , and the federal bureau of investigation have not developed indicators that can be used to systematically measure progress toward the stated psi objective . further , the agencies have not systematically evaluated psi activity results . although some officials indicated plans to develop psi performance indicators , officials from dod and state also cited several challenges to developing indicators to measure psi activities results including difficulty quantifying how psi activities improved capacity . however , gao has previously reported that , despite such challenges , developing measures that help link activities to results is possible . psi agencies could develop a framework that links performance measures to outcomes . for example , such a framework could link the number of participants trained to changes in national policies that strengthen participant countries authority to interdict the shipment of wmd , their delivery systems , and related materials . gao recommends that state and dod provide all required expenditure information in psi annual reports and develop a framework for measuring psis results . dod partially concurred with both recommendations and state partially concurred with the reporting recommendation . state disagreed with the framework recommendation , but noted its support for analysis consistent with it .
in response to the recession of 2007 , congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) . recovery act funds provided states with fiscal relief and helped to maintain state medicaid programs through a temporary increase to the federal share of medicaid funding - the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) - from october 2008 through december 2010. in march 2011 , gao reported that states ' ability to fund medicaid was hampered due to increased medicaid enrollment and declines in states ' revenues that typically occur during a national downturn . the recovery act mandated that gao provide recommendations for modifying the increased fmap formula to make it more responsive to state medicaid program needs during future economic downturns . in this report , gao presents a prototype formula for a temporary increased fmap and evaluates its effects on the allocation of assistance to states . to evaluate the three components of the prototype formula -- starting assistance , targeting assistance , and ending assistance -- gao uses the 2007 recession . gao 's prototype formula offers a timely and targeted option for providing states temporary medicaid assistance during a national economic downturn . once a threshold number of states -- 26 in gao 's prototype formula -- show a sustained decrease in their employment - to - population ( epop ) ratio , temporary increases to states ' fmaps would be triggered automatically . the epop ratio compares the number of employed persons in a state to the working age population aged 16 and older . this assistance would end when fewer than the threshold number of states shows a decline in their epop ratio . because the prototype formula relies on labor market data as an automatic trigger rather than legislative action , assistance would have begun earlier and extended longer than the assistance provided by the recovery act . the prototype formula would have triggered assistance to begin in january 2008 and end in september 2011 , compared with the recovery act which provided an increased fmap from october 2008 through june 2011. once the increased fmap is triggered , targeted state assistance would be calculated based on two components : increases in unemployment , as a proxy for changes in medicaid enrollment ; and reductions in total wages and salaries , as a proxy for changes in states ' revenues . gao 's prototype formula provides a baseline of funding for state medicaid needs during an economic downturn by offering automatic , timely , and targeted assistance to states . such assistance would facilitate state budget planning , provide states with greater fiscal stability , and better align federal assistance with the magnitude of the economic downturn 's effects on individual states . in commenting on a draft of this report , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) agreed with the analysis and goals of the report and emphasized the importance of aligning changes to the fmap formula with individual state circumstances . hhs noted the complexity of the prototype formula and offered several considerations to guide policy choices regarding appropriate thresholds for timing and targeting of increased fmap funds . to ensure that federal funding efficiently and effectively responds to the countercyclical nature of the medicaid program , congress could consider enacting an increased fmap formula that targets variable state medicaid needs and provides automatic , timely , and temporary assistance in response to national economic downturns .
gsa serves as the primary steward of the federal governments civilian real property portfolio of nearly 10,000 assets . since 1972 , gsa has funded its real property acquisition , operation , maintenance , and disposal through the rent it collects from tenant agencies that is deposited into the fbf . gao has previously reported , however , that the fbf has faced difficulty providing sufficient resources to support gsas mission . gao was asked to examine the factors affecting the resources in the fbf , gsas potential repair liability and the implications for the fbf , and the information gsa considers when evaluating capital investments and how these practices compare to leading practices for prioritizing capital investments . gao reviewed legislation and gsa documents and compared leading practices on making capital investment decisions from omb and gao capital planning guidance to gsa practices . gao also analyzed budget and financial data from fiscal years 2006 through 2012 , facility condition data from fiscal year 2011 , and interviewed gsa officials and omb staff . the federal buildings funds ( fbf ) balance has increased from $ 56 million in fiscal year 2007 to $ 2.2 billion in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the growing difference between the resources provided to the fbf and the general services administrations ( gsa ) use of these funds as determined through the budgeting and appropriations process . in the last 2 years , congress has provided fewer resources than requested by the executive branch and generated by the fbf . office of management and budget ( omb ) staff and gsa officials stated that if gsa were able to spend all of the funds collected by the fbf each year , these funds would generally be sufficient to fund gsas needs . however , gsa , through the annual presidents budget request , has sought less obligational authority than the balance available in the fund . while the fbfs balance has increased , various factors have limited the funds income . funds from operationsrevenue less costs excluding depreciationthat contribute to fbf income have declined from 2006 to 2011 when adjusted for inflation . revenues have declined while costs have outstripped inflation over this time period . in addition , portions of gsas inventory operate at a loss . for example , about 30 percent of gsas owned assets lost money in 2011 , while gsas total leased portfolio lost about $ 75 million . despite the losses in its leased portfolio , gsa continues to rely extensively on leasing . gsa is taking steps to reduce the size of its overall real estate portfolio . gsa has identified $ 4.6 billion in maintenance and repairs expected from 2012 to 2021 and anticipates that nearly a quarter of this amount is needed immediately . however , funding for maintenance and repairs has declined since 2006. gsa officials noted that reduced funding for capital reinvestments could result in deferred maintenance and repairs , and increase the cost and extent of such work in the future . these concerns are consistent with the national research councils findings that each $ 1 in deferred maintenance and repair work results in a long - term capital liability of $ 4 to $ 5 . gsas use of information to make capital investment decisions conforms to some leading practices from gao and omb guidance , but gsa lacks a transparent process for prioritizing projects and a comprehensive long - term capital plan that fully aligns with leading practices . gsa keeps a baseline of information on its assets and needsas leading practices suggestthrough various tools and databases . gsas process and guidance for evaluating capital investment alternatives substantially meet leading practices as its project planning process explores alternatives to meeting investment needs . gsas process for prioritizing capital investments partially meets leading practices , but its project prioritization transparency could be improved by laying out in its annual budget submission how it uses its criteria to determine which projects get selected for funding over others . in addition , an improved comprehensive long - term capital plan could further gsas ability to make informed choices about long - term investment decisions . both omb and gao guidance emphasize the importance of developing a long - term capital plan to guide the implementation of organizational goals . having such a plan would enable gsa and congress to better evaluate a range of priorities over the next 5 years . in short , more transparency through a comprehensive long - term capital plan would allow for more informed decision making by gsa and congress among competing priorities . gao recommends that gsa document in its budget submission how it prioritizes capital investments and develop and annually submit a 5-year long - term capital plan to omb and congress . gsa agreed with our recommendations . technical comments from gsa and omb were incorporated as appropriate .
in the wake of increased product recalls in 2007-2008 , congress passed the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 ( cpsia ) . among other things , cpsia requires the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) to establish a database on the safety of consumer products that is publicly available , searchable , and accessible through the cpsc web site . in response , cpsc launched saferproducts.gov in march 2011. the department of defense and full year continuing appropriations act of 2011 requires gao to report on the data collected by cpsc in its safety information database . this report examines the information required for submitting a report of harm to saferproducts.gov , the information used to identify the product and to allow cpsc to review manufacturer claims of material inaccuracy in a report of harm , and the length of time cpsc takes to review a manufacturer 's claim that a report contains materially inaccurate information . to do this work , gao analyzed agency data , regulations , and cpsc program documentation and interviewed cpsc staff and various industry and consumer representatives . to be eligible for publication on saferproducts.gov , reports of harm involving a consumer product must contain several types of information , such as descriptions of the product and the associated harm . reports may be submitted by consumers , government agencies , and health care professionals , among others . gao 's analysis of cpsc data as of july 7 , 2011 , showed that 38 percent of the 5,464 reports submitted to cpsc contained information that cpsia requires for publication . of these reports , 1,847 were published on saferproducts.gov . although not required , many submitters appear to have firsthand knowledge of the product -- 37 percent of published reports stated that the submitter was also the victim , and 24 percent stated that the victim was the child , spouse , parent , or other relative of the submitter . also , most submitters provided their optional consent for cpsc to release their contact information to the manufacturer . numeric information , such as a model number or serial number , can be helpful in identifying potentially unsafe products . however , this information is optional rather than required in a report of harm . instead , submitters must only include a word or phrase sufficient to distinguish the product as one within cpsc 's jurisdiction . all manufacturers we spoke with considered the required information insufficient for identifying products in a report of harm . on august 12 , 2011 , a new law was signed containing a requirement for cpsc to attempt to obtain the model number or serial number , or a photograph of the product , from submitters who did not provide this information in a report of harm . to meet this requirement , cpsc must identify all reports of harm that do not contain either a model number or a serial number . however , cpsc does not currently analyze its data to identify reports of harm that contain this numeric information . instead , its method of analysis combines numeric identifiers -- model numbers or serial numbers -- and less precise text entries , such as product descriptions or names . furthermore , some submitters include model numbers and serial numbers in other database fields that cpsc does not include in its analysis . unless cpsc strengthens its analytic methods to identify model numbers or serial numbers in a report of harm , it will likely not be able to identify all reports that require the agency to contact the submitter for more product information because it does not track all reports of harm missing such information . prior to recent amendments to cpsia , cpsc had 10 business days from its transmission of a report to the manufacturer in which to publish a report of harm ( after the amendments , cpsc has up to 5 additional business days to publish a report when a claim of materially inaccurate information is made or when a report does not contain a model number or serial number ) . most reports to which manufacturers responded that were published met the 10-day time frame . of the 1,085 published reports of harm to which companies responded , 1,020 ( 94 percent ) were published within 10 business days after cpsc notified the company that the report had been submitted . cpsc published 160 reports with claims of materially inaccurate information , and , of these reports , most were resolved and published within 10 business days . cpsc plans to conduct outreach to increase the number of manufacturers registered to receive electronic notifications to yield a more rapid response to its notifications . to effectively implement the recent amendments to cpsia , gao recommends that cpsc strengthen the analytic methods used to identify product information in a report of harm . cpsc agreed with gao 's recommendation . the minority commissioners also raised a number of concerns about the accuracy and usefulness of the new database .
uspss declining revenues have become insufficient to cover its costs . its strategies to address losses include reducing hours of service at many post offices and expanding the use of post office alternatives , including cpus.cpus are independent businesses compensated by usps to sell most of the same products and services as post offices at the same price . although cpus can provide important benefits , the number of cpus has fallen from 5,290 in fiscal year 2002 to 3,619 in fiscal year 2011. as requested , this report discusses : how cpus supplement uspss post office network , uspss revenue from cpus and compensation to them from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , and challenges usps might face if it increases its use of cpus . gao analyzed usps data on cpu locations , revenues , compensation , and hours of operation as well as on post office locations and hours of operation . gao interviewed cpu owners and usps staff in charge of managing cpus . although contract postal units ( cpus ) have declined in number , their nationwide presence in urban and rural areas supplements the u.s. postal service 's ( usps ) network of post offices by providing additional locations and hours of service . more than 60 percent of cpus are in urban areas where they can provide customers nearby alternatives for postal services when they face long lines at local post offices . over one - half of cpus are located less than 2 miles from the nearest post office . urban cpus are , on average , closer to post offices than rural cpus . cpus are also sometimes located in remote or fast - growing areas where post offices are not conveniently located or may not be cost effective . cpus further supplement post offices by providing expanded hours of service . on average , cpus are open 54 hours per week , compared to 41 hours for post offices . in addition , a greater proportion of cpus than post offices are open after 6 p.m. and on sundays . these factors are important as usps considers expanding the use of post office alternatives to cut costs and maintain access to its products and services . total usps revenues from cpus fell from fiscal years 2007 to 2011 , while usps 's compensation to them increased during this period ; nonetheless , cpus generated high revenues relative to usps 's compensation to cpus . declines in mail volumes and the number of cpus drove revenues down 9 percent , from $ 672 million to $ 611 million from fiscal years 2007 to 2011. usps total compensation to cpus increased 6 percent during this period , from $ 76 million to $ 80 million ; however , after increasing from fiscal year 2007 to 2008 , compensation decreased every fiscal year from 2008 to 2011. according to usps officials , the overall increase was because of increased compensation to individual cpus and decreasing numbers of less expensive cpus . in fiscal year 2011 , after compensating cpus , usps retained 87 cents of every dollar of cpu revenue . usps has a target to retain 80 cents for every dollar in revenue for individual cpus . usps did not meet this target at many individual cpus -- especially ones in rural areas . in fact , 49 percent of cpus that usps compensates a fixed amount regardless of their sales in small - town rural areas -- where cpus may serve as the de facto post office -- generated less postal revenue than the cpus received in compensation from usps . cpu revenues and compensation are important factors as usps seeks a more sustainable cost structure . limited interest from potential partners , competing demands on usps staff resources , and changes to usps 's retail network may pose challenges to usps 's use of cpus . usps has no current plans to strategically increase the number of cpus as part of its retail network transformation . however , a number of district usps staff charged with identifying the need for cpus told us they see a larger role for cpus . nevertheless , usps may face limited interest from potential partners as many may not want to operate cpus because of concerns over cpu contract requirements such as space requirements and prohibitions on selling products and services that compete with usps . many usps district retail managers we spoke with in charge of opening cpus said that finding partners to operate cpus could be difficult . furthermore , many of these managers said that they now have fewer staff and less time and , as a result , do not have the resources to manage opening cpus to meet the need they have identified . gao previously recommended that usps develop and implement a plan to modernize its retail network . gao is not making any new recommendations at this time , but believes that it is important for usps to consider the role of cpus as usps works to develop and implement its retail network plan and control costs . in commenting on a draft of this report , usps provided information on its efforts to provide convenient access to its products and services .
congress established the ctaa program in february 2009 through the trade and globalization adjustment assistance act ( tgaaa ) , passed as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act . the ctaa program was designed to supplement other trade adjustment assistance programs by providing assistance through grants to trade - impacted communities to help them become more competitive in the global economy . in 2010 , eda awarded $ 36.8 million in ctaa grants to 36 communities . the administration proposed to discontinue the program , contending that eda could provide similar assistance to communities at a lower cost through its eaa program . congress responded by repealing the ctaa program in 2012. tgaaa mandated that gao review the operation and effectiveness of trade adjustment assistance programs . this is one of several reports responding to that mandate . for this report , gao determined how eda made grant award decisions , what mechanisms eda established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness , and how the ctaa program compared with other eda community grant programs . gao reviewed agency documents , conducted a file review , and interviewed eda officials . the department of commerce 's economic development administration ( eda ) used its standard grant award process to announce , receive , and review applications for the community trade adjustment assistance ( ctaa ) program , with modifications related to program eligibility . to comply with legislative requirements , eda reached out to eligible communities by identifying those with workers or firms already certified as trade impacted by other trade adjustment assistance programs . eda awarded the grants in accordance with the review and selection process outlined in the ctaa federal funding opportunity -- the program 's grant application announcement . more than half of the grants were for construction projects , such as building roads and installing broadband fiber for industrial parks . although eda was able to adapt standard procedures already in place for its other grant programs , eda officials cited some ctaa - specific challenges : first , the effort required to set up the new program for ctaa grants ; second , a relatively limited time for the outreach and application process ; and third , the development of a list of eligible communities for outreach , which proved to be a complex undertaking . eda regional staff said that they monitor the grants using tools such as periodic progress and financial reports . gao 's review of a nonprobability sample of 12 of the 36 ctaa grant files found no gaps in the regional offices ' collection of required reports . many of the projects will not be completed until after 2013 , but grantees with construction projects are required to report on certain eda performance measures 3 , 6 , and 9 years after the award . thus , in 2013 , those grantees will be required to report measures relating to jobs created , jobs retained , and level of new private investment . the grantees will submit final nineyear project reports in 2019 that will help the agency determine whether the projects met their goals . gao 's review of how the ctaa program compared with other eda grant programs shows that although the ctaa grants targeted trade - impacted communities , some grantees might have been eligible for other eda grant programs . eda officials identified two other programs that target economically distressed communities -- eda 's economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) and public works programs -- that may have been able to provide assistance to ctaa communities . gao found that , through ctaa grants , eda assisted some trade - impacted communities that may not have qualified for eda 's other community grant programs due to differences in eligibility and cost - share requirements . however , eda officials provided some specific examples of ctaa grantees that may have qualified for the eaa or public works programs . although officials credited the ctaa program with providing additional funding to assist more communities , some officials suggested that funding for tradeimpacted communities could have been designated within , and similar services could have been delivered through , eda 's existing programs . gao is not making recommendations in this report . commerce concurred with gao 's findings and provided additional information on grantee performance reports and planned improvements to performance measures .
in fiscal year 2012 , the feca program made more than $ 2.1 billion in wageloss compensation payments to claimants . feca provides benefits to federal employees who sustained injuries or illnesses at work . gao was asked to examine whether examples of improper payments , potential fraud , or overlapping benefits could be found in the feca program . this report identifies examples of these issues , what factors may contribute to these issues , and how , if at all , labor could address them . gao matched qw and unemployment files from five selected states with feca payment files for the period of july 2009 to june 2010. gao identified 530 individuals who received concurrent feca compensation payments and wages of at least $ 5,000 between july 2009 and june 2010. gao also identified 50 individuals who received concurrent feca compensation and ui benefits of at least $ 5,000 each during the same period . gao randomly selected up to seven recipients from each state for an in - depth review , for a total of 32 qw and 19 ui cases , respectively . these examples can not be generalized beyond those presented . gao also reviewed labor 's policies , guidelines , and procedures for managing claims . gao found examples of improper payments and indicators of potential fraud in the federal employees ' compensation act ( feca ) program , which could be attributed , in part , to oversight and data - access issues . gao found examples of claimants ' receiving overlapping feca and unemployment insurance ( ui ) benefits , which may be allowable under certain circumstances , but could also be erroneous . gao also found that feca program requirements allow claimants to receive earnings , and earnings increases , without necessarily resulting in adjustment of feca compensation . for example , of the 32 feca case files reviewed , gao found five instances where an individual 's wage - earning capacity ( wec ) , which is used to determine feca benefits , was not adjusted even though the individual earned substantially more than the wage that was originally used to calculate the wec . in addition , two feca claimants continued to receive privateemployment salaries that were not subject to their wec calculation . this is because , as currently written , program procedures allow claimants to receive increases in earnings , in certain circumstances , without adjustments to feca compensation , and current law allows for claimants ' earnings from dissimilar concurrent private employment at the time of injury to be exempt when determining feca compensation . as discussed below , gao identified challenges related to oversight and data access , which could result in improper payments or overlapping benefits . gao found that the department of labor ( labor ) did not conduct a timely review of the medical activity reports of 4 of the 32 feca claimants and did not complete a timely review of the employment activity reports of 2 claimants , which could potentially result in an improper payment or be an indicator of potential fraud in one case where a claimant did not respond to repeated labor requests for the employment activity reports . labor has taken some steps to enhance oversight of the program , such as developing measures to improve the periodic review of claimants ' documentation . gao found that 8 out of 32 claimants underreported employment wages in comparison to the state 's quarterly wage ( qw ) reports . labor does not have authority to directly access social security administration ( ssa ) wage data to verify claimants ' reported income ; consequently , it relies on periodic selfreporting of income . gao has previously identified this as a potential vulnerability that could increase the risk of claimants receiving benefits they are not entitled to . to address this , labor proposed legislation allowing the agency to match ssa wage data with feca files , but the proposal is still pending . gao identified 19 cases where claimants were receiving overlapping ui and feca benefits totaling over $ 1.3 million . four of these 19 claimants received more income from combined ui and feca benefits than they would have received from their federal salary alone . four of the five selected states in our review require the offset of ui benefits against feca compensation payments . because labor does not have a process to share necessary data with states to identify overlapping feca and ui payments , a mechanism to share feca information with the states would help provide reasonable assurance that payments are being made properly . gao recommends that the secretary of labor develop an effective mechanism to share feca compensation information with states to help identify whether claimants are inappropriately receiving overlapping ui and feca payments . in addition , congress should consider granting labor the additional authority it is seeking to access wage data to help verify claimants reported income and help ensure the proper payment of benefits . labor agreed to study the feasibility of sharing compensation information with the states .
this testimony discusses two satellite acquisition programs within the department of commerces national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) . the joint polar satellite system ( jpss ) and the geostationary operational environmental satellite - r ( goes - r ) programs are meant to replace current operational satellites , and both are considered critical to the united states ability to maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting . as requested , this statement summarizes our two reports being released today on the status , plans , and risks for jpss and the status , schedule management process , and risk management process within the goes - r program . we found that the jpss cost and goes - r contractor cost data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes . further , while we found that the goes - r schedule and management reserve data were not sufficiently reliable , we reported on the datas shortcomings in our report .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) pays plans in medicare advantage ( ma ) the private plan alternative to medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) a predetermined amount per beneficiary adjusted for health status . to make this adjustment , cms calculates a risk score , a relative measure of expected health care costs , for each beneficiary . risk scores should be the same among all beneficiaries with the same health conditions and demographic characteristics . policymakers raised concerns that differences in diagnostic coding between ma plans and medicare ffs could lead to inappropriately high ma risk scores and payments to ma plans . cms began adjusting for coding differences in 2010. gao estimated the impact of any coding differences on ma risk scores and payments to plans in 2010 and evaluated cmss methodology for estimating the impact of these differences in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012. to do this , gao compared risk score growth for ma beneficiaries with an estimate of what risk score growth would have been for those beneficiaries if they were in medicare ffs , and evaluated cmss methodology by assessing the data , study populations , study design , and beneficiary characteristics analyzed . gao found that diagnostic coding differences exist between ma plans and medicare ffs . using data on beneficiary characteristics and regression analysis , gao estimated that before cmss adjustment , 2010 ma beneficiary risk scores were at least 4.8 percent , and perhaps as much as 7.1 percent , higher than they likely would have been if the same beneficiaries had been continuously enrolled in ffs . the higher risk scores were equivalent to $ 3.9 billion to $ 5.8 billion in payments to ma plans . both gao and cms found that the impact of coding differences increased over time . this trend suggests that the cumulative impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 could be larger than in 2010. in contrast to gao , cms estimated that 3.4 percent of 2010 ma beneficiary risk scores were attributable to coding differences between ma plans and medicare ffs . cmss adjustment for this difference avoided $ 2.7 billion in excess payments to ma plans . cmss 2010 estimate differs from gaos in that cmss methodology did not include more current data , did not incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences over time , and did not account for beneficiary characteristics other than age and mortality , such as sex , health status , medicaid enrollment status , beneficiary residential location , and whether the original reason for medicare entitlement was disability . cms did not update its coding adjustment estimate in 2011 and 2012 to include more current data , to account for additional years of coding differences , or to incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences . by continuing to implement the same 3.4 percent adjustment for coding differences in 2011 and 2012 , cms likely underestimated the impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 , resulting in excess payments to ma plans . gaos findings underscore the importance of both cms continuing to adjust risk scores to account for coding differences and ensuring that those adjustments are as complete and accurate as possible . in its comments , cms stated that it found our findings informative . cms did not comment on our recommendation . gao recommends that cms should improve the accuracy of its ma risk score adjustments by taking steps such as incorporating adjustments for additional beneficiary characteristics , using the most current data available , accounting for all relevant years of coding differences , and incorporating the effect of coding difference trends .
approximately 2 million of the nations 130 million housing units are manufactured homes ( i.e . , mobile homes ) that were built before 1976. these older manufactured homes are generally considered to have some of the poorest energy efficiency of all housing units . many of the occupants of these homes qualify for federal assistance to help pay their energy bills through the u.s. department of health and human services low income home energy assistance program . a portion of this programs funds can be used to improve the energy efficiency of these homes ; however , program funding may not be used for new construction , or replacing existing homes . some states have conducted pilot programs to replace older manufactured homes with newer , more energy efficient models . gao was asked to identify and review state programs and the extent to which they may be cost - effective based on reduced energy costs . for this report , gaos objectives were to identify states that have funded replacement programs and describe these programs ; identify challenges , if any , these states reported facing in implementing these programs ; and determine the extent to which these programs resulted in energy savings sufficient to offset replacement costs . to address these objectives , gao surveyed all 50 states and the district of columbia , examined data from pilot programs spanning about 2 years , and interviewed officials from three state - based programs . hhs provided technical and clarifying comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . gao identified three statesmaine , montana , and washingtonthat have developed pilot programs focused on replacing older manufactured homes using a combination of state and federal funds . the three programs were relatively small , accounting for about $ 4.5 million in spending and responsible for replacing 81 homes , over about 2 years . the programs differed in requirements , including whether the land that the replacement home would occupy had to be owned or could be leased ; the types of financing used , with some replacements requiring recipients to take on a partial mortgage ; and the types of replacement homes . program officials and representatives of organizations that aided them from the three state replacement pilot programs identified three key types of challenges in implementing these programs . first , they told gao that many potential beneficiaries were not eligible to participate because they had liens on their existing properties , they did not own or have a long - term lease for the land the homes would be placed on , or their credit histories made them ineligible for any type of loan . second , these officials told gao that some potential beneficiaries were unwilling to participate because they were : mistrustful that such a program would be legitimate ; unwilling to take on any debt , regardless of the poor condition of their home ; unwilling to move from their current location ; or unwilling to take on increases in property taxes resulting from increased home value . third , they identified challenges that were primarily logistical in nature , such as the need to construct wheelchair ramps or update utilities , which could raise the cost of replacement . in the three pilot replacement programs gao examined , the energy savings did not fully offset the costs of replacing older manufactured homes over a typical loan period . the two programs that maintained information on energy use and estimated savings spent an average of about $ 56,119 per unit to replace each older manufactured home and estimated about $ 489 in annual energy savings per home . the average cost of replacement homes varied across the three programs gao examined . the least costly program gao examined was montanas , which replaced some older manufactured homes with used , but newer and more energy efficient models , with an average cost of about $ 42,339 per home . however , state officials told gao that these replacement programs were not specifically focused on energy savings and that energy efficiency gains were secondary to the health and welfare benefits of getting occupants into safer , more weather - tight manufactured homes .
this testimony discusses the efforts of the department of homeland securitys ( dhs ) domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) to develop and deploy a global nuclear detection architecture ( gnda ) an integrated system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities to combat nuclear smuggling in foreign countries , at the u.s. border , and inside the united statesand to provide an update on the deployment of radiation detection equipment at u.s. borders . preventing terrorists from using nuclear or radiological material to carry out an attack in the united states is a top national priority . dndo is charged with , among other things , enhancing and coordinating the nuclear detection efforts of federal , state , local , and tribal governments and the private sector to ensure a managed , coordinated response . among other things , dndo is required to coordinate with other federal agencies to develop an enhanced gnda . it is also responsible for developing , acquiring , and deploying radiation detection equipment to support the efforts of dhs and other federal agencies . while federal efforts to combat nuclear smuggling have largely focused on established ports of entry , such as seaports and land border crossings , dndo has also been examining nuclear detection strategies along other potential pathways in the architecture , including land border areas between ports of entry into the united states , international general aviation , and small maritime craft , such as recreational boats and commercial fishing vessels . even before dndos inception in 2005 , we were highlighting the need for a more comprehensive strategy for nuclear detection . in 2002 , we reported on the need for a comprehensive plan for installing radiation detection equipment , such as radiation portal monitors , at all u.s. border crossings and ports of entry . in july 2008 , we testified that dndo had not developed an overarching strategic plan to guide the development of a more comprehensive gnda , and we recommended that dhs coordinate with the departments of defense , energy , and state to develop one . dhs agreed with our recommendation . in january 2009 , we recommended that the secretary of homeland security develop a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear detection strategy to help ensure the success of initiatives aimed at closing vulnerabilities in the united states . we stated that this plan should focus on , among other things , establishing time frames and costs for the areas dndo had identifiedland border areas between ports of entry , aviation , and small maritime craft . dhs did not comment on this recommendation but noted that it aligned with dndos past , present , and future actions . the status of these recommendations is discussed later in this testimony . dhs has made meaningful progress in deploying radiation detection equipment at u.s. border crossings and seaports ; however , as deployed portal monitors begin to reach the end of their expected service lives , dhs will soon need to make decisions about whether to refurbish or replace them . dhs has also made progress in developing key planning documents to guide the gnda . this testimony discusses : dhss efforts to complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the united states at ports of entry , observations from our past work that may help dhs as it considers options for deploying new technologies to refurbish or replace existing portal monitors when they reach the end of their expected service lives , and our assessment of the extent to which dhs has addressed our prior recommendations . this testimony is primarily based on our prior work on federal efforts to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials , issued from october 2002 through july 2011. we have updated our prior work in this testimony to reflect dhss continuing efforts to deploy radiation detection equipment . over the past 10 years , dhs has made significant progress in deploying radiation detection equipment to scan for nuclear or radiological materials in nearly all trucks and containerized cargo coming into the united stated through seaports and border crossings . however , challenges remain for the agency in developing a similar scanning capability for railcars entering this country from canada and mexico , as well as for international air cargo and international commercial aviation . as portal monitors approach the end of their expected service lives , observations from our past work may help dhs as it considers options to refurbish or replace such monitors . among other things , we have previously reported that dhs should test new equipment rigorously prior to acquisition and deployment , obtain the full concurrence of the end user to ensure that new equipment meets operational needs , and conduct a cost - benefit analysis to inform any acquisition decisions . in our past work on the gnda , we recommended that dhs develop an overarching strategic plan to guide the development of the gdna , as well as a strategic plan for the domestic part of the global nuclear detection strategy . dhs took action on these recommendations and , in december 2010 , it issued the interagency gnda strategic plan . we reported , in july 2011 , that the gnda strategic plan addressed several of the aspects of our prior recommendations but did not identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or employ monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify needed improvements . in april 2012 , dhs issued its gnda implementation plan , which addresses the remaining aspects of our recommendations by identifying funding dedicated to plan objectives and employing monitoring mechanisms to assess progress in meeting those objectives . however , in both the gnda strategic plan and the implementation plan , it remains difficult to identify priorities from among various components of the domestic part of the gnda .
ssa administers two of the largest disability programs , with annual benefit payments that have grown fivefold over the last 20 yearsfrom $ 35 billion in 1990 to over $ 164 billion in 2010and the agency receives millions of new applications annually . gao has designated federal disability programs as a high - risk area , in part because eligibility criteria have not been updated to reflect medical and technological advances and labor market changes . given the size and cost of its disability programs , ssa needs updated criteria to appropriately determine who qualifies for benefits . in this statement , gao discusses initial observations from its ongoing review and assessment of ssas efforts to update its medical criteria and develop a new occupational information system . to do this , gao reviewed prior gao and ssa inspector general reports ; relevant federal laws and regulations ; program documentation including policies , procedures , strategic goals , and supporting project plans ; and cost estimates . gao also interviewed ssa officials , project stakeholders , experts , and representatives from other agencies that administer disability programs . this work is ongoing and gao has no recommendations at this time . gao plans to issue its final report later in 2012. the social security administration ( ssa ) has made several changes to improve the process it uses for updating its medical criteria , but continues to face challenges ensuring timely updates . ssas medical criteria for adults are in the form of listings of medical conditions and impairments organized under 14 body systems , which ssa periodically updates . to help ensure timely , periodic updates of a body systems listings , ssa is moving away from comprehensively revising a body systems listings toward a more targeted approach , wherein ssa selects for revision those impairment listings most in need of change . to date , ssa has completed comprehensive revisions of listings for 8 of the 14 body systems and now is in the process of reviewing them to determine whether and which targeted revisions are appropriate . in 2010 , the ssa commissioner set a 5-year cycle time for updating listings for each body system , replacing the agencys prior practice of setting expiration dates for listings that ranged from 3 to 8 years and then frequently extending them . to further increase the timeliness and accuracy of decisions , ssa has sought recommendations from the institute of medicine and has acted on some of them , such as creating a standing committee to provide advice on updating the listings . however , ssa continues to face challenges keeping its listings up to date . for example , ssa is still working on completing comprehensive revisions of listings for six body systems that have been ongoing for 19 to 33 years . ssa staff told us that a lack of staff and expertise , along with the complexity and unpredictability of the regulatory process , have made it challenging to maintain its schedule of periodic updates for all listings . ssa has embarked on an ambitious plan to produce by 2016 an occupational inventory database to support its disability benefit decisions , but it is too soon to determine if ssa will meet key time frames . ssa currently relies on an occupational information source developed by the department of labor that was updated for the last time in 1991 and is viewed by many as outdated . in 2008 , ssa initiated a project to develop its own occupational information system ( ois ) , which ssa expects will provide up - to - date information on the physical and mental demands of work , and in sufficient detail to support its disability benefit decisions . to guide the creation of its ois , ssa established an advisory panel , collaborated with outside experts and other agencies , and in july 2011 issued a research and development plan detailing all relevant activities and goals between 2010 and 2016. as of february 2012 , ssa had completed many initial research efforts , including investigating other types of occupational information systems and identifying job analysis methods . despite preliminary progress , it is too early to determine if ssa will meet its target implementation date . ssa officials told us that due to staffing shortages it did not meet all initial goals on time and may need to adjust its time frames for future activities . while gao is still evaluating ssas schedule and cost estimates against best practices , we have preliminarily identified some potential gaps in ssas approach , such as not reflecting the costs to both implement and maintain a new ois .
the gsa estimated that federal agencies spent about $ 1.6 billion during fiscal year 2009 purchasing office supplies from more than 239,000 vendors . concerned that federal agencies may not be getting the best prices available , congress directed gsa to study office supply purchases by the 10 largest federal agencies . gsa delivered the results of its study in november 2010. the study also discussed gsas efforts to implement an initiative focused on leveraging the governments buying power to realize savings when buying office supplies , known as os ii . congress directed gao to assess the gsa study , with particular attention to the potential for savings . this testimony is based on the findings and conclusions of gaos december 2011 report , g ao - 12-178 , and focuses on the support for the findings and conclusions in gsas study , and how gsa 's new office supply contracts support the goal of leveraging the governments buying power to achieve savings . in 2010 , the general services administrations ( gsa ) pricing study found that during fiscal year 2009 , the 10 largest federal agencies accounted for about $ 1.3 billion , or about 81 percent , of the total $ 1.6 billion spent governmentwide in 14 categories of office supplies . about 58 percent of their office supply purchases were made outside of the gsa schedules programa simplified process to take advantage of price discounts equal to those that vendors offer most favored customers. most of these purchases were made at retail stores . gsa also reported that agencies paid an average of 75 percent more ( a price premium ) than schedule prices for their retail purchases and 86 percent more compared to office supplies ii ( os ii ) prices . while the gsa acknowledged some limitations with the study data , we identified additional data and other limitations that lead us to question the magnitude of some of gsas reported price premiums and assertions . more specifically , we determined that the study may not have properly controlled for quantities , used two different formulas to calculate price premium estimates , and relied on interviews with senior level acquisition officials instead of purchasers to determine whether buyers compared prices before making purchases . we were not able to fully quantify the impact of these limitations . additionally , other agencies questioned the studys specific findings related to price premiums , but their own studies of price premiums support gsas conclusion that better prices can be obtained through consolidated , leveraged purchasing . available data show that the os ii initiative has produced savings of $ 39.2 million from june 2010 through march 2012. according to gsa , the os ii initiative is demonstrating that leveraged buying can produce greater savings and has provided improvements for managing ongoing and future strategic sourcing initiatives . for example , gsa reports that os ii allowed it to negotiate discounts with vendors who were selected for the initiative . as governmentwide sales surpass certain targets , additional discounts are applied to purchase prices . further , os ii has spurred competition among schedule vendors that were not selected for os ii , resulting in decreased schedule prices . the initiative is also expected to lower governmentwide supply costs through more centralized contract management . another key aspect of the initiative is that participating vendors provide sales and other information to gsa to help monitor prices , savings , and vendor performance . finally , gsa is capturing lessons learned from os ii and is attempting to incorporate these lessons into other strategic sourcing initiatives . gao did not make any recommendations in its report , and is not making any in this testimony .
this testimony discusses the use of test facilities as a means of leveraging public , private , and academic resources to deliver technologies for the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) . nextgen will affect nearly every aspect of air transportation and will transform the way in which the air transportation system operates today . it is a complex undertaking that requires new technologies -- including new integrated ground and aircraft systems -- as well as new procedures , processes , and supporting infrastructure . the result will be an air transportation system that relies on satellite - based surveillance and navigation , data communications , and improved collaborative decision making . transforming the nation 's air transportation system affects and involves the activities and missions of several federal agencies , though the federal aviation administration ( faa ) is the lead implementer . in addition , nextgen was designed and planned to be developed in collaboration with aviation stakeholders -- airlines and other airspace users , air traffic controllers , and avionics , aircraft , and automation systems manufacturers -- in order to facilitate coordinated research activities , transfer technologies from faa and partner agencies to the private sector , and take advantage of research and technology developed by the private sector that could meet nextgen needs , as appropriate . three nextgen test facilities , collectively referred to as the nextgen test bed , are designed to foster the research and development of nextgen - related technologies and to evaluate integrated technologies and procedures for nationwide nextgen deployment . these test facilities provide access to the systems currently used in the national air space ( nas ) and house various types of hardware , simulators , and other equipment to allow for demonstrations of new technologies . they also provide opportunities for stakeholders -- public and private -- to collaborate with faa , academia , and each other . this statement today discusses the role of the nextgen test facilities in the development of nextgen technologies and how private industry and partner agencies participate in projects at the nextgen test facilities , and our previous findings on nextgen technology transfer and faa 's efforts to improve the transfer and implementation of nextgen - related technologies . this statement is based on our prior nextgen - related reports and testimonies , updated with information we gathered from faa and test facility officials in october 2011. the gao reports cited in this statement contain more detailed explanations of the methods used to conduct our work , which we performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards . the role of the nextgen test bed is to demonstrate the benefits of nextgen initiatives and to do so early in the technology development process . while sharing a common purpose , each of the three facilities that collectively make up the nextgen test bed offers different testing capabilities and brings together different participants from different communities . across the test facilities private and public sector stakeholders contribute personnel , equipment , and funding to develop and integrate technologies . linking the test facilities to leverage the benefits of each is part of the nextgen test bed concept and officials from the test facilities indicated they have made some progress in doing so . in prior work on technology transfer activities , we found that the success of test facilities as a means to leverage private sector resources depends in large part on the extent to which the private sector perceives benefits to its participation . similarly , collaboration among the nextgen partner agencies depends in part on their seeing outcomes that further their mission and on identifying a common purpose . faa has taken a number of actions to improve its ability to implement new technologies and increase partner agencies ' and private sector participants ' involvement in seeing the development of selected technologies through to successful implementation -- including restructuring the organization responsible for implementing nextgen and linking the test facilities and improving their capabilities .
dod reports that more than 83,000 persons are missing from past conflicts in vietnam , korea , the cold war , the persian gulf , and world war ii . several dod organizations , known as the accounting community , have a role in accounting for the missing . between 2002 and 2012 , dod accounted for an average of 72 persons each year . in 2009 , congress mandated dod to increase its capability and capacity such that the community could account for at least 200 missing persons annually by 2015. the law also added all world war ii losses to the list of conflicts for which dod was responsible , thus increasing from about 10,000 to 83,000 the number of missing persons for whom dod must account . a committee report accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 mandated gao to review dod 's efforts to address the accounting - for goal . gao assessed dod 's capability and capacity to accomplish the missing persons accounting mission . in doing so , gao analyzed guidance and requirements , discussed accounting efforts and the structure of the community with community members , and surveyed accounting community members and related entities . while the department of defense ( dod ) has made some progress in promoting communication among the several organizations responsible for accounting for missing persons -- known collectively as the accounting community -- dod 's capability and capacity to accomplish its missing persons accounting mission is being undermined by longstanding leadership weaknesses and a fragmented organizational structure . leadership from the under secretary of defense for policy ( usd policy ) and u.s. pacific command ( pacom ) have not been able to resolve disagreements among accounting community members , thereby impacting dod 's ability to meet the mandated goal of increasing its capability and capacity to account for 200 missing persons a year by 2015. dod averaged 72 identifications annually in the decade ending in 2012. gao found the following areas of progress and continuing areas of weakness : in response to a 2009 direction from the deputy secretary of defense , the accounting community has begun drafting a community - wide plan to meet the accounting - for goal , but as of july 2013 this plan had not been completed due to a fragmented approach to planning and disputes among community members . without a community - wide plan , members have had varied success in obtaining resources to meet the goal . dod is working to clarify its guidance , but roles and responsibilities for community members are not well defined , and this lack of clarity has led to overlap in key aspects of the mission such as investigations . dod does not have agreements with all combatant commands to conduct operations to find missing persons outside of pacom 's area of responsibility . jpac negotiated an updated agreement with european command , signed in april 2013 , but it has not negotiated similar agreements with any of the other four geographic combatant commands . while dod has established criteria to prioritize recovery efforts for missing persons from the vietnam war , it has not established criteria to prioritize potentially recoverable missing persons from other conflicts . dod has not established mechanisms to sustain recent improvements in communication among community members . statute and dod guidance assign responsibility for the accounting mission to many organizations and each reports through a different line of authority . thus , no single entity is responsible for communitywide personnel and resources . this fragmented organizational structure has exacerbated weaknesses in leadership , and most community organizations gao spoke to believe alternative structures would be more effective . a majority of community members gao surveyed conveyed a lack of confidence about the organizational structure . for example , 12 out of 13 survey respondents ranked an option with a more centralized chain of command as the most effective in enabling the accounting community to achieve its mission . until top - level leaders at usd policy and pacom can ensure that all mission activities are carried out with unity of effort , inefficient and potentially avoidable overlap , unexpected operational concerns , and disagreements among members could continue to hinder the mission . gao is making nine recommendations to dod , including for example : examining options to reorganize ; clarifying responsibilities for the accounting community ; improving planning , guidance , and criteria to prioritize cases ; and sustaining communication . dod generally concurred with these recommendations .
the forest service manages more than 158,000 miles of recreational trails offering hikers , horseback riders , cyclists , off - highway - vehicle drivers , and others access to national forests . to remain safe and usable , these trails need regular maintenance , such as removal of downed trees or bridge repairs . gao was asked to review the agency 's trail maintenance activities . this report examines the extent to which the forest service is meeting trail maintenance needs , and effects associated with any maintenance not done ; resources , including funding and labor , that the agency employs to maintain its trails ; factors , if any , complicating agency efforts to maintain its trails ; and options , if any , that could improve the agency 's trail maintenance efforts . gao reviewed laws and agency documents ; analyzed forest service budget data for fiscal years 2006-2012 and trails data for fiscal years 2008-2012 ; and interviewed agency officials and representatives of 16 stakeholder groups selected to represent trail users , conservation , and industry . their views are not generalizable . the forest service has more miles of trail than it has been able to maintain , resulting in a persistent maintenance backlog with a range of negative effects . in fiscal year 2012 , the agency reported that it accomplished at least some maintenance on about 37 percent of its 158,000 trail miles and that about one - quarter of its trail miles met the agency 's standards . the forest service estimated the value of its trail maintenance backlog to be $ 314 million in fiscal year 2012 , with an additional $ 210 million for annual maintenance , capital improvement , and operations . trails not maintained to quality standards have a range of negative effects , such as inhibiting trail use and harming natural resources , and deferring maintenance can add to maintenance costs . the forest service relies on a combination of internal and external resources to help maintain its trail system . internal resources include about $ 80 million allocated annually for trail maintenance activities plus funding for other agency programs that involve trails . external resources include volunteer labor , which the forest service valued at $ 26 million in fiscal year 2012 , and funding from federal programs , states , and other sources . collectively , agency officials and stakeholders gao spoke with identified a number of factors complicating the forest service 's trail maintenance efforts , including factors associated with the origin and location of trails , some agency policies and procedures , and factors associated with the management of volunteers and other external resources . for example , many trails were created for purposes other than recreation , such as access for timber harvesting or firefighting , and some were built on steep slopes , leaving unsustainable , erosion - prone trails that require continual maintenance . in addition , certain agency policies and procedures complicate trail maintenance efforts , such as the agency 's lack of standardized training in trails field skills , which limits agency expertise . further , while volunteers are important to the agency 's trail maintenance efforts , managing volunteers can decrease the time officials can spend performing on - the - ground maintenance . agency officials and stakeholders gao interviewed collectively identified numerous options to improve forest service trail maintenance , including assessing the sustainability of the trail system , improving agency policies and procedures , and improving management of volunteers and other external resources . in a 2010 document titled a framework for sustainable recreation , the forest service noted the importance of analyzing recreation program needs and available resources and assessing potential ways to narrow the gap between them , which the agency has not yet done for its trails . many officials and stakeholders suggested that the agency systematically assess its trail system to identify ways to reduce the gap and improve trail system sustainability . they also identified other options for improving management of volunteers . for example , while the agency 's goal in the forest service manual is to use volunteers , the agency has not established collaboration with and management of volunteers who help maintain trails as clear expectations for trails staff responsible for working with volunteers , and training in this area is limited . some agency officials and stakeholders stated that training on how to collaborate with and manage volunteers would enhance the agency 's ability to capitalize on this resource . gao recommends , among otheractions , that the forest service analyze trails program needs and available resources and develop options for narrowing the gap between them and take steps to assess and improve the sustainability of its trails and take steps to enhance training on collaborating with and managing volunteers who help maintain trails . in commenting on a draft of this report , the forest service generally agreed with gao 's findings and recommendations .
the coast guard is managing a multi - billion dollar effort to modernize aging assets , including ships , aircraft , and information technology to provide new capabilities to conduct missions ranging from marine safety to defense readiness . gao has reviewed the coast guard 's acquisitions since 2001 and has found it faces challenges managing its portfolio . in 2007 , the coast guard established a cost baseline of $ 24.2 billion for 13 assets . gao was asked to examine the coast guard 's current and planned acquisition portfolio . this report assesses : operational performance and testing of selected assets ; the current cost of the coast guard 's portfolio and funding plans ; and the extent to which the coast guard is experiencing capability gaps , if any , given known affordability issues . to conduct this work , gao analyzed the operational performance and test reports for all 4 newly fielded assets that the coast guard planned to test and the costs and capabilities of its major system acquisition portfolio . gao also interviewed coast guard , dhs , and navy officials . the selected coast guard assets that gao reviewed are generally demonstrating improved performance — according to coast guard operators — but gao found that they have yet to meet all key requirements . specifically , two assets , the hc - 144 patrol aircraft and fast response cutter , did not meet all key requirements during operational testing before being approved for full - rate production , and department of homeland security ( dhs ) and coast guard guidance do not clearly specify when this level of performance should be achieved . additionally , the coast guard changed its testing strategy for the command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) system and , as a result , is no longer planning to test the system 's key requirements . completing operational testing for the c4isr system would provide the coast guard with the knowledge of whether this asset meets requirements . as acquisition program costs increase across the portfolio , consuming significant amounts of funding , the coast guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009 , in terms of the money needed to finish these programs . in 2009 , gao found that the coast guard needed $ 18.2 billion to finish its 2007 baseline , but now needs $ 20.7 billion to finish these assets . to inform congress of its budget plans , the coast guard uses a statutorily required 5-year capital investment plan , but the law does not require the coast guard to report the effects of actual funding levels on individual projects and , thus , it has not done so . for example , the coast guard has received less funding than planned in its annual budgets , but has not reflected the effects of this reduced funding in terms of increased cost or schedule for certain projects . without complete information , congress can not know the full cost of the portfolio . the coast guard has repeatedly delayed and reduced its capability through its annual budget process and , therefore , it does not know the extent to which it will meet mission needs and achieve desired results . this is because the coast guard does not have a long - term fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources . without such a plan , the coast guard can not know the extent to which its assets are affordable and whether it can maintain service levels and meet mission needs . congress should consider requiring the coast guard to include additional information in its capital investment plan . in addition , the secretary of dhs should clarify when minimum performance standards should be achieved , conduct c4isr testing , and develop a long - term modernization plan . dhs concurred with the recommendations , but its position on developing a long - term plan does not fully address gao 's concerns as discussed in the report .
the federal inmate population has increased over the last two decades , and as of july 2014 , bop was responsible for the custody and care of more than 216,000 inmates . to handle the projected growth of between 2,500 and 3,000 or more inmates per year from 2015 through 2020 , bop has spent about $ 1.3 billion constructing five new institutions and acquiring one in thomson , illinois . bop is activating these institutions by staffing and equipping them and populating them with inmates . gao was requested to review bop 's activation process of newly constructed and acquired institutions . gao reviewed , among other things , the extent to which bop is activating institutions within estimated timeframes and has an activation policy or schedules that meet best practices , and why doj purchased thomson and how the purchase affected system wide costs . gao reviewed bop budget documents from fiscal years 2008 to 2015 and assessed schedules against gao 's schedule assessment guide . gao conducted site visits to the six institutions , interviewed bop officials , and reviewed staffing data from fiscal years 2010 through 2013. the department of justice 's ( doj ) federal bureau of prisons ( bop ) is behind schedule activating all six new institutions — the process by which it prepares them for inmates — and does not have a policy to guide activation or an activation schedule that reflects best practices . bop is behind schedule , in part , because of challenges , such as staffing , posed by the locations of the activating institutions . according to bop officials , delays in receiving congressionally directed activation funding can exacerbate these challenges ( see fig . ) . none of the six institutions is fully activated , or at rated capacity , as they do not house the number of inmates they are designed to safely and securely house . bop does not effectively communicate to congress how the locations of new institutions may affect activation schedules . bop officials said that when directed by congress to investigate a location , they consider this as direction to focus on construction at that site . doj and bop could more effectively manage activation timelines and costs by using the bop annual budget justification to communicate to congress the factors associated with certain locations that can delay activations , such as challenges hiring staff and placing inmates in institutions . also , bop officials said they review staffing data system - wide , but they have not prioritized an analysis of such data at the institution level . analyzing staffing data on institutions in the activation process could help bop assess its progress in staffing and tailoring effective mitigating strategies . finally , bop lacks a comprehensive activation policy to guide activations , as well as an activation schedule that reflects best practices , and it has largely relied on staff 's past experience to complete ongoing activations . developing and implementing a comprehensive policy and a schedule that reflects best practices , could better position bop to meet its estimated timeframes and activation costs . doj purchased thomson to help reduce crowding among inmates requiring high levels of security . once it is fully populated , it will reduce bop - wide crowding by 16 percent at the high - security level . thomson will cost about $ 160 million annually to operate once fully activated , adding to bop 's system - wide costs . bop officials said thomson will provide benefits , such as high - security bed space , which outweigh the costs associated with the institution . gao recommends that doj use its annual budget justification to communicate to congress factors that might delay prison activation , and that bop analyze institution - level staffing data and develop and implement a comprehensive activation policy and a schedule that reflects best practices . doj concurred with all of gao 's recommendations .
dhs plays a vital role in securing the nation , and its intelligence analysis capabilities are a key part of this effort . within dhs , i & a has a lead role for intelligence analysis , but other operational components also perform their own analysis activities . gao was asked to review the management of departmental analysis efforts . this report addresses the extent to which dhs intelligence analysis activities are integrated to support departmental intelligence priorities , i & a customers find analytic products and services useful , and i & a has addressed challenges in maintaining a skilled analytic workforce . gao examined mechanisms dhs used to coordinate analysis across components , i & a reports and feedback surveys , and human capital plans . gao also interviewed officials from i & a , the five dhs components with intelligence analysis as a core function , the office of the director of national intelligence who represent the intelligence community , 7 of 78 fusion centers ( focal points within states that analyze and share information ) , and the private sector . the fusion center and sector interviews , chosen based on geographic location and other factors , are not generalizable , but provided insight on progress . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established mechanisms — including an intelligence framework and an analytic planning process — to better integrate analysis activities throughout the department , but the mechanisms are not functioning as intended . for example , the framework does not establish strategic departmental intelligence priorities that can be used to inform annual planning decisions , such as what analytic activities to pursue and the level of investment to make , as called for in dhs guidance . according to officials from dhs 's office of intelligence and analysis ( i & a ) , it can be challenging for dhs components to focus on developing both strategic priorities and more tactical priorities that support their specific operations . absent strategic priorities , dhs used component subject matter experts and other information to develop key questions of common interest they would address through analysis . as a result , dhs does not have reasonable assurance that component analytic activities and resource investments are aligned to support departmental priorities . the mechanisms to integrate analysis , however , gave components insight into one another 's work and helped them avoid unnecessary overlap and duplication . i & a customers had mixed views on the extent to which its analytic products and services are useful . gao 's interviews with representatives of i & a 's five customer groups indicate that two groups — dhs leadership and state , local , tribal , and territorial partners — found products to be useful , while three groups — dhs components , the intelligence community , and the private sector — generally did not . representatives of four of the five groups said that they found other types of services , such as briefings , to be useful . results from surveys that are attached to i & a products indicate that most customers were very satisfied with the products ' usefulness , but the results are not generalizable because they reflect only the views of customers who chose to respond . to address this issue , i & a is conducting more comprehensive surveys and interviews with customers to evaluate the products and services that best meet their needs . i & a expects to complete this effort by the end of june 2014. i & a has taken steps to address challenges it faced in maintaining a skilled workforce , but has not assessed whether its efforts are resolving the challenges . for example : i & a faced challenges in recruiting and hiring analysts , in part because of its hiring authority , which put it at a disadvantage compared with other agencies that were able to process hiring actions more quickly . i & a 's hiring authority was changed in 2013 , a fact that could help ease these challenges . i & a experienced low morale and high rates of attrition , particularly among its lower - level analysts . to help address these issues , i & a restructured its grade levels in 2012 to provide additional career advancement opportunities . however , i & a has not established mechanisms to evaluate its efforts and use the results to make any needed changes because i & a leadership has focused on other priorities . such mechanisms will help i & a evaluate if efforts are achieving their intended results of improving recruiting and hiring , bolstering morale , and reducing attrition . in addition , using the evaluation results to determine any needed changes will help ensure that i & a is making sound workforce decisions . gao recommends , among other things , that dhs establish strategic intelligence priorities and use them to inform analytic activities and establish mechanisms to evaluate workforce initiatives and use results to determine any needed changes . dhs concurred with our recommendations .
the internet offers consumers a convenient method for purchasing drugs that is sometimes cheaper than buying from traditional brick - and - mortar pharmacies . according to a recent fda survey , nearly 1 in 4 adult u.s. internet consumers have purchased prescription drugs online . however , many internet pharmacies are fraudulent enterprises that offer prescription drugs without a prescription and are not appropriately licensed . these rogue internet pharmacies may sell drugs that are expired , improperly labeled , or are counterfeits of other drugs . a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for administering and enforcing laws related to internet pharmacies , including state boards of pharmacy , fda , doj , cbp , and ice . the food and drug administration safety and innovation act directed gao to report on problems with internet pharmacies . this report identifies how rogue sites violate federal and state laws , challenges federal agencies face in investigating and prosecuting operators , efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and efforts to educate consumers about the risks of purchasing prescription drugs online . to conduct this work , gao interviewed officials from fda , doj , cbp , ice , and other federal agencies , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency data and documents . gao also interviewed officials from five state boards of pharmacy with varied approaches to regulating internet pharmacies , and stakeholders including nabp , drug manufacturers , and companies that provide services to internet businesses , such as payment processors . rogue internet pharmacies violate a variety of federal and state laws . most operate from abroad , and many illegally ship prescription drugs into the united states that have not been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , that is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs . many also illegally sell prescription drugs without a prescription that meets federal and state requirements . rogue sites also often violate other laws , including those related to fraud , money laundering , and intellectual property rights . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting those involved . according to federal agency officials , piecing together rogue internet pharmacy operations can be difficult because they may be composed of thousands of related websites , and operators take steps to disguise their identities . officials also face challenges investigating and prosecuting operators because they are often located abroad . the department of justice ( doj ) may not prosecute such cases due to competing priorities , the complexity of these operations , and challenges related to bringing charges under some federal laws . despite these challenges , federal and state agencies as well as stakeholders have taken actions to combat rogue internet pharmacies . federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions , fines , and asset seizures from rogue internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them . fda and other federal agencies have also collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to disrupt rogue internet pharmacy operations . the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , which are responsible for enforcing laws related to the importation of goods such as prescription drugs , have also worked with other agencies , including fda , to interdict rogue internet pharmacy shipments at the border . given that most rogue internet pharmacies operate from abroad , states have faced challenges combating them , and generally focus their oversight on licensed in - state entities that fulfill orders for rogue internet pharmacies . companies that provide services to internet - based businesses , such as search engines and payment processors , have also taken action -- primarily by blocking services to them . fda and others have taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of buying prescription drugs from rogue internet pharmacies . fda recently launched a national campaign to raise public awareness about the risks of purchasing drugs online , and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) posts information on its website about how to safely purchase drugs online . however , rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated marketing methods to appear legitimate , making it hard for consumers to differentiate between legitimate and rogue sites . hhs , doj , and dhs provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
virtual currencies — digital representations of value that are not government - issued — have grown in popularity in recent years . some virtual currencies can be used to buy real goods and services and exchanged for dollars or other currencies . one example of these is bitcoin , which was developed in 2009. bitcoin and similar virtual currency systems operate over the internet and use computer protocols and encryption to conduct and verify transactions . while these virtual currency systems offer some benefits , they also pose risks . for example , they have been associated with illicit activity and security breaches , raising possible regulatory , law enforcement , and consumer protection issues . gao was asked to examine federal policy and interagency collaboration issues concerning virtual currencies . this report discusses federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agency responsibilities related to the use of virtual currencies and associated challenges and actions and collaborative efforts the agencies have undertaken regarding virtual currencies . to address these objectives , gao reviewed federal laws and regulations , academic and industry research , and agency documents ; and interviewed federal agency officials , researchers , and industry groups . virtual currencies are financial innovations that pose emerging challenges to federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies in carrying out their responsibilities , as the following examples illustrate : virtual currency systems may provide greater anonymity than traditional payment systems and sometimes lack a central intermediary to maintain transaction information . as a result , financial regulators and law enforcement agencies may find it difficult to detect money laundering and other crimes involving virtual currencies . many virtual currency systems can be accessed globally to make payments and transfer funds across borders . consequently , law enforcement agencies investigating and prosecuting crimes that involve virtual currencies may have to rely upon cooperation from international partners who may operate under different regulatory and legal regimes . the emergence of virtual currencies has raised a number of consumer and investor protection issues . these include the reported loss of consumer funds maintained by bitcoin exchanges , volatility in bitcoin prices , and the development of virtual - currency - based investment products . for example , in february 2014 , a tokyo - based bitcoin exchange called mt . gox filed for bankruptcy after reporting that it had lost more than $ 460 million . federal financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies have taken a number of actions regarding virtual currencies . in march 2013 , the department of the treasury 's financial crimes enforcement network ( fincen ) issued guidance that clarified which participants in virtual currency systems are subject to anti - money - laundering requirements and required virtual currency exchanges to register with fincen . additionally , financial regulators have taken some actions regarding anti - money - laundering compliance and investor protection . for example , in july 2013 , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) charged an individual and his company with defrauding investors through a bitcoin - based investment scheme . further , law enforcement agencies have taken actions against parties alleged to have used virtual currencies to facilitate money laundering or other crimes . for example , in october 2013 , multiple agencies worked together to shut down silk road , an online marketplace where users paid for illegal goods and services with bitcoins . federal agencies also have begun to collaborate on virtual currency issues through informal discussions and interagency working groups primarily concerned with money laundering and other law enforcement matters . however , these working groups have not focused on emerging consumer protection issues , and the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) — whose responsibilities include providing consumers with information to make responsible decisions about financial transactions — has generally not participated in these groups . therefore , interagency efforts related to virtual currencies may not be consistent with key practices that can benefit interagency collaboration , such as including all relevant participants to ensure they contribute to the outcomes of the effort . as a result , future interagency efforts may not be in a position to address consumer risks associated with virtual currencies in the most timely and effective manner . gao recommends that cfpb take steps to identify and participate in pertinent interagency working groups addressing virtual currencies , in coordination with other participating agencies . cfpb concurred with this recommendation .
through title ii of the food for peace act , the united states provides u.s. agricultural commodities to meet emergency food needs in foreign countries . in fiscal years 2007 to 2012 , usaid delivered $ 9.2 billion in emergency food aid to recipient countries through cooperating sponsors . in 2000 , congress authorized usaid to order , transport , and store food for prepositioning in both overseas and domestic locations . through prepositioning , the agency orders food before it is requested and stores it in warehouses in or near regions with historically high needs . gao was asked to examine u.s. international food aid procurement . this report examines the effects of prepositioning on emergency food aid delivery time frames , the effects of prepositioning on the costs of the food aid , and the extent to which the agency monitors prepositioning to maximize time savings and cost effectiveness . gao analyzed data on delivery time frames and costs ; reviewed agency documents ; and interviewed agency officials and representatives from wfp , other cooperating sponsors , and ocean freight contractors . the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) reduces the average delivery time frame for emergency food aid by prepositioning food domestically — that is , in warehouses in the united states — and overseas . gao estimates that compared with usaid 's standard shipping process , which can take several months , prepositioning food aid shortened delivery time frames by an average of almost a month for shipments to the world food program ( wfp ) . gao also estimates that prepositioning shortened delivery time frames by an average of more than 2 months for other organizations — “ cooperating sponsors ” — that receive usaid grants . in addition , usaid reduces delivery time frames when it diverts shipments en route to overseas prepositioning warehouses to areas with immediate needs . for all cooperating sponsors , gao estimates that diversions saved , on average , about 2 months . prepositioning food can increase the cost of emergency food aid because of additional warehouse , shipping , and commodity costs . for example , in fiscal year 2012 , usaid paid approximately $ 8 million for its overseas and domestic prepositioning warehouses . usaid also paid $ 13 million to ship food by ocean freight from overseas prepositioning warehouses to recipient countries , in addition to the cost of shipping from the united states to the warehouses . further , usaid generally paid higher weighted annual average prices for domestically prepositioned commodities than for standard shipment commodities . u.s. officials and vendors noted that factors such as limited commodity supplies and few participating suppliers may have contributed to higher prices . usaid has taken some steps to evaluate prepositioning , but the agency does not collect and analyze data needed to systematically monitor delivery time frames for prepositioned commodities . in addition , some available data are unreliable . further , usaid does not systematically monitor the total cost of prepositioning . according to usaid policy and federal internal control standards , the agency should monitor its programs by collecting and analyzing data to guide higher - level decision making and allocate resources . without such monitoring , usaid is limited in its ability to assess prepositioning 's impact on delivery time frames and costs and to maximize emergency food aid 's timeliness and cost effectiveness . gao recommends that usaid systematically collect , and ensure the reliability of , data for prepositioned food aid and systematically monitor and assess the effectiveness of food aid 's delivery time frames and costs . usaid concurred with the recommendations and is working to improve both the collection of reliable data and its monitoring of prepositioning .
a longstanding challenge for federal agencies has been developing credible and effective performance management systems that can serve as a strategic tool to drive internal change and achieve results . in 2011 , various federal agencies , labor unions , and other organizations developed the goals - engagement - accountability - results ( gear ) framework to help improve performance management . gao was asked to evaluate gear . this report analyzes how the gear framework addresses key practices for effective performance management and identifies opportunities to improve gear implementation government - wide ; describes the status of gear implementation at pilot agencies and lessons learned to date ; and assesses the extent to which each pilot agency 's gear implementation plan includes selected best practices for project planning . the report is based on gao 's analysis of gear documents , agency project plans , and interviews with agency officials . gao found that the gear framework generally addresses previously identified key practices for effective performance management , such as aligning individual performance expectations with organizational goals , but refinements could improve future government - wide implementation . five federal agencies are piloting gear -- the departments of energy ( doe ) , homeland security / coast guard ( dhs / coast guard ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , veterans affairs / national cemetery administration ( va / nca ) , and the office of personnel management ( opm ) -- with the intention to expand gear government - wide . the chief human capital officers council ( chco council ) is developing a toolkit based , among other things , on the experience of the pilot agencies . the toolkit is intended to help additional agencies implement the gear framework ; chco council representatives expect the toolkit to be complete by the end of september 2013. however , beyond the toolkit , neither the chco council nor opm have identified next steps to implement gear government - wide , such as identifying roles and responsibilities . further , neither opm nor the chco council has plans to regularly update the gear framework or toolkit to include additional lessons learned , or to make such information available more broadly to key stakeholders , such as human resource professionals who may be responsible for future implementation . without taking these steps , agencies that have already begun implementing gear risk losing their momentum ; in addition , it may be challenging to implement gear government - wide . the five pilot agencies adopted various approaches to implementing gear - doe , hud , and opm implemented gear agency - wide , while coast guard and nca adopted gear in single units - based on agency needs , available resources , and gao 's lessons learned to date . for example , early stakeholder involvement , including engagement between those representing labor and management , resulted in greater transparency and fewer obstacles . in addition , administering employee surveys to identify the greatest needs before implementing gear helped establish a baseline to better track results . each of the pilot agencies developed a gear project plan that outlined specific actions . doe 's gear plan was the most thoroughly documented . the other four agency plans did not include all project planning best practices . without these elements , agencies may be limited in their ability to determine what needs to be done , when it should be done , who should do it , and how to measure progress towards achieving objectives . as gear is adopted government - wide , gao recommends that the director of opm , in collaboration with the chco council , define roles and responsibilities for opm , the chco council , and individual agencies , in such areas as updating the toolkit ( as needed ) and disseminating information on gear more broadly . gao also recommends that opm , coast guard , hud , and nca update their gear project plans to be consistent with best practices for project planning . opm , dhs , hud , and va agreed with the recommendations .
tsa accelerated the deployment of ait systems , or full - body scanners , in response to the december 25 , 2009 , attempted terrorist attack on northwest airlines flight 253. pursuant to the federal aviation administration modernization and reform act of 2012 , tsa was mandated to ensure that ait systems were equipped with atr software , which displays generic outlines of passengers rather than actual images , by june 1 , 2013. all deployed ait systems were equipped with atr software by the deadline . gao was asked to evaluate tsa 's ait - atr systems ' effectiveness . this report addresses the extent to which tsa collects and analyzes available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of the ait - atr system and tsa has made progress toward enhancing ait capabilities to detect concealed explosives and other threat items , and any challenges that remain . gao analyzed testing results conducted by the transportation security laboratory and tsa personnel at airports and interviewed dhs and tsa officials . this is a public version of a classified report that gao issued in december 2013. information dhs and tsa deemed classified or sensitive has been omitted , including information and recommendations related to improving ait capabilities . the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) transportation security administration ( tsa ) does not collect or analyze available information that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of the advanced imaging technology ( ait ) with automated target recognition ( atr ) system . specifically , tsa does not collect or analyze available data on drills using improvised explosive devices ( ied ) at the checkpoint that could provide insight into how well screening officers ( so ) resolve anomalies , including objects that could pose a threat to an aircraft , identified by ait systems , because it does not enforce compliance with its operational directive . tsa 's operational directive requires personnel at airports to conduct drills to assess so compliance with tsa 's screening standard operating procedures and to train sos to better resolve anomalies identified by ait - atr systems . gao found that tsa personnel at about half of airports with ait systems did not report any ied checkpoint drill results on those systems from march 2011 through february 2013. according to tsa , it does not ensure compliance with the directive at every airport because it is unclear which office should oversee enforcing the directive . without data on ied checkpoint drills , tsa lacks insight into how well sos resolve anomalies detected by ait systems , information that could be used to help strengthen existing screening processes . potential weaknesses in the screening process could be caused by tsa not clarifying which office is responsible for overseeing tsa 's operational directive , directing that office to ensure enforcement of the directive in conducting these drills , and analyzing the data . further , when determining ait - atr system effectiveness , tsa uses laboratory test results that do not reflect the combined performance of the technology , the personnel who operate it , and the process that governs ait - related security operations . tsa officials agreed that it is important to analyze performance by including an evaluation of the technology , operators , and processes and stated that tsa is planning to assess the performance of all layers of security . by not measuring system effectiveness based on the performance of the technology and sos who operate the technology or taking into account current processes and deployment strategies , dhs and tsa are not ensuring that future procurements meet mission needs . tsa completed the installation of atr software upgrades intended to address privacy concerns for all deployed ait systems ; however , it has not met proposed milestones for enhancing capabilities as documented in its ait roadmap — a document that contains milestones for achieving enhanced capabilities to meet the agency 's mission needs . for example , tsa began operational test and evaluation for tier ii upgrades 17 months after the expected start date . moreover , tsa did not use available scientific research or information from experts from the national laboratories or vendors on the technological challenges that it faces in developing requirements and milestones , because , according to tsa , it relied on time frames proposed by vendors . thus , tsa can not ensure that its roadmap reflects the true capabilities of the next generation of ait systems by using scientific evidence and information from dhs 's science and technology directorate , the national laboratories , and vendors to develop a realistic schedule with achievable milestones that outlines the technological advancements , estimated time , and resources needed to achieve enhanced capabilities as outlined in tsa 's roadmap . gao recommends that tsa , among other things , clarify which office should oversee its operational directive , better measure system effectiveness , and develop a realistic schedule before procuring future generations . tsa concurred with gao 's recommendations .
dod has emphasized innovative and low - cost approaches to build the defense capacity of foreign partners , and it uses its five regional centers to administer programs to foster partnerships and deepen foreign officials ' understanding of u.s. objectives . the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2013 national defense authorization act ( h.r . conf . rep. no . 112-705 ) mandated gao to conduct a study of the regional centers . gao 's report describes how the regional centers ' activities compare with those of other dod training and education organizations , and evaluates the extent to which dod has developed and implemented an approach to oversee and assess the regional centers ' progress in achieving dod priorities . this report also provides information on the process used to approve regional center requests to waive reimbursement of the costs for nongovernmental and international organizations that participate in the regional centers ' activities . gao reviewed public law and departmental directives and conducted an analysis comparing aspects of the regional centers with other selected dod training and education institutions . the department of defense 's ( dod ) five regional centers for security studies ( regional centers ) share similarities and differences with other dod institutions that provide training and education , including professional military education , advanced degree - conferring , and professional development institutions , in terms of curriculum topics , targeted audience , and program format . gao found that they all offer training and educational programs and activities to help participants understand security and military matters and to enhance their knowledge , skills , and experiences in these matters . however , there are notable differences in that the regional centers generally focus on helping foreign participants understand and respond to regional security issues ; generally target a foreign civilian and military personnel audience ; and offer shorter and typically less formal courses of study . the regional centers support dod policy objectives with curricula designed to enhance security and foster partnerships through education and exchanges . by contrast , other dod training and education organizations focus their curricula on military operations and leadership . while the regional centers ' target audience is foreign civilian and military officials , the other dod educational organizations typically aim their programs and activities at u.s. servicemembers at all career levels . regional center participants generally do not earn credit toward a degree , and the offered courses , conferences , and workshops are of shorter duration ranging from days to weeks . dod 's professional military education and advanced degree - conferring institutions are accredited and generally offer longer , more formal courses that provide participants the opportunity to earn advanced degrees . dod has taken some steps to enhance its oversight of the regional centers ' plans and activities , but its ability to determine whether the regional centers are achieving departmental priorities remains limited because it has not developed an approach for assessing progress . dod has defined roles and responsibilities , issued relevant guidance that reflects departmental objectives , and established a governance body and planning process to facilitate information sharing and to achieve more integrated decision making . however , dod has not developed an approach that includes measurable goals and objectives , metrics for assessing performance , or a methodology to assess the regional centers ' progress in achieving dod priorities , to include clarifying how it will use performance data provided by the regional centers . gao 's prior work has found that achieving results in government requires a comprehensive oversight framework that includes clear goals , measurable objectives , and metrics for assessing progress , consistent with the framework established in the government performance and results act . the regional centers report various types of performance data , such as summaries of past activities . while dod has established a governance body to assist in monitoring the regional centers ' plans and activities , the body has not identified how it will use performance information to assess the regional centers ' progress toward achieving department priorities . conducting routine assessments using measurable goals and objectives , with metrics to evaluate progress , and a methodology for using performance information to include defining the role of the governance body would provide dod a sounder basis for assessing the regional centers ' progress in achieving results , and for better determining the allocation of resources . gao recommends that dod develop measurable goals linked to key programming priorities for the regional centers , metrics for assessing performance against these goals , and a methodology to assess the regional centers ' progress in achieving dod priorities . dod generally agreed with the recommendations . or charles michael johnson , jr. at 512-7331 or johnsoncm @ gao.gov .
according to dod , corrosion can significantly affect maintenance cost , service life of equipment , and military readiness by diminishing the operations of critical systems and creating safety hazards . pursuant to section 2228 of title 10 of the u.s. code , dod 's corrosion office is responsible for prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military equipment and infrastructure . to help identify technology to prevent or mitigate corrosion and educate personnel about corrosion prevention and control , dod funds universities and military labs in the tcc program . gao was asked to review dod 's tcc program and its goals . in this report , gao addressed the extent to which dod has established procedures for managing the tcc program , can provide information on the amount of funds spent on the program to date , and has established goals for the tcc program and transitioned demonstrated results from projects to military departments . gao reviewed dod policies and plans and met with dod corrosion officials and tcc participants . the department of defense 's ( dod ) office of corrosion policy and oversight ( corrosion office ) has documented some , but not all , key procedures for the technical corrosion collaboration ( tcc ) program . for civilian institutions , the corrosion office documented procedures for selecting projects , but has not done so for approving these projects . in addition , for military academic institutions , the office has not documented procedures for selecting and approving projects . corrosion office officials stated that procedures for some aspects of the tcc program are not documented because the program is still evolving and they would like flexibility to enable innovation in determining how to manage the program . however , without fully documenting its decision - making procedures for selecting and approving projects , the corrosion office can not demonstrate how projects were selected and approved for the tcc program . corrosion office officials provided data on the amount of funds spent on the tcc program for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 , but in some cases the data were not readily available and were inconsistent for the same time frame . as a result , it is unclear what the corrosion office has spent on the tcc program . section 2228 requires the corrosion office to include a description of the amount of funds used for the tcc program in its annual corrosion budget report to congress . however , because the corrosion office does not track and maintain accurate records , it is unable to determine the amount of funds spent . in the absence of fully documented funding data that are readily available for examination , corrosion office officials can not ensure that they will accurately account for and report tcc costs in the annual budget report to congress . dod has set goals for the tcc program , but has not developed a process to transition demonstrated results from projects to military departments . according to the dod corrosion prevention and mitigation strategic plan , tcc program goals are to : develop individuals with education , training , and experience who will form the future core of the technical community within dod and private industry ; and produce solutions that will reduce the effect of corrosion on dod infrastructure and weapon systems . to track the goal of developing people , the corrosion office cited , among other things , the research papers that have been produced as a result of the tcc program . section 2228 requires that the corrosion office coordinate a research and development program that includes a plan for the transition of new corrosion - prevention technologies to the military departments . to track the goal to produce solutions that will reduce corrosion , the corrosion office monitors tcc projects ' results ; however , the office has not established a process to transition demonstrated results of the research projects to the military departments . corrosion office officials stated that it is difficult to transition results because outputs of tcc research are in the early stages of technology evolution and thus are not mature enough to be used by the military departments . therefore , corrosion office officials acknowledge the need to establish a process to transition tcc results to the military departments . until the corrosion office establishes a process to study and determine what , if any , tcc results could transition to the military departments , dod will not be able to demonstrate the success of the tcc program and the extent to which tcc results are helping to prevent or mitigate corrosion . gao recommends five actions to improve dod 's management of the tcc program . dod partially agreed with two actions : to document procedures to select and approve labs , and to track and maintain accurate funding data . dod did not agree with three recommendations to document procedures to select and approve projects , and to establish a process to transition project results to the military departments . gao believes that these recommendations remain valid .
states foreign service promotion process follows an up - or - out principle , under which failure to gain promotion to higher rank within a specified time leads to mandatory retirement for personnel in certain occupational categories . states oig and the foreign service grievance board identified procedural concerns relating to the process in 2010. gao was asked to review the foreign service promotion process . this report examines states process for ranking and promoting foreign service personnel , procedural changes state has made to its foreign service promotion process in response to identified concerns , and the extent to which updated procedures were consistently followed in 2011 and 2012 and whether any notable concerns about the promotion process remain . gao reviewed laws and procedures ; analyzed selection , performance standards , and reconstituted board files as well as grievance case files for the 2011 and 2012 promotion cycles ; interviewed state officials ; and contacted 2011 and 2012 board members to offer them an opportunity to comment on the process . the department of state 's ( state ) foreign service promotion process includes convening several types of boards to evaluate candidates for promotion and identify other candidates for possible separation from the service . state has a separate process to address related grievances . selection boards review all candidates and sort them into one of three categories : promotable , mid - ranked , and low - ranked . the selection boards produce rank - ordered lists of those candidates recommended for promotion , and a `` cut line '' is subsequently determined based on the number of available promotion slots . before announcing promotions , state vets all recommended candidates to determine whether there are outstanding issues , such as a pending investigation , that can lead to their removal from the promotion list . subsequently , state convenes performance standards boards to assess low - ranked candidates for possible separation from the service . there are several mechanisms to address grievances relating to the promotion process . for example , state may initiate reconstituted boards to reassess candidates if a board failed to follow the procedures or if the underlying performance information contained omissions or inaccuracies . employees not satisfied with grievance outcomes can file an appeal with the foreign service grievance board . in response to concerns identified by the office of inspector general ( oig ) and foreign service grievance board in 2010 , state has taken a number of actions to strengthen its foreign service promotion process internal controls . for example , in response to concerns about improper introduction of information about candidates , state instituted a requirement that board members sign an oath to adhere to the promotion criteria and protect the confidentiality of board materials . state also revised its procedures governing recusal requests , thereby broadening the provisions under which a candidate can request an individual board member 's recusal from reviewing their file . in addition , state updated its reconstituted board procedures , outlining a set of required documents , such as signed board member score sheets , to be included in each board 's official record . in addition to actions taken in response to others ' identified concerns , state initiated other practices to strengthen promotion process safeguards , such as including selection board and reconstituted board member recusal memos in the final board report . gao found that foreign service selection boards , performance standards boards , and reconstituted boards complied with many of state 's updated procedures in the 2011 and 2012 foreign service promotion cycles , but some board reports had documentation gaps for certain internal controls . for example , all 41 selection board reports we reviewed included a signed memo certifying final results . however , only 29 of 41 selection boards had signed oaths from all board members , and 45 of 122 required oaths were missing from 2012 selection board reports . in addition , some board reports lacked documentation of some recusal requests . the absence of a fully documented system of controls increases the risk that intentional or unintentional failures to implement safeguards , by board members or state human resources staff , may go undetected and uncorrected . such a failure to implement safeguards , in turn , increases the risk that the integrity of promotion results could be intentionally or inadvertently compromised . gao recommends that state take actions to ensure full implementation of promotion process internal controls . state concurred with gao 's recommendation .
each year , millions of visitors come to the united states legally on a temporary basis either with or without a visa . overstays are individuals who were admitted legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized periods of admission . dhs has primary responsibility for identifying and taking enforcement action to address overstays . in april 2011 , gao reported on dhs 's actions to identify and address overstays and made recommendations to strengthen these processes . dhs concurred and has taken or is taking steps to address them . dhs has also reported taking further actions to address overstays . gao was asked to review dhs 's progress since april 2011. this report addresses dhs 's efforts to review its records to identify potential overstays , the extent to which dhs 's changes in its systems or processes have improved data on potential overstays and dhs 's ability to report overstay rates , and the extent to which dhs has made progress toward establishing a biometric exit system . gao analyzed dhs overstay data and documents -- such as those related to the overstay identification processes and biometric exit plans -- and interviewed relevant dhs officials . since april 2011 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has taken action to address a backlog of potential overstay records that gao previously identified . specifically , dhs reviewed such records to identify national security and public safety threats , but unmatched arrival records -- those without corresponding departure records -- remain in dhs 's system . gao had previously reported that , as of january 2011 , dhs had a backlog of 1.6 million unmatched arrival records that had not been reviewed through automated or manual processes . dhs tracks arrivals and departures and closes records for individuals with matching arrival and departure records . unmatched arrival records indicate that the individual is a potential overstay . in 2011 , dhs reviewed this backlog of 1.6 million records , closed about 863,000 records , and removed them from the backlog . as new unmatched arrival records have accrued , dhs has continued to review all of these new records for national security and public safety concerns . as of june 2013 , dhs 's unmatched arrival records totaled more than 1 million . dhs has actions completed and under way to improve data on potential overstays and report overstay rates , but the effect of these improvements is not yet known . further , dhs continues to face challenges in reporting reliable overstay rates . dhs has streamlined connections among databases used to identify potential overstays . however , these improvements do not address some underlying data quality issues , such as missing land departure data . federal law requires dhs to report overstay estimates , but dhs or its predecessor has not regularly done so since 1994. in april 2011 , gao reported that dhs officials said that they have not reported overstay rates because dhs has not had sufficient confidence in the quality of its overstay data . in february 2013 , the secretary of homeland security testified that dhs plans to report overstay rates by december 2013. however , dhs has not assessed or documented improvements in the reliability of data used to develop overstay estimates , in accordance with federal internal control standards . without such a documented assessment to ensure the reliability of these data , decision makers would not have the information needed to use these data for policy - making purposes . developing and implementing a biometric exit capability to collect biometric data , such as fingerprints , which is required by federal law , has been a long - standing challenge for dhs . in may 2012 , dhs internally reported recommendations to support the planning for a biometric exit capability at airports -- dhs 's priority for biometric exit capabilities -- that could also be implemented at seaports in the future ; however , as of june 2013 , dhs 's planning did not address a biometric exit capability at land ports of entry . dhs officials stated that the department 's goal is to develop information and report to congress about the benefits and costs of biometric air exit options before the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle . standard practices for project management state that time frames should be documented as part of the planning process ; however , dhs has a high - level plan for a biometric air exit capability , and it does not clearly define the steps , time frames , and milestones needed to develop and implement an evaluation framework , as recommended in dhs 's may 2012 report . without robust planning that includes time frames and milestones , dhs does not have reasonable assurance that it will meet its time frame for developing and implementing an evaluation framework .
the small business jobs act of 2010 aimed to stimulate job growth by , among other things , establishing the sblf program within treasury . sblf was authorized to make up to $ 30 billion in capital investments to encourage banks and community development loan funds with assets of less than $ 10 billion to increase their small business lending . the act generally defined `` small business lending '' as loans not more than $ 10 million originally . under the act , gao is mandated to conduct an audit of sblf annually . gao 's first and second reports were on the program 's implementation and performance reporting and made recommendations on management oversight , program evaluation , and performance reporting . this third report examines the growth in qualified small business lending and reasons for variations in the growth at sblf banks and actions treasury has taken to evaluate participant lending patterns . gao analyzed the most recent available performance and financial information on sblf participants ; reviewed government and private sector surveys on small business credit conditions ; and interviewed officials from treasury and representatives from sblf participants . according to the u.s. department of the treasury ( treasury ) , as of june 30 , 2013 , small business lending fund ( sblf ) participants had increased their qualified small business lending by $ 10.4 billion over their aggregate 2010 baseline of $ 36.5 billion . however , sblf participants varied greatly in the extent to which they had increased small business lending . gao analysis for the quarter ending june 30 , 2013 , showed that the median sblf bank in the top ( first ) quartile had over a 100 percent increase over the baseline , compared to a 9.1 percent increase for the median sblf bank in the bottom ( fourth ) quartile . several factors gao analyzed could help explain this variation . for example , the median bank in the bottom quartile had more troubled loans than banks in the top quartile , which could affect a bank 's lending capacity . also , a majority of banks in the bottom lending quartile used much of their sblf funds to repay investments received from treasury 's capital purchase program , leaving them with a much smaller net increase in available capital . several banks gao interviewed said that they have seen increased demand for credit as the economy improved . in addition , publicly reported surveys indicate that credit conditions have improved , but some small businesses continue to face challenges securing credit . treasury has taken steps to assess sblf participants ' lending patterns , including conducting a peer - group analysis and collecting performance data through an annual survey of sblf participants . however , these steps are not sufficient to isolate the net impact of sblf on participants ' lending . treasury officials said that they are exploring evaluation approaches and have a firm under contract to help identify statistical analyses that could be used , but have not provided documentation of its evaluation plan committing to an approach . gao guidance on program evaluation suggests that impact evaluations are usually required to assess the net impact of a program by comparing the observed outcomes to an estimate of what would have happened in the program 's absence . by conducting an evaluation that includes methods to assess the net impact of sblf , treasury could more effectively inform the public and congress on how sblf has affected the participants ' lending compared to other factors , such as economic conditions , and could better assist congress in making future decisions about similar capital investment programs or alternative programs that support small business access to capital . treasury should follow through in conducting an impact evaluation that includes methods to isolate the effect of sblf from other factors on participants ' small business lending . in written comments on a draft of this report , treasury agreed to implement the recommendation .
motor vehicle crashes involving alcohol - impaired drivers killed 10,322 people in 2012 and account for almost one third of all traffic fatalities annually . ignition interlocks are one strategy states use to combat dwi . in 2012 , map - 21 established a grant program for states that adopt and implement mandatory alcohol ignition - interlock laws for all convicted dwi offenders . funding authorization for this program expires at the end of fiscal year 2014. gao was asked to review the effectiveness of ignition interlocks and nhtsa 's implementation of the new grant program . this report discusses what is known about ignition interlock effectiveness and the extent to which nhtsa has assisted states in implementing ignition - interlock programs , including the grant program . gao reviewed 25 studies that analyzed relationships between ignition interlocks and dwi arrests and fatalities ; interviewed nhtsa officials and reviewed reports about nhtsa 's assistance to states ; and interviewed representatives from safety - advocacy and research organizations , and officials involved with ignition - interlock programs from 10 states . the states were selected based on grant program qualification and the number of alcohol - impaired fatalities , among other factors . the information from these states is not generalizable . dot officials reviewed a draft of this report and generally agreed with the findings . dot offered technical corrections , which we incorporated as appropriate . research gao reviewed consistently indicated that when installed ignition “ interlocks ” — devices that prevent drivers from starting their cars if they have been drinking alcohol — effectively reduce the rate of re - arrest for driving while intoxicated ( dwi ) when installed . but once the devices are removed , dwi re - arrest rates return to pre - interlock rates . ( most studies use dwi arrest as a proxy for alcohol - impaired driving . ) . further , the national highway traffic safety administration ( nhtsa ) estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of offenders arrested for dwi actually install ignition interlocks . many factors contribute to low installation rates . for example , some states lack the resources to monitor offenders to ensure they install ignition interlocks ; other states require that offenders pay fees and penalties to be eligible to install ignition interlocks and return to driving with interlocks . state ignition interlock programs vary in terms of how they are designed , but little research exists on which specific interlock program characteristics — such as monitoring or length of installation — could improve the effectiveness of interlock programs . nhtsa is currently conducting studies on factors that could help states improve installation rates or otherwise improve the effectiveness of their interlock programs . nhtsa expects these studies to be completed by 2015. nhtsa has offered a variety of technical assistance , research , and education to help states establish and improve their ignition - interlock programs , as well as implement the ignition interlock grant program established by the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) . while state officials confirmed that nhtsa 's overall ignition - interlock - related activities have been useful , some questioned nhtsa 's implementation of the ignition interlock grant program . specifically , nhtsa 's implementation was based on the plain meaning of the authorizing language in map - 21 , which did not include any reference to exemptions . as a result , states with “ employer exemptions ” — programs that require offenders to drive only vehicles equipped with ignition interlocks for personal use but allow them to drive employer - owned vehicles for work purposes — were disqualified . some state officials told us these exemptions are seldom used in practice , but are important to maintain because they facilitate the ability of offenders to work . according to nhtsa officials , they recognized that to qualify for the grant , many states would have to modify their ignition - interlock laws to make them applicable to first time offenders and eliminate exemptions ; therefore , few states were expected to qualify in the grant 's first years because it would be difficult for state legislatures to change their ignition - interlock laws in that time frame . in fiscal year 2013 , 2 states qualified for the grant ; most of the additional 12 states that applied for the grant were disqualified at least in part due to employer exemptions , but the legislatures in 2 of those states later removed such exemptions from their laws , resulting in 4 states qualifying for the grant in fiscal year 2014. because the ignition interlock grant is relatively new , the extent to which additional state legislatures may be willing or able to modify their laws to qualify for the grant is unclear . a 2012 nhtsa review of states ' impaired - driving laws found that at least 5 states ' ignition - interlock laws included employer vehicle exemptions , but additional states had other factors that would prevent them from qualifying for the ignition - interlock grant .
omb launched the dashboard in june 2009 as a public web site that reports performance for major it investments -- on which the federal government plans to invest over $ 38 billion in fiscal year 2014. the dashboard is to provide transparency for these investments and to facilitate public monitoring of them . after its launch , omb began using it to identify at - risk investments . this report characterizes the cio ratings for selected federal agencies ' it investments as reported on the dashboard over time , determines the extent to which selected agencies ' cio ratings are consistent with investment risk , and determines the extent to which selected agencies are addressing at - risk investments . gao selected the eight agencies with the most reported major it spending in fiscal year 2012 ( excluding those gao recently reviewed ) and selected 10 investments at each agency . gao reviewed the investments ' documentation , compared it to the cio ratings , and reviewed processes used for the highest - risk investments . gao also interviewed appropriate officials . as of august 2013 , the chief information officers ( cio ) at the eight selected agencies rated 198 of their 244 major information technology ( it ) investments listed on the federal it dashboard ( dashboard ) as low risk or moderately low risk , 41 as medium risk , and 5 as high risk or moderately high risk . however , the total number of investments reported by these agencies has varied over time , which impacts the number of investments receiving cio ratings . for example , energy reclassified several of its supercomputer investments from it to facilities and commerce decided to reclassify its satellite ground system investments . both decisions resulted in the removal of the investments from the dashboard , even though the investments were clearly it . in addition , the office of management and budget ( omb ) does not update the public version of the dashboard as the president 's budget request is being created . as a result , the public version of the dashboard was not updated for 15 of the past 24 months , and so was not available as a tool for investment oversight and decision making . of the 80 investments reviewed , 53 of the cio ratings were consistent with the investment risk , 20 were partially consistent , and 7 were inconsistent . while two agencies ' cio ratings were entirely consistent , other agencies ' ratings were inconsistent for a variety of reasons , including delays in updating the dashboard and how investment performance was tracked . for example , the department of justice downgraded an investment in july 2012 , but the dashboard was not updated to reflect this until april 2013. further , the social security administration resets investment cost and schedule performance baselines annually , an approach that increases the risk of undetected cost or schedule variances that will impact investment success . of the eight investments that were at highest risk in 2012 , seven were reviewed by their agencies using tools such as techstat sessions -- evidence - based reviews intended to improve investment performance and other high - level reviews . each of these resulted in action items intended to improve performance . the final investment was scheduled to have a techstat , but instead , according to department officials , a decision was made to modify its program cost and schedule commitments to better reflect the investment 's actual performance . gao recommends that omb make dashboard information available independent of the budget process , and that agencies appropriately categorize it investments and address identified weaknesses . omb neither agreed nor disagreed . six agencies generally agreed with the report or had no comments and two others did not agree , believing their categorizations were appropriate . gao continues to believe its recommendations remain valid , as discussed .
dod provides certain health care services through its tricare program , which complements the health care services provided in military treatment facilities . dod acquires these health care services through mcscs with private sector companies . as of october 1 , 2013 , dod 's defense health agency is responsible for awarding , administering , and overseeing tricare 's mcscs . prior to this date tma handled these duties . dod 's health care costs have more than doubled from $ 19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to its fiscal year 2014 budget request of more than $ 49 billion . senate report 112-173 , which accompanied a version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 , cited concerns with the growth of dod 's health care costs and identified private sector health care contracts as an area for potential savings and efficiencies . the senate report mandated that gao review dod 's process for acquiring tricare 's mcscs . this report examines : tma 's acquisition process to award tricare 's third generation mcscs ; the extent to which issues were raised in the bid protests involving these mcscs , including identifying any common themes ; and lessons learned from the acquisition process to award these mcscs and how these lessons may be used in future acquisitions . gao reviewed relevant federal statutes , regulations , policy documentation , and the bid protest decisions for tricare 's third generation mcscs . gao also interviewed tricare officials about the acquisition process and lessons learned . the tricare management activity ( tma ) within the department of defense ( dod ) used the acquisition process prescribed by federal regulations to acquire health care services for the tricare program through the third generation of tricare 's managed care support contracts ( mcsc ) . this process included a three - phased contract award process outlined in the figure below . tma policy also defined steps for the acquisition process beyond what was required in the federal regulations , including developing additional documentation and obtaining additional approvals from senior tricare acquisition officials . for example , peer reviews of the acquisition process are conducted and documented for certain dod contracts , including tricare 's mcscs . tma awarded a contract for each tricare region ( north , south , and west ) , but challenges ( bid protests ) to the agency 's award decisions were filed by unsuccessful offerors in all three regions . of the six bid protests filed , three were sustained and three were denied . following the resolution of the bid protests , the mcscs in all three regions were awarded to a different offeror than was initially awarded the contract . the offerors who filed the bid protests cited various issues , most frequently tma 's evaluation of proposals . for example , four bid protests challenged tma 's evaluation of offerors ' proposed network provider discounts , which are discounts of provider payment rates negotiated by offerors to reduce overall health care costs to the government . tricare acquisition officials said that sustained bid protests and tma 's implementation of corrective actions prompted them to identify lessons learned where changes could be made to improve the acquisition process for subsequent tricare mcscs . lessons learned included improvements in communication and documentation to increase transparency during the evaluation of proposals and increases to the length of the acquisition process to allow for more time to evaluate proposals and for the transition from one mcsc to another . tricare acquisition officials also said that some of these lessons have been applied in other contracting activities ; however , they could not confirm which , if any , of these lessons will be incorporated into the acquisition process for the next generation of tricare mcscs , scheduled for 2018. gao requested comments from dod on the draft report , but none were provided .
aerial refueling allows u.s. military aircraft to fly farther , stay airborne longer , and transport more weapons , equipment , and supplies . yet the mainstay of the u.s. tanker forces — the kc - 135 stratotanker — is over 50 years old . it is increasingly costly to support and its age - related problems could potentially ground the fleet . as a result , the air force initiated the $ 51 billion kc - 46 program to replace the aerial refueling fleet . the program plans to produce 18 tankers by 2017 and 179 aircraft in total . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 mandated gao to annually review the kc - 46 program through 2017. this report addresses progress made in 2013 toward cost , schedule , and performance goals , development challenges , if any , and steps to address them , and progress made in manufacturing the aircraft . to do this , gao reviewed key program documents and discussed development and production plans and results with officials from the kc - 46 program office , other defense offices , and the prime contractor , boeing . the kc - 46 program has made good progress over the past year — acquisition costs have remained relatively stable , the critical design review was successfully completed , the program is on track to meet performance parameters , and the contractor started building development aircraft . as shown , total program acquisition costs — which include development , production , and military construction costs — and unit costs have changed less than 1 percent since february 2011. as of december 2013 , boeing had about $ 75 million of its management reserves remaining to address identified , but unresolved development risks . there are indications that the start of initial operational test and evaluation , which is scheduled for may 2016 , may slip 6 to 12 months . according to the director of operational test and evaluation , more time may be needed to train aircrew and maintenance personnel and verify maintenance procedures . the program released over 90 percent of the kc - 46 design drawings at the critical design review , indicating that the design is stable . overall , development of about 15.8 million lines of software code is progressing mostly according to plan . the next 12 months will be challenging as the program must complete software development , verify that the software works as intended , finalize developmental flight test planning , and begin developmental flight tests . software problem reports are increasing and boeing could have difficulty completing all testing if more retests are needed than expected . developmental flight testing activities are also a concern due to the need for extensive coordination among government agencies , the need for timely access to receiver aircraft ( aircraft the kc - 46 will refuel while in flight ) , and the aggressive test pace . the program office is conducting test exercises to mitigate risks and working with navy and united kingdom officials to finalize agreements to have access to necessary receiver aircraft . the program has also made progress in ensuring that the kc - 46 is ready for low rate initial production in 2015. boeing has started manufacturing all four development aircraft on schedule . the program office has identified its critical manufacturing processes and verified that the processes are capable of producing key military subsystems in a production representative environment . in addition , the program has established a reliability growth curve and will begin tracking its progress towards reaching reliability goals once testing begins . boeing is experiencing some manufacturing delays due to late supplier deliveries on the first aircraft and parts delays for a test article of a critical aerial refueling subsystem , but the program has not missed any major milestones . gao recommends that the air force determine the likelihood and potential effect of delays on total development costs , and develop mitigation plans , as needed , related to potential delays . dod concurred with the recommendation .
the department of commerce 's eda provides financial assistance through grants to rural and urban communities experiencing substantial and persistent economic distress . eda grants are intended to leverage existing regional assets to support the implementation of economic development strategies that advance new ideas and creative approaches to promote economic prosperity in distressed communities . house report 112-463 included a mandate that gao review grants eda made under its public works and eaa programs from fiscal years 2006 through 2012. this report discusses the extent to which eda documented its funding decisions the levels of economic distress and population density of counties where eda funded projects , and the types of projects eda funded . gao reviewed eda regulations and guidance ; analyzed eda project data from fiscal years 2007 ( the year in the period covered by the mandate in which eda awarded the most grants ) , 2011 ( the most recent year with reliable data ) , and 2012 ( the year in which eda implemented new documentation procedures ) , as well as other federal data ; and interviewed eda staff . the economic development administration ( eda ) implemented a new procedure in fiscal year 2012 that requires its regional offices to complete a standard template to document the results of committee meetings in which proposed projects are discussed and potentially recommended for funding . however , gao found that for the public works and economic development ( public works ) program and the economic adjustment assistance ( eaa ) program — eda 's two largest grant assistance programs — eda regional offices had not completed the template consistently . gao estimated that only 46 percent of all projects recommended for funding in fiscal year 2012 under these programs were documented using the complete template . eda has a history of inconsistent documentation : for example , in 2000 the department of commerce 's inspector general reported inconsistencies in how eda 's regional offices documented the project review process . standards for internal control in the federal government require all transactions and significant events to be clearly documented and available for examination . until eda takes steps to ensure that all of its regional offices consistently and fully complete the standard template for all proposed projects considered for funding , eda will not have adequate assurance that its funding decisions are consistent and transparent . gao found that counties where eda funded projects in fiscal years 2007 and 2011 under its public works and eaa programs generally had lower per capita income and higher unemployment rates than national and state averages . furthermore , some projects that eda funded under the public works and eaa programs in fiscal years 2007 and 2011 had an eda - defined special need arising from actual or threatened severe unemployment or economic adjustment problems . in addition , gao found that counties where eda funded projects under public works and eaa were generally part of nonrural areas ( areas with an urban center of more than 50,000 people ) . specifically , in fiscal years 2007 and 2011 , respectively , 52 percent and 67 percent of all of eda 's funded projects under the two programs were in nonrural areas . gao found that various types of economic development projects received funding under public works and eaa in fiscal years 2007 and 2011. the most common types of projects funded under public works involved constructing or repairing infrastructure ( such as water , sewer , gas , and electrical systems ) or constructing or renovating commercial buildings and industrial and business parks . the most common types of projects funded under eaa involved helping businesses get started , planning and research to support job creation and retention , and constructing or repairing infrastructure . to increase transparency in the award selection process , gao recommends that eda develop and implement procedures to ensure that eda regional offices consistently complete the required template for each proposed project considered for funding . eda agreed with the recommendation and described its plans to address it .
about 13 percent of our nations electricity is produced by pressurized water reactors that rely on lithium - 7 , an isotope of lithium produced and exported solely by china and russia , for their safe operation . lithium - 7 is added to the water that cools the reactor core to prevent the cooling water from becoming acidic . without the lithium - 7 , the cooling waters acidity would increase the rate of corrosion of pipes and other infrastructurepossibly causing them to fail . utilities that operate the pressurized water reactors have experienced little difficulty obtaining lithium - 7 , but they may not be aware of all the risks of relying on two producers . gao was asked to review the supply and domestic demand for lithium - 7 and how risks are being managed . this report examines what is known about the supply and demand of lithium - 7 , what federal agencies are responsible for managing supply risks , and alternative options to mitigate a potential shortage . gao reviewed documents and interviewed officials from doe , nnsa , and nrc , in addition to industry representatives . this report is an unclassified version of a classified report also issued in september 2013. little is known about lithium - 7 production in china and russia and whether their supplies can meet future domestic demand . according to industry representatives , china and russia produce enough lithium - 7 to meet demand from u.s. pressurized water reactors , a type of commercial nuclear power reactor that requires lithium - 7 for safe operation . however , china 's continued supply may be reduced by its own growing demand , according to an expert that is familiar with china 's plans . specifically , china is building several pressurized water reactors and developing a new type of reactor that will require 1,000s of kilograms of lithium - 7 to operate , rather than the 300 kilograms needed annually for all 65 u.s. pressurized water reactors . relying on two producers of lithium - 7 leaves u.s. pressurized water reactors vulnerable to lithium - 7 supply disruptions . no federal entity has taken stewardship responsibility for assessing and managing risks to the lithium - 7 supply , but doe is taking some steps . risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks , communication of risks to stakeholders , and then taking steps to manage the risks , according to federal standards for internal control . officials at doe , the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , and the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) told gao they view lithium - 7 as a commercial commodity for which industry is responsible . industry representatives told gao that they had no concerns about the lithium - 7 supply , as they have experienced no problems in obtaining it . but gao learned that industry representatives may not be familiar with all the supply risks . notwithstanding , doe plans to set aside 200 kilograms of lithium - 7 and is funding research on lithium - 7 production methods . doe also studied lithium - 7 supply and demand and concluded that no further action is needed . however , gao found several shortcomings in its study , including that doe underestimated the amount of lithium - 7 used domestically . industry estimates show that about 300 kilograms of lithium - 7 are used annually in the united states , whereas doe estimated that 200 kilograms are used annually . this and other shortcomings make it unclear if doe 's conclusion is correct that no additional action is needed . based on information from agency officials and industry representatives , gao identified three options to mitigate a potential lithium - 7 shortage : building a domestic reserve is a low - cost option that could help in the short - term ; building a domestic production capability is a longer - term solution that could eliminate lithium - 7 imports , but take about 5 years and cost $ 10-12 million , according to nnsa ; and reducing pressurized water reactors ' reliance on lithium - 7 is another longer - term solution , but may require years of research and changes in how reactors are operated . gao recommends that the secretary of energy ensure a stable future supply of lithium - 7 by directing the isotope program to take on a stewardship role for lithium - 7 by taking steps , including fully assessing risks and accurately determining domestic demand . doe concurred with the recommendation .
as u.s. forces draw down from afghanistan and home training is expanded , the competition for training ranges may also increase . section 366 of the bob stump national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 ( as amended ) required dod to submit a comprehensive plan to address training constraints caused by limitations on the use of military lands , marine areas , and airspace available in the united states and overseas for training , and provide annual progress reports on these efforts through 2018. the act also requires gao to submit annual evaluations of dods reports to congress within 90 days of receiving them from dod . in this report , gao examined whether dods 2013 sustainable ranges report met the legislative requirements ; and whether dod acted on gao previous recommendations to improve its submissions . gao is not making any recommendations in this report . in commenting on this report , dod stated that it agrees in general with the report . the 2013 sustainable ranges report of the department of defense ( dod ) met the annual statutory reporting requirements for the department to describe its progress in implementing its sustainable ranges plan and any additional actions taken or planned for addressing training constraints caused by limitations on the use of military lands , marine areas , or airspace . dod 's 2013 report provides updates to several elements of the plan that the act required it to include in its annual progress reports , including proposals to enhance training range capabilities and address any shortfalls ; goals and milestones for tracking progress in the implementation of its sustainment plan ; and projected funding requirements for each of the military services to implement their planned actions . dod reported that there were no significant changes in range capability or encroachment since 2012. it identified emerging challenges to training range sustainability , and reported on actions being taken to mitigate them . it used goals and milestones in its progress updates , and reported its projected funding requirements for implementing planned actions . together these elements describe dod 's progress in implementing its comprehensive plan and addressing training constraints at its ranges , thus meeting the annual reporting requirements of the act . dod has now implemented all prior gao recommendations focused on meeting the requirements of the act and improving report submissions . gao reported in 2012 that dod had implemented all but 2 of 13 prior recommendations . dod has subsequently addressed these 2 recommendations by developing and launching the range assessment module within the defense readiness reporting system . additionally , dod created a range visibility tool within its range scheduler system to enable a user to query and identify the availability of training ranges across the army , marine corps , and navy to optimize utilization of training resources . future improvements include plans to provide a link to the air force range scheduling system . through the changes dod has implemented in its annual reporting over the past several years , the department has continually improved reporting on the sustainability of its ranges .
fighter aircraft are important to achieve and maintain air dominance during combat operations as well as to protect the homeland . dod plans to replace many of its current fighter fleet with the f - 35 ; however , the f - 35 program has experienced numerous delays and cost increases . to maintain fighter capabilities and capacity , the air force and navy have decided to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft . in this context , two subcommittees of the house armed services committee asked gao to describe the air force and navy plans to upgrade and extend the service life of selected f - 16 and f / a - 18 aircraft ; and assess the extent to which cost estimates for these upgrades and life extensions exhibit characteristics of a high - quality cost estimate . gao obtained documentation of the plans and estimates , compared the estimates to best practices outlined in the gao cost estimating guide , and assessed factors that could affect total costs . the air force plans to upgrade and extend the service life of 300 f - 16 aircraft and the navy 150 f / a - 18 aircraft , at a combined cost estimated at almost $ 5 billion in fiscal year 2013 dollars . the air force plans to extend the service life of selected f - 16s by 2,000 flying hours each as well as install capability upgrades such as an improved radar . the air force estimates that it will complete this work by 2022 at a cost of $ 2.61 billion . about 28 percent of the projected costs are included in the air force 's spending plans through 2017 , with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2018-2022. the navy plans to extend the service life of selected f / a - 18s by 1,400 flying hours each and may install capability upgrades on some of the 150 aircraft -- such as adding the ability to integrate with newer aircraft . the navy projects that it will complete the life extension by 2018 at a cost of $ 2.19 billion , with most of these costs included in its spending plans through 2017 , but costs associated with any upgrades are not included in the navy estimate or in its spending plans . air force and navy officials told gao that they could ultimately extend the service life of up to 650 f - 16s and 280 f / a - 18s if needed to attain desired inventory levels . the air force 's and navy 's cost estimates to upgrade and extend the service life of selected fighter aircraft exhibit some characteristics of a high - quality cost estimate but do not reflect all potential costs . the estimates were : well - documented since they identified data sources and methodologies ; accurate since they accounted for inflation and were checked for errors ; and mostly comprehensive since they included the work planned and identified key assumptions . however , the estimates were not fully credible in part because they did not assess the extent to which the total costs could change if additional work is done or more aircraft are included in the programs . another factor affecting the credibility of the estimates is that they have not been compared to an independently developed estimate . gao 's past work has shown that such an independent cost estimate is one of the best validation methods since an independent cost estimate tends to be higher and more accurate than a program office estimate . air force and navy officials told gao that they use department of defense and military department guidance that allows for some variation in how the estimates are developed depending on the dollar value and maturity of the program . however , these programs -- which are critical to maintain fighter capability and capacity as current inventory ages -- total almost $ 5 billion and the costs will increase if program quantities and scope increase . without fully credible cost estimates , including an analysis of how much total costs may increase , decision makers will not have visibility into the range of potential costs , which could hinder their ability to formulate realistic budgets and make informed investment decisions . gao recommends that the air force and navy follow all best practices to enhance the credibility of the cost estimates for the f - 16 and f / a - 18 upgrades and life extensions including an assessment of the potential range of costs and seeking independent cost estimates .
the rail network is one of americas safest modes of transportation , although several recent rail accidents have reinforced the need for constant effort from the private and public sectors to ensure safety for rail passengers , the public , and railroad employees . fra , the federal agency responsible for railroad safety , works with freight , commuter , and intercity passenger railroads and certain states to ensure the safety of the u.s. railroad network . in 2007 , fra developed and implemented a risk - based approach to its safety inspections of the railroad network . in 2008 , rsia was enacted and , among other things , reauthorized fras rail safety program and included several new rail safety provisions , such as the implementation of ptc and creation of rail safety risk reduction plans . this statement discusses gaos preliminary observations about 1 ) how fra oversees rail safety , 2 ) challenges to rail safety , and 3 ) ptc implementation by the u.s. rail industry . gao examined fras overall rail safety framework and interviewed state rail safety officials and officials from fra ; selected class i , ii , and iii railroads ; and amtrak on rail safety and ptc implementation . gao plans to issue reports on reviews of rail safety and ptc in the fall of 2013. the federal railroad administration ( fra ) primarily monitors railroads ' compliance with federal safety regulations through routine inspections by individual inspectors at specific sites on railroads ' systems . thirty states also employ railroad safety inspectors , who participate in a partnership program with fra to conduct supplemental safety oversight activities based on fra rail safety regulations and enforce state railroad safety laws . fra applies a quantitative , risk - based approach , the national inspection plan , to inform its rail safety oversight efforts using analyses of past accident and inspection data and other information to target inspections in each region . fra also uses a planning and evaluation tool , the staffing allocation model ( sam ) , to distribute its inspection resources across each fra region . however , according to several fra regional administrators that gao spoke with , the staffing decisions based on sam results do not necessarily align with their perspectives on the inspector needs for their regions . based on gao 's work to date , there are several potential challenges affecting fra 's rail safety oversight . first , the rail safety improvement act ( rsia ) required fra to issue regulations requiring certain railroads to submit risk reduction plans within 4 years . fra has not yet issued a final rule on the plans . second , fra does not have a specific plan to replace its aging inspector workforce . according to fra officials , in the next 5 years , about 32 percent of fra inspectors will be eligible to retire . although fra officials said that they anticipate being able to replace inspectors , it can take 1 to 2 years to find , hire , train , and certify a new inspector . finally , fra faces other ongoing and emerging safety challenges like addressing adverse weather conditions and their impact on railroad operations and equipment , educating the public on the potential hazards of rail - highway crossings , accommodating changes in rail safety risks including new freight flows that affect the need for inspections , and hiring and training a specialized inspector workforce to provide adequate safety oversight for emerging technologies including positive train control ( ptc ) , a communications - based system designed to prevent train accidents caused by human factors . gao 's work to date indicates that railroads may not be able to fully implement ptc by the 2015 deadline established in rsia . this is because of the many interrelated challenges caused by the complexity and breadth of ptc implementation . for example , ptc components , such as the back office servers , which are needed to communicate vital information between locomotives and wayside signals , are still under development . in addition , the need to integrate ptc components and field test the system is a time - and resource - consuming process . finally , some railroads had concerns with fra 's limited resources and ability to verify field testing and certify the system once it is fully implemented . officials from freight railroads and fra stated they will not compromise ptc safety functions and will ensure ptc is implemented to meet the requirements of the rsia mandate . however , in attempting to implement ptc by the 2015 deadline , railroads may be making choices that could introduce financial and operational risks . for example , freight railroad representatives told us that without adequate time for field testing , ptc systems could potentially malfunction or fail more frequently , causing system disruptions .
in 2010 , as focal point for information technology management across the government , ombs federal chief information officer launched the federal data center consolidation initiativean effort to consolidate the growing number of federal data centers . in july 2011 and july 2012 , gao evaluated 24 agencies progress and reported that nearly all of the agencies had not completed a data center inventory or consolidation plan and recommended that they do so . gao was asked to testify on its report , being released today , that evaluated agencies ' reported progress against ombs planned consolidation and cost savings goals , and assessed the extent to which the oversight organizations put in place by omb for the federal data center consolidation initiative are adequately performing oversight of agencies ' efforts to meet these goals . in this report , gao assessed agencies progress against ombs goals , analyzed the execution of oversight roles and responsibilities , and interviewed omb , gsa , and data center consolidation task force officials about their efforts to oversee agencies consolidation efforts . the 24 agencies participating in the federal data center consolidation initiative made progress towards the office of management and budgets ( omb ) goal to close 40 percent , or 1,253 of the 3,133 total federal data centers , by the end of 2015 , but omb has not measured agencies progress against its other goal of $ 3 billion in cost savings by the end of 2015. agencies closed 420 data centers by the end of december 2012 , and have plans to close an additional 548 to reach 968 by december 2015285 closures short of ombs goal . omb has not determined agencies progress against its cost savings goal because , according to omb staff , the agency has not determined a consistent and repeatable method for tracking cost savings . this lack of information makes it uncertain whether the $ 3 billion in savings is achievable by the end of 2015. until omb tracks and reports on performance measures such as cost savings , it will be limited in its ability to oversee agencies progress against key goals . pursuant to omb direction , three organizationsthe data center consolidation task force , the general services administration ( gsa ) program management office , and ombare responsible for federal data center consolidation oversight activities ; while most activities are being performed , there are still several weaknesses in oversight . specifically , while the data center consolidation task force has established several initiatives to assist agencies in their consolidation efforts , such as holding monthly meetings to facilitate communication among agencies , it has not adequately overseen its peer review process for improving the quality of agencies ' consolidation plans . the gsa program management office has collected agencies quarterly data center closure updates and made the information publically available on an electronic dashboard for tracking consolidation progress , but it has not fully performed other oversight activities , such as conducting analyses of agencies inventories and plans . omb has implemented several initiatives to track agencies consolidation progress , such as establishing requirements for agencies to update their plans and inventories yearly and to report quarterly on their consolidation progress . however , the agency has not approved the plans on the basis of their completeness or reported on progress against its goal of $ 3 billion in cost savings . the weaknesses in oversight of the data center consolidation initiative are due , in part , to omb not ensuring that assigned responsibilities are being executed . improved oversight could better position omb to assess progress against its cost savings goal and minimize agencies risk of not realizing expected cost savings . in march 2013 , omb issued a memorandum that integrated the federal data center consolidation initiative with the portfoliostat initiative , which requires agencies to conduct annual reviews of its information technology investments and make decisions on eliminating duplication , among other things . the memorandum also made significant changes to the federal data center consolidation effort , including the initiatives reporting requirements and goals . specifically , agencies are no longer required to submit the previously required consolidation plans and the memorandum does not identify a cost savings goal . in its report , gao recommended that ombs federal chief information officer track and report on key performance measures , extend the time frame for achieving planned cost savings , and improve the execution of important oversight responsibilities . omb agreed with two of gaos recommendations and plans to evaluate the remaining recommendation related to extending the time frame .
as part of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , fps is responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in approximately 9,600 federal facilities under the control and custody of the general services administration ( gsa ) . recent incidents at federal facilities demonstrate their continued vulnerability to attacks or other acts of violence . to help accomplish its mission , fps conducts facility risk assessments and provides oversight of approximately 13,500 contract security guards deployed to federal facilities . this testimony is based on the results of our september 2013 report ( released by the subcommittee today ) , previous reports , and preliminary results of work gao conducted for a report that gao plans to issue to the chairman later this year . gao discusses challenges fps faces in ensuring contract security guards deployed to federal facilities are properly trained and certified and the extent to which fps and select federal agencies ' facility risk assessment methodologies align with standards issued by the isc . to perform this work , gao reviewed fps and guard company documentation and interviewed officials about oversight of guards . gao also reviewed fps 's and eight federal agencies ' risk assessment documentation and compared it to isc 's standards . these agencies were selected based on their missions and types of facilities . the federal protective service ( fps ) faces challenges ensuring that contract guards have been properly trained and certified before being deployed to federal facilities around the country . in a september 2013 report , gao found that providing active - shooter - response and screener training is a challenge for fps . for example , according to officials at five guard companies , their contract guards have not received training on how to respond during incidents involving an active - shooter . without ensuring that all guards receive this training , fps has limited assurance that its guards are prepared for such a threat . similarly , officials from one of fps 's contract guard companies stated that 133 ( about 38 percent ) of its approximately 350 guards have never received screener training . as a result , those guards may be using x - ray and magnetometer equipment at federal facilities that they are not qualified to use , raising questions about their ability to properly screen access control points at federal facilities -- one of their primary responsibilities . we were unable to determine the extent to which fps 's guards have received active - shooter - response and screener training . fps agreed with gao 's 2013 recommendation that they take steps to identify guards that have not had required training and provide it to them . gao also found that fps continues to lack effective management controls to ensure its guards have met its training and certification requirements . for instance , although fps agreed with gao 's 2010 and 2012 recommendations that it develop a comprehensive and reliable system for managing information on guards ' training , certifications , and qualifications , it still does not have such a system . additionally , 23 percent of the 276 guard files gao examined ( maintained by 11 of the 31 guard companies we interviewed ) lacked required training and certification documentation . examples of missing items include documentation of initial weapons and screener training and firearms qualifications . gao 's preliminary results indicate that several agencies , including fps , do not use a methodology to assess risk at their facilities that aligns with the interagency security committee 's ( isc ) risk assessment standards . risk assessments help decision - makers identify and evaluate security risks and implement protective measures to mitigate the risk . isc 's standards state that agencies ' facility risk assessment methodologies must : 1 ) consider all of the undesirable events identified by isc as possible risks to federal facilities , and 2 ) assess the threat , vulnerability , and consequence of specific undesirable events . most commonly , agencies ' methodologies that gao reviewed are inconsistent with isc 's standards because they do not assess facilities ' vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events . if an agency does not know its facilities ' potential vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events , it can not set priorities to mitigate these vulnerabilities . in addition , as gao reported in august 2012 , although federal agencies pay fps millions of dollars to assess risk at their facilities , fps 's risk assessment tool is not consistent with isc 's risk assessment standards because it does not assess consequence ( i.e . , the level , duration , and nature of loss resulting from undesirable events ) . as a result , fps and the other non - compliant agencies gao reviewed may not have a complete understanding of the risks facing approximately 57,000 federal facilities located around the country ( including the 9,600 protected by fps ) . dhs and fps agreed with gao 's recommendations in its september 2013 report .
stem education programs help to enhance the nation 's global competitiveness . many federal agencies have been involved in administering these programs . concerns have been raised about the overall effectiveness and efficiency of stem education programs . this testimony discusses the number of federal agencies and programs that provided funding for stem education programs in fiscal year 2010 ; the extent to which stem education programs overlap ; and the extent to which stem education programs measured effectiveness and were aligned to a governmentwide strategy . this testimony is based on several previously published gao reports and includes updates on actions taken in response to these reports . in fiscal year 2010 , 13 federal agencies invested over $ 3 billion in 209 programs designed to increase knowledge of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( stem ) fields and attainment of stem degrees . the number of programs within agencies ranged from 3 to 46 , with the department of health and human services , department of energy , and the national science foundation administering more than half of the 209 programs . almost a third of all programs had obligations of $ 1 million or less , while some had obligations of over $ 100 million . beyond programs specifically focused on stem education , agencies funded other broad efforts that contributed to enhancing stem education . eighty - three percent of the programs gao identified overlapped to some degree with at least 1 other program in that they offered similar services to similar target groups in similar stem fields to achieve similar objectives . many programs have a broad scope -- serving multiple target groups with multiple services . however , even when programs overlap , the services they provide and the populations they serve may differ in meaningful ways and would therefore not necessarily be duplicative . nonetheless , the programs are similar enough that they need to be well coordinated and guided by a robust strategic plan . agencies ' limited use of performance measures and evaluations may hamper their ability to assess the effectiveness of their individual programs as well as the overall stem education effort . specifically , program officials varied in their ability to provide reliable output measures -- for example , the number of students , teachers , or institutions directly served by their program . further , most agencies did not use outcomes measures in a way that is clearly reflected in their performance planning documents . in addition , a majority of programs did not conduct comprehensive evaluations since our prior review in 2005 and the time of our survey in 2011 to assess effectiveness , and the evaluations gao reviewed did not always align with program objectives . finally , gao found that completed stem education evaluation results had not always been disseminated in a fashion that facilitated knowledge sharing between both practitioners and researchers . in naming stem education as a crosscutting goal , the administration is taking the first step towards better governmentwide coordinated planning ; however , it will be important to finalize a governmentwide strategic plan so agencies can better align their performance plans and reports to new governmentwide goals . gao previously recommended that the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) should direct the national science and technology council ( nstc ) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy , develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination , identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination , and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs . since gao 's report , ostp released a progress report that identified some programs for elimination , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) named stem education one of its interim cross - cutting priority goals . gao previously recommended that the office of science and technology policy ( ostp ) should direct the national science and technology council ( nstc ) to work with agencies to better align their activities with a governmentwide strategy , develop a plan for sustained monitoring of coordination , identify programs for consolidation or potential elimination , and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs . since gaos report , ostp released a progress report that identified some programs for elimination , and the office of management and budget ( omb ) named stem education one of its interim cross - cutting priority goals .
economic development programs that effectively provide assistance to entrepreneurs may help businesses develop and expand . in august 2012 , gao reported information on 52 programs at commerce , hud , sba , and usda that provided $ 2.0 billion in support to entrepreneurs in fiscal year 2011 ( gao - 12-819 ) . of these 52 programs , 30 programs distributed across the four agencies can provide financial assistance in the form of grants and loans . inefficiencies in the administration of these programs could compromise the government 's ability to effectively provide services and meet the shared goals of the programs . this testimony discusses the extent of overlap , fragmentation , and duplication among these programs and the extent to which programs collaborate and the extent to which agencies collect information necessary to track program activities and whether these programs have met their performance goals and have been evaluated . this testimony is based on gao 's august 2012 report and provides information on the agencies ' actions to address recommendations gao made in that report . federal programs gao reviewed that offer financial support to entrepreneurs , such as grants and loans , are fragmented and overlap based on the type of support they are authorized to offer and the type of entrepreneur they are authorized to serve . the departments of commerce ( commerce ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and agriculture ( usda ) ; the small business administration ( sba ) ; and the office of management and budget ( omb ) have taken steps to collaborate more in administering these programs in response to a recommendation in gao 's august 2012 report . for example , omb has established a cross - agency priority goal for entrepreneurship and small business and an associated interagency working group . however , the four agencies have not implemented a number of good collaborative practices gao has identified , such as establishing compatible policies and procedures to better support rural businesses . the government performance and results act modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) crosscutting framework requires that agencies collaborate in order to address issues such as economic development that transcend more than one agency , and gprama directs agencies to describe how they are working with each other to achieve their program goals . some entrepreneurs struggle to navigate the fragmented programs that provide technical assistance in the form of training and counseling . this difficulty can in turn affect referrals to other programs , including financial assistance programs . for example , some entrepreneurs and technical assistance providers gao spoke with said the system can be confusing and that some entrepreneurs do not know where to go for technical assistance . collaboration could reduce some negative effects of overlap and fragmentation , but field staff gao spoke with did not consistently collaborate to provide training and counseling services to entrepreneurs . without enhanced collaboration and coordination , agencies may not be able to use limited federal resources in the most effective and efficient manner and entrepreneurs may struggle to navigate these fragmented programs . while the four agencies collect at least some information on entrepreneurial assistance program activities , they do not track such information for many programs , a practice that is not consistent with government standards for internal controls . they typically do not track detailed information on the characteristics of entrepreneurs that they serve , such as whether they are located in rural or economically distressed areas or the entrepreneurs ' type of industry . in addition , gao found that from 2000 through 2012 , the four agencies conducted program evaluations of 13 of the 30 financial assistance programs reviewed . gprama requires agencies to set and measure annual performance goals and recognizes the value of program evaluations because they can help agencies assess programs ' effectiveness and improve program performance . without more robust program information , agencies may not be able to administer programs in the most effective and efficient manner , and scarce resources may be going toward programs that are less effective . in august 2012 , gao recommended that the four agencies and omb explore opportunities to enhance collaboration among programs and that the four agencies track program information and conduct more program evaluations . the agencies neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but did provide information on their plans to address them .
tsa has implemented a multilayered system composed of people , processes , and technology to protect the nation 's transportation system . one of tsa 's security layers is nedctp , composed of over 800 deployed explosives detection canine teams , including psc teams trained to detect explosives on passengers . this testimony addresses the extent to which tsa has regularly analyzed data to identify program trends and areas working well or in need of corrective action , and comprehensively assessed the effectiveness of pscs , and coordinated with stakeholders to deploy psc teams to the highest - risk airports and utilize them as intended . this statement is based on a report gao issued in january 2013 and selected updates obtained from october 2013 through june 2014. for the selected updates , gao reviewed tsa documentation , including the results of psc effectiveness assessments , and interviewed agency officials on the status of implementing gao 's recommendations . in january 2013 , gao reported that the transportation security administration ( tsa ) collected and used key canine program data in support of its national explosives detection canine team program ( nedctp ) , but could better analyze these data to identify program trends . for example , gao found that in reviewing short notice assessments ( covert tests ) , tsa did not analyze the results beyond the pass and fail rates . therefore , tsa was missing an opportunity to determine if there were any search areas or types of explosives in which canine teams were more effective compared with others , and what , if any , training may be needed to mitigate deficiencies . gao recommended that tsa regularly analyze available data to identify program trends and areas that are working well and those in need of corrective action to guide program resources and activities . tsa concurred and has taken actions that address the intent of our recommendation . for example , in the event a team fails a short notice assessment , tsa now requires that canine team supervisors complete an analysis of the team 's training records to identify an explanation for the failure . in january 2013 , gao found that tsa began deploying passenger screening canine ( psc ) teams — teams of canines trained to detect explosives being carried or worn on a person — in april 2011 prior to determining the teams ' operational effectiveness and where within an airport psc teams would be most effectively utilized . gao recommended that tsa expand and complete testing to assess the effectiveness of pscs and conventional canines ( trained to detect explosives in stationary objects ) in all airport areas deemed appropriate prior to making additional psc deployments . this would help determine whether pscs are effective at screening passengers , and resource expenditures for psc training are warranted , and inform decisions regarding the type of canine team to deploy and where to optimally deploy such teams . tsa concurred and has taken steps to address the recommendation , but additional action is needed . specifically , tsa launched a psc training and assessment initiative and determined pscs to be most effective when working at the airport checkpoint , but tsa does not plan to conduct a comparison of psc teams with conventional canine teams as gao recommended . in january 2013 , gao also found that tsa 's 2012 strategic framework calls for the deployment of psc teams based on risk ; however , airport stakeholder concerns related to the composition and capabilities of psc teams resulted in the teams not being deployed to the highest - risk airports . gao recommended that if pscs are determined to provide an enhanced security benefit compared with conventional canine teams , tsa should coordinate with airport stakeholders to deploy future psc teams to the highest - risk airports . tsa concurred and has taken steps to address the recommendation . specifically , the psc teams for which tsa had funding and not already deployed to a specific airport at the time gao 's report was issued have been deployed to , or allocated to , the highest - risk airports . gao is making no new recommendations in this statement .
since beginning operations in 2003 , dhs has become the third - largest federal department , with more than 224,000 employees and an annual budget of about $ 60 billion . over the past 10 years , dhs has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential . since 2003 , gao has issued more than 1,300 reports and congressional testimonies designed to strengthen dhss program management , performance measurement efforts , and management processes , among other things . gao has reported that overlap and fragmentation among government programs , including those of dhs , can cause potential duplication , and reducing it could save billions of tax dollars annually and help agencies provide more efficient and effective services . moreover , in 2003 , gao designated implementing and transforming dhs as high risk because it had to transform 22 agencies into one department , and failure to address associated risks could have serious consequences . this statement addresses opportunities for dhs to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in its programs ; save tax dollars ; and enhance revenue , and opportunities for dhs to strengthen its management functions . since 2011 , gao has identified 11 areas across the department of homeland security ( dhs ) where fragmentation , overlap , or potential duplication exists and 13 areas of opportunity for cost savings or enhanced revenue collections . in these reports , gao has suggested 53 total actions to the department and congress to help strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of dhs operations . in gaos 2013 annual report on federal programs , agencies , offices , and initiatives that have duplicative goals or activities , gao identified 6 new areas where dhs could take actions to address fragmentation , overlap , or potential duplication or achieve significant cost savings . for example , gao found that dhs does not have a department - wide policy defining research and development ( r & d ) or guidance directing components how to report r & d activities . thus , dhs does not know its total annual investment in r & d , which limits its ability to oversee components r & d efforts . in particular , gao identified at least 6 components with r & d activities and an additional $ 255 million in r & d obligations in fiscal year 2011 by dhs components that was not centrally tracked . gao suggested that dhs develop and implement policies and guidance for defining and overseeing r & d at the department . in addition , gao reported that by reviewing the appropriateness of the federal cost share the transportation security administration ( tsa ) applies to agreements financing airport facility modification projects related to the installation of checked baggage screening systems , tsa could , if a reduced cost share was deemed appropriate , achieve cost efficiencies of up to $ 300 million by 2030 and be positioned to install a greater number of optimal baggage screening systems . gao has also updated its assessments of the progress that dhs and congress have made in addressing the suggested actions from the 2011 and 2012 annual reports . as of march 2013 , of the 42 actions from these reports , 5 have been addressed ( 12 percent ) , 24 have been partially addressed ( 57 percent ) , and the remaining 13 have not been addressed ( 31 percent ) . although dhs and congress have made some progress in addressing the issues that gao has previously identified , additional steps are needed to address the remaining areas to achieve associated benefits . while challenges remain across its missions , dhs has made considerable progress since 2003 in transforming its original component agencies into a single department . as a result , in its 2013 biennial high - risk update , gao narrowed the scope of the area and changed its focus and name from implementing and transforming the department of homeland security to strengthening the department of homeland security management functions . to more fully address this area , dhs needs to further strengthen its acquisition , information technology , and financial and human capital management functions . of the 31 actions and outcomes gao identified as important to addressing this area , dhs has fully or mostly addressed 8 , partially addressed 16 , and initiated 7. moving forward , dhs needs to , for example , validate required acquisition documents in a timely manner , and demonstrate measurable progress in meeting cost , schedule , and performance metrics for its major acquisition programs . in addition , dhs has begun to implement a governance structure to improve information technology management consistent with best practices , but the structure covers less than 20 percent of dhss major information technology investments . while this testimony contains no new recommendations , gao previously made about 1,800 recommendations to dhs designed to strengthen its programs and operations . the department has implemented more than 60 percent of them and has actions under way to address others .
while some internet pharmacies are legitimate businesses that offer consumers a safe and convenient way to purchase their prescription drugs , the fda and nabp have reported that thousands are fraudulent enterprises . among other things , these rogue internet pharmacies often sell counterfeit or otherwise substandard drugs . consumers have experienced health problems as a result of purchasing drugs from rogue internet pharmacies , and the proliferation and patronage of such entities has rendered them a public health threat . a number of federal and state agencies share responsibility for administering and enforcing laws related to internet pharmacies , including fda , doj , cbp , and ice , as well as state boards of pharmacy . this statement is based on gao 's july 2013 report , entitled internet pharmacies : federal agencies and states face challenges combating rogue sites , particularly those abroad ( gao - 13-560 ) . in this report , gao identified how rogue sites violate federal and state laws , challenges federal agencies face in investigating and prosecuting operators , efforts to combat rogue internet pharmacies , and efforts to educate consumers about the risks of purchasing prescription drugs online . to conduct this work , gao interviewed officials from federal agencies , reviewed federal laws and regulations , and examined agency data and documents . gao also interviewed officials from stakeholders including nabp , drug manufacturers , and companies that provide services to internet businesses . although the exact number of rogue internet pharmacies is unknown , one estimate suggests that there were over 36,000 in operation as of february 2014 , and these rogue sites violate a variety of federal laws . most operate from abroad , and many illegally ship prescription drugs into the united states that have not been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) , including drugs that are counterfeit or are otherwise substandard . many also illegally sell prescription drugs without a prescription that meets federal and state requirements . foreign rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated methods to evade scrutiny by customs officials and smuggle drugs into the country . their operators also often violate other laws , including those related to fraud and money laundering . rogue internet pharmacies are often complex , global operations , and federal agencies face substantial challenges investigating and prosecuting those involved . according to federal agency officials , piecing together rogue internet pharmacy operations can be difficult because they may be composed of thousands of related websites , and operators take steps to disguise their identities . officials also face challenges investigating and prosecuting operators because they are often located abroad in countries that are unable or unwilling to aid u.s. agencies . the department of justice ( doj ) may not prosecute such cases due to competing priorities , the complexity of these operations , and challenges related to bringing charges under some federal laws . despite these challenges , federal agencies have conducted investigations that have led to convictions , fines , and asset seizures from rogue internet pharmacies as well as from companies that provide services to them . fda and other federal agencies have also collaborated with law enforcement agencies around the world to disrupt rogue internet pharmacy operations . for example , fda took action against 1,677 rogue internet pharmacy websites in 2013 as part of a worldwide enforcement initiative . other federal agencies such as u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) and u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) have also taken actions — for example , by interdicting counterfeit drug shipments from rogue internet pharmacies at the border . fda and others have taken steps to educate consumers about the dangers of buying prescription drugs from rogue internet pharmacies . fda recently launched a national campaign to raise public awareness about the risks of purchasing drugs online , and the national association of boards of pharmacy ( nabp ) posts information on its website about how to safely purchase drugs online . however , rogue internet pharmacies use sophisticated marketing methods to appear legitimate , making it hard for consumers to differentiate between legitimate and rogue sites . nabp 's recent analysis shows that 97 percent of the over 10,000 internet pharmacies that it reviewed were out of compliance with laws or industry standards . some rogue sites seek to assure consumers of the safety of their drugs by purporting to be “ canadian ” despite being located elsewhere or selling drugs sourced from other countries .
this testimony discusses the status of the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) efforts to implement a biometric exit system . beginning in 1996 , federal law has required the implementation of an entry and exit data system to track foreign nationals entering and leaving the united states . the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 required the secretary of homeland security to develop a plan to accelerate implementation of a biometric entry and exit data system that matches available information provided by foreign nationals upon their arrival in and departure from the united states . in 2003 , dhs initiated the u.s. visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program to develop a system to collect biographic data ( such as name and date of birth ) and biometric data ( such as fingerprints ) from foreign nationals at u.s. ports of entry . since 2004 , dhs has tracked foreign nationals ' entries into the united states as part of an effort to comply with legislative requirements , and since december 2006 , a biometric entry capability has been fully operational at all air , sea , and land ports of entry . however , gao has identified a range of management challenges that dhs has faced in its effort to fully deploy a corresponding biometric exit capability to track foreign nationals when they depart the country . for example , in november 2009 , gao found that dhs had not adopted an integrated approach to scheduling , executing , and tracking the work that needed to be accomplished to deliver a biometric exit system . in these reports , gao made recommendations intended to help ensure that a biometric exit capability was planned , designed , developed , and implemented in an effective and efficient manner . dhs generally agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to implement a number of them . most recently , in july 2013 , gao reported on dhs 's progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system , as well as dhs 's efforts to identify and address potential overstays -- individuals who were admitted into the country legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized period of admission . this statement is based on gao 's july 2013 report and , like that report , discusses the extent to which dhs has made progress in developing and implementing a biometric exit system at air ports of entry , which is dhs 's priority for a biometric exit capability . gao concluded in its july 2013 report that without robust planning that includes time frames and milestones to develop and implement an evaluation framework for this assessment , dhs lacks reasonable assurance that it will be able to provide this assessment to congress for the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle as planned . furthermore , any delays in providing this information to congress could further affect possible implementation of a biometric exit system to address statutory requirements . therefore , gao recommended that the secretary of homeland security establish time frames and milestones for developing and implementing an evaluation framework to be used in conducting the department 's assessment of biometric exit options . dhs concurred with this recommendation and indicated that its component agencies plan to finalize the goals and objectives for biometric air exit by january 31 , 2014 , and that these goals and objectives will be used in the development of an evaluation framework that dhs expects to have completed by june 30 , 2014 .
federal , state , and local agencies play an important role in improving social outcomes for society 's most vulnerable populations . a small number of state , local , and foreign governments are employing pfs to fund efforts designed to better serve these vulnerable populations . gao was asked to provide information about pfs . this report examines how selected pfs projects have been structured and what potential benefits these projects can provide ; how selected pfs contracts have been structured to address potential project risks ; and the potential roles for the federal government 's involvement in pfs projects . to address these objectives , gao reviewed relevant literature on pfs ; selected 10 pfs projects that reflected a variety of policy areas and were in different stages of implementation in state and local governments in the united states and the united kingdom , where pfs originated ; reviewed key documents and interviewed stakeholders from organizations that played a role in the selected projects ; and reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the eight federal agencies that participated in an informal pfs working group . pay for success ( pfs ) , also known as social impact bonds , is a new contracting mechanism to fund prevention programs , where investors provide capital to implement a social service — for example , to reduce recidivism by former prisoners . if the service provider achieves agreed upon outcomes , the government pays the investor , usually with a rate of return , based on savings from decreased use of more costly remedial services , such as incarceration . stakeholders from the 10 pfs projects in gao 's study said that pfs offers potential benefits to all parties in the project . for example , governments can implement prevention programs that potentially lead to reduced spending on social services and transfer the risk of failing to achieve outcomes to investors . the pfs projects in gao 's review sought to manage potential risks in the feasibility assessment , design , and implementation of complex pfs contracts . for example , without safeguards , there is a risk that paying for outcomes could create perverse incentives , such as focusing on individuals who are easiest to serve rather than those most in need . to address this risk , pfs contracts included various provisions , such as only including those with the greatest need in the evaluation that determines if the government makes payments . to date , federal government involvement in pfs has been limited . the office of management and budget ( omb ) has encouraged agencies to explore the use of pfs as appropriate . potential roles federal agencies could play in pfs projects include making outcome payments or helping build capacity . we have previously reported that collaborative mechanisms , such as interagency groups , can be used to implement programs and share information . however , a formal mechanism for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs does not exist . given the evolving nature of pfs , a mechanism for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs would increase access to leading practices . to identify and broadly disseminate information on leading practices and lessons learned , the director of omb should establish a formal means for federal agencies to collaborate on pfs . omb concurred with this recommendation and is working with agencies to explore options for collaboration .
part of dol 's mission is to promote the retirement security of america 's workers , a goal that has become increasingly challenging . one tool for assessing the adequacy of retirement income is the replacement rate . however , recommendations for the replacement rate that a household should target vary widely , in part because of the diverse underlying assumptions used to develop the rates . gao was asked to review what consumption in retirement looks like and how target replacement rates are developed . gao examined whether and how spending patterns vary by age , key factors used to develop target replacement rates , and the usefulness of information on such rates provided by dol . gao analyzed data from the bls 's 2013 consumer expenditure survey , the most recent available ; analyzed 59 articles and reports that discussed how to develop , calculate , or evaluate replacement rates ; collected non - generalizable information from 14 retirement services firms and financial planners recommended by researchers and actuaries who have studied replacement rates ; and reviewed dol materials and interviewed officials . household spending patterns varied by age , with mid - career households ( those aged 45-49 ) spending more than older households . for example , according to 2013 survey data from the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) , mid - career households spent an estimated average of around $ 58,500 , while young retiree households ( those aged 65-69 ) spent about 20 percent less . while the share of spending was consistent for some categories , other categories had larger variations across age groups . for example , housing expenses comprised the largest share of spending regardless of age , while older households spent more out of pocket on health care than mid - career households . spending was less variable across age for low - income households compared to other households . for example , there was not a significant difference in average spending between mid - career and young retiree households in the lowest income quartile , compared to an approximately $ 20,000 difference for the highest income quartile . these variations in spending patterns have implications for the resources households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement . researchers and financial industry professionals develop target replacement rates — the percentage of income to aim for in retirement — based on certain key factors , including spending , household characteristics , and pre - retirement earnings . gao 's analysis of the literature found that calculating an appropriate replacement rate can be complex . for example , there is debate over whether households that have raised children should target a lower replacement rate than households that have not . in addition , a worker 's pre - retirement earnings could be defined as earnings at the end of the worker 's career or as average earnings over the course of the career . despite these complicated considerations , target replacement rates cited in the articles and reports gao reviewed typically range between 70 and 85 percent . some financial industry professionals told gao that they develop customized targets that take into account workers ' assets and expected spending , while others questioned the usefulness of replacement rates . the information and tools on replacement rates that the department of labor ( dol ) provides may be too limited to help workers understand how to use such rates for retirement planning . dol 's employee benefits security administration 's ( ebsa ) website provides information and tools to help american workers better plan for retirement , including a tool to help workers calculate their retirement income needs as a percentage of preretirement income . while ebsa 's materials note that a target replacement rate can vary based on individual circumstances , they do not include specific examples of demographic groups that research indicates can result in higher or lower income replacement needs , or how much a replacement rate might need to be adjusted for those groups or for other individual circumstances . without additional information , workers may not understand how to adjust target replacement rates when planning for retirement . further , ebsa 's worksheet and online tool for calculating how much to save use a default replacement rate with no opportunity for a user to adjust the rate based on individual circumstances . without the ability to adjust the replacement rates used in planning tools , workers may over - or under - estimate how much they need to save for retirement . gao recommends that dol provide additional examples and guidance on using a replacement rate for estimating retirement savings needs in its planning tools , and modify the planning tools so the rate can be adjusted . dol generally agreed with our recommendations and plans to add information and provide options for adjusting replacement rates in its planning tools by june 2017 .
federal obligations under sba 's 8 business development program totaled about $ 4 billion for 344 anc - owned firms in 2014. in 2011 , sba updated program regulations to address prior oversight challenges identified by gao . gao was asked to follow - up on past reports and examine sba 's current oversight processes . this report discusses , among other things , sba 's ability to enforce regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source 8 contracts to subsidiaries of the same anc ; limit subsidiaries of the same 8 anc from operating in the same primary line of business , and address challenges , if any , to sba 's oversight of 8 anc - owned firms . to do this work , gao analyzed fiscal year 2011 through 2014 data from a federal contracting database using separate nongeneralizable samples for each objective , conducted site visits , reviewed 8 sole - source contracts , and anc - owned firm annual updates , and interviewed relevant sba officials . gao has reported in the past that the small business administration 's ( sba ) ability to enforce regulations prohibiting the award of follow - on , sole - source contracts to 8 subsidiary firms of the same alaska native corporation ( anc ) relies on contract information from other federal agencies that is sometimes incomplete . sba 's regulations prohibit program participants from receiving an 8 sole - source contract that immediately follows another 8 contract with the same requirements performed by another participant owned by the same anc . other federal agencies offering 8 contracts must generally submit offer letters to sba that include information about a contract 's procurement history and name of any prior small business contractors . sba relies on this information to determine whether a firm is eligible to receive a particular 8 , follow - on , sole - source contract . however , gao 's analysis of a selection of contracts for this review found that agencies are not required to directly identify whether a sole - source contract is also a follow - on contract in these letters . one sba office has begun taking action to address this limitation by asking agencies to specifically report whether contracts are follow - on , sole - source awards in offer letters , but the change has not been broadly adopted . sba would be better positioned to limit the award of follow - on , sole - source contracts by anc - owned subsidiaries if it requested that other federal agencies specifically state whether contracts are follow - ons in offer letters . gao found in past reports and this review and in that sba 's ability to enforce its regulation prohibiting subsidiaries owned by the same anc from operating in the same primary line of business as reported to sba is hindered by limited tracking and sharing of information across sba 's 68 district offices . anc - owned firms must register a primary line of business with sba , but are allowed to pursue multiple other lines of business . in this review , gao found 5 of 39 ancs owned subsidiaries that generated a greater portion of revenues in secondary lines of business than their registered primary line of business . additionally , those secondary lines of business were the same lines of business as the primary lines for other subsidiaries owned by the same anc . such activity could potentially conflict with the regulation 's intent . sba proposed a rule designed to limit and track this activity , but lacks plans and timelines associated with this effort . regarding limited information - sharing , different district offices service different firms that are subsidiaries of the same anc . oversight staff in these offices can not access or share relevant data from other district offices . without better data sharing , sba can not monitor whether firms owned by the same anc and serviced by different district offices are complying with program rules . as gao reported in the past , sba 's staffing for its data collection and program guidance activities contributed to weak program oversight and monitoring of 8 anc - owned firms . sba took some recent actions to enhance oversight , such as conducting an accountability review in october 2014 of the alaska district office . sba has established an office to improve compliance with 8 rules by verifying self - reported information supplied by firms . however , sba does not have plans that detail the office 's roles and responsibilities for its activities . with the oversight weaknesses gao identified in this review , sba has an opportunity to enhance its oversight by finalizing plans for this office . gao recommends that , among other things , sba asks other federal agencies to specifically identify whether a contract is a follow - on in their letters to sba ; develop plans and timelines for tracking anc - owned firms ' revenues across lines of business ; and enable its staff to access and share relevant revenue data . sba agreed with two recommendations and reported actions taken to implement two others . sba disagreed with the final two , stating they were unnecessary . based on a review of actions taken , gao believes all six recommendations are still warranted .
the 2007-2009 financial crisis revealed that many u.s. and international banks lacked capital of sufficient quality and quantity to absorb substantial losses . in 2010 , the basel committee ( the global standard - setter for prudential bank regulation ) issued the basel iii framework — comprehensive reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity standards with the goal of promoting a more resilient banking sector . in 2013 , federal banking regulators adopted regulations to implement the basel iii - based capital standards in the united states , which generally apply to u.s. bank holding companies and banks and are being phased in through 2019. some market participants have raised questions about the potential negative impact of the regulations on u.s. banks , including on their lending and competitiveness . this report examines how the u.s. basel iii regulations may affect u.s. banks , including smaller ones , and implementation of basel iii by different countries and other jurisdictions may affect u.s. banking organizations ' international competitiveness . to address the objectives , gao analyzed data from financial filings ; conducted legal and economic analysis ; reviewed empirical studies , federal regulations , and agency documents ; and interviewed regulators , u.s. and foreign banks , and industry associations . gao makes no recommendations in this report . gao provided a draft of this report to the banking regulators for their review and comment and received technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . although the u.s. basel iii capital requirements may increase compliance costs , they likely will have a modest impact on lending activity as most banks may not need to raise additional capital to meet the minimum requirements . gao 's analyses of financial data for the first quarter of 2014 indicate the vast majority of bank holding companies and banks currently meet the new minimum capital ratios and capital conservation buffer ( an additional capital requirement ) at the fully phased - in levels required by 2019. gao estimated that less than 10 percent of the bank holding companies collectively would need to raise less than $ 5 billion in total additional capital to cover the capital shortfall . banks with a shortfall tended to be small , with less than $ 1 billion in assets . the empirical research gao reviewed suggests that higher regulatory capital requirements will have a modest effect on the cost and availability of credit . similarly , gao 's economic analysis indicates that raising the additional capital would lead to a modest decline in lending and a modest increase in loan rates . according to officials from the eight community banks gao interviewed , they do not anticipate any difficulties meeting the capital requirements but expect to incur additional compliance costs . officials from the 10 global systemically important banks that gao interviewed said they have been incurring significant costs to comply with the new requirements , but three said that u.s. minimum capital ratios for basel iii tend not to be the binding capital constraint . most of these bank officials said they expect the requirements to improve the resilience of the banking system . jurisdictional differences in the implementation of the basel iii capital standards have arisen , but their competitive effect on internationally active banks is unclear . basel iii serves , in part , to limit competitive disparities due to differences in capital standards , but there are limitations to full harmonization . for example , the basel capital standards have no legal force ; rather , members of the basel committee on banking supervision ( basel committee ) developed and agreed to the standards , with the expectation that each member will implement them . thus , jurisdictions may adopt requirements more or less stringent than the minimum standards . almost all basel committee members report having adopted rules to implement the basel iii capital requirements . to help promote a level regulatory playing field , the basel committee began conducting reviews in 2012 to assess whether each member 's implementation meets the basel iii minimum standards and whether implementation produced consistent outcomes across jurisdictions . these reviews found the rules of the seven members it assessed to date to be generally compliant . however , the basel committee 's other reviews identified some inconsistencies in how banks across different jurisdictions calculated their risk - weighted assets . as was the case with basel ii implementation , some banks and others are concerned about jurisdictional differences in the implementation of basel iii and their effect on competition . for example , some jurisdictions are subjecting certain of their banks to capital or leverage requirements above the basel iii minimums or exempting banks from certain capital requirements . because basel iii 's implementation is ongoing , the extent to which the differences collectively will affect competition among internationally active banks is unclear . in addition , other factors can affect the competitive position of internationally active banks , such as differences in accounting treatment , cost of capital , and tax rules across jurisdictions .
recruiters are often referred to as the “ face ” of the arng . in the past , there have been allegations of recruiter misconduct and misuse of financial incentives , making it important for recruiters to ensure procedures are followed when working with applicants and that incentives to join the arng are awarded properly and effectively . house report 113-446 included a provision for gao to review the arng 's recruiting practices . this report evaluates the extent to which arng has provided oversight of its recruiting process ; arng met its goals for recruiting , completion of initial military training , and initial term of service ; and osd , department of the army , and arng have conducted oversight of arng 's enlistment financial incentives programs . for this work , gao reviewed dod and arng recruiting policy and procedures and interviewed cognizant officials . gao analyzed data on recruiting from fy2010 through fy2014 , training from fy2011 through fy2014 , and initial term of service for fy2015 . gao visited four states representing a range of size and locations . the army national guard ( arng ) has taken steps to increase oversight of its recruiting process primarily conducted by recruiters dispersed at the state - level but has not established a permanent program to monitor state - level recruiting activities . in june 2014 , the arng created a recruiting standards branch that has started to conduct inspections of state offices . the recruiting standards branch completed inspections in 16 states from october 2014 through july 2015 and found that 2 states did not achieve full compliance in their inspections . however , this is not a permanent program , and arng officials stated that they are using positions to staff it intended for use in other areas . the arng is seeking approval for permanent staff by early 2017 to continue its oversight . continued monitoring of state - level recruiting activities , such as through a permanent recruiting standards branch , will be important to arng 's oversight functions . the arng had mixed results in meeting its overall recruiting goals and nearly met its goals for initial military training ; however , the arng does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service or military obligation . the arng met its recruiting goals in 2 of the 5 years from fiscal years ( fy ) 2010 through 2014. while the arng nearly met its goals for training completion from fy 2011 through 2014 , gao found that the arng does not have complete , consistent , and valid data on why soldiers do not complete training and when they separate during training . without consistent , complete , and valid data , decision makers do not have information to determine why a higher number of soldiers are not completing training . the arng also does not track whether soldiers are completing their initial term of service . gao 's analysis shows that about 40 percent of enlisted soldiers who joined the arng from fy 2001 through 2007 did not complete their initial term of service . without tracking completion of initial term of service , arng officials can not assess whether their programs are effective in meeting personnel requirements and do not have visibility to ensure the arng is maximizing its investment in its soldiers . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , department of the army ( army ) , and arng have not fully conducted their oversight responsibilities of arng enlistment financial - incentives programs . osd has not enforced a requirement that arng report incentives obligated through the arng incentives programs . further , although army and national guard regulations require evaluations of the effectiveness of the arng financial incentives programs , the army and arng have not evaluated and documented the effectiveness of the programs . without evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of arng incentives programs , officials may not know whether changes are needed for effective use of incentives or they may determine that certain financial incentives are not needed . moreover , the arng has not ensured that recruiters have an understanding of available financial incentives . financial incentives are a tool available to recruiters and agency policy states that incentives are available to assist in meeting and sustaining readiness requirements and to assist in filling critical shortages . arng has not provided recruiters with training on using financial incentives . with additional training , recruiters could better understand when and how to offer financial incentives to fill critical positions . gao recommends , among other things , that arng take actions to collect consistent , complete , and valid data on soldiers who do not complete training and initial term of service , and evaluate and document its incentives programs . dod concurred with gao 's recommendations but stated that it did not concur with the report due to gao 's depiction of waivers . gao disagrees with dod 's characterization as discussed in the report .
beginning in 2010 , omb initiated a series of it reform efforts to consolidate the growing number of data centers and eliminate duplicative spending . in may 2012 , the agency began a “ cut and reinvest ” effort that required agencies to propose fiscal year 2014 it reductions and reinvestments . gao was asked to review agencies ' savings from omb 's it reform efforts and determine how those savings are being reinvested . the objectives were to assess agencies ' progress in achieving savings from their it reform efforts , evaluate agencies ' plans to reinvest their savings , and evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings and governance processes to oversee the reinvestments . gao assessed 26 agencies ' cost savings and avoidance documentation , evaluated 27 agencies ' ( including the smithsonian institution ) reinvestment plans against omb 's guidance , and compared 4 of the agencies ' governance processes against best practices . the 4 agencies were selected , in part , because they had the highest dollar amounts of proposed it reinvestments . twenty - four of the 26 federal agencies participating in the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) information technology ( it ) reform initiatives reported achieving an estimated total of $ 3.6 billion dollars in cost savings and avoidances between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. slightly more than half ( or about $ 2.0 billion ) of the savings and avoidances were from data center consolidation and optimization efforts . notably , of the $ 3.6 billion total , the departments of defense , homeland security , treasury , and the social security administration accounted for about $ 2.5 billion ( or 69 percent ) . most agencies did not fully meet omb 's requirements to submit reinvestment plan information . of the 27 agencies required to submit reinvestment plans ( including one - time and ongoing plans ) , 5 agencies had fully implemented omb 's guidance , while the remaining 22 had only partially implemented it . for example , most agencies had not fully implemented omb 's guidance for submitting one - time fiscal year 2014 it reduction and reinvestment plans as part of omb 's “ cut and reinvest ” effort . as a result , agencies ' plans were substantially short of omb 's overall fiscal year 2014 targets : $ 3.0 billion in proposed reductions and $ 2.1 billion in proposed reinvestments , compared to omb 's targets of $ 7.6 billion in reductions and as much as $ 7.6 billion in reinvestments . agencies provided varied reasons for not meeting omb 's requirements , such as that their components had not fully tracked and reported how their savings were to be reinvested . until agencies complete their ongoing reinvestment plans , they will be challenged to ensure that their considerable savings are being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible . four selected agencies — the departments of education , interior , labor , and the social security administration — had documented key governance processes to guide the development of their fiscal year 2014 budget submission , which included proposed it reinvestments of $ 350 million . however , none of the four agencies had tracked the reinvestment performance results . they provided varied reasons for not doing so , and two agencies noted the lack of visibility into their components ' reinvestments . the lack of performance tracking is also due to omb not requiring agencies to document actual results . in addition , omb has not defined targets for reinvestments beyond fiscal year 2014. until omb requires agencies to track actual reinvestment performance and defines targets , it will be limited in its ability to ensure that agencies are actually reinvesting funds as planned and may not be able to hold them accountable . finally , without improved tracking , selected agencies may lack assurance that their components are reinvesting in areas consistent with agency - wide goals . gao recommends that agencies complete their it savings reinvestment plans and improve tracking , and that omb define targets for agency reinvestment and require that agencies complete their plans and track actual reinvestment performance . omb and 12 agencies agreed with gao 's recommendations , 1 did not state whether it agreed or disagreed , 3 had no comments , and 1 partially agreed .
dba requires u.s. government contractors to buy workers ' compensation insurance for most employees working overseas . the cost of this insurance , if allowable under federal regulations , is generally reimbursable under government contracts . from 1992 until 2012 , state had a contract with a single insurer to supply all state 's contractors working overseas with dba insurance . in july 2012 , state 's single insurer program ended after state unsuccessfully sought to solicit a new dba single insurer agreement and state transitioned to a system requiring its contractors to obtain dba insurance on the open market . however , concerns were raised about the transition and its impact on state 's costs and on small businesses ' competitiveness . to address these objectives , gao was asked to review state 's transition . this report assesses state 's management of the transition to an open market system , the change 's effect on contractors ' premium rates , and the change 's effect on small businesses . gao analyzed state documents ; reviewed federal and state contracting regulations ; analyzed premium rate data and federal contracting data ; and interviewed officials from state , the insurance industry , and contracting firms . the department of state ( state ) did not follow leading acquisition practices in transitioning from a single insurer defense base act ( dba ) program to an open market system . leading practices emphasize adequately documenting market research , allowing enough time to complete a solicitation , and collecting and analyzing data to select among alternatives , but state took limited measures to document the market research it performed and had little time to complete its 2012 solicitation . state included provisions in the solicitation to which insurers strongly objected , received no offers , and had to cancel the solicitation 3 days before its existing single insurer contract was to expire . as a result , state had to quickly transition to an open market system without weighing the relative costs and benefits to determine which insurance system best served its needs . until state conducts such an evaluation , it can not be assured that the open market system is the better alternative , and unless state incorporates leading practices into any future single insurer solicitations , it risks a similar outcome . gao found that state contractors ' dba premiums increased following the transition , but the increases were in a range similar to those likely to have occurred if state had continued its single insurer program . for example , median dba premium rates increased by $ 1.98 per $ 100 of payroll . gao analysis also shows that the increase in dba premium rates after the transition was in a range comparable to the increase in dba premium rates requested by state 's single dba insurer , which said it had lost money under the prior contract . existing data do not show a clear effect on small businesses resulting from state 's transition to an open market system , but insurers and contractors have expressed concern that the change has had or could have an adverse effect . gao analysis of federal procurement data from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 found a decrease in the percentage of contracts awarded to small businesses , but gao could not link this to state 's transition . information gao gathered from insurance industry officials and contractors shows that there is a potential for adverse effects , for example , denial of coverage and higher effective premium rates . state 's policy is to maximize opportunities for small businesses , but it has not assessed whether its transition to an open market dba system is affecting those opportunities . without such an assessment , state can not be assured that it is meeting its policy goal of maximizing opportunities for small businesses . state should determine whether an open market system best suits its needs , incorporate leading practices into any future single insurer solicitation , and assess the effects of its transition on small businesses . state concurred with gao 's recommendations .
mortgage servicers use lpi to protect the collateral on mortgages when borrower - purchased homeowners or flood insurance coverage lapses . the 2007-2009 financial crisis resulted in an increased prevalence of lpi . because lpi premiums are generally higher than those for borrower - purchased coverage , state insurance regulators and consumer groups have raised concerns about costs to consumers . this report addresses the extent to which lpi is used ; stakeholder views on the cost of lpi ; and state and federal oversight of lpi . gao examined documentation , studies , and laws and regulations related to lpi , and interviewed stakeholders including state insurance and federal financial regulators , consumer advocates , insurers , servicers , and industry associations . gao selected interviewees based on their involvement in the lpi market and other factors to obtain a diverse range of perspectives . gao selected the seven state insurance regulators to interview based on a number of factors including lpi premium volume and involvement in the lpi market . mortgage servicers purchase lender - placed insurance ( lpi ) for mortgages whose borrower - purchased insurance coverage lapses , most often because of nonpayment by the borrower or cancellation or nonrenewal by the original insurer . the limited information available indicates that lpi generally affects 1 percent to 2 percent of all mortgaged properties annually and has become less prevalent since the 2007-2009 financial crisis as foreclosures have declined . although used more often when borrowers without escrow accounts ( about 25 percent to 40 percent of borrowers ) stop paying their insurance premiums , servicers also use lpi when an insurer declines to renew a policy . lpi insurers often provide services such as tracking properties to help servicers identify those without insurance and confirming coverage . lpi insurers said they must refund premiums if a borrower provides evidence of coverage , which occurs on about 10 percent of policies . the federal emergency management agency offers flood lpi , but industry officials said most servicers prefer private coverage because of more comprehensive coverage and lower rates , among other things . lpi premium rates are higher than rates for borrower - purchased insurance , and stakeholders disagreed about whether the difference is justified . insurers pointed out that they provide coverage for any property in a servicer 's portfolio without a rigorous underwriting process , and the limited information requires higher rates . they added that lpi properties tended to have higher risk characteristics , such as higher - risk locations ( along the coast ) and higher vacancy rates because of foreclosures . but some consumer advocates and state regulators said that the factors that insurers cite for higher rates , as well as the insurers ' limited loss histories , do not justify the magnitude of the premium differences . they also said borrowers have little influence over the price of lpi and that some insurers competed for the servicers ' business by providing commissions to the servicer that passed the costs on to the borrower through higher premium rates . insurers , however , said that lpi premium rates were filed with and approved by state regulators and that commissions were a standard industry practice , but their use had decreased . state insurance regulators have primary responsibility for overseeing lpi insurers , but federal financial regulators generally oversee the servicers that purchase lpi coverage for their portfolios . however , a lack of comprehensive data at the state and national levels limits effective oversight of the lpi industry . for example , regulators lack reliable data that would allow them to evaluate the cost of lpi or the appropriateness of its use . the national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) , which helps coordinate state insurance regulation , requires insurers to annually submit state - level lpi data , but the data were incomplete and unreliable . naic provides guidance for the reporting of these data and shares responsibility with state regulators for reviewing and analyzing the data , but neither has developed policies and procedures sufficient for ensuring their reliability . state and federal regulators have coordinated to collect more detailed national data to better understand the lpi industry , but insurers failed to provide them all of the requested information , and whether and when they will is unknown . without more comprehensive and reliable data , state and federal regulators lack an important tool to fully evaluate lpi premium rates and industry practices and ensure that consumers are adequately protected . gao recommends that naic work with state insurance regulators to collect sufficient , reliable data to oversee the lpi market . this includes working with state insurance regulators to develop and implement more robust policies and procedures for lpi data collected annually from insurers and to complete efforts to obtain more detailed national data from insurers . naic said it would consider the recommendations as part of its ongoing work in the area .
the data act directed omb and treasury to establish government - wide data standards by may 2015 to improve the transparency and quality of federal spending data . agencies must begin reporting spending data in accordance with these standards by may 2017 and must publicly post spending data in machine - readable formats by may 2018. consistent with gao 's mandate under the act , this report is part of a series of products that gao will provide to the congress as data act implementation proceeds . this report identifies steps taken by omb and treasury to standardize data element definitions and the extent to which those definitions are consistent with leading practices or face challenges that could affect data quality ; reviews efforts by omb and treasury to provide agencies with technical implementation guidance and related challenges ; and examines the implementation status of selected federal agencies . gao analyzed data standards against leading practices ; reviewed key implementation documents , technical specifications , and applicable guidance ; and interviewed staff at omb , treasury , and other selected agencies . as required by the digital accountability and transparency act of 2014 ( data act ) , the office of management and budget ( omb ) and the department of the treasury ( treasury ) issued definitions for 57 federal spending data elements . gao found that most definitions adhered to leading practices derived from international standards for formulating data definitions . specifically , 12 of the 57 definitions met all 13 leading practices and none met fewer than 9. however , gao found several definitions that could lead to inconsistent reporting . for example , as shown in the figure below , the primary place of performance definitions ' inclusion of the word “ predominant “ leaves much open to interpretation . without more interpretive clarification , agencies run the risk of reporting data that can not be aggregated government - wide . omb and treasury addressed some of gao 's earlier concerns on draft technical guidance for implementing data standards . however , final technical guidance has not been issued , which could impede agency implementation . while omb and treasury have released interim versions of technical guidance , they have not yet released final guidance to provide a stable base for agency implementation . they also are developing an intermediary service ( “ broker ” ) to standardize and validate agency data submissions . gao 's review of selected implementation plans found that agencies need the technical guidance and the intermediary service to be finalized before they can develop detailed agency - level plans . if this guidance is not aligned with agency implementation timelines , agencies may delay taking key steps or need to revise existing plans once final technical guidance is released , thereby hindering their ability to meet data act requirements and timelines . gao found that the three agencies it reviewed — the departments of agriculture and health and human services , as well as the corporation for national and community service — have formed internal teams and are inventorying their data and assessing any needed changes to policies , processes , and technology to implement the data act . gao recommends that omb and treasury provide agencies with clarifications to address potential quality issues with the definitions , and take steps to align the release of finalized technical guidance and the broker service with agency implementation time frames . omb and treasury generally concurred with our recommendations .
gsa annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars making major and minor repairs and alterations to the more than 1,500 federally owned buildings that it holds . gao 's past work has indicated that gsa sometimes encounters “ unforeseen site conditions ” — conditions that are different from what was expected — in performing this work . unforeseen conditions can add both time and cost to repair and alteration projects . gao was asked to review issues related to tenant repair and alteration projects . this report addresses information about the extent , impact , and cause of unforeseen site conditions on selected projects , and how gsa identifies and assesses the risks of unforeseen conditions . gao reviewed 18 non - generalizable repair and alteration projects funded from fiscal year 2010 to 2013 , valued at $ 2 million or more ; interviewed gsa project managers and contracting officers about these projects ; reviewed project documents ; and interviewed a non - generalizable sample of organizations and individuals knowledgeable about the construction industry ( industry stakeholders ) . both industry stakeholders and general services administration ( gsa ) officials told gao that unforeseen conditions in repair and alteration projects are common . such conditions , for example , included an unknown wood subflooring discovered during demolition work . among the impacts identified by the stakeholders were increased project costs and schedule delays . in general , data are limited on unforeseen conditions since gsa does not analyze this type of information . most of the repair and alteration projects gao reviewed — 11 of 18 projects -- experienced an unforeseen condition . the overall impact of the unforeseen conditions on the 18 projects gao reviewed was largely limited . on 9 of the 11 projects that experienced such conditions , the cost to remediate them accounted for 1 to 5 percent of the project 's original construction contract award amount , and on one project the cost was approximately 6 percent . these amounts were below the typical 10 percent construction contingency gsa adds to project costs . schedule impacts were also limited : 4 of the 11 projects experienced delays ranging from 23 to 105 days . gao also found that three projects reviewed that did not experience unforeseen conditions were attached to larger projects that did experience these conditions . in two of these larger projects the cost increases from unforeseen conditions were about $ 2 million each . incomplete building drawings and lack of building information were among the possible causes of the unforeseen conditions experienced in the projects gao reviewed . gsa has a variety of methods to identify and assess risks of unforeseen conditions . gsa 's project planning guide states that , among other things , facility condition assessments and site surveys should be conducted initially . gsa guidance also calls for preparation of a project management plan ( pmp ) , which includes a risk assessment matrix . gao found that , in general , gsa used at least one of its risk identification methods on the projects reviewed . for example , gao found that gsa prepared pmps for 13 of the 18 projects reviewed . three of the remaining five projects were attached to larger projects that had pmps and gsa was unable to provide a pmp for the other two projects . however , gsa 's risk identification was sometimes inconsistent with unforeseen conditions that were actually experienced . for example , on 11 of the projects , gsa did not identify risks that later materialized during the project . the standards for internal control in the federal government state that agencies should comprehensively identify risks using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods . gsa officials told gao that contract change orders are used to document unforeseen conditions that result in a change to the contract , but that these change orders are not analyzed to identify what role these conditions represent on projects or their causes or impacts . as shown in the projects gao reviewed , unforeseen conditions can delay schedules and increase project costs — in some cases in the millions of dollars . analyzing project information such as change orders would allow gsa to better know what role unforeseen conditions play in repair and alteration projects and the magnitude of this risk . gao recommends that gsa develop and implement a plan for analyzing information it collects to identify the role of unforeseen conditions in repair and alteration projects and the specific causes and impacts of these conditions . gsa agreed with the recommendation and the agency stated it will develop a plan to address it .
as baby boomers move into retirement each year , the census bureau projects that the age 65-and - older population will grow over 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. several issues call attention to the retirement security of this sizeable population , including a shift in private - sector pension coverage from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans , longer life expectancies , and uncertainty about social security 's long - term financial condition . in light of these developments , gao was asked to review the financial status of workers approaching retirement and of current retirees . gao examined 1 ) the financial resources of workers approaching retirement and retirees and 2 ) the evidence that studies and surveys provide about retirement security for workers and retirees . to conduct this work , gao analyzed household financial data , including retirement savings and income , from the federal reserve 's 2013 survey of consumer finances , reviewed academic studies of retirement savings adequacy , analyzed retirement - related questions from surveys , and interviewed retirement experts about retirement readiness . gao found the data to be reliable for the purposes used in this report . gao received technical comments on a draft of this report from the department of labor and incorporated them as appropriate . many retirees and workers approaching retirement have limited financial resources . about half of households age 55 and older have no retirement savings ( such as in a 401 plan or an ira ) . according to gao 's analysis of the 2013 survey of consumer finances , many older households without retirement savings have few other resources , such as a defined benefit ( db ) plan or nonretirement savings , to draw on in retirement ( see figure below ) . for example , among households age 55 and older , about 29 percent have neither retirement savings nor a db plan , which typically provides a monthly payment for life . households that have retirement savings generally have other resources to draw on , such as non - retirement savings and db plans . among those with some retirement savings , the median amount of those savings is about $ 104,000 for households age 55-64 and $ 148,000 for households age 65-74 , equivalent to an inflation - protected annuity of $ 310 and $ 649 per month , respectively . social security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older . studies and surveys gao reviewed provide mixed evidence about the adequacy of retirement savings . studies range widely in their conclusions about the degree to which americans are likely to maintain their pre - retirement standard of living in retirement , largely because of different assumptions about how much income this goal requires . the studies generally found about one - third to two - thirds of workers are at risk of falling short of this target . in surveys , compared to current retirees , workers age 55 and older expect to retire later and a higher percentage plan to work during retirement . however , one survey found that about half of retirees said they retired earlier than planned due to health problems , changes at their workplace , or other factors , suggesting that many workers may be overestimating their future retirement income and savings . surveys have also found that people age 55-64 are less confident about their finances in retirement than those who are age 65 or older .
irs relies extensively on it systems to annually collect more than $ 2 trillion in taxes , distribute more than $ 300 billion in refunds , and carry out its mission of providing service to america 's taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations . for fiscal year 2014 , irs expected to spend about $ 2.4 billion on it . given the size and significance of irs 's it investments and the challenges inherent in successfully delivering these complex it systems , it is important that congress be provided reliable cost , schedule , and scope information to assist with its oversight responsibilities . accordingly , gao 's objectives were to evaluate irs 's efforts to address prior gao recommendations for improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope information ; summarize the reported cost , schedule , and performance of irs 's major it investments ; and assess the status and plans of selected investments . to do so , gao analyzed quarterly reports and reviewed information on cost and schedule from october 2013 to september 2014 , interviewed program officials , and analyzed documentation for selected investments . the internal revenue service ( irs ) has made limited progress in improving the reliability and reporting of cost , schedule , and scope performance information – the agency has partially implemented two of gao 's five prior recommendations , but not yet addressed the remaining three ( see table ) . irs 's implementation of these recommendations is critical in ensuring that congress receives the reliable information it needs for effective oversight and decision making . key : ● fully — the agency provided evidence that it fully addressed the recommendation . ◐ partially — the agency provided evidence that it has addressed the recommendation to some extent . ◌ not addressed — the agency did not provide any evidence that it addressed the recommendation . most of irs 's major information technology ( it ) investments were reported as meeting cost and schedule goals . specifically , 11 of 17 investments were reportedly within 10 percent of cost estimates , and 13 were within 10 percent of schedule estimates between october 2013 and september 2014. in addition , the agency reported “ green ” ratings for investments instead of their previous “ yellow ” ratings for chief technology officer summary - level risk assessments . it is important to note that these ratings are not provided for 6 investments for which irs provides detailed reporting to congress . providing summary - level risk ratings for all major investments would improve the visibility into changes in investment risk , and provide congress with the information to more easily determine the investments requiring greater attention . selected investments experienced variances from initial cost , schedule , and scope plans that were not transparent in congressional reporting because irs has yet to address gao 's prior recommendations . specifically , the return review program has so far exceeded planned costs by $ 86.5 million and has yet to deliver functionality that was scheduled for september 2012 , and a key phase of customer account data engine 2 was developed 10 months late and at $ 183.6 million more than planned . however , none of these variances were clearly identified in congressional reporting . in addition , the consolidated reports on the status of testing for the affordable care act administration investment are not comprehensive , making it difficult to determine whether all required testing is being performed . gao is making three recommendations to improve the reliability and reporting of investment performance information and management of selected investments . irs agreed with two recommendations but disagreed with the third related to the reporting of test results . gao continues to believe it is still warranted .
whistleblowers help safeguard the federal government against waste , fraud , and abuse — however , they also risk retaliation by their employers . for example , in 2002 , a former fbi agent alleged she suffered retaliation after disclosing that colleagues had stolen items from ground zero following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . doj found in her favor over 10 years after she reported the retaliation . gao was asked to review doj 's process for handling such complaints . gao examined the time doj took to resolve fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints , the extent to which doj took steps to resolve complaints more quickly , and the extent to which doj complied with certain regulatory reporting requirements . gao reviewed all doj case files for fbi whistleblower retaliation complaints doj closed from 2009 to 2013 , and interviewed whistleblower attorneys , advocates , and government officials about the complaint process . the interview results are not generalizable . the department of justice ( doj ) closed 44 of the 62 ( 71 percent ) federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) whistleblower retaliation complaints we reviewed within 1 year , took up to 4 years to close 15 complaints , and took up to 10.6 years to close the remaining 3. doj terminated 55 of the 62 complaints ( 89 percent ) and awarded corrective action for 3 . ( complainants withdrew 4 . ) . we found that doj terminated many ( 48 of 62 ) complaints we reviewed because they did not meet certain regulatory requirements . for example , doj terminated at least 17 complaints in part because a disclosure was made to someone in the employee 's chain of command or management , such as a supervisor , who was not one of the nine high - level fbi or doj entities designated under doj regulations to receive such disclosures . unlike employees of other executive branch agencies , fbi employees do not have a process to seek corrective action if they experience retaliation based on a disclosure of wrongdoing to their supervisors or others in their chain of command who are not designated officials . this difference is due , in part , to doj 's decisions about how to implement the statute governing fbi whistleblowers . in 2014 , doj reviewed its regulations and , in an effort to balance competing priorities , recommended adding more senior officials in fbi field offices to the list of designated entities , but did not recommend adding all supervisors . doj cited a number of reasons for this , including concerns about the additional resources and time needed to handle a possible increase in complaints if doj added supervisors . however , doj is already taking other steps to improve the efficiency of the complaint process . more importantly , dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee 's supervisor or someone in that person 's chain of command leaves some fbi whistleblowers — such as the 17 complainants we identified — without protection from retaliation . by dismissing potentially legitimate complaints in this way , doj could deny some whistleblowers access to recourse , permit retaliatory activity to go uninvestigated , and create a chilling effect for future whistleblowers . we also found that doj and fbi guidance is not always clear that fbi employees reporting alleged wrongdoing to a supervisor or someone in their chain of command may not be a protected disclosure . ensuring that guidance always clearly explains to whom an fbi employee can report wrongdoing will help fbi whistleblowers ensure that they are fully protected from retaliation . doj took from 2 to 10.6 years to resolve the 4 complaints we reviewed that doj adjudicated , and doj did not provide complainants with estimates of when to expect doj decisions throughout the complaint process . providing such estimates would enhance accountability to complainants and provide additional assurance about doj management 's commitment to improve efficiency . further , doj offices responsible for investigating whistleblower retaliation complaints have not consistently complied with certain regulatory requirements , such as obtaining complainants ' approvals for extensions of time . one investigating office does not track investigators ' compliance with specific regulatory requirements and does not have a formal oversight mechanism to do so . effectively monitoring investigators ' compliance with such requirements could help assure complainants that their cases are making progress and that they have the information they need to determine next steps for their complaints . congress may wish to consider whether fbi whistleblowers should have means to seek corrective action if retaliated against for disclosures to supervisors , among others . further , gao recommends that doj clarify guidance to clearly convey to whom employees can make protected disclosures , provide complainants with estimated complaint decision timeframes , and develop an oversight mechanism to monitor regulatory compliance . doj and the office of the inspector general concurred with gao 's recommendations .
the mining law of 1872 encouraged development of the west by opening up federal land to exploration , extraction , and development of hardrock minerals such as gold , silver , and copper . because mining creates the potential for serious health , safety , and environmental hazards , blm and the forest service have processes for reviewing mine plans submitted by operators to help prevent and mitigate these hazards . a mine plan details the proposed mine 's operations , such as the methods for mining and reclaiming the site once operations have concluded . gao was asked to assess the mine plan review process . this report examines the number of mine plans blm and the forest service approved from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , among other things , and challenges that have affected the length of time for blm and the forest service to complete the review process , as well as actions these agencies have taken to address these challenges . gao obtained and analyzed mine plan review data from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , and interviewed agency officials in 23 offices , representing the 12 western states where hardrock mining occurs . the results are not generalizable to all locations conducting mine plan reviews . from fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , the department of the interior 's bureau of land management ( blm ) and the department of agriculture 's forest service approved 68 mine plans of operation . the length of time it took the agencies to approve the mine plans ranged from about 1 month to over 11 years , and averaged approximately 2 years . of the 68 approved mine plans , 13 had not begun operations as of november 2015. agency officials attribute this to difficulties mine operators may face , such as obtaining other required federal and state permits . blm and forest service officials gao interviewed said they experienced 13 key challenges that affected the length of time to review hardrock mine plans . the two most frequently cited were the low quality of information operators provided in their mine plans and the agencies ' limited allocation of resources for their hardrock mining programs . to address the low quality of information in mine plans , some blm and forest service officials held pre - mine plan submittal meetings with operators . however , officials do not always do so because blm does not have specific guidance on how to implement these meetings , and forest service does not have any guidance instructing them to do so . federal standards for internal control state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals . without taking further actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions , blm and the forest service may be missing opportunities to help expedite the review process . to address the limited allocation of resources , blm and forest service officials are leveraging existing resources by collaborating with other agencies , among other actions , but neither agency has fully used its authority to collect fees for conducting mine plan reviews as authorized by law . in addition , forest service is not authorized to retain these fees , as blm is , but has not proposed the legislative changes that would allow it to retain fees , as is suggested by office of management and budget guidance . blm officials said the agency has not prioritized cost recovery for certain types of environmental analyses , and forest service officials were unaware of these authorities . by not using these authorities , blm and forest service may be missing opportunities to expedite the mine plan review process . gao recommends , among other things , that the agencies take actions to improve the quality of mine plan submissions and seek additional recovery of the costs associated with conducting mine plan reviews . the agencies generally concurred with these recommendations .
the may 2014 national climate assessment indicates that the frequency and / or severity of many weather and climate extremes may increase with climate change . public and private property insurers can bear a large portion of the financial impact of such weather - related losses . in the public sector , federal insurance includes nfip , managed by fema , and the federal crop insurance program , managed by rma . gao was asked to review climate change 's effect on insurers . this report examines how federal and private exposure to losses has changed since gao 's 2007 report on the subject , and what is known about how climate change may affect insured and uninsured losses ; how public insurers are preparing for climate change , and any challenges they face ; and how private insurers are preparing for climate change and any challenges they face . gao reviewed 20 studies , examined federal and private sector data on exposure to losses from 2000 to 2013 , reviewed agency documents , and interviewed agency officials and a nonprobability sample of eight insurers and reinsurers . since gao 's 2007 report on flood and crop insurance , exposure growth in hazard - prone areas has increased losses , and climate change and related increases in extreme weather events may further increase such losses in coming decades . scientific and industry studies gao reviewed generally found that increasing growth and property values in hazard - prone areas have increased losses to date and that climate change may compound this effect . from 2007 through 2013 , data from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and the risk management agency ( rma ) show that exposure to potential losses for insured property grew from $ 1.3 trillion to $ 1.4 trillion ( 8 percent ) . according to industry data , private sector exposure to such loss grew from $ 60.7 trillion to $ 66.5 trillion ( 10 percent ) from 2007 through 2012. federal exposure to uninsured loss also increased by 46 percent over this period , based on a 2013 analysis by the congressional research service . according to the studies gao reviewed , climate change may substantially increase losses by 2040 and increase losses from about 50 to 100 percent by 2100. fema and rma have taken some steps to better understand and prepare for climate change 's potential effects under the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) and the federal crop insurance program by , for example , commissioning climate change studies . however , both agencies face challenges that may limit their ability to minimize long - term federal exposure to climate change . for example , because of the short - term nature of insurance ( i.e . , contracts typically estimate and communicate risk of property losses for the 1-year term of a policy ) , fema and rma face a challenge in encouraging policyholders to reduce their long - term exposure to climate change risks . specifically , flood insurance policyholders who build to nfip standards — which are based on current flood risk and not on long - term risks — may unintentionally increase their vulnerability to climate change as sea - level rises . also , while federal law prohibits crop insurance from covering losses due to a farmers ' failure to follow good farming practices , such as various irrigation methods , some of these practices maintain short - term production but may inadvertently increase the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change through increased erosion and inefficient water use . a recent executive order directed federal agencies to reform policies that may , perhaps unintentionally , increase the vulnerability of economic sectors or communities to climate change . without encouraging nfip and crop insurance policyholders to adopt building and agricultural practices that reduce long - term risk , fema and rma may send policyholders signals that unintentionally encourage their vulnerability to climate change , counter to the direction of the executive order , which could exacerbate federal exposure to losses . many private insurers and reinsurers have taken steps since 2007 to better understand and prepare for climate change effects and related challenges , including participating in industry climate change surveys , and issuing reports that identify and assess climate change risks and trends in weather - related losses . according to industry officials , they can manage their exposure to climate change and related challenges through risk - based premiums , reinsurance , and other practices , although estimating weather - related risks still includes elements of uncertainty . gao recommends that fema and rma take additional steps to encourage flood and crop insurance policyholders to adopt building and agricultural practices that reduce long - term risk and federal exposure to losses . fema agreed with gao 's recommendation , and rma neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendation .
the federal government is one of the world 's largest and most complex entities ; about $ 3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2014 funded a broad array of programs and operations . gao maintains a program to focus attention on government operations that it identifies as high risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy , efficiency , or effectiveness challenges . since 1990 , more than one - third of the areas previously designated as high risk have been removed from the list because sufficient progress was made in addressing the problems identified . the five criteria for removal are : leadership commitment , agency capacity , an action plan , monitoring efforts , and demonstrated progress . this biennial update describes the status of high - risk areas listed in 2013 and identifies new high - risk areas needing attention by congress and the executive branch . solutions to high - risk problems offer the potential to save billions of dollars , improve service to the public , and strengthen government performance and accountability . solid , steady progress has been made in the vast majority of the high - risk areas . eighteen of the 30 areas on the 2013 list at least partially met all of the criteria for removal from the high risk list . of those , 11 met at least one of the criteria for removal and partially met all others . sufficient progress was made to narrow the scope of two high - risk issues — protecting public health through enhanced oversight of medical products and dod contract management . overall , progress has been possible through the concerted actions of congress , leadership and staff in agencies , and the office of management and budget . this year gao is adding 2 areas , bringing the total to 32. managing risks and improving veterans affairs ( va ) health care . gao has reported since 2000 about va facilities ' failure to provide timely health care . in some cases , these delays or va 's failure to provide care at all have reportedly harmed veterans . although va has taken actions to address some gao recommendations , more than 100 of gao 's recommendations have not been fully addressed , including recommendations related to the following areas : ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes , inadequate oversight and accountability , information technology challenges , inadequate training for va staff , and unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . the recently enacted veterans access , choice , and accountability act included provisions to help va address systemic weaknesses . va must effectively implement the act . improving the management of information technology ( it ) acquisitions and operations . congress has passed legislation and the administration has undertaken numerous initiatives to better manage it investments . nonetheless , federal it investments too frequently fail to be completed or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to mission - related outcomes . gao has found that the federal government spent billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing it investments which often suffered from ineffective management , such as project planning , requirements definition , and program oversight and governance . over the past 5 years , gao made more than 730 recommendations ; however , only about 23 percent had been fully implemented as of january 2015. gao is also expanding two areas due to evolving high - risk issues . enforcement of tax laws . this area is expanded to include irs 's efforts to address tax refund fraud due to identify theft . irs estimates it paid out $ 5.8 billion ( the exact number is uncertain ) in fraudulent refunds in tax year 2013 due to identity theft . this occurs when a thief files a fraudulent return using a legitimate taxpayer 's identifying information and claims a refund . ensuring the security of federal information systems and cyber critical infrastructure and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information ( pii ) . this risk area is expanded because of the challenges to ensuring the privacy of personally identifiable information posed by advances in technology . these advances have allowed both government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of pii more effectively . the number of reported security incidents involving pii at federal agencies has increased dramatically in recent years . this report contains gao 's views on progress made and what remains to be done to bring about lasting solutions for each high - risk area . perseverance by the executive branch in implementing gao 's recommended solutions and continued oversight and action by congress are essential to achieving greater progress .
over the last few years , billions of dollars have been collected in fines , penalties , and forfeitures assessed against financial institutions for violations of requirements related to financial crimes . these requirements are significant tools that help the federal government detect and disrupt money laundering , terrorist financing , bribery , corruption , and violations of u.s. sanctions programs . gao was asked to review the collection and use of these fines , penalties , and forfeitures assessed against financial institutions for violations of these requirements — specifically , bsa / aml , fcpa , and u.s. sanctions programs requirements . this report describes the amounts collected by the federal government for these violations , and the process for collecting these funds and the purposes for which they are used . gao analyzed agency data , reviewed documentation on agency collection processes and on authorized uses of the funds in which collections are deposited , and reviewed relevant laws . gao also interviewed officials from treasury ( including the financial crimes enforcement network and the office of foreign assets control ) , securities and exchange commission , department of justice , and the federal banking regulators . gao is not making recommendations in this report . since 2009 , financial institutions have been assessed about $ 12 billion in fines , penalties , and forfeitures for violations of bank secrecy act / anti - money - laundering regulations ( bsa / aml ) , foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 ( fcpa ) , and u.s. sanctions programs requirements by the federal government . specifically , gao found that from january 2009 to december 2015 , federal agencies assessed about $ 5.2 billion for bsa / aml violations , $ 27 million for fcpa violations , and about $ 6.8 billion for violations of u.s. sanctions program requirements . of the $ 12 billion , federal agencies have collected all of these assessments , except for about $ 100 million . collections of fines , penalties , and forfeitures from financial institutions for violations of bank secrecy act / anti - money laundering , foreign corrupt practices act , and u.s. sanctions programs requirements , assessed in january 2009 – december 2015 agencies have processes for collecting payments for violations of bsa / aml , fcpa , and u.s. sanctions programs requirements and these collections can be used to support general government and law enforcement activities and provide payments to crime victims . components within the department of the treasury ( treasury ) and financial regulators are responsible for initially collecting penalty payments , verifying that the correct amount has been paid , and then depositing the funds into treasury 's general fund accounts , after which the funds are available for appropriation and use for general support of the government . of the approximately $ 11.9 billion collected , about $ 2.7 billion was deposited into treasury general fund accounts . the bsa and u.s. sanctions - related criminal cases gao identified since 2009 resulted in the forfeiture of almost $ 9 billion through the department of justice ( doj ) and treasury . of this amount , about $ 3.2 billion was deposited into doj 's asset forfeiture fund ( aff ) and $ 5.7 billion into the treasury forfeiture fund ( tff ) , of which $ 3.8 billion related to a sanctions case was rescinded in fiscal year 2016 appropriations legislation . funds from the aff and tff are primarily used for program expenses , payments to third parties , including the victims of the related crimes , and payments to law enforcement agencies that participated in the efforts resulting in forfeitures . as of december 2015 , doj and treasury had distributed about $ 1.1 billion to law enforcement agencies and about $ 2 billion was planned for distribution to crime victims . remaining funds from these cases are subject to general rescissions to the tff and aff or may be used for program or other law enforcement expenses .
in 2007 , gao reported weaknesses in nrc 's licensing program as gao investigators , after setting up fictitious companies , were able to obtain an nrc license and then alter it to obtain agreements to purchase devices containing , in aggregate , a dangerous quantity of radioactive materials . gao was asked to review and assess the steps nrc and agreement states have taken to strengthen their licensing processes . this report examines the steps nrc and agreement states have taken to ensure that radioactive materials licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations and licensees can obtain materials only in quantities allowed by their licenses ; and the results of covert vulnerability testing designed to test the effectiveness of these controls . gao reviewed relevant guidance documents , regulations , and analyses of orders , and interviewed nrc and state officials . gao also established three fictitious businesses and applied for a radioactive materials license for each . the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) and the 37 states it permits to grant licenses for radioactive materials — called agreement states — have taken several steps since 2007 to help ensure that licenses are granted only to legitimate organizations and that licensees can only obtain such materials in quantities allowed by their licenses . however , nrc and agreement states have not taken some measures to better control some dangerous quantities of radioactive materials . the international atomic energy agency established a system ranking quantities of certain radioactive materials into five categories based on their potential to harm human health , with , in descending order of danger , categories 1 , 2 , and 3 all considered dangerous . nrc developed revised guidance , screening criteria , and a checklist , among other things , and now directs nrc regions and agreement states to conduct prelicensing site visits — focusing on questions related to the applicant 's business operations , facility , radiation safety operations , and personnel qualifications for all unknown applicants . nrc , however , has not strengthened controls for all categories of radioactive material considered dangerous . unlike its process for applicants for category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive materials , for category 3 applicants nrc does not review specific security measures before a license is issued . nrc has also developed and deployed the national source tracking system ( nsts ) , the web - based licensing system ( wbl ) , and the license verification system to better control some materials . however , these systems focus on more dangerous category 1 and 2 quantities but not category 3 quantities . further , nrc does not specifically require that the validity of category 3 licenses be verified by the seller with nrc or the agreement states — creating risks that licenses could be counterfeited or that licensees could obtain radioactive materials in quantities greater than what is allowed by their licenses . gao 's covert testing of nrc requirements showed them to be effective in two out of our three cases ; in a third case , gao was able to obtain a license and secure commitments to purchase , by accumulating multiple category 3 quantities of materials , a category 2 quantity of a radioactive material considered attractive for use in a “ dirty bomb ” — which uses explosives to disperse radioactive material . to test nrc 's prelicensing processes , gao established three fictitious companies , leased vacant space for each company ( two in agreement states , one in an nrc state ) , and submitted an application to the appropriate agreement state or nrc office for a license to possess a category 3 source only slightly below the threshold for category 2. gao made no attempt to outfit the site to make it appear as if a legitimate business was operating there . in the two cases where gao was unable to obtain a license , the scrutiny provided by nrc or agreement state ( regulatory body ) officials during the prelicensing site visit led to the license not being granted . in the third case , the official from the regulatory body accepted gao 's assurances without scrutinizing key aspects of the fictitious business , which led to a license being obtained . nrc is currently taking corrective actions to provide training to nrc and agreement state officials to emphasize greater scrutiny in conducting prelicensing site visits . according to nrc officials , nrc and agreement state working groups are currently developing and evaluating enhancements to prelicensing guidance overall and license verification and transfer requirements for category 3 licenses . gao is making three recommendations to nrc , including that nrc take steps to include category 3 quantities of radioactive materials in nsts and wbl , and require that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials confirm the validity of licenses with regulators before selling or transferring these materials . gao provided a draft of this report to nrc for comment . nrc neither agreed nor disagreed with gao 's recommendations , but noted that the agency has formal evaluations underway considering all three recommendations .
nnsa is responsible for the nation 's nuclear security programs . these programs often include the design and construction of large projects to meet program needs . nnsa has a history of struggling to complete these and other projects and programs within cost estimates . senate report 112-73 mandated that gao report on nnsa 's cost estimating practices . this report examines : the extent to which doe and nnsa cost estimating requirements and guidance for projects and programs reflect best practices and the extent to which recent nnsa project and program reviews identified cost estimating weaknesses , and the extent to which the weaknesses can be attributed to not following best practices . gao reviewed doe and nnsa cost estimating practices and compared them to best practices , nnsa project and program reviews , and two programs selected among the largest and most complex nnsa programs . gao also interviewed doe and nnsa officials about requirements and guidance for cost estimates . the department of energy 's ( doe ) and its national nuclear security administration 's ( nnsa ) cost estimating requirements and guidance for projects and programs do not fully reflect best practices for developing cost estimates . in regard to cost estimating requirements for projects , doe 's 2010 project management order requires 1 of the 12 cost estimating best practices — conducting an independent cost estimate — for larger projects at certain stages of development . in contrast , doe 's 2011 cost estimating guide describes recommended approaches for using 10 of 12 best practices and partially contains information about the other 2. furthermore , because doe 's cost estimating guide was issued in 2011 — after doe 's 2010 project order was issued — it is not referenced in the order . as a result , users of the order may not be aware of the guide 's availability and may not benefit from its usefulness . in addition , although nnsa programs are required to follow doe 's budget formulation order and nnsa 's budget process , both of which require the development of cost estimates , neither the order nor the process requires the use of best practices in developing the estimates . in february 2014 , for example , gao found that nnsa 's lifecycle cost estimate for the plutonium disposition program did not follow all key steps for developing high - quality cost estimates , in part because the agency did not have a requirement to develop a life - cycle cost estimate . in the absence of a requirement for using best practices , it is unlikely that doe , nnsa , and their contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates . nnsa 's project and program reviews issued during fiscal year 2009 through march 2014 identified cost estimating weaknesses that can be attributed to not following best practices . doe and nnsa require independent project reviews , including reviews of cost estimates at certain stages of development and at the discretion of project managers . of the 50 reviews gao analyzed , 39 identified a total of 113 cost estimating weaknesses . gao determined that 71 of the 113 weaknesses — or about 63 percent — can be attributed to not following four best practices : determining the estimating structure , identifying ground rules and assumptions , conducting risk and uncertainty analysis , and documenting the estimate . neither doe nor nnsa , however , requires reviews of program cost estimates . of the three program reviews conducted during fiscal years 2009 to 2013 , two were of the b61 life extension program , which is to extend the operational life of this nuclear weapon . both reviews identified weaknesses in the cost estimates that can be attributed to not following three best practices : determining the estimating structure , defining program characteristics , and obtaining data . in addition , a february 2014 gao report on nnsa 's program to dispose of weapons - grade plutonium found that nnsa did not follow several cost estimating best practices , such as conducting an independent cost estimate and as a result , the program cost estimate was not reliable . while the program reviews and gao 's february 2014 report indicate weaknesses in a few program cost estimates , the extent of program cost estimate weaknesses is largely unknown because neither doe nor nnsa requires reviews of program cost estimates . without a requirement for conducting independent program reviews , nnsa does not have the internal control necessary for assessing program performance over time . gao recommends that doe , among other things , revise doe requirements and guidance that apply to projects and programs to ensure : the guidance is referenced in the project management order , doe and nnsa and its contractors develop cost estimates in accordance with the 12 best practices , its cost estimating guide fully reflects best practices , and independent reviews of programs are conducted periodically . doe agreed with the report and its recommendations .
the lda , as amended , requires lobbyists to file quarterly lobbying disclosure reports and semiannual reports on certain political contributions . the law also requires that gao annually audit lobbyists ' compliance with the lda . gao 's objectives were to determine the extent to which lobbyists can demonstrate compliance with disclosure requirements , identify challenges to compliance that lobbyists report , and describe the resources and authorities available to usao in its role in enforcing lda compliance , and the efforts usao has made to improve enforcement . this is gao 's ninth report under the mandate . gao reviewed a stratified random sample of 80 quarterly disclosure ld - 2 reports filed for the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the first and second quarters of 2015. gao also reviewed two random samples totaling 160 ld - 203 reports from year - end 2014 and midyear 2015. this methodology allowed gao to generalize to the population of 45,565 disclosure reports with $ 5,000 or more in lobbying activity , and 29,189 reports of federal political campaign contributions . gao met with officials from usao to obtain status updates on its efforts to focus resources on lobbyists who fail to comply . gao provided a draft of this report to the attorney general for review and comment . the department of justice provided updated data which gao incorporated into the report . gao is not making any recommendations in this report . for the 2015 reporting period , most lobbyists provided documentation for key elements of their disclosure reports to demonstrate compliance with the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 , as amended ( lda ) . for lobbying disclosure ( ld - 2 ) reports filed during the third and fourth quarter of 2014 and the first and second quarter of 2015 , gao estimates that 88 percent of lobbyists filed initial ld - 2 reports as required for new lobbying registrations ( lobbyists are required to file ld - 2 reports for the quarter in which they first register ) ; the figure below describes the filing process and enforcement ; 93 percent could provide documentation for income and expenses , but on 31 percent of these ld - 2 reports lobbyists did not correctly follow the guidance to round to the nearest $ 10,000 ; and 85 percent filed year - end ld - 203 2014 reports as required . these findings are generally consistent with prior reports gao issued for the 2010 through 2014 reporting periods . as in our other reports , some lobbyists were still unclear about the need to disclose certain covered positions , such as paid congressional internships or certain executive agency positions . gao estimates that 21 percent of all ld - 2 reports may not have properly disclosed one or more previously held covered positions . however , over the past several years of reporting on lobbying disclosure , gao has found that most lobbyists in the sample rated the terms associated with ld - 2 reporting as “ very easy ” or “ somewhat easy ” to understand with regard to meeting their reporting requirements . the u.s. attorney 's office for the district of columbia ( usao ) stated it has sufficient resources and authority to enforce compliance with the lda . usao continued its efforts to bring lobbyists into compliance by prompting them to file reports or applying civil penalties . in august 2015 , usao finalized a $ 125,000 settlement with the carmen group , the largest civil penalty settlement for noncompliance .
gao designated federal real - property management as a high - risk area in part because of physical security challenges at federal facilities . fps and gsa have joint responsibility for protecting federal facilities held or leased by gsa . fps has primary responsibility for the security and protection of buildings and their occupants , whereas gsa has primary responsibility for security fixtures , maintenance , and building access . in light of these challenges , gao was asked to review how the agencies ' collaboration reflects key practices to ensure facility security and the impact of their collaboration practices on day - to - day operations at the regional and facility level . gao analyzed pertinent laws and documents , compared fps 's and gsa 's collaboration efforts against gao 's selected key - collaboration practices , and interviewed agency officials at the headquarters and regional levels selected based on various factors . while the results from regions can not be generalized , they provided illustrative examples . the federal protective service ( fps ) , within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and the general services administration ( gsa ) have taken some steps to improve collaboration , such as drafting a joint strategy . while each agency has some individual policies for collaboration , the two agencies have made limited progress in agreeing on several key practices as described below . reaching agreement on these practices will help to enhance the agencies ' ability to protect federal facilities and to improve day - to - day operations at the regional level . as a result of not having key practices in place , regional officials said they were not aware of agreed upon collaborative policies and procedures to conduct day - to - day operations . gao found that this created inefficiencies and security risks . for example , fps officials told gao that gsa did not coordinate with them on new construction intended for law enforcement tenants , and as a result , it was not suitable for law enforcement use . gsa officials told gao that they did not have sufficient information from fps about security plans for upcoming events and , therefore , were not able to inform tenants of necessary security measures . gao recommends that fps and gsa take actions to improve their collaboration in several areas , including defining common outcomes , agreeing on roles and responsibilities , and communicating compatible policies and procedures . dhs specifically concurred with gao 's recommendations , and gsa agreed to work with fps to address the findings .
in fiscal year 2013 , hrsa awarded over $ 6 billion in grants , which accounted for over 80 percent of the agency 's appropriations . hrsa 's workforce — its staff and contractors — is responsible for monitoring the agency 's grantees to ensure they are financially sound , using federal funds appropriately , and in compliance with program requirements . in recent years , gao has reported on weaknesses in hrsa 's monitoring of certain grant programs and made recommendations for the agency to improve grantee monitoring . gao was asked to review hrsa 's oversight mechanisms for its grantee monitoring workforce . this report examines the extent to which hrsa has developed guidance for staff who monitor grantees ; the extent to which it implemented training for this staff ; hrsa 's oversight of its staff ; and its practices to ensure contractors who conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified and carry out their work as appropriate . gao reviewed hrsa training documentation and guidance related to grantee monitoring and interviewed hrsa officials . gao also reviewed the contracts that hrsa identified as including grantee monitoring activities in fiscal year 2013. in 2012 , the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) began systematically developing guidance for the key staff involved in grantee monitoring — project officers in its programmatic bureaus and grants management specialists and financial integrity staff in its office of federal assistance management ( ofam ) . specifically , hrsa issued the first agency - wide guidance written primarily for project officers in november 2012 and is in the process of developing new guidance and revising existing guidance for staff in ofam . additionally , hrsa required each of the bureaus to develop more detailed guidance for project officers by the end of 2012. to assist the bureaus in systematically developing this guidance , hrsa provided a template outlining the minimum components to be included in the documents . while all of hrsa 's bureaus developed guidance for their project officers , gao found that the bureaus ' guidance did not address all of the key components of grantee monitoring identified by hrsa , such as components related to conducting site visits . although hrsa conducted reviews of the bureaus ' guidance , these reviews were not sufficient to ensure that the guidance addressed all required grantee monitoring components . consequently , there is an increased possibility that project officers will not conduct , or document , all the monitoring activities required by hrsa , which puts the agency at risk for incomplete or insufficient grantee monitoring . since 2013 , hrsa has implemented agency - wide training programs for key staff responsible for conducting monitoring of grantees — a project officer certification program , which the majority of project officers have completed , and a career development program for grants management specialists . both programs include courses that cover material related to grantee monitoring . in addition to these training programs , the bureaus and ofam offer formal and informal training related to grantee monitoring , such as training on specific grant program requirements . hrsa has four main methods for overseeing its staff 's monitoring of grantees . according to hrsa officials , supervisors review information in , and reports from , hrsa 's online system for documenting grantee monitoring activities , such as staff 's assessments of grantee compliance ; regularly communicate with staff in one - on - one and other meetings ; and conduct annual performance appraisals to hold staff accountable for their monitoring responsibilities . additionally , hrsa has mechanisms in place to ensure that the contractors that conduct grantee monitoring activities are qualified , including reviewing staffing proposals prior to awarding the contract , requiring contractor staff to have specific qualifications , and requiring training for contractor staff . to oversee contractors ' work , hrsa staff regularly communicate with the contractors , review their deliverables , and obtain feedback from project officers and grantees on contractor performance . gao recommends that hrsa develop a process to ensure that the guidance developed by its bureaus addresses all of the key components of grantee monitoring as established by the agency . hhs agreed with gao 's recommendation and said hrsa has begun to take action to implement it .
weapons in the u.s. nuclear stockpile are aging . nnsa and dod undertake leps to refurbish or replace nuclear weapons ' aging components . in 2010 , they began an lep to consolidate four versions of a legacy nuclear weapon , the b61 bomb , into a bomb called the b61-12 ( see fig . ) . nnsa and dod have stated they must complete this lep by 2024 to uphold u.s. commitments to the north atlantic treaty organization . as of september 2015 , nnsa and dod estimated that the b61-12 lep would cost about $ 8.9 billion . senate report 113-44 included a provision for gao to periodically assess the status of the b61-12 lep . this report assesses nnsa 's management approach for the b61-12 lep and the extent to which nnsa and the air force are managing risks in the lep . gao reviewed project plans , schedules , management plans , and other documents and program data , and visited the two nnsa national laboratories — sandia and los alamos — that serve as the design agencies for the lep . the b61-12 life extension program 's ( lep ) managers have developed a management approach that officials from the department of energy 's ( doe ) national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) and the department of defense ( dod ) regard as improved over the management approach used for past leps , which experienced schedule delays and cost overruns . among other things , the b61-12 lep is the first lep to use earned value management , a tool that measures the planned versus actual value of work accomplished in a given period , which may help nnsa ensure that work progresses on budget and on schedule . it is also the first lep to integrate the schedules and cost estimates for activities at all participating nnsa sites . nnsa used this new approach to inform its first program execution guide for defense programs , issued in august 2014 , which applies to all nnsa defense programs . nnsa 's new management approach notwithstanding , the b61-12 lep faces ongoing management challenges in some areas , including staff shortfalls and an earned value management system that has yet to be tested . the new management approach may help the lep address these potential challenges , but it is too soon to determine whether this will be the case . to manage risks in the b61-12 lep , nnsa and the air force use a risk management database and integrated schedules to categorize risks and incorporate risk management steps in the schedules . according to nnsa and air force officials , some risks have already been managed in this manner . for example , nnsa estimates that making a needed material procurement in advance prevented a potential delay of more than a year and a potential cost increase of more than $ 2 million . remaining risks include the risk that components may fail in certain flight environments and risks related to testing of certain nonnuclear components . nnsa is also working to ensure future compatibility with the f - 35 aircraft . nnsa and air force officials said they will not know for several years whether steps planned to manage these risks are adequate . a constrained development and production schedule — which doe 's and dod 's nuclear weapons council characterized as having “ little , if any , margin left ” — complicates efforts to manage risks . factors constraining the schedule include the aging of components in current versions of the b61 , delays in starting the b61-12 lep because of a lengthy design study , the effects of sequestration , and the need to complete the b61-12 lep so that nnsa can begin other planned leps . gao will continue to monitor these issues as it assesses the lep in later stages . gao is making no new recommendations but discusses the status of prior gao recommendations in this report . in commenting on a draft of this report , doe generally agreed with gao 's findings and provided technical comments that were incorporated , as appropriate . dod provided technical comments that were also incorporated , as appropriate .
in 2010 , ppaca authorized the establishment of pcori as a federally funded , nonprofit corporation to improve the quality and relevance of cer . pcori , which began operation in 2010 , is required to identify research priorities , establish a research project agenda , fund research consistent with its research agenda , and disseminate research results , among other things . to fund pcori , ppaca established the patient - centered outcomes research trust fund , through which the institute is expected to receive an estimated $ 3.5 billion from fiscal years 2010 through 2019. ppaca mandated that gao review pcori 's activities by 2015 and 2018. this report examines the extent to which pcori established priorities and processes for funding and disseminating comparative clinical effectiveness research consistent with its legislative requirements ; the status of pcori 's efforts to fund comparative clinical effectiveness research ; and pcori 's plans , if any , to evaluate the effectiveness of its work . gao reviewed relevant legislative requirements and pcori documentation , including funding data , and interviewed pcori officials . gao also interviewed relevant stakeholders , including health policy experts and pcori contractors . pcori provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . the patient - centered outcomes research institute ( pcori ) has established priorities and processes for funding comparative clinical effectiveness research ( cer ) — which is research that evaluates and compares health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness , risks , and benefits of two or more medical treatments , services , or items such as health care interventions — and is developing dissemination plans , consistent with the legislative requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) . in 2012 , pcori established five broad research priorities : assessment of prevention , diagnosis , and treatment options ; improving health care systems ; researching communication and dissemination strategies ; comparing interventions to reduce health disparities ; and accelerating patient - centered outcomes research and methodological research . pcori also developed a research agenda to identify how each priority would be addressed . pcori has established a multi - step research funding process designed to assess and select contract applications for funding . funded contracts are monitored by pcori staff . per legislative requirement , pcori is developing a peer review assessment process to review final reports submitted by contract awardees and is in the process of developing a plan for the dissemination of funded research potentially beginning in 2015 , in coordination with the agency for healthcare research and quality . pcori has started awarding contracts for research and plans to award additional contracts through 2019. as of october 2014 , pcori has awarded 360 contracts to fund research projects , committing a total of $ 670.8 million to them . pcori expects to commit about $ 2.6 billion to research contracts , out of $ 3.5 billion in total estimated spending . approximately $ 106 million in commitments to date are for pcornet , a data research network aimed at improving the capacity for and speed of conducting cer . pcori officials stated that they expect to spend a total of $ 271 million on pcornet through fiscal year 2019. pcori officials stated that limited amounts of data will be available through pcornet for researchers to use after september 2015 with the amount of available data increasing over time . pcori has established an evaluation plan and is developing efforts to measure outcomes . pcori has developed initial plans for evaluating the institute 's efforts against its three strategic goals , which are to increase information , speed implementation , and influence research . to do so , pcori has developed primary outcome measures for assessing pcori 's progress related to these strategic goals . in its strategic plan , pcori notes that these are meant to be long - term measures because research typically requires several years to complete and additional years for the results to be disseminated and implemented . therefore , since 2013 , pcori has been using early and intermediate process and output measures — such as the number of people accessing or referencing pcori information — as a way to monitor its progress toward its strategic goals . pcori anticipates having some early results related to its primary outcome measures starting in 2017 after the first cer studies are completed and their findings released , although full evaluation of the results of these outcome measures will not be possible until around 2020 .
in may 2013 , a truck carrying an oversize load crashed into an interstate bridge in washington state causing it to collapse . this crash raised issues about oversize vehicles and public safety . dot develops regulations on vehicle size and weight , and states enforce these standards with some oversight from dot . states also issue their own regulations on vehicle size and weight and issue permits for oversize and overweight vehicles . the joint explanatory statement of the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 2014 required gao to review the role of federal and state agencies in overseeing oversize vehicles . this report discusses how dot regulates and provides oversight of oversize vehicles and how states regulate oversize vehicles . gao collected information from 50 states and the district of columbia about their permitting practices ; reviewed relevant federal legislation and dot regulations and documents ; and interviewed dot and state officials from a non - generalizable sample of 10 states , chosen based on a variety of considerations , including geographic diversity and types of permitting requirements . the department of transportation 's ( dot ) federal highway administration ( fhwa ) has established some federal vehicle size and weight requirements and oversees some state activities . based on current legislation , fhwa has established rules and regulations for vehicle width , truck trailer length , and vehicle weight standards for certain federal - aid highways aimed at protecting highways and bridges from damage while providing a safe and efficient highway network . fhwa does not , however , have the authority to establish a height requirement , a decision that goes back to the interstate system 's construction in the 1950 's , when height clearances already varied from state to state . fhwa also oversees states ' processes for enforcing these standards by reviewing states ' documentation of enforcement operations . however , fhwa has more limited involvement in individual states ' permitting processes and requirements , which the agency considers largely a state matter . for example , it does not provide technical assistance on permitting to states . state laws and regulations set varying size and weight limits and permitting requirements for vehicles that exceed these limits and that operate on highways and bridges . specifically , gao found that the vehicle size and weight limits set by state laws and regulations vary by state , although they are within the parameters of federal requirements . for example , states ' length standards vary between the minimum federal standard of 48 feet and 65 feet for a semitrailer . gao also found that permitting practices for oversize vehicles often vary by state . in some cases , states follow similar practices ; for example , most states make use of online permitting systems and escort vehicles that travel with an oversize or overweight vehicle . however , other permitting practices vary by state — such as states ' use of automated routing systems to provide a route for oversize vehicles . a national transportation safety board investigation reported that differences among states on the various aspects of truck permitting could be a safety concern . state officials gao interviewed did not always agree on the benefits of the various permitting practices , and some spoke of the need for more information on this topic . while fhwa is conducting some research on the potential effect of changes to truck size and weight limits and working with the trucking industry to update a best practices guide on escort vehicle operations , it has not studied permitting best practices across states due to lack of authority over state permitting . in gao 's prior work on improving agency performance , gao found that identifying best practices can help identify changes that might be needed to improve performance . by conducting this type of research , fhwa would be better positioned to help states make sound decisions to improve safety and protect infrastructure . gao recommends that dot conduct a study on states ' oversize - and overweight - permitting practices , including automated vehicle routing and escort driver certification , to identify areas of best practice and share the results with states . dot agreed with gao 's recommendation and provided clarifying comments , which gao incorporated .
gao has reported extensively on problems in cost , schedule , and performance for major defense acquisition programs . according to some acquisition reform advocates , expanding the role of the military service chiefs in the process to acquire weapon systems may improve acquisition outcomes . following a 2014 gao report on the service chiefs ' role in the acquisition chain of command , gao was asked to review further related issues and concerns the service chiefs have with the acquisition process and its outcomes . this report examines : the views of current and former military service chiefs on the acquisition process , and key problems or factors the service chiefs identified with the acquisition process and gao 's assessment of these issues . gao conducted interviews with 12 current and former military service chiefs and vice chiefs , and with other current and former dod leadership to discuss the acquisition process . gao also drew upon its extensive body of work on defense acquisitions and best practices . to assess key problems with the current process , gao reviewed program execution information on all 78 current major defense programs . most current and former military service chiefs and vice chiefs gao interviewed from the army , air force , navy , and marine corps collectively expressed dissatisfaction with acquisition program outcomes and believed that the department of defense 's ( dod ) requirements development and acquisition processes need to be better integrated . the service chiefs are largely responsible for developing the services ' requirements for weapon systems , while the service acquisition executives are responsible for overseeing programs to plan and develop systems . most service chiefs told gao they were concerned that after weapon system requirements are handed to the acquisition process , requirements are changed or added by the acquisition community ( sometimes referred to as “ creep ” ) , increasing the capabilities and cost of the system . some service chiefs stated that they are not always involved in the acquisition process and are frequently caught by surprise when cost , schedule , and performance problems emerge in programs . current and former chiefs agreed that the chiefs should be more involved in programs , but their views varied on how best to achieve this . gao analyzed requirements for all 78 major defense acquisition programs and found that creep — or growth — in the high - level requirements is rare . instead , it is after a program has formally started development that the myriad lower - level , technical requirements needed to complete a weapon system 's design are defined ( see figure ) . it is the definition of these requirements — most of which occurs after the service chiefs ' primary involvement — that leads to the realization that much more time and resources are needed to build the weapon system . the process of systems engineering translates high - level requirements , such as range , into specifics , like fuel tank size . gao has previously reported on the importance of conducting systems engineering early so that the consequences of high - level requirements can be confronted before a program starts . when gao presented its analysis of the problem to the service chiefs , they generally agreed with it . several noted that trade - offs informed by systems engineering must take place before programs start so that requirements are better defined and more realistic cost , schedule , and performance commitments can be made . gao recommends that dod ensure sufficient systems engineering is conducted to better define requirements and assess resource trade - offs before a program starts . dod concurred with the recommendations , citing recent policy changes . gao believes more focus is needed on implementing actions .
small businesses , including those that conduct business with dod , are vulnerable to cyber threats and may have fewer resources , such as robust cybersecurity systems , than larger businesses to counter cyber threats . the joint explanatory statement accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision that gao assess dod osbp 's outreach and education efforts to small businesses on cyber threats . this report addresses the extent to which dod osbp has integrated cybersecurity into its outreach and education efforts to defense small businesses . dod osbp 's mission includes providing small business policy advice to the office of the secretary of defense , and policy oversight to dod military department and component small business offices . to conduct this review , gao analyzed documentation and interviewed officials from dod osbp about its cybersecurity outreach and education efforts . gao also analyzed documentation and interviewed officials from nine organizations selected for their cybersecurity expertise to identify examples of cybersecurity outreach and education programs potentially available to defense small businesses . the department of defense ( dod ) office of small business programs ( osbp ) has explored some options , such as online training videos , to integrate cybersecurity into its existing efforts ; however , as of july 2015 , the office had not identified and disseminated cybersecurity resources in its outreach and education efforts to defense small businesses . while dod osbp is not required to educate small businesses on cybersecurity , dod osbp officials acknowledged that cybersecurity is an important and timely issue for small businesses — and therefore the office is considering incorporating cybersecurity into its existing outreach and education efforts . during the review , gao identified 15 existing federal cybersecurity resources that dod osbp could disseminate to defense small businesses . source : gao analysis of information from listed agencies . | gao - 15-777 while dod osbp officials recognized the importance of identifying and disseminating cybersecurity resources through outreach and education efforts to small businesses , they identified factors that had limited their progress in doing so . specifically , they were not aware of existing cybersecurity resources , they had leadership turnover in the office , and the office was focused on developing a training curriculum for professionals who work with small businesses . while gao recognizes that these factors could affect progress , federal government internal controls state that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with , and obtaining information from , external stakeholders who may have a significant impact on the agency 's achieving its goals . dod osbp officials agreed that identifying and disseminating information about existing cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses could help small businesses be more aware of cybersecurity practices and cyber threats . in addition , by identifying and disseminating this information , dod osbp could help small businesses to protect their networks , thereby supporting the 2015 dod cyber strategy goals of working with the private sector to help secure defense industrial base trade data and build layered cyber defenses . gao recommends that dod identify and disseminate cybersecurity resources to defense small businesses . dod concurred with the recommendation and agreed to implement training events and education programs .
the threat posed by an electromagnetic pulse ( emp ) or solar weather event could have a debilitating impact on the nation 's critical electrical infrastructure , as well as other key assets that depend on electricity . these events could lead to power outages over broad geographic areas for extended durations . addressing these risks requires collaboration among multiple government and industry stakeholders ; with dhs in the lead role for overall infrastructure protection efforts , working in coordination with doe . the emp commission , established by statute and comprised of subject matter experts , issued recommendations in 2008 addressing the preparation , protection and recovery of critical infrastructures against a possible emp attack . the majority of these recommendations were made to dhs and doe . this testimony is based on preliminary observations from gao 's ongoing review of dhs 's efforts to address electromagnetic threats . specifically , this testimony addresses the extent to which dhs has : taken action to address recommendations from the 2008 emp commission report and coordinated with other principal federal agencies , such as doe and industry stakeholders to mitigate risks to the electric grid from electromagnetic threats . gao reviewed emp commission recommendations and dhs program documents , and interviewed relevant stakeholders who provided insights on key issues and coordination activities with the federal government to address these threats . as of july 2015 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) reported taking several actions that could help address electromagnetic threats to the electric grid . gao 's preliminary analysis of dhs 's actions indicates that they generally fell under four categories : developing reports , identifying mitigation efforts , strategy development and planning , and conducting exercises . for example : impacts of severe space weather on the electric grid . this 2011 report evaluated how previous solar storms have affected electric grids , and identified potential cost - effective mitigation equipment available to protect these grids , among other topics . recx . in 2012 , dhs science & technology partnered with industry to develop a prototype transformer that could significantly reduce the time to transport , install , and energize a transformer to aid recovery from power outages associated with transformer failures from several months to less than one week . dhs reported its actions were not taken in response to the 2008 recommendations of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse attack ( emp commission ) . gao also recognizes that dhs does not have a statutory obligation to specifically address the recommendations , but implementation of them could help mitigate electromagnetic impacts to the electric grid , such as helping to assure the protection of high - value transmission assets . moreover , gao 's preliminary work suggests that dhs , in conjunction with the department of energy ( doe ) , has not fully addressed a key critical infrastructure protection responsibility — identification of clear internal agency roles and responsibilities related to addressing electromagnetic threats . for example , although dhs recognized one component as the lead for assessing solar weather risks , the component has not yet identified any specific roles related to collecting or analyzing risk information . dhs has also coordinated with federal and industry stakeholders to address some , but not all risks to the electrical grid since the emp commission issued its recommendations . gao preliminarily identified eight projects in which dhs coordinated with stakeholders to help protect the grid including developing plans to address long term power outages , participation in exercises , and research and development activities . although these are positive steps , gao 's preliminary work indicates that dhs has not effectively coordinated with stakeholders to identify critical assets or collect necessary risk information , among other responsibilities . gao will continue to assess the issues in this statement as it completes its work and will issue a report with the final results later this year .
the 2007-2009 financial crisis focused attention on weaknesses in the u.s. regulatory structure , including the lack of an agency or mechanism responsible for monitoring and addressing risks across the financial system . to address this weakness , the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act created fsoc to identify and address threats to financial stability . among other statutorily defined authorities , fsoc may designate nonbank financial companies for heightened supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system . fsoc consists of 10 voting members and 5 nonvoting members . the 10 voting members include 9 federal regulators and an independent insurance expert . in september 2012 , gao issued a report on fsoc 's challenges , efforts to establish management mechanisms , activities for supporting collaboration among its members and external stakeholders , and processes for issuing reports and rules . gao made nine recommendations to fsoc to improve the transparency and accountability of its decisionmaking , among other things . this testimony is based on gao 's september 2012 report ( gao - 12-886 ) . it discusses fsoc 's efforts to respond to gao 's 2012 recommendations . from june through september 2014 , gao obtained updated information from fsoc staff and reviewed documents related to gao 's recommendations . the financial stability oversight council 's ( fsoc ) has taken steps to address some of gao 's september 2012 recommendations , but additional efforts are needed . gao made nine recommendations to fsoc in three areas : emerging threats and risks identification , transparency and accountability , and collaboration and coordination . gao recommended , among other things , that fsoc : develop a systematic approach that includes collecting and sharing key financial risk indicators to help identify potential threats to financial stability ; develop a strategy to improve communications with the public ; keep detailed records of closed - door sessions ; create a framework for assessing the impact of its decisions to designate nonbanks for enhanced supervision ; develop policies to clarify when collaboration or coordination should occur ; adopt leading practices , such as joint strategies , for collaboration ; and clarify roles and responsibilities for monitoring threats to the financial system . fsoc still lacks a comprehensive , systematic approach to identify emerging threats to financial stability . in 2012 , gao reported that fsoc 's approach might not help identify new risks or threats that member agencies had not already identified . the office of financial research ( ofr ) has made some progress in developing data tools to support fsoc since the 2012 report , but gao 's observations of two of these tools suggest that one tool does not focus on risks to the financial system , while another remains in a prototype phase . fsoc has taken steps to improve its communication with the public but could do more to improve transparency and accountability . in may 2014 , fsoc approved a revised transparency policy , and fsoc staff said they had attempted to provide more information in the minutes of meetings . but fsoc staff said that they did not intend to keep detailed minutes because of the confidential information discussed . also , fsoc staff also said that the impact of designating nonbanks for enhanced supervision would be assessed as part of a mandated january 2016 study . however , fsoc has not begun to prepare for this study . gao has reported on the importance of advance planning for retrospective studies so that needed data are collected . fsoc has taken steps to improve collaboration and coordination among member agencies but does not plan to act on some of gao 's recommendations on coordination . in may 2014 , fsoc approved one formal mechanism that supported coordination — bylaws for the deputies committee of senior officials from member agencies that describe its role in coordinating fsoc activities . fsoc staff said they did not plan to clarify the roles and responsibilities of fsoc , ofr , and member agencies because the overlapping responsibilities for monitoring systemic risk had not been problematic . officials also said that fsoc would not adopt practices to coordinate rulemaking across member agencies , as it does not have the authority to direct independent agencies . gao maintains that action is needed as its past work has shown that the lack of clear roles and coordination can lead to duplication , confusion , and regulatory gaps .
wildland fires play an important ecological role on the landscape , but they cost billions each year , result in loss of life , and cause damage to homes and other structures . the forest service and interior are responsible for wildland fire management on federal lands , including acquiring firefighting assets such as large airtankers to assist in fire suppression activities . increased fire intensity has prompted efforts aimed at implementing more effective fire management strategies . understanding the effectiveness of these efforts takes on heightened importance given that the forest service and interior have obligated $ 8.3 billion to suppress wildland fires in fiscal years 2009 through 2014. this testimony is based on gao reports issued in september 2015 and august 2013. it focuses on how the federal wildland fire agencies assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs and forest service efforts to modernize the large airtanker fleet and challenges it faces in doing so . for the 2015 report , gao reviewed agency performance measures and other ways the agencies assess effectiveness . for the 2013 report , gao reviewed large airtanker planning and acquisition documents . gao also conducted selected updates by reviewing documentation and interviewing officials . as gao found in its september 2015 report , the department of agriculture 's forest service and the department of the interior assess the effectiveness of their wildland fire management programs in several ways , including through performance measures , evaluations of particular activities , and reviews of specific wildland fires . forest service and interior officials told gao their performance measures need to be improved and that they are working to do so . for example , in fiscal year 2014 , the forest service began developing a performance measure intended to reflect that , in some cases , allowing naturallyignited fires to burn can provide natural resource benefits at a lower cost and lower risk to personnel than fully suppressing the fire as quickly as possible . officials told gao they plan to finalize the measure and use it in 2017. in addition , forest service and interior have undertaken efforts to evaluate particular wildland fire management activities , such as efforts to reduce potentially hazardous vegetation that can fuel fires , known as fuel reduction , and assess the performance of firefighting aircraft . however , gao 's 2015 report found that the forest service and interior conducted reviews to assess their effectiveness in responding to wildland fire , but did not consistently follow agency policy which generally directs them to review each fire involving federal expenditures of $ 10 million or more . forest service and interior officials told gao that this policy overly emphasized the cost of wildland fire suppression rather than the effectiveness of their response to fires . however , the forest service and interior have not established specific criteria for selecting fires for review and conducting the reviews . for example forest service officials told gao the agency judgmentally selects incidents to review based on broad criteria such as complexity and national significance . by developing specific criteria , gao concluded that the agencies may enhance their ability to help ensure that their fire reviews provide useful information about the effectiveness of their wildland fire activities . in its august 2013 report , gao found that the forest service faced challenges in modernizing the government 's fleet of large airtankers — which had declined from 44 in 2002 to 8 in 2013 — but since that report the agency has increased the availability of such aircraft . gao found in 2013 that the forest service , which is responsible for contracting for large airtankers , planned to modernize the fleet by obtaining large airtankers from various sources over the near , medium , and long term , but that each component of that approach faced challenges , making the continued availability of such aircraft to meet fire suppression needs uncertain . for example , for the medium term , the forest service had awarded contracts for seven “ next - generation ” large airtankers , but as of august 2013 only one had completed necessary federal approval and certification processes . since that report , forest service officials told gao that the agency has increased the availability of large airtankers . specifically , as of november 2015 , the agency had contracted for 20 privately - owned large airtankers , and another 7 large airtankers are to be transferred to forest service ownership from the coast guard . gao recommended in september 2015 that the agencies develop specific criteria for reviewing wildland fires . the agencies generally agreed . gao is not making any new recommendations in this testimony .
epa formulates rules to protect the environment and public health . to enhance the quality and credibility of such rules , epa obtains advice and recommendations from the sab and casac — two federal advisory committees that review the scientific and technical basis for epa decision making . erddaa requires the sab to provide both the epa administrator and designated congressional committees with scientific advice as requested . amendments to the clean air act established casac to , among other things , provide advice to the administrator on naaqs . this testimony reflects gao 's preliminary observations from its ongoing review that examines the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional requests to the sab ensure compliance with erddaa and the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs . gao reviewed relevant federal regulations and agency documents , and interviewed epa , sab , and other relevant officials . gao is not making any recommendations in this testimony , but as it finalizes its work in this area , gao will consider making recommendations , as appropriate . the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) procedures for processing congressional requests for scientific advice from the science advisory board ( sab ) do not ensure compliance with the environmental research , development , and demonstration authorization act of 1978 ( erddaa ) because these procedures are incomplete . for example , they do not clearly outline how the epa administrator , the sab staff office , and others are to handle a congressional committee 's request . while the procedures reflect epa 's responsibility to exercise general management controls over the sab and all its federal advisory committees under the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) , including keeping such committees free from outside influence , they do not fully account for the specific access that designated congressional committees have to the sab under erddaa . for example , epa 's policy documents do not establish how epa will determine which questions would be taken up by the sab . epa officials told gao that , in responding to congressional requests , epa follows the same process that it would apply to internal requests for questions to the sab , including considering whether the questions are science or policy driven or are important to science and the agency . however , epa has not documented these criteria . under the federal standards of internal control , agencies are to clearly document internal controls . moreover , under erddaa , the sab is required to provide requested scientific advice to select committees . by clearly documenting how to process congressional requests received under erddaa , including which criteria to use , epa can provide reasonable assurance that its staff process responses consistently and in accordance with law . furthermore , epa 's charter states that , when scientific advice is requested by one of the committees specified in erddaa , the administrator will , when appropriate forward the sab 's advice to the requesting congressional committee . epa policy does not specify when it would be “ appropriate ” for the epa administrator to take this action . such specificity would be consistent with clearly documenting internal controls . gao will continue to monitor these issues and plans to issue a report with its final results in june 2015. the clean air scientific advisory committee ( casac ) has provided certain types of advice related to the review of national ambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) , but has not provided advice on adverse social , economic , or energy effects related to naaqs . under the clean air act , casac is to review air quality criteria and existing naaqs every 5 years and advise epa of any adverse public health , welfare , social , economic , or energy effects that may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of naaqs . an epa official stated that casac has carried out its role in reviewing the air quality criteria and the naaqs , but casac has never provided advice on adverse social , economic , or energy effects related to naaqs because epa has never asked casac to do so . in a june 2014 letter to the epa administrator , casac indicated it would review such effects at the agency 's request . according to a senior epa official , the agency has no plans to ask casac to provide advice on such adverse effects .
the navy expects to have invested at least $ 3 billion through fiscal year 2020 in the development of the uclass system , which includes air system , aircraft carrier , and control system and connectivity segments . it is expected to enhance the intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , targeting , and strike capabilities of the navy 's aircraft carrier fleet . in august 2013 , the navy awarded contracts worth $ 15 million each to four competing contractors to develop and deliver preliminary designs for the air system , which were assessed by the navy in may 2014. the next anticipated steps for the program will be to solicit proposals and award the contract for air system development . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 included a provision that gao review the status of the uclass acquisition program annually . this report assesses the current status of the program , and the extent to which the navy has the knowledge about resources it needs to develop the uclass system . gao applied best practice standards , analyzed program documentation , and interviewed department of defense ( dod ) and contractor officials . since our last review in september 2013 , the intended mission and required capabilities of the navy 's unmanned carrier - launched airborne surveillance and strike ( uclass ) system have come into question . ongoing debate about whether the primary role of the uclass system should be mainly surveillance with limited strike or mainly strike with limited surveillance has delayed the program , as shown in the figure . requirements emphasizing a strike role with limited surveillance could be more demanding and costly . a early operational capability is currently not anticipated before fiscal year 2022 and could occur as late as fiscal year 2023. the knowledge the navy has obtained about the resources needed to develop the uclass system may no longer be applicable depending on what requirements are finally chosen . gao 's prior best practices work has found that before initiating system development , a program should present an executable business case that demonstrates that it has a high level of knowledge and a match between requirements and available resources . if the final uclass requirements emphasize a strike role with limited surveillance , the navy will likely need to revisit its understanding of available resources in the areas of design knowledge , funding , and technologies before awarding an air system development contract . gao recommends that before committing significant resources the navy should ensure that it has an executable business case for uclass development that matches available resources to required capabilities . on behalf of dod , the navy generally agreed with the recommendation .
as of june 2016 , 24 percent of direct loan borrowers repaying their loans ( or 5.3 million borrowers ) were doing so in idr plans , compared to 10 percent in june 2013. education expects these plans to have costs to the government . gao was asked to review education 's idr plan budget estimates and estimation methodology . this report examines : current idr plan budget estimates and how those estimates have changed over time , and the extent to which education 's approach to estimating costs and quality control practices help ensure reliable estimates . gao analyzed published and unpublished budget data covering direct loans made from fiscal years 1995 through 2015 and estimated to be made in 2016 and 2017 ; analyzed and tested education 's computer code used to estimate idr plan costs ; reviewed documentation related to education 's estimation approach ; and interviewed officials at education and other federal agencies . for the fiscal year 2017 budget , the u.s. department of education ( education ) estimates that all federally issued direct loans in income - driven repayment ( idr ) plans will have government costs of $ 74 billion , higher than previous budget estimates . idr plans are designed to help ease student debt burden by setting loan payments as a percentage of borrower income , extending repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years , and forgiving remaining balances at the end of that period . while actual costs can not be known until borrowers repay their loans , gao found that current idr plan budget estimates are more than double what was originally expected for loans made in fiscal years 2009 through 2016 ( the only years for which original estimates are available ) . this growth is largely due to the rising volume of loans in idr plans . education 's approach to estimating idr plan costs and quality control practices do not ensure reliable budget estimates . weaknesses in this approach may cause costs to be over - or understated by billions of dollars . for instance : education assumes that borrowers ' incomes will not grow with inflation even though federal guidelines for estimating loan costs state that estimates should account for relevant economic factors . gao tested this assumption by incorporating inflation into income forecasts , and found that estimated costs fell by over $ 17 billion . education also assumes no borrowers will switch into or out of idr plans in the future despite participation growth that has led budget estimates to more than double from $ 25 to $ 53 billion for loans made in recent fiscal years . predicting plan switching would be advisable per federal guidance on estimating loan costs . education has begun developing a revised model with this capability , but this model is not complete and it is not yet clear when or how well it will reflect idr plan participation trends . insufficient quality controls contributed to issues gao identified . for instance : education tested only one assumption for reasonableness , and did so at the request of others , although such testing is recommended in federal guidance on estimating loan costs . without further model testing , education 's estimates may be based on unreasonable assumptions . due to growing idr plan popularity , improving education 's estimation approach is especially important . until that happens , idr plan budget estimates will remain in question , and congress 's ability to make informed decisions may be affected . gao is making six recommendations to education to improve the quality of its idr plan budget estimates . these include adjusting borrower income forecasts for inflation , completing planned model revisions and ensuring that they generate reasonable predictions of participation trends , and testing key assumptions . education generally agreed with gao 's recommendations and noted actions it would take to address them .
the patient protection and affordable care act required the establishment of health insurance exchanges — or marketplaces — to allow consumers to compare , select , and purchase health insurance plans . states can elect to establish a state - based marketplace , or cede this authority to cms to establish a federally facilitated marketplace . some states had difficulties with the rollout and operation of their marketplaces , and some states that struggled with it implementation are now using the federal marketplace it platform . gao was requested to review cms 's and states ' actions to implement the marketplaces . this report describes cms 's actions to assist states that have chosen to transition to a different marketplace it platform and identify costs and challenges those states incurred in making this transition ; assesses cms 's actions taken to assist selected states to ensure that the development and operations of marketplace it systems can be financially self - sustained ; and assesses cms 's steps to monitor the performance of the states ' marketplace it systems . gao reviewed documentation from cms and four states selected based on different types of marketplaces , federal grants provided , and enrollment numbers , and interviewed cms and the states ' officials . the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) has offered assistance through providing periodic oversight and issuing regulation and guidance to states transitioning from state - based marketplaces to the federally based marketplace it platform , including two states that gao reviewed — hawaii and oregon — that had made that transition . while cms provided these states with assistance , documented cms transition guidance was not finalized until after the two states had completed their transition . the two states incurred costs of approximately $ 84.3 million , collectively , to transition to the federal platform . the two states ' transition efforts included making changes to their medicaid systems , with these states mainly relying on medicaid matching funds from cms to do this . while the selected states successfully transitioned , they encountered challenges during their transitions , due to accelerated transition time frames , difficulties reassigning marketplace responsibilities , delays in receiving approvals from cms , and trouble accessing historical consumer data in previous vendor - developed marketplace it systems . cms took steps to assist hawaii and oregon , as well as two states that gao selected for review that operated state - based marketplaces , minnesota and new york , in developing plans for marketplace it system sustainability . cms assisted these four states by consulting with the states ' officials and providing oversight of their sustainability plans , financial audit reports , and risk assessments . however , cms did not fully ensure the states provided complete sustainability plans and financial audit reports . further , cms did not base its risk assessments on fully defined processes . these weaknesses limit cms 's oversight and assurance that it can be informed of the state marketplaces ' sustainability efforts . although cms established a process to monitor the performance of state - based marketplaces , cms did not consistently follow its processes . for example , cms did not ensure that the two selected states , minnesota and new york , had developed , updated , and followed their performance measurement plans . also , cms did not conduct reviews to analyze the operational performance of these states ' marketplace it systems against an established set of parameters . further , while cms collected it performance metrics from the two states , such as the number of electronic enrollments and website traffic volume , it did not link state metrics to goals or establish targets for performance . these weaknesses limit cms 's ability to determine if states ' marketplace systems are performing efficiently , effectively , and to provide early warnings of potential problems ( see table ) . gao recommends that cms take six actions : ensure that states provide complete sustainability plans ; complete financial audit reports ; fully define its risk assessment process ; complete updated performance measurement plans ; align metrics with goals ; and conduct operational analysis reviews . hhs concurred with two , partially concurred with two , and did not concur with two of gao 's recommendations , which gao continues to believe are valid .
doe had long planned to store defense and commercial nuclear waste in a single repository at yucca mountain , nevada , funded largely from commercial power fees . in 2010 , doe terminated this plan , and then considered developing separate defense and commercial repositories . this approach requires a presidential finding under the nwpa . in 2015 , doe provided information to the president supporting separate repositories and cited several benefits , including cost efficiencies . on the basis of this information , the president in 2015 reversed a 1985 presidential finding and determined that a separate repository for defense waste was required , setting doe down the path of developing separate repositories . taxpayers would likely fund a defense waste repository rather than industry fees . gao reviewed doe 's efforts to develop a separate defense waste repository . this report assesses the information on benefits doe provided to the president ; the reliability of doe 's cost and schedule estimates ; and doe 's efforts to site a defense hlw repository . gao reviewed doe documents and interviewed more than 50 experts . the information that the department of energy ( doe ) provided to the president about whether a separate defense waste repository was required did not quantify cited benefits , when possible , show how these benefits could be achieved , or show the risks if certain benefits could not be realized as planned . in the information provided to the president , doe stated that separate repositories for defense high - level waste ( hlw ) and commercial spent nuclear fuel ( snf ) would produce certain benefits . doe cited benefits in each area required by the nuclear waste policy act ( nwpa ) — cost efficiency , public acceptability , regulation , transportation , national security , and health and safety — in concluding that there is a strong basis for a defense hlw repository . federal guidance states that benefits must be quantified when possible , and that the risk that a benefit may not be realized as planned should be factored into the cost - benefit analysis . doe officials said their plan was still conceptual and the guidance did not yet apply . nevertheless , doe did not show that benefits outweighed costs in recommending to the president that the nation should depart from its longstanding nuclear waste strategy . doe 's preliminary cost and schedule estimates for the two - repository approach that it provided to the president are not reliable because the estimates do not meet industry best practices . doe 's cost estimates excluded major costs , such as site selection and site characterization costs that could add tens of billions of dollars . regarding its schedule estimates , doe did not provide information on how its schedules would be achieved . gao found that doe 's estimates leave little time for major activities and that doe 's schedule appears optimistic , given its past repository siting experiences . without reliable estimates that reflect best practices , doe provided information to the president that supported a decision that could commit the nation to expending undisclosed but significant future resources and to a time frame that appears optimistic . doe is planning to develop a process to obtain consent for an eventual repository site ; however , doe faces significant public opposition and certain prerequisites have not yet been established . these prerequisites include updated health and safety regulations , which are necessary for the public to consider as part of a consent - based siting process . without updated health and safety regulations , which establish radiation exposure limits , the public can not provide meaningful input into a consent - based siting process and local communities can not effectively be engaged in hosting potential repository sites . doe officials acknowledge that health and safety regulations — which were developed in the 1980s — need to be updated and revised for any future defense hlw or mostly commercial snf repository . revising such regulations is the responsibility of other federal agencies . experts and stakeholders told gao that updated health and safety regulations are a precondition for having discussions with the public and for screening potential sites . an internal project management requirement directs doe to perform key “ preconceptual ” planning activities to enhance front - end planning . in proceeding with siting activities without ensuring key prerequisites have been established , doe runs the risk of increasing public opposition and potentially wasting resources . gao recommends that doe assess benefits , costs , and schedule estimates , and reassess its decision to conduct site selection activities . doe agreed on the need for a more thorough assessment , but disagreed on the need to reassess site selection activities , citing benefits of its approach . gao continues to believe its recommendation is valid , as discussed in the report .
blm is responsible for managing oil and gas development on federal lands while mitigating related environmental impacts . blm seeks to do so , in part , by applying requirements to the leases and drilling permits it issues to operators . these requirements may include environmental mitigation practices outlined in blm 's best management practices policy . in some cases , operators may request exceptions to lease and permit requirements . gao was asked to examine blm 's efforts to mitigate environmental impacts from oil and gas development . this report examines the extent to which blm approved requests for exceptions to lease and permit requirements and how these decisions were made and documented , involved the public in the development of lease and permit requirements and in the approval of exception requests , and implemented and assessed the effectiveness of its best management practices policy . gao examined laws , regulations , and blm policies and documents ; surveyed and visited blm field offices ; and conducted interviews with blm officials and other stakeholders . the extent to which the bureau of land management ( blm ) approved requests for exceptions to oil and gas lease and permit requirements is unknown , primarily because blm 's process for considering these requests and documenting decisions varied across field offices . oil and gas operators may request exceptions to a permit requirement , such as prohibition of drilling in an area during times of the year when certain wildlife are present . blm may approve such a request — allowing the operator to continue to drill during a portion of the normally prohibited time — if , for instance , no wildlife are present . gao 's survey of 42 blm offices found that fewer than half tracked data on exception requests . additionally , gao found that the process for considering these requests and documenting decisions varied . blm does not have a policy requiring field offices to consistently track exception data or documented procedures specifying how requests should be considered and documented . because blm does not consistently track exception request data or have a consistent process for considering requests and clearly documenting decisions , blm may be unable to provide reasonable assurance that it is meeting its environmental responsibilities . blm has consistently involved the public in developing lease requirements and , to a lesser extent , permit requirements . for example , gao reviewed 35 lease sales that occurred from calendar years 2012 through 2015 at the six field offices visited and found that in all cases the field offices provided the public an opportunity to review and comment on lease parcels to be offered for sale . blm has not generally involved the public in the approval of exception requests . according to blm 's policy , public notification of an exception is not required unless granting it would result in a substantial modification or waiver of a lease requirement , which , according to blm officials , rarely occurs . blm has generally implemented its best management practices policy by including key practices as permit requirements , but it has not consistently documented inspections or used inspection data to assess the policy 's effectiveness . the policy identifies four key practices that should be considered for inclusion as permit requirements in nearly all circumstances : painting facilities to blend with the environment , constructing roads to certain blm standards , implementing interim reclamation , and completing final reclamation . during file reviews at six blm field offices , gao found that at least one of the four key practices was included as a permit requirement in almost all of the 109 files reviewed . however , in reviewing documentation of inspections , gao found that documents were not consistent and not always sufficient to determine whether blm had verified key practices . gao further found that blm generally does not use data collected from inspections to assess the effectiveness of permit requirements in mitigating environmental impacts . blm does not have guidance specifying how inspections should be documented and how inspection data should be used . without sufficiently detailed documentation of inspections and effective use of data from inspections , blm is unable to fully assess the effectiveness of its best management practices policy to mitigate environmental impacts . gao is making six recommendations , including that blm develop a policy for tracking and documenting exceptions . interior generally concurred with gao 's recommendations .
dense vegetation , drought , and other factors have resulted in more severe wildland fires in recent years . at the same time , development in and around wildlands continues to increase , with some communities experiencing devastating effects from wildland fire . to reduce risk to communities , federal agencies and nonfederal stakeholders can collaborate in various ways . gao was asked to review collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities . this report examines federal officials ' and stakeholders ' views on factors that affect federal - nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and actions that could improve their ability to reduce risk to communities . gao reviewed laws and documents about collaboration on wildland fire management ; compared agency efforts with guidance ; and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 10 federal land management units selected based on wildland fire potential , geographic diversity , and other factors . gao also interviewed stakeholders including community members near the selected units and representatives of nonfederal entities involved in fire risk - reduction efforts . officials gao interviewed from the five federal agencies responsible for wildland fire management — the forest service within the department of agriculture and the bureau of indian affairs , bureau of land management , fish and wildlife service , and national park service within the department of the interior — and nonfederal stakeholders , including state and local officials , homeowners , and representatives of nongovernmental organizations , identified several factors as affecting federal - nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities . in some cases these factors were cited as enhancing collaboration , while in other cases they were cited as hindering it . among the factors identified were federal authorities , agency initiatives , joint community - level planning , and others . for example , several officials and stakeholders cited laws such as the good neighbor authority and tribal forest protection act of 2004 as enhancing collaboration because they provide federal and nonfederal entities the authority to work across jurisdictions on projects to reduce risk . in addition , several officials and stakeholders cited the 2014 national cohesive wildland fire management strategy ( cohesive strategy ) as helpful for collaboration because it emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies and includes comprehensive fire management goals . in contrast , some officials and stakeholders said collaboration on certain types of projects was hindered by the difficulty in sharing project costs between federal and nonfederal entities . federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified several actions they said could improve federal agencies ' and nonfederal entities ' ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities . among the actions cited was improving the implementation of the cohesive strategy . some agency officials and stakeholders noted the importance of increasing accountability for implementing the cohesive strategy , such as through the use of performance measures . the strategy states that its success depends in part on monitoring and accountability , and calls for national outcome measures . this is consistent with previous gao findings regarding national strategies . however , gao found that the wildland fire leadership council ( wflc ) — the interagency body charged with overseeing and implementing the cohesive strategy and which includes the forest service and interior as members — has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the cohesive strategy . in 2013 , wflc proposed several measures but concluded that implementing them could place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners . in 2016 , however , wflc reported that recent research findings could help quantify the strategy 's effects over time . by working with wflc to develop such measures , the forest service and interior , together with federal and nonfederal partners , could better assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the cohesive strategy . federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified actions that , while not necessarily within the federal agencies ' control , could be taken to reduce wildland fire risk to communities . for example , these actions include adopting state laws that require property owners to take risk - reducing actions such as using fire - resistant building materials or reducing vegetation around their homes . some states have adopted laws to promote such actions . gao recommends that the forest service and interior work with wflc to develop measures to assess progress toward achieving the cohesive strategy 's goals . the forest service agreed with gao 's recommendation , while interior did not . gao believes the recommendation is valid , as discussed in the report .
in fiscal year 2014 , medicare processed 1.2 billion ffs claims submitted by providers on behalf of beneficiaries . when medicare denies or reduces payment for a claim or a portion of a claim , providers , beneficiaries , and others may appeal these decisions through medicare 's appeals process . in recent years there have been increases in the number of filed and backlogged appeals ( i.e . , pending appeals that remain undecided after statutory time frames ) . gao was asked to examine levels 1 through 4 of medicare 's appeals process . this report examines trends in appeals for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 , data hhs uses to monitor the appeals process , and hhs efforts to reduce the number of appeals filed and backlogged . gao analyzed data from the three data systems used to monitor appeals , reviewed relevant hhs agency documentation and policies , federal internal control standards , and interviewed hhs agency officials and others . the appeals process for medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) claims consists of four administrative levels of review within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and a fifth level in which appeals are reviewed by federal courts . appeals are generally reviewed by each level sequentially , as appellants may appeal a decision to the next level depending on the prior outcome . under the administrative process , separate appeals bodies review appeals and issue decisions under time limits established by law , which can vary by level . from fiscal years 2010 and 2014 , the total number of filed appeals at levels 1 through 4 of medicare 's ffs appeals process increased significantly but varied by level . level 3 experienced the largest rate of increase in appeals — from 41,733 to 432,534 appeals ( 936 percent ) — during this period . a significant portion of the increase was driven by appeals of hospital and other inpatient stays , which increased from 12,938 to 275,791 appeals ( over 2,000 percent ) at level 3. hhs attributed the growth in appeals to its increased program integrity efforts and a greater propensity of providers to appeal claims , among other things . gao also found that the number of appeal decisions issued after statutory time frames generally increased during this time , with the largest increase in and largest proportion of late decisions occurring at appeal levels 3 and 4. for example , in fiscal year 2014 , 96 percent of level 3 decisions were issued after the general 90-day statutory time frame for level 3. the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and two other components within hhs that are part of the medicare appeals process use data collected in three appeal data systems — such as the date when the appeal was filed , the type of service or claim appealed , and the length of time taken to issue appeal decisions — to monitor the medicare appeals process . however , these systems do not collect other data that hhs agencies could use to monitor important appeal trends , such as information related to the reasons for level 3 decisions and the actual amount of medicare reimbursement at issue . gao also found variation in how appeals bodies record decisions across the three systems , including the use of different categories to track the type of medicare service at issue in the appeal . absent more complete and consistent appeals data , hhs 's ability to monitor emerging trends in appeals is limited and is inconsistent with federal internal control standards that require agencies to run and control agency operations using relevant , reliable , and timely information . hhs agencies have taken several actions aimed at reducing the total number of medicare appeals filed and the current appeals backlog . for example , in 2014 , cms agreed to pay a portion of the payable amount for certain denied hospital claims on the condition that pending appeals associated with those claims were withdrawn and rights to future appeals of them waived . however , despite this and other actions taken by hhs agencies , the medicare appeals backlog continues to grow at a rate that outpaces the adjudication process and will likely persist . further , hhs efforts do not address inefficiencies regarding the way appeals of certain repetitious claims — such as claims for monthly oxygen equipment rentals — are adjudicated , which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards . under the current process , if the initial claim is reversed in favor of the appellant , the decision generally can not be applied to the other related claims . as a result , more appeals must go through the appeals process . gao recommends that hhs take four actions , including improving the completeness and consistency of the data used by hhs to monitor appeals and implementing a more efficient method of handling appeals associated with repetitious claims . hhs generally agreed with four of gao 's recommendations , and disagreed with a fifth recommendation , citing potential unintended consequences . gao agrees and has dropped that recommendation .
the board is charged with overseeing and supporting the capitol police . gao was asked to review the board 's operations , including the board 's accountability and level of communication . this report examines the roles and responsibilities of the board and the police chief and the comparability of the board 's scope to other law enforcement oversight entities ; the extent to which the board 's manual incorporates leading practices for accountability , transparency , and external communication , and how the board implements these practices ; and congressional stakeholder perspectives on the board 's approaches and adjustments to enhance them . to complete this review , gao analyzed relevant statutes and board governing documents and operations . gao also used internal control and corporate governance standards to articulate the key principles of accountability , transparency , and effective external communication ; identified six leading practices that facilitate these principles ; and analyzed the board 's manual against each . gao also interviewed board members and staff , congressional stakeholders , and experts selected for their knowledge of law enforcement oversight . the capitol police board ( board ) has wide - ranging responsibilities and according to experts with knowledge of law enforcement oversight bodies , like civilian oversight boards , the board 's scope is unique by comparison . for example , the board has authority for security decisions , as well as certain human capital and personnel matters , including the approval of officer terminations . in 2013 , the board adopted a manual of procedures ( manual ) that references its operations and establishes protocols for outreach with the congressional committees and leadership offices ( stakeholders ) with whom the board interacts . this manual fully incorporated one and partially incorporated five of the six leading practices that facilitate the principles of accountability , transparency , and effective external communication ; however , the board has not always implemented these practices , such as notifying stakeholders that certain information on the board 's decisions and operations is available to them . some stakeholders raised concerns , such as the board not adequately soliciting their input , and suggested adjustments to enhance the board 's approaches . board officials told us that the manual has not incorporated some leading practices , in part because they address activities beyond statutory requirements . leading practices note that effective governing bodies make commitments to stakeholders that exceed basic requirements , and gao found the manual includes activities that go beyond what is statutorily prescribed . working to fully incorporate leading practices into its manual and operations would help the board enhance its accountability , transparency , and effective external communication with stakeholders . gao recommends that the board revise its manual to fully incorporate leading practices , including evaluating its performance , and engage with stakeholders and incorporate their views , as appropriate , on any changes . the board did not state whether it concurred with the recommendation .
human trafficking — the exploitation of a person typically through force , fraud , or coercion for such purposes as forced labor , involuntary servitude or commercial sex — is occurring in the united states . congress has passed multiple laws to help ensure punishment of traffickers and protection of victims . doj and the department of homeland security lead federal investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes . the departments of defense , labor , and state , and the equal employment opportunity commission investigate trafficking related offenses under certain circumstances , and take further action , as appropriate . doj and hhs award grants to fund victim service programs . the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 includes a provision for gao to review law enforcement efforts and grant programs to combat human trafficking and assist victims in the united states . this report discusses federal efforts to assess prevalence of human trafficking challenges agencies face in investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases , and 3 ) federal grants and steps taken to prevent duplication . gao reviewed trafficking data and agency documents , and conducted 32 interviews with federal , state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors in four jurisdictions . we selected these jurisdictions based on the number of human trafficking tips they received , receipt of human trafficking task force funding and geographic variation . these officials ' perspectives can not be generalized to all jurisdictions but they provide insights into anti - trafficking efforts . federal agencies have begun efforts to assess the prevalence of human trafficking in the united states and develop data standards and definitions to help facilitate prevalence studies . for example , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) is sponsoring the human trafficking data collection project , which seeks to inform the development of an integrated data collection platform regarding human trafficking victimization , establish baseline knowledge of human trafficking and victim needs , and support effective prevention and intervention responses . hhs , in consultation with key stakeholders , has developed draft data fields and definitions for human trafficking and expects to begin piloting the data collection effort in fall 2016. further , the national institute of justice , within the department of justice ( doj ) , has awarded grants for the development and testing of methodologies that could be used to estimate the prevalence of human trafficking . federal , state and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors gao interviewed reported that investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases is challenging for multiple reasons , including a lack of victim cooperation , limited availability of services for victims , and difficulty identifying human trafficking . officials told us that obtaining the victim 's cooperation is important because the victim is generally the primary witness and source of evidence ; however , obtaining and securing victims ' cooperation is difficult , as victims may be unable or unwilling to testify due to distrust of law enforcement or fear of retaliation by the trafficker . according to these officials , victim service programs , such as those that provide mental health and substance abuse services , have helped improve victim cooperation ; however , the availability of services is limited . further , officials reported that identifying and distinguishing human trafficking from other crimes such as prostitution can be challenging . federal , state , and local agencies have taken or are taking actions to address these challenges , such as increasing the availability of victim services through grants and implementing training and public awareness initiatives . gao identified 42 grant programs with awards made in 2014 and 2015 that may be used to combat human trafficking or to assist victims of human trafficking , 15 of which are intended solely for these purposes . although some overlap exists among these human trafficking grant programs , federal agencies have established processes to help prevent unnecessary duplication . for instance , in response to recommendations in a prior gao report , doj requires grant applicants to identify any federal grants they are currently operating under as well as federal grants for which they have applied . in addition , agencies that participate in the grantmaking committee of the senior policy operating group are encouraged to share grant solicitations and information on proposed grant awards , allowing other agencies to comment on proposed grant awards and determine whether they plan to award funding to the same organization .
dod invests roughly $ 70 billion annually in weapon system research , development , test , and evaluation , including prototyping activities . prototyping can help reduce risk in weapon system acquisition programs by improving understanding of technologies , requirements , and proposed solutions . it can also contribute to innovation by demonstrating the value of new technologies or systems . house conference report 114-102 accompanying a bill for the fiscal year 2016 national defense authorization act included a provision for gao to review how dod 's research and development funds are used and whether this approach effectively supports activities such as prototyping . this report assesses how dod has used prototyping prior to system development on major defense acquisition programs , and what steps dod has taken to increase innovation through prototyping activities outside of major defense acquisition programs . gao examined prototyping activities for 22 mdaps that planned to enter system development between december 2009 and february 2016 and 7 prototyping - focused initiatives with the stated purpose of promoting innovation . the department of defense ( dod ) has used prototyping on its major defense acquisition programs ( mdap ) primarily to reduce technical risk , investigate integration challenges , validate designs , mature technologies , and refine performance requirements . of the 22 programs gao reviewed , 17 used prototyping before starting system development . for many of those programs , prototyping provided information that helped introduce realism into their business cases by providing information on technology maturity , the feasibility of the design concepts , potential costs , and the achievability of planned performance requirements . dod has developed new initiatives that are outside of major defense acquisition programs to increase prototyping and further innovation . however , these initiatives face barriers , such as limited funding , a risk averse culture , and competing priorities . literature on private sector innovation identifies key enablers for these types of efforts , such as developing an innovation strategy , aligning investments with innovation goals , and protecting funding for riskier projects . dod has taken steps that are consistent with a few , but not all , of these enablers . for example , dod does not have a department - wide strategy that communicates strategic goals and priorities and delineates roles and responsibilities to guide the prototyping initiatives . this could lead to unproductive or poorly coordinated investments later . dod 's initiatives also face competition for funding , particularly with acquisition programs . one strategy to address funding issues called “ strategic buckets ” involves allocating resources to different types of projects based on an organization 's strategy ( see figure ) . dod has not set strategic funding targets for its initiatives . failing to do so could prevent them from gaining traction and puts their long - term success at risk . gao is making four recommendations , including that dod develop a department - wide innovation strategy that includes prototyping and adopt a more strategic approach for funding prototyping efforts across dod . dod concurred with the recommendations and is currently working on this strategy .
as the lead federal agency charged with securing u.s. borders , the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) cbp has employed a variety of technologies and assets to assist with its border security efforts . in support of its mission , cbp operates a fleet of remotely piloted predator b uas and uses aerostats , including tactical aerostats and tars . gao was asked to review cbp 's use of uas and aerostats for border security . this report addresses the following questions : how does cbp use uas and aerostats for border security activities , and to what extent has cbp developed and documented procedures for uas coordination ? . and to what extent has cbp taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its uas and aerostats for border security activities ? . gao reviewed cbp documents ; analyzed predator b uas , tactical aerostat , and tars data on use and effectiveness from fiscal years 2013 through 2016 ; interviewed field and headquarters officials ; and conducted site visits to observe cbp 's use of uas and aerostats along u.s. borders . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) uses predator b unmanned aerial systems ( uas ) for a variety of border security activities but could benefit from documented coordination procedures in all operating locations . cbp uses its predator b uas to support a variety of efforts , such as missions to support investigations in collaboration with other government agencies ( e.g . , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ) and to locate individuals illegally crossing the border . gao found that cbp established various mechanisms to coordinate with other agencies for predator b missions but did not develop and document coordination procedures in two of its three operational centers . without documented coordination procedures in all operating locations consistent with internal control standards , cbp does not have reasonable assurance that practices in all operating locations align with existing policies and procedures for joint operations with other federal and non - federal government agencies . cbp uses aerostats — unmanned buoyant craft tethered to the ground and equipped with video surveillance cameras and radar technology — to support its border security activities along the southern u.s. border . in south texas , the u.s. border patrol ( border patrol ) uses relocatable tactical aerostats equipped with video surveillance technology to locate and support the interdiction of cross - border illegal activity . at eight fixed sites across the southern u.s. border and in puerto rico , cbp uses the tethered aerostat radar system ( tars ) program to support its efforts to detect occurrences of illegal aircraft and maritime vessel border incursions . cbp has taken actions to assess the effectiveness of its uas and aerostats for border security , but could improve its data collection . cbp collects a variety of data on its use of predator b uas , tactical aerostats , and tars including data on their support for the apprehension of individuals , seizure of drugs , and other events ( asset assists ) . for predator b uas , gao found mission data — such as the names of supported agencies and asset assists for seizures of narcotics — was not recorded consistently across all operational centers , limiting cbp 's ability to assess the effectiveness of the program . cbp has not updated its guidance for collecting and recording mission information in its data collection system to include new data elements added since 2014 , and it does not have instructions for recording mission information such as asset assists . in addition , not all users of cbp 's system have received training for recording mission information . updating guidance and fully training users , consistent with internal control standards , would help cbp better ensure the quality of data it uses to assess effectiveness . for tactical aerostats , gao found that border patrol collection of asset assist information for seizures and apprehensions does not distinguish between its tactical aerostats and tars . consistent with internal control standards , data that distinguishes between support provided by tactical aerostats and support provided by tars would help cbp collect better and more complete information and guide resource allocation decisions , such as the re - deployment of tactical aerostat sites based on changes in cross - border illegal activity . gao is making five recommendations , including that cbp document coordination procedures for predator b operations in all operating locations , update guidance and implement training for collection of predator b mission data , and update border patrol 's data collection practices for aerostat asset assists . cbp concurred and identified planned actions to address the recommendations .
gao previously reported that children in foster care in five selected states were prescribed psychotropic medications at higher rates than other children on medicaid . gao also reported that some prescriptions were not supported by research and could pose health risks . gao was asked to study efforts to oversee psychotropic medications for children in foster care since gao last reported on the issue in 2014. gao examined how child welfare and medicaid agencies in selected states ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care , what is known about the results of their efforts , and the extent to which hhs helps states support appropriate medication use . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; visited a nongeneralizable group of seven states and five counties in two of those states , selected by foster care population and diversity of location ; analyzed selected states ' data on medication use in foster care populations ; and interviewed officials from federal , state , and county child welfare , medicaid , and other agencies , as well as officials from nine relevant national organizations selected to represent a variety of views . state child welfare and medicaid officials in seven selected states reported a variety of practices to support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications , which affect mood , thought , or behavior , for children in foster care . practices include screening for mental health conditions , developing prescription guidelines , and monitoring a child 's health while on medication . additional state efforts aim to increase mental health knowledge among stakeholders and improve access to mental health services . however , officials in four selected states and from five national mental health organizations said limited access to mental health services was a challenge . five of the selected states have begun offering remote consultation services that connect patients with mental health specialists . state officials said strong interagency collaboration and outreach to stakeholders helped them implement practices more effectively . while some selected states have reduced medication use among these children , states focused on other measures to gauge the results of their efforts . four of the seven selected states reduced medication use from 2011 through 2015 , two states had steady rates , and the remaining state did not have data during this time period . these data , however , can not be compared across states because states use different methodologies to collect data . officials in three selected states said reducing medication use may not be appropriate for every child , and officials in all seven states said they focus instead on measures such as tracking the use of medications that can have negative side effects and the use of psychosocial services ( e.g . , therapy ) for children in foster care . officials in most selected states discussed limitations with gathering data needed to oversee medication use , such as disparate data systems , resource constraints , and privacy concerns related to data sharing among state child welfare and medicaid agencies and with managed care organizations . officials in some states that shared data said they overcame privacy concerns through written interagency agreements and educating stakeholders . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) has taken steps to help state child welfare and medicaid agencies support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications and identify mental health needs and treatments for children in foster care . hhs has focused its efforts on practices for prescribing , screening and diagnosis , and access to trauma - related services . hhs is also working with states to implement voluntary measures to track medication use , other mental health treatments , and a child 's overall health . in 2012 , hhs hosted a meeting for state leaders to help them establish effective medication oversight practices . despite the positive outcomes resulting from this meeting , and hhs guidance that says an agency goal is to facilitate cross - system collaborations , such as in the oversight of psychotropic medications , it has not convened meetings with all stakeholders together since 2012. though hhs has conducted webinars , created learning communities , and convened smaller meetings , hhs officials said it has no plans to convene all stakeholders as it did in 2012 due to resource constraints . officials in three selected states said more federal support to bring together state stakeholders could help address ongoing issues , such as privacy concerns around data sharing . gao recommends that hhs consider cost - effective ways to convene state child welfare , medicaid , and other stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing on psychotropic medication oversight . hhs agreed with gao 's recommendation and provided technical comments .
given the significance and complexity of the cap goals , it is important that cap goal contributors , congress , and the public are able to track how cap goal teams are making progress . this report is one in a series in response to a statutory provision to review gprama implementation . it assesses the extent to which lessons learned from implementing the interim cap goals were incorporated into the governance of the current cap goals ; the extent to which gprama requirements for reporting on cap goal progress are included in the selected cap goal quarterly progress updates ; and the initial progress in implementing the selected cap goals . gao selected 7 of the 15 cap goals to review ( customer service , job - creating investment , lab - to - market , open data , people and culture , smarter it delivery , and stem education ) . gao assessed those goals ' quarterly progress updates against relevant gprama requirements , reviewed omb and pic guidance to cap goal teams , and interviewed omb , pic , and cap goal staff . the gpra modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) requires the office of management and budget ( omb ) to coordinate with agencies to develop cross - agency priority ( cap ) goals , which are 4-year outcome - oriented goals covering a number of complex or high - risk management and mission issues . for the current set of cap goals covering the period from 2014-2018 , omb and the interagency performance improvement council ( pic ) incorporated lessons learned from the 2012-2014 interim cap goal period to improve the governance and implementation of these cross - cutting goals . for example , omb and the pic changed the cap goal governance structure to include agency leaders , and holds regular senior - level reviews on cap goal progress . they also provide ongoing assistance to cap goal teams , such as by helping teams develop milestones and performance measures . based in part on prior gao recommendations , omb and the pic updated its guidance to assist cap goal teams in managing the goals and in meeting gprama reporting requirements . cap goal teams told gao that the cap goal designation increased leadership attention and improved interagency collaboration on these issues . gao 's assessment of the selected cap goals ' quarterly progress updates — published on performance.gov — determined that cap goal teams are meeting a number of gprama reporting requirements , including identifying contributors , reporting strategies for performance improvement and quarterly results . however , most of the selected cap goal teams have not established quarterly targets as required by gprama , but are consistently reporting the status of quarterly milestones to track goal progress . gao found that the selected goal teams are aligning their quarterly milestones with strategies to achieve the desired goal outcomes . further , all of the selected cap goal teams reported that they are working to develop performance measures , and are at various stages of the process . however , the selected cap goal teams were not consistently reporting on their efforts to develop performance measures . given omb , the pic , and cap goal teams ' emphasis on developing measures that are relevant and well - defined , greater transparency is needed to track goal team 's efforts on a quarterly basis . with improved performance information the cap goal teams will be better positioned to demonstrate goal progress at the end of the 4-year goal period . gao recommends that omb , working with the pic , report on performance.gov the actions that cap goal teams are taking to develop performance measures and quarterly targets . omb staff generally agreed with gao 's recommendation and provided technical clarifications , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
telehealth and remote patient monitoring can provide alternatives to health care provided in person at a physician 's office , particularly for patients who can not easily travel long distances for care . medicare pays for some telehealth services that are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements , such as requiring the patient be present at an originating site like a rural health clinic . the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 includes a provision for gao to study telehealth and remote patient monitoring . among other reporting objectives , this report reviews the factors that associations identified as affecting the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare and emerging payment and delivery models that could affect the potential use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare . gao reviewed agency documents and regulations and interviewed agency officials . gao also selected nine general and medical specialty associations with expertise and interest in telehealth or remote patient monitoring — six provider , two patient , and one payer association — based on a review of relevant documents and literature and through background interviews . gao interviewed representatives from each of the associations and collected information from the provider and patient associations through a data collection instrument . gao provided a draft of this report to hhs . in response , hhs provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . selected associations representing providers and patients most often cited the potential to improve or maintain quality of care as a significant factor that encourages the use of telehealth ( providing clinical care remotely by two - way video ) and remote patient monitoring ( monitoring of patients outside of conventional settings ) in medicare . for example , according to officials from a provider association , telehealth can improve patient outcomes by facilitating follow - up care , while remote patient monitoring is helpful for treating patients with chronic diseases . with regard to factors that create barriers , the selected associations most often cited concerns over payment and coverage restrictions . for example , officials from a provider association noted that medicare telehealth coverage restrictions limit the geographic and practice settings in which beneficiaries may receive services . while not indicating how significant these factors are to medicare , officials with a payer association told gao that they considered these factors — also identified by the provider and patient associations — as either encouraging use or creating barriers to the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring . medicare models , demonstrations , and a new payment program have the potential to expand the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring . the centers for medicare & medicaid services , an agency within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , supports eight models and demonstrations in which certain medicare telehealth requirements have been waived , such as requirements for the locations and facility types where beneficiaries can receive telehealth services . for example , the waivers allow beneficiaries to access telehealth in urban areas , or from their homes . additionally , the use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring in medicare may change depending on how many clinicians use them as a way to achieve the goals of the new merit - based incentive payment system , which — starting in 2017 — will pay clinicians based on quality and resource use , among other things . under this payment program , clinicians can use telehealth and , in some instances , remote patient monitoring , to help meet the payment program 's performance criteria . for example , clinicians could use telehealth to coordinate care or use remote patient monitoring to remotely gather information to determine a patient 's proper dose of medication .
the park service manages more than 75,000 assets , including buildings , roads , and water systems , at 413 park units across all 50 states . in 2015 , the agency estimated that its deferred maintenance on these assets was $ 11.9 billion . gao was asked to review how the park service manages its maintenance needs . this report examines , among other things , agency allocations to maintain assets in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , the amount and composition of the agency 's deferred maintenance in fiscal years 2009 through 2015 , and how the agency makes maintenance decisions . to conduct this work , gao analyzed park service allocation data for fiscal years 2006 through 2015 and deferred maintenance data in fiscal years 2009 ( first year data for all assets was available ) through 2015 ( most current data available ) ; reviewed planning and guidance documents and compared the process for making asset management decisions to guidance developed by the national academies , among others ; and interviewed park service officials at headquarters , all seven regions , and 21 park units selected to include those with large and small amounts of deferred maintenance , among other things . this sample is not generalizable to all park units . in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 , the department of the interior 's national park service ( park service ) allocated , on average , $ 1.16 billion annually to maintain assets . in fiscal year 2015 , allocations to maintenance accounted for about one - third ( or $ 1.08 billion ) of the agency 's total funding of $ 3.3 billion . the largest portion of maintenance funds in fiscal year 2015 was allocated to facility operations , which includes maintenance that is routine in nature , such as maintenance of trails . the park service 's deferred maintenance — maintenance of its assets that was not performed when it should have been and is delayed for a future period — averaged $ 11.3 billion from fiscal years 2009 through 2015. bridges , tunnels , and paved roadways consistently made up the largest share of the agency 's deferred maintenance , accounting for half of all deferred maintenance in fiscal year 2015. older park units have the most deferred maintenance , with $ 10.5 billion in fiscal year 2015 in park units established more than 40 years ago . the park service uses several tools to determine an asset 's importance and condition and assign maintenance priority . park unit staff assess the condition of the asset and identify maintenance projects . once identified , park unit staff use the agency 's capital investment strategy to evaluate and rank projects . projects score higher if they target critical assets with deferred maintenance . fiscal year 2015 was the first budget year in which projects ranked using the strategy were funded , and regional and park unit officials said that it is too soon to determine if the strategy is meeting its objectives , such as maintaining the condition of its most important assets . however , the park service does not have a plan or timeframe for evaluating whether the strategy has been successful . a senior official said that the agency has not determined what is needed to begin such an evaluation and that it would be beneficial to verify that the capital investment strategy is achieving intended outcomes . according to the national academies federal facilities council , it is important that agencies track the outcome of investments to improve decision making and asset management . evaluating the strategy may help the park service determine if the strategy is achieving intended outcomes or if changes need to be made . gao recommends that the park service evaluate the capital investment strategy and results to assess whether it has achieved its intended outcomes . the department of the interior agreed with gao 's recommendation .
fda has faced challenges regulating medical products , owing in part to rapid changes in science and technology . in 2010 , fda established a regulatory science initiative that identified eight priority areas for medical products where new research was needed to advance its mission . legislation enacted in 2012 required fda to establish a plan for measuring its progress on its regulatory science efforts . gao was asked to examine fda 's progress on its regulatory science efforts related to medical products . in this report , gao evaluates fda 's strategic planning efforts to address its regulatory science priorities , describes fda 's funding targeted at regulatory science projects , and describes the achievements of selected fda regulatory science projects . gao compared related fda strategic planning documents to federal internal control standards and leading practices for strategic planning . gao reviewed fda data on obligations targeted at regulatory science projects for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 and reviewed the achievements fda reported from a sample of 17 projects , chosen to ensure nine fda centers and offices and priority areas are represented . the food and drug administration ( fda ) lacks measurable goals to assess its progress in advancing regulatory science — the science supporting its effort to assess the products it regulates . the agency issued strategic planning documents in 2011 and 2013 to guide its regulatory science efforts and identify priority areas for conducting work , but these documents do not specify the targets and time frames necessary for the agency to measure progress overall or within each of the eight priority areas related to medical products . according to leading practices for strategic planning , identifying and using consistent measurable goals in planning and progress documents is important to assessing effectiveness . while fda cited examples of its achievements in regulatory science in a 2015 report , fda can not assess how those achievements constitute progress towards its goals . in addition , fda lacks information about how funding targeted at regulatory science is distributed across the priority areas . decisions to award these funds are made by individual fda centers and offices , which generally did not collect information on the associated priority areas of funded projects . rather , fda retrospectively identified these areas for the purpose of gao 's review . the lack of consistent information limits fda 's ability to examine obligations across , or progress within , specific priority areas . standards for internal control in the federal government state that complete and accurate data are needed to make operating decisions and allocate resources . furthermore , multiple centers or offices fund projects toward a given priority area and leading practices for strategic planning encourage agencies to manage efforts that cut across the agency . for the 17 regulatory science projects gao reviewed , fda identified achievements ranging from the dissemination of project findings to changes in both agency and external stakeholder practices . for example , fda reported that all projects resulted in some type of change within fda . about half of the projects resulted in the agency developing standards , methods , tools , or training that it could use internally , and about one - third of the projects affected guidance or regulations . fda also reported that about half of the projects resulted in the development of new tools or standards for use by industry or other stakeholders , in areas such as setting new standards for defibrillators to account for radio interference . to improve strategic planning for regulatory science efforts , fda should develop and document measurable goals , including targets and time frames , and systematically track funding across its regulatory science priority areas . the department of health and human services agreed with gao 's recommendations .
federal agencies have awarded contracts and grants totaling more than $ 40 billion through the sbir and sttr programs to small businesses to develop and commercialize innovative technologies . the small business act requires agencies with extramural r & d obligations that meet certain thresholds — $ 100 million for sbir and $ 1 billion for sttr — to spend a percentage of these funds on the programs . the agencies are to report on their activities to sba , and in turn , sba is to report to congress . the 2011 reauthorization of the programs includes a provision for gao to review compliance with spending and reporting requirements and other program aspects . this report examines , for fiscal year 2014 , the extent to which participating agencies complied with spending requirements , the extent to which agencies and sba complied with certain reporting requirements , the potential effects of basing spending requirements on total r & d budget authority , and what is known about the amounts spent to administer the programs . gao reviewed agency spending data and reports and interviewed program officials from sba and the 11 participating agencies . agency data indicate that 9 of the 11 agencies participating in the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program and 4 of the 5 agencies participating in the small business technology transfer ( sttr ) program complied with spending requirements in fiscal year 2014. one agency — the department of agriculture ( usda ) — had extramural r & d obligations greater than $ 1 billion , but did not implement an sttr program , as required in the small business act . this is , in part , because the small business administration 's ( sba ) guidance does not address when an agency should establish a new sttr program . as a result , in fiscal year 2014 , less money was available for awards to small businesses through this program . most participating agencies did not fully comply with certain reporting requirements . for example , while all participating agencies submitted the required methodology reports for fiscal year 2014 , 6 of the 11 did not fully itemize the specific programs they excluded from their extramural r & d , did not fully explain the reasons why they excluded the programs , or both . additionally , 2 agencies did not submit complete information on the dollar amounts of exclusions in fiscal year 2014 because of a change in sba 's fiscal year 2014 guidance . restoring this guidance could provide information to help sba assess the accuracy of agency methodology reports . gao 's analysis shows that basing sbir and sttr spending requirements on an agency 's total r & d budget authority instead of its extramural r & d obligations could increase the amount each agency has to spend on the programs and increase the number of agencies required to participate in the programs . some agency officials identified benefits of this potential change , such as more funding to make awards to small businesses , but some agencies identified drawbacks , such as limiting resources for other r & d programs . total administrative spending on the sbir and sttr programs in fiscal year 2014 is unknown , but agencies participating in the administrative pilot program spent about $ 19 million on new activities . agencies do not and are not required to track total administrative costs , and therefore total spending could not be calculated for fiscal year 2014. seven agencies participated in the administrative pilot program and tracked the amounts of program funds they spent on new administrative and oversight activities in fiscal year 2014. while these 7 agencies spent more on the program in fiscal year 2014 than in the previous year , some of these agencies identified constraints that limited their participation . for example , agency officials pointed to guidance that requires agencies to only spend money on new initiatives and the limited length of the pilot . agency officials told gao these constraints kept them from achieving program goals by preventing them from undertaking some initiatives and hiring individuals for administrative purposes . sba plans to include its required evaluation of the pilot program in its annual report to congress , which could include an evaluation of such constraints and the steps needed to address them , but it has not yet submitted its fiscal year 2014 report to congress . until sba submits its evaluation of the pilot program , sba and congress will not have needed information about the pilot for fiscal year 2014 or potential constraints for participants . gao recommends that sba clarify guidance for when an agency is to start up an sttr program , restore guidance about dollar amounts of exclusions in the methodology report , and complete the required report to congress for fiscal year 2014. sba generally agreed with gao 's findings and recommendations .
the federal government is expected to spend more than $ 90 billion on it in fiscal year 2017. this includes a variety of software applications supporting agencies ' enterprise needs . since 2013 , omb has advocated the use of application rationalization . this is a process by which an agency streamlines its portfolio of software applications with the goal of improving efficiency , reducing complexity and redundancy , and lowering the cost of ownership . gao 's objectives were to determine whether agencies have established complete application inventories and to what extent selected agencies have developed and implemented processes for rationalizing their portfolio of applications . to do this , gao assessed the inventories of the 24 cfo act agencies against four key practices and selected six agencies — the departments of defense , homeland security , the interior , labor , and nasa and nsf — due to their it spending , among other factors , to determine whether they had processes addressing applications . most of the 24 chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 agencies in the review fully met at least three of the four practices gao identified to determine if agencies had complete software application inventories . to be considered complete , an inventory should include business and enterprise information technology ( it ) systems as defined by the office of management and budget ( omb ) ; include these systems from all organizational components ; specify application name , description , owner , and function supported ; and be regularly updated . of the 24 agencies , 4 ( the departments of defense , homeland security , and justice , and the general services administration ) fully met all four practices , 9 fully met three practices , 6 fully met two practices , 2 fully met one practice , and 3 did not fully meet any practice ( see figure ) . a january 2016 omb requirement to complete an it asset inventory by the end of may 2016 contributed to most of the agencies fully meeting the first three practices . agencies that did not fully address these practices stated , among other things , their focus on major and high risk investments as a reason for not having complete inventories . however , not accounting for all applications may result in missed opportunities to identify savings and efficiencies . it is also inconsistent with omb guidance regarding implementation of it acquisition reform law , referred to as the federal information technology acquisition reform act , which requires that chief information officers at covered agencies have increased visibility into all it resources . not accounting for all applications also presents a security risk since agencies can only secure assets if they are aware of them . each of the six selected agencies relied on their investment management processes and , in some cases , supplemental processes to rationalize their applications to varying degrees . however , five of the six agencies acknowledged that their processes did not always allow for collecting or reviewing the information needed to effectively rationalize all their applications . the sixth agency , the national science foundation ( nsf ) , stated its processes allow it to effectively rationalize its applications , but agency documentation supporting this assertion was incomplete . only one agency — the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) — had plans to address shortcomings . taking action to address identified weaknesses with agencies ' existing processes for rationalizing applications would assist with identifying additional opportunities to reduce duplication and achieve savings . gao is recommending that 20 agencies improve their inventories and five of the selected agencies take actions to improve their processes to rationalize their applications more completely . the department of defense disagreed with both recommendations made to it . after reviewing additional evidence , gao removed the recommendation associated with improving the inventory but maintained the other . the other agencies agreed to or had no comments on the draft report .
in july 2015 , multilateral talks with iran culminated in an agreement called the jcpoa , through which iran committed to limits on its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions put in place by the united states and other nations . iaea , an independent international organization that administers safeguards designed to detect and deter the diversion of nuclear material for nonpeaceful purposes , was requested to verify and monitor iran 's implementation of these commitments . the u.s. department of state coordinates the united states ' financial and policy relationship with iaea . gao was asked to review the authorities and resources iaea has to carry out its activities regarding the jcpoa . this report , which updates the preliminary findings from an interim report released in february 2016 ( gao - 16-417 ) , examines the jcpoa commitments that iaea has been asked to verify and monitor and its authorities to do so , the resources iaea has identified as necessary to verify and monitor those jcpoa commitments , and potential challenges and mitigating actions iaea and others have identified with regard to verifying and monitoring the jcpoa . gao analyzed the jcpoa and key iaea documents and interviewed current and former iaea officials , u.s. government officials , national laboratory representatives , and experts from research institutions . as outlined in the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) was asked to verify and monitor iran 's implementation of a range of nuclear - related commitments . iaea is using its safeguards authorities and conducting additional activities agreed to by iran under the jcpoa to do so . iran 's commitments include limits on uranium enrichment levels and on enriched uranium inventories . iaea is verifying and monitoring iran 's implementation of these commitments through a range of activities conducted by its safeguards department , such as inspecting iran 's nuclear facilities , analyzing environmental samples , and monitoring iran 's uranium mines and mills . under the jcpoa , iran agreed to provisionally apply the additional protocol , an agreement that will give iaea 's inspectors access to an expanded range of locations , including where the agency seeks assurance regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities . the jcpoa also includes a mechanism in which participants to the agreement commit to resolve an access request from the agency within 24 days after the request is made . iaea has identified the financial , human , and technical resources necessary to verify and monitor iran 's nuclear - related commitments in the jcpoa . iaea has estimated that it needs approximately $ 10 million per year for 15 years in additional funding above its current safeguards budget for jcpoa verification . according to iaea documents , this $ 10 million will be entirely funded through extra - budgetary contributions through 2016. iaea officials said that the agency intends to propose that of the $ 10 million approximately $ 5.7 million for all additional protocol activities and inspector costs attributable to the jcpoa be funded through iaea 's regular budget after 2016 ; approximately $ 4.4 million will be supported through extra - budgetary contributions from member states , such as the united states . iaea also plans to transfer 18 experienced inspectors to its office of safeguards verification in iran from other safeguards divisions and to hire and train additional inspectors . according to iaea officials , existing safeguards technical resources are sufficient to implement the jcpoa . iaea may face potential challenges in verifying and monitoring iran 's implementation of certain nuclear - related commitments in the jcpoa . according to current and former iaea and u.s. officials and expert organizations , these potential challenges include integrating jcpoa - related funding into iaea 's regular budget and managing human resources in the safeguards program , access challenges depending on iran 's cooperation and the untested jcpoa mechanism to resolve access issues , and the inherent challenge of detecting undeclared nuclear materials and activities . iaea has identified mitigating actions , such as utilizing remote monitoring and cost - free experts to address potential understaffing of iaea safeguards activities in other countries as additional experienced inspectors are transferred to work on iran - related safeguards . in addition , according to iaea and u.s. officials as well as a former iaea official gao interviewed , iaea has improved its capabilities in detecting undeclared activity . for example , according to u.s. officials , iaea has adapted its inspector training program to focus on potential indicators of undeclared activities . gao is not making any recommendations .
the number of older adults , those over age 65 , is expected to nearly double in the united states by 2050. when an older adult becomes incapable of making informed decisions , a guardianship may be necessary . generally , guardianships are legal relationships created when a state court grants one person or entity the authority and responsibility to make decisions in the best interest of an incapacitated individual — which can include an older adult — concerning his or her person or property . while many guardians act in the best interest of persons under guardianship , some have been reported to engage in the abuse of older adults . gao was asked to review whether abusive practices by guardians are widespread . this report describes what is known about the extent of elder abuse by guardians ; and what measures federal agencies and selected state and local guardianship programs have taken to help protect older adults with guardians . gao reviewed relevant research , reports , studies , and other publications issued by organizations with expertise on elder abuse and guardianship issues . gao also conducted interviews with various guardianship stakeholders including federal agencies such as hhs , six selected state courts , and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in guardianship - related issues . in addition , gao identified eight closed cases of abuse by guardians in which there was a criminal conviction or finding of civil or administrative liability to use as nongeneralizable illustrative examples . gao makes no recommendations in this report . the extent of elder abuse by guardians nationally is unknown due to limited data on key factors related to elder abuse by a guardian , such as the numbers of guardians serving older adults , older adults in guardianships , and cases of elder abuse by a guardian . court officials from six selected states gao spoke to noted various data limitations that prevent them from being able to provide reliable figures about elder abuse by guardians , including incomplete information about the ages of individuals with guardians . officials from selected courts and representatives from organizations gao spoke to described their observations about elder abuse by a guardian , including that one of the most common types appeared to be financial exploitation . some efforts are under way to try to collect better data on elder abuse and guardianship at the federal , state , and local levels to support decision making and help prevent and address elder abuse by guardians . for example , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) plans to launch the national adult maltreatment reporting system — a national reporting system based on data from state adult protective services ( aps ) agency information systems by early 2017. according to hhs and its contractor , this system has the capability to collect information that could specifically help identify cases of elder abuse where a guardian was involved . gao also identified state and local initiatives to capture key data points and complaint data as well as identify “ red flags ” such as unusually high guardian fees or excessive vehicle or dining expenses . the federal government does not regulate or directly support guardianship , but federal agencies may provide indirect support to state guardianship programs by providing funding for efforts to share best practices and facilitate improved coordination , as well as by sharing information that state and local entities can use related to guardianship . state and local courts have primary responsibility over the guardianship process and , as such , have a role in protecting older adults with guardians from abuse , neglect , and exploitation . measures taken by selected states to help protect older adults with guardians vary but generally include screening , education , monitoring , and enforcement .
interior 's blm oversees and accounts for onshore oil and gas production on federal lands . interior generally collects royalties for this oil and gas , but its guidance , which was issued over 30 years ago , may exempt gas that is vented , flared , or used to operate equipment on the lease . increased oil production in recent years has resulted in a rise in flared gas in certain regions where there is limited infrastructure to transport or process gas associated with oil production . blm has proposed updating its venting and flaring regulations to clarify how such emissions are to be managed . gao was asked to review interior 's management of natural gas emissions onshore . this report examines the extent to which interior can account for these emissions and how blm field offices have managed requests to vent or flare . gao analyzed interior data , including a simple random sample of venting or flaring requests from fiscal year 2014 , the most recent year for which data were available ; reviewed interior documents ; and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of six blm field offices selected based on increased natural gas emissions in recent years . gao also interviewed operators with leases managed by two blm field offices . the department of the interior 's ( interior ) guidance to oil and gas operators on its reporting requirements has limitations that may hinder the extent to which it can account for natural gas emissions on onshore federal lands ( leases ) . interior is required to ensure that oil and gas operations are conducted in a manner that minimizes waste . as part of its oversight activities , interior requires operators to submit monthly oil and gas operations reports ( ogor ) . interior uses these reports to track volumes of oil and gas produced on federal lands , including gas that may be exempt from royalties , such as gas released into the air ( vented ) , burned ( flared ) , or used to power equipment on the lease ( lease use ) . historically , interior 's focus has been on collecting data from royalty - bearing oil and gas production , and thus it has provided limited guidance on how operators are to report natural gas emissions . for example , interior does not provide specific instructions on how to estimate natural gas emissions , which results in operators using varying estimation methods that may be difficult to verify ; does not specify which natural gas emissions activities should be reported , resulting in operators not reporting some emissions ( e.g . , from storage tanks ) . as a result of these limitations , interior may not have a consistent accounting of natural gas emissions from onshore federal leases , and does not have the information it needs to reasonably ensure it is minimizing waste on these leases . the bureau of land management 's ( blm ) field offices have not consistently followed blm 's existing guidance in managing operators ' venting or flaring requests . gao found that blm field offices have approved venting or flaring requests that did not include the documentation blm 's guidance requires . specifically , in fiscal year 2014 , gao found that blm received 1,281 venting or flaring requests from operators . gao reviewed the documentation for a random sample of 100 of those requests and , based on this sample , estimates that 90 percent ( + / - 8 ) of the requests to blm did not provide the documentation required by blm guidance . gao also estimates that blm approved 70 percent ( + / - 9 ) of these venting or flaring requests and , for nearly half of the approvals , allowed operators to flare gas royalty - free . further , gao found that selected blm field offices have applied blm guidance differently to venting or flaring requests . for example , officials in two blm field offices gao reviewed said they used their authority under the existing guidance to charge royalties on flared gas , while a third field office was considering doing so . the other three field offices gao reviewed have interpreted blm guidance as allowing all venting or flaring requests in their regions to be approved royalty - free . blm 's proposed update to its regulations , if finalized , would clarify how blm will manage future venting or flaring requests . interior officials told gao that they expect to finalize the proposed update to its regulations by the end of calendar year 2016 and that finalizing the regulations is an administration priority . gao is making four recommendations to interior , including providing additional guidance on how operators are to report natural gas emissions . interior generally concurred with these recommendations .
gao has previously reported that federal facilities are vulnerable to threats from foreign sources that may target their information systems and affect the physical security of the occupants . gao was asked to examine gsa 's lease of high - security space from foreign owners . this report addresses what is known about foreign ownership of high - security space leased by gsa , potential risks posed by such foreign ownership , and policies and procedures regarding gsa 's leasing of space from foreign - owned entities . gao reviewed gsa 's leasing documents ; identified and checked ownership information regarding high - security leased space to the extent possible using data , as of march 2016 , from a firm that specializes in analyzing the commercial real estate market ; interviewed gsa and federal foreign investment officials , tenant agencies that were occupying space owned by foreign entities , and five real estate companies that lease space to gsa or provide related services ; and visited three foreign - owned high - security leased facilities selected to represent a variety of owners and tenants . gao reviewed available information on the ownership of general services administration ( gsa ) leased space that requires higher levels of security protection based on factors such as mission criticality and facility size ( high - security space ) as of march 2016 and found that gsa is leasing high - security space from foreign owners in 20 buildings . the 26 tenant agencies occupy about 3.3 million square feet at an annual cost of about $ 97 million and use the space , in some cases , for classified operations and to store law enforcement evidence and sensitive data . the foreign - owned leased space included six federal bureau of investigation field offices and three drug enforcement administration field offices . gao determined that the high - security space is owned by companies based in countries such as canada , china , israel , japan , and south korea . gao was unable to identify ownership information for about one - third of gsa 's 1,406 high - security leases as of march 2016 because ownership information was not readily available for all buildings . federal officials who assess foreign investments in the united states and some tenant agencies occupying high - security leased space told gao that leasing space in foreign - owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access . however , 9 of the 14 tenant agencies gao contacted were unaware that the space they occupy is in a building that we identified as foreign owned . the other five agencies that knew about occupying foreign - owned space had taken actions to mitigate the risk or were not concerned . another risk is possibly entering into leases with hidden beneficial owners — the persons who ultimately own and control a building . according to the treasury department 's financial crimes enforcement network , the risks of contracting with hidden beneficial owners include money laundering . gsa is not required to collect beneficial ownership information and therefore does not know the beneficial owners of the buildings it leases . federal agencies are required to assess and address the risks to their high - security facilities but gsa does not inform tenants when leasing space from foreign owners . when leasing space , gsa is required , among other things , to determine whether the prospective lessor is a responsible party , but foreign ownership is not one of the factors that it must consider . as a result , tenants may be unaware that they are occupying foreign - owned space and not know whether they need to address any security risks associated with such foreign ownership . gao recommends that gsa determine whether the beneficial owner of high - security leased space is a foreign entity and , if so , share that information with the tenant agencies for any needed security mitigation . gsa agreed with the recommendation .
millions of elderly individuals and persons with disabling conditions rely on ltss to help them perform routine daily activities , such as eating and bathing . direct care workers are among the primary providers of ltss . reported difficulties recruiting and retaining direct care workers and the anticipated growth in the elderly population have fueled concerns about the capacity of the paid direct care workforce to meet the demand for ltss . despite these concerns , policymakers lack data to help assess the size of the problem . gao was asked to provide information on direct care workers who deliver ltss . this report examines federal and state data available on the paid direct care workforce and actions hrsa has taken to develop information and projections on this workforce . gao analyzed the most recent data available from the census bureau and bureau of labor statistics on paid direct care workers ' demographics , compensation , and benefits and reviewed efforts to collect data on direct care workers in four states , selected in part for geographic variation . gao also reviewed hrsa documents and interviewed agency officials about hrsa 's previous , ongoing , and planned efforts to improve data . federal data sources provide a broad picture of direct care workers — nursing assistants and home health , psychiatric , and personal care aides — who provide long - term services and supports ( ltss ) , but limitations and gaps affect the data 's usefulness for workforce planning . some states have collected data in areas where federal data are limited , but these have been one - time studies . federal data show that direct care workers who provide ltss numbered an estimated 3.27 million in 2014 , or 20.8 percent of the nation 's health workforce . federal data show that wages for direct care workers , while differing by occupation , are generally low , averaging between approximately $ 10 and $ 13 per hour in 2015. however it is unclear to what extent these wage data include direct care workers employed directly by the individuals for whom they care . the number of these workers , often referred to as independent providers , is believed to be significant and growing . some states , in coordination with the federal government or on their own , have conducted studies about direct care workers and collected detailed information . these studies showed that a majority of independent providers worked for a family member or someone else they knew . the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , which is responsible for monitoring the supply of and demand for health professionals , has developed some information on direct care workers . however , hrsa has not produced projections of this workforce or developed methods to address data limitations , which is in line with one of the goals in its strategic plan . hrsa 's actions include sponsoring research and issuing a 2013 report that summarized federal data on different occupations , including direct care workers . while hrsa has recognized the limitations of existing data and cites these as reasons it has not developed projections for this workforce , the agency has not developed methods to address data challenges . unless hrsa takes steps to overcome data limitations in order to make projections of supply and demand for direct care workers , policymakers will continue to be hampered in their ability to identify workforce trends and develop appropriate strategies to help ensure a sufficient number of qualified direct care workers . gao recommends that hrsa take steps to produce projections of direct care workforce supply and demand and develop methods to address data limitations in order to do so . hhs concurred with gao 's recommendation , stating that developing projections for the direct care workforce is timely and important .
disposal of unneeded buildings — for example through demolition , sale , or transfer to other federal agencies — has the potential to save the government millions of dollars . to this end , omb has developed policies to reduce space in federal buildings and identify buildings for disposal . recent progress notwithstanding , gao 's body of work on real property has found limitations in the overall reliability of data in gsa 's government - wide database . omb has reported on the status of federal real property disposals for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. gao was asked to examine the reliability of the data used to report disposals and any efforts to improve the data . this report assesses the reliability and reporting of government - wide disposal data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 , and steps omb , gsa , and three selected agencies have taken to improve disposal data . gao analyzed the most recent frpp data , agency documents , and interviewed omb , gsa , and agency officials . gao selected the departments of agriculture , energy , and the interior based on the highest numbers of disposed buildings . gao 's analysis showed that government - wide data were generally reliable for reporting on real property disposals for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. the general services administration 's ( gsa ) federal real property profile ( frpp ) serves as the building inventory database for most of the largest federal agencies . frpp 's data on real property disposals were generally complete , reasonable , and internally consistent , based on gao 's guidance for assessing data reliability . for example , the disposal date , disposal method , and buildings ' square footage data generally met these criteria . the office of management and budget 's ( omb ) reporting of frpp disposal data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 was also generally reliable . based on analysis of frpp data , gao was able to replicate omb 's reported numbers on building disposals , despite minor inconsistencies . gao identified three minor inconsistencies in its analysis and omb 's reporting , all of which led to some over - reporting of building disposals . for example , the data showed 134 buildings as disposed of in multiple years . given that these inconsistencies resulted in small differences in the number of buildings reported , gao determined that the inconsistencies did not affect the overall reliability of government - wide reporting of disposal data . gao recommends that gsa implement a data validation procedure to prevent reporting a building as disposed of multiple times and that omb , in coordination with gsa , establish a procedure to verify that its reports include data as intended . gsa and omb agreed with gao 's recommendations and identified steps to implement them .
enacted in 2014 , wioa aims , in part , to increase coordination among federal workforce development programs , which are administered primarily by dol and education . gao was asked to review selected states ' approaches for addressing certain wioa provisions in their state workforce plans . gao examined 1 ) approaches selected states have taken to develop plans for implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies , and 2 ) related planning challenges these states have encountered and how they have addressed them . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance . gao also conducted case studies in five states ( california , colorado , kentucky , ohio , and pennsylvania ) . gao selected these states based on input from national associations about their level of experience with career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies , and gao 's review of relevant reports . in these states , gao interviewed state workforce board officials and agency officials who were involved in developing the state plan . the information gao obtained provides in - depth examples but is not generalizable to all states . gao also reviewed state plans and other relevant documentation . in addition , gao interviewed dol and education officials . officials in five selected states reported using three main approaches to develop plans for implementing career pathways , sector partnerships , and regional planning strategies under the workforce innovation and opportunity act ( wioa ) . gao selected states that had various levels of experience with these strategies . specifically , as a condition of receiving funding , federal agencies require state plans under wioa to include career pathways strategies , which align education , job training , and support services to help job seekers obtain employment . these plans must also include sector partnership strategies , which help employers in an industry address shared goals and hiring needs . in addition , states are required to establish regions , which may be made up of multiple local workforce areas . according to the department of labor ( dol ) , these regions are intended in part to align workforce activities with regional economies . to address these requirements , officials in each of the five states reported : building on prior experience to enhance career pathways , sector partnerships , or both strategies . for example , pennsylvania 's state plan proposes building on over 10 years of experience with sector partnerships by increasing technical assistance for them and exploring the development of a certification program for these partnerships . increasing the involvement of stakeholders , which uncovered ways to enhance services in most selected states . for example , ohio officials said they involved the state agency that oversees employment services for individuals with disabilities and advocates for these individuals in planning efforts for the first time , which led them to provide training on disability awareness for staff at all local workforce centers . using multiple sources of labor market information , which helped better align career pathways strategies with employer needs in some selected states . for example , colorado officials said they asked employers to review projected worker shortages in the medical industry over the next 10 years , and employers said they would need more workers over a shorter period of time . officials used this information to focus their career pathways strategies on preparing individuals to eventually fill the jobs that were projected to have worker shortages . officials in four of the states gao selected reported facing challenges establishing regions due to local areas ' concerns , which they addressed by revising regional boundaries or increasing the number of regions and by providing incentives for regional collaboration or innovation . in three states , officials said they revised their regions in response to local concerns . for example , california officials said they redrew regional boundaries after a local area requested that it be assigned to a different region based on commuting patterns , among other factors . in addition , to encourage regional collaboration or innovation , officials in four states reported providing financial incentives . for example , a kentucky official said the state is using a private grant to fund regional efforts to develop career pathways and sector partnership strategies . additionally , dol and department of education ( education ) officials told us that they plan to support states with related technical assistance . gao is not making recommendations in this report . dol and education provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
in recent years , the size , sophistication , and cost of the department of defense 's ( dod ) uas portfolio has grown considerably , as has the demand for trained uas pilots . this testimony discusses , among other things , dod 's progress in taking actions to strengthen the management of air force uas pilots and addressing challenges the army faces to ensure that its uas pilots complete their required training and receive high - quality training . gao 's statement is based on information from its reports issued in april 2014 on the air force uas pilots and may 2015 on army and air force uas pilot training . for those reports , gao reviewed dod guidance on training uas pilots and other relevant documents , examined nongeneralizeable training records of air force uas units , conducted nongeneralizeable focus groups with active duty uas pilots who were selected to cover a range of ranks and other factors at 6 installations , and interviewed dod and military services officials . gao obtained updates from dod and military services officials for this statement . in april 2014 , gao reported on several issues the air force faced in managing its uas pilots , and while the air force has taken some actions since then , it has not fully implemented gao 's recommendations to strengthen its management . personnel requirements : gao reported that the air force had not accurately identified the number of uas pilots required to accomplish its mission nor had it established a minimum number of pilots needed . as of march 2016 , the air force had not updated personnel requirements and until it does , the air force will not know if it is assuming unacceptable levels of risk to accomplishing the mission and ensuring pilot safety . recruiting and retaining : gao reported that the air force had faced challenges recruiting uas pilots and might also face retention challenges in the future . the air force has taken steps to recruit more uas pilots and offers a monthly assignment incentive pay to help retain pilots , but issues related to recruiting uas pilots may warrant the air force 's attention . alternative sources : gao reported that the air force had not evaluated the use of alternative personnel populations such as enlisted or civilian personnel to help it sustain required uas pilot staffing levels . in 2015 , the air force announced it would test using enlisted personnel but has not formally evaluated using dod civilian personnel as uas pilots and thus may lack information on potential options for meeting personnel requirements . training : gao reported that the air force had faced challenges training its uas pilots due to uas pilot shortages , which impacted its ability to produce new pilots . fully implementing gao 's recommendations pertaining to management of uas pilots would better position the air force to address its training challenges . promotions : gao reported that the air force monitors the promotion rates of uas pilots but had not analyzed factors that may relate to their low promotion rates . until the air force does this analysis , it is unclear whether its actions to raise promotion rates are appropriate . the army has initiated steps to address challenges related to uas pilots completing their required training and its use of less experienced instructors , which could affect training quality . in may 2015 , gao found that army unit status reports did not require uas pilot training information , and thus the army did not know the extent pilots had been trained and were ready to deploy . gao recommended that the army require unit status reports to include uas pilot readiness information . in march 2016 , officials stated that the army had taken steps to implement the recommendation , but its efforts are ongoing and thus it is too early to know their impact . also , the army had waived course prerequisites for about 40 percent of the uas pilots attending a course to become instructor pilots from the beginning of fiscal year 2013 through february 2015. as a result , army uas pilots may not have been receiving the highest caliber of training to prepare them for uas missions . gao recommended in may 2015 that the army mitigate risks posed by waiving prerequisites for less experienced uas pilots , and in march 2016 , army officials stated that they have addressed the underlying causes that led it to waive the prerequisites , but they did not provide information for gao to be able to determine whether they were continuing to waive these prerequisites . in april 2014 and may 2015 , gao made ten recommendations to dod to improve the air force 's management of uas pilots , address army uas pilot training challenges , and enhance dod coordination of uas pilot training . dod initiated action on most of these recommendations .
in 2015 , more than 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving large trucks . to identify carriers with the highest crash risk , fmcsa uses information from roadside inspections and crashes to rank each carrier 's safety performance relative to other carriers in seven categories , including one on vehicle maintenance . some stakeholders have proposed a system for carriers or their drivers to self - report en route vehicle equipment problems to fmcsa . reported equipment problems that were repaired within a certain time period would not affect the carrier 's relative ranking , potentially incentivizing carriers to make repairs more quickly . the fixing america 's surface transportation act included a provision for gao to examine the cost and feasibility of establishing a system for carriers or drivers to self - report vehicle equipment problems to fmcsa . this report examines the potential safety impacts of a self - reporting system and factors that could affect its feasibility and cost . gao reviewed relevant regulations , information on other existing dot self - reporting systems , and prior related gao work . gao also interviewed a non - generalizable sample of representatives from six industry and safety associations , six carriers , and six drivers about this potential system for self - reporting equipment problems . gao selected carriers to include those with diverse fleet sizes and average distances traveled , and drivers from six additional carriers . dot provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . establishing a system that would provide incentives for trucking companies to self - report equipment problems may not necessarily yield safety benefits . most stakeholders gao interviewed — including selected carriers and drivers — thought a self - reporting system would be unlikely to produce safety benefits , stating that it would not incentivize quicker repairs . if repairs are not made more quickly , there would be no positive impact on safety . three drivers , however , thought a self - reporting system could yield some safety benefits if it incentivized drivers to do more thorough inspections of their vehicles . officials from industry groups and the federal motor carrier safety administration ( fmcsa ) noted that a self - reporting system could negatively impact safety , such as by encouraging distracted driving if drivers report equipment problems on their cell phones while driving . moreover , estimating the potential safety impacts of such a system requires information that is not currently available , such as how equipment problems that would be permitted to be self - reported are related to crashes . example of a driver receiving a violation for a previously identified equipment problem under current system and under a self - reporting one fmcsa has the statutory and regulatory authority to establish a system for self - reporting equipment problems , and technology exists to create it , but its costs are unknown . also , establishing such a system could pose challenges for fmcsa , carriers , and drivers . for example , developing a new system could delay efforts fmcsa has under way to improve its information technology , and carriers or drivers may have difficulty selecting their specific equipment problem from the more than 300 potential vehicle maintenance violations . further , without information on key design features of a self - reporting system , such as whether reporting would be through a telephone hotline or a web - application , it is not possible to estimate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence . fmcsa developed a rough estimate that a self - reporting system would cost between $ 5 and $ 10 million to establish and operate for the first year .
dhs 's human resources information technology environment includes fragmented systems , duplicative and paper - based processes , and little uniformity of data management practices , which according to dhs , are compromising the department 's ability to effectively carry out its mission . dhs initiated hrit in 2003 to consolidate , integrate , and modernize dhs 's human resources information technology infrastructure . in 2011 , dhs redefined hrit 's scope and implementation time frames . this statement summarizes gao 's report that is being released at today 's hearing ( gao - 16-253 ) on , among other objectives , the progress dhs has made in implementing the hrit investment and how effectively it managed the investment . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has made very little progress in implementing its human resources information technology ( hrit ) investment over the last several years . this investment includes 15 improvement areas ; as of november 2015 , dhs had fully implemented only 1. hrit 's limited progress was due in part to the lack of involvement of its executive steering committee — the investment 's core oversight and advisory body . specifically , this committee was minimally involved with hrit , such as meeting only once during a nearly 2-year period when major problems were occurring , including schedule delays and the lack of a life - cycle cost estimate . as a result , key governance activities , such as approval of hrit 's operational plan , were not completed . officials acknowledge that hrit should be re - evaluated . they have met to discuss it ; however , specific actions and time frames have not yet been determined . until dhs takes key actions to manage this neglected investment , it is unknown when its human capital management weaknesses will be addressed . in its report that is being released today , gao made 14 recommendations to dhs to , among other things , address hrit 's poor progress and ineffective management . for example , gao recommended that the hrit executive steering committee be consistently involved in overseeing and advising the investment , and that dhs establish time frames for re - evaluating hrit and develop a complete life - cycle cost estimate for the investment . dhs concurred with the 14 recommendations and provided estimated completion dates for implementing each of them .
following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the coast guard has been charged with expanded security - related missions . constrained budgets in recent years have underscored the importance of ensuring that the coast guard has the proper mix of assets and that it can effectively allocate these assets to achieve its missions . in recent years , the coast guard has begun to deploy new assets , and has taken actions to assess what assets it needs to carry out its missions and how to best allocate its current assets . however , the coast guard continues to face decisions about what assets it needs and how to best allocate these assets to meet its mission responsibilities . this statement addresses the coast guard 's mission needs , and process for allocating asset resource hours across missions and units . this testimony is based on gao 's may 2016 report on the coast guard 's allocation of assets , and gao 's body of work over the past 6 years on coast guard major acquisitions , as well as selected updates obtained in may 2016. for the selected updates , gao reviewed coast guard documentation and analyzed fiscal year 2015 data on coast guard asset resource hour utilization , which gao found to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this testimony statement . since the u.s. coast guard developed acquisition plans for its asset recapitalization program , many of the assumptions that initially informed these documents , including its 2005 mission needs statement baseline , are no longer accurate . for example , in march 2015 , gao reported that the coast guard received an unexpected transfer of 14 c - 27j aircraft from the air force , representing a significant change to its aircraft fleet mix . in addition , congress recently provided the coast guard with funding for a ninth national security cutter — one more than it had planned for in 2005. further , the coast guard has reduced the operational capacities of several assets to reflect more realistic and achievable operational targets . for example , the coast guard reduced the operational capacity of the fast response cutter from 3,000 hours per vessel per year to 2,500 hours . gao has also consistently found that there is a significant difference between the funding the coast guard estimates it needs for its major acquisitions and what it has traditionally requested and received . the coast guard 's attempts to address this difference by establishing its future fleet 's mission needs within reasonable budget constraints have been unsuccessful . gao has made several recommendations for the coast guard to improve its recapitalization business case , including that the coast guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them . the coast guard concurred with the recommendation and has actions underway , but has not completed this plan . given that key changes have taken place since 2005 , the coast guard should continue to take steps to address gao 's recommendations . gao reported in may 2016 that the coast guard uses the standard operational planning process to annually allocate asset resource hours to field units for meeting missions , but the headquarters ' strategic planning directions used in this process do not provide field units with strategic , realistic goals . rather , headquarters ' strategic planning directions allocate maximum resource hour capacities for each asset . these allocations have consistently exceeded actual asset resource hours used by field units . gao recommended , among other things , that the coast guard more systematically incorporate field unit input to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions — in addition to asset maximum capacities currently used — in the annual strategic planning directions to more effectively communicate strategic intent to field units . the coast guard concurred with gao 's recommendation and stated that it was taking actions to better incorporate field unit input for fiscal year 2017. gao is not making any new recommendations in this statement .
over 151,000 very low - income elderly and disabled households rely on the section 202 and the section 811 programs to provide affordable rents and housing with supportive services . before fiscal year 2012 , nonprofit organizations interested in developing units for these populations could apply to hud for grants known as capital advances , which did not have to be repaid as long as the property continued to serve these populations for 40 years . since fiscal year 2012 , congress has not appropriated any funding for capital advances for either program , although it has continued to fund rental assistance for existing developments . the house report accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 contained a provision for gao to provide information on hud capital advances for the section 202 and section 811 programs from 2008 – 2013 . this report examines how hud determined the capital advance amounts awarded to sponsors for section 202 and section 811 and the number of capital advance awards and amounts by state from fiscal years 2008 – 2011 and any changes in the distribution of capital advances over that period . gao reviewed budget documents and funding announcements and interviewed agency officials . gao makes no recommendations in this report . gao provided a draft to hud for its review and received technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . until program funding for new development ceased in fiscal year 2012 , the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) used a two - phase process to allocate and award capital advances for section 202 supportive housing for the elderly ( section 202 ) and section 811 supportive housing for persons with disabilities ( section 811 ) . first , hud headquarters allocated the amount of appropriated funds for capital advances to each of the 18 regional offices using a funding formula , which accounted for regional housing needs and cost characteristics . funding was further divided among 52 local offices using a set - aside formula and was also split between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas for section 202. in 2010 , hud eliminated the set - aside which had guaranteed a minimum amount of funding for each local field office . the process for making capital advance awards did not change , but hud was better able fund properties at a higher level . second , applicants submitted applications to the applicable hud regional office , and staff from these offices evaluated and scored applications based on various criteria , including capacity to provide housing and ability to secure funding from other sources . applicants in each regional office were ranked highest to lowest and funded in that order . any residual funds that were not sufficient to fund the next project in rank order were pooled nationwide and hud headquarters used a national ranking to fund additional projects . most but not all states ( including the district of columbia and puerto rico ) had applicants that received capital advances for section 202 and section 811 in fiscal years 2008 through 2011. gao found that some states had applicants that received capital advances in each of the years reviewed , while other states did not . in the period reviewed , four states had no applicants that received section 202 capital advance awards , and eight states had no applicants that received section 811 capital advance awards . hud officials cited several reasons applicants from some states may not have received funding during this period , including applications that were submitted may have been ineligible or higher - scoring applications from other states may have been selected instead . the capital advance amounts varied . for section 202 , total capital advance amounts for fiscal years 2008-2011 for states that received at least one award ranged from less than $ 24 million to more than $ 75 million . for section 811 , total capital advance amounts for fiscal years 2008-2011 for states that received at least one capital advance award ranged from less than $ 4 million to more than $ 15 million .
the u.s. commercial space launch industry has changed considerably since the enactment of the commercial space launch amendments act of 2004. faa is required to license or permit commercial space launches ; however , to allow space tourism to develop , the act prohibited faa from regulating crew and spaceflight participant safety before 2012 — a moratorium that was extended to 2023. the u.s. commercial space launch competitiveness act , enacted in november 2015 , addressed other aspects of the commercial space launch industry . this testimony summarizes and updates findings from gao 's 2015 report , specifically industry developments and faa challenges , including faa 's launch licensing workload and budget . for its 2015 report , gao reviewed faa 's guidance on its launch permit , licensing , and safety oversight activities ; interviewed faa officials , industry stakeholders , and experts who were selected on the basis of their knowledge of faa 's oversight of the commercial space launch industry ; and visited spaceports where two 2014 launch mishaps occurred . to update this information gao reviewed faa information on the industry and faa 's budget request . in 2015 , gao reported that during the last decade , u.s. commercial space launch companies conducted fewer orbital launches in total than companies in russia or europe , which are among their main foreign competitors . however , the u.s. commercial space launch industry has expanded recently . in 2015 , u.s. companies conducted eight orbital launches , compared with none in 2011. in addition , in 2015 , u.s. companies conducted more orbital launches than companies in russia , which conducted five , or europe , which conducted six . in 2015 , gao reported that the federal aviation administration ( faa ) — which is responsible for protecting the public with respect to commercial space launches , including licensing and permitting launches — faces challenges . according to faa officials and industry stakeholders , faa faces an increasing workload licensing and permitting launches for transporting cargo , and in the future , crew for nasa 's commercial space programs , space tourism , and potentially launching small satellites . faa also faces the challenges of whether and when to regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants — in 2015 congress extended the moratorium to 2023 — and overseeing new types of vehicles and technologies . ( see figure for commercial space launch vehicles . ) . challenges also include updating faa 's method to calculate maximum probable loss — the amount above which the federal government indemnifies the industry for catastrophic loss . virgin galactic 's spaceshiptwo and spacex 's falcon 9 gao reported in 2015 that faa 's budget requests for its commercial space launch activities generally were based on the number of projected launches , but that in recent years the actual number of launches was much lower than faa 's projections . gao also reported that , according to faa officials , more detailed information was not provided in faa 's budget submissions because the agency lacked information on its workload overseeing commercial space launch activities . in addition , gao reported that the office of commercial space transportation did not track the amount of time spent on various activities . faa has taken steps to implement gao 's recommendation that it provide more detailed information in its budget submissions regarding commercial space transportation activities . in its 2017 budget submission , faa provided workload indices regarding authorizations under which companies conduct one or more launches ; on - site inspections ; licensing of spaceports ; and staffing levels since 2006.why gao did this study in 2015 , gao recommended that faa , in its budget submissions , provide more detailed information about the office of commercial space transportation 's workload . faa agreed with the recommendation . gao is not making new recommendations in this testimony .
this testimony summarizes the information contained in gao 's september 2016 report , entitled veterans affairs contracting : improvements in policies and processes could yield cost savings and efficiency ( gao - 16-810 ) . gao found opportunities for the department of veterans affairs ( va ) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its multi - billion dollar annual procurement spending in several areas including data systems , procurement policies and oversight , acquisition workforce , and contract management . shortcomings in va 's recording of procurement data limit its visibility into the full extent of its spending . a recent policy directing that medical - surgical supply orders be captured in va 's procurement system is a step in the right direction , but proper implementation is at risk because procedures are not in place to ensure all obligations are recorded . va 's procurement policy framework is outdated and fragmented . as a result , contracting officers are unclear where to turn for current guidance . va has been revising its overarching procurement regulation since 2011 but completion is not expected until 2018. meanwhile , contracting officers must consult two versions of this regulation , as well as other policy related documents . clear policies are key to ensuring va conducts procurements effectively on behalf of veterans . the figure below depicts the various sources of regulations , policy , and guidance . sources of veterans affairs ( va ) procurement policy as of june 2016 managing workload is a challenge for va 's contracting officers and their representatives in customer offices . a 2014 directive created contract liaisons at medical centers in part to address this issue , but medical centers have not consistently implemented this initiative , and va officials have not identified the reasons for uneven implementation . va can improve its procurement processes and achieve cost savings by complying with applicable policy and regulation to obtain available discounts when procuring medical supplies ; leveraging its buying power through strategic sourcing ; ensuring key documents are included in the contract file , as gao found that more than a third of the 37 contract files lacked key documents ; and ensuring that compliance reviews identify all contract file shortcomings .
va operates one of the nation 's largest health care systems , serving millions of veterans each year . for almost two decades , the department has undertaken a patchwork of initiatives with dod to increase interoperability between their respective electronic health record systems . during much of this time , va has also been planning to modernize its system . while the department has made progress in these efforts , it has also faced significant information technology challenges that contributed to gao 's designation of va health care as a high risk area . this statement summarizes gao 's august 2015 report ( gao - 15-530 ) on va 's efforts to achieve interoperability with dod 's electronic health records system . it also summarizes key content from gao 's reports on duplication , overlap , and fragmentation of federal government programs . lastly , this statement provides updated information on va 's actions in response to gao 's recommendation calling for an interoperability and electronic health record system plan . even as the department of veterans affairs ( va ) has undertaken numerous initiatives with the department of defense ( dod ) that were intended to advance the ability of the two departments to share electronic health records , the departments have not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts . in an august 2015 report , gao recommended that the two departments establish a time frame for identifying outcome - oriented metrics , define related goals as a basis for determining the extent to which the departments ' systems are achieving interoperability , and update their guidance accordingly . since that time , va has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome - oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas and has begun to establish baseline measurements . gao is continuing to monitor va 's and dod 's efforts to define metrics and report on the interoperability results achieved between the departments . following an unsuccessful attempt to develop a joint system with dod , va switched tactics and moved forward with an effort to modernize its current system separately from dod 's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system . the department took this course of action even though , in may 2010 , it identified 10 areas of health care business needs in common with those of dod . further , the results of a 2008 study pointed out that more than 97 percent of inpatient requirements for electronic health record systems are common to both departments . gao noted that the departments ' plans to separately modernize their systems were duplicative and recommended that their decisions should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches . the departments agreed with gao 's recommendations and stated that their initial comparison indicated that separate systems would be more cost effective . however , the departments have not provided a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous approaches . further , both departments developed schedules that indicated their separate modernization efforts will not be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the previous joint system approach . va has developed a number of plans to support its development of its electronic health record system , called vista , including a plan for interoperability and a road map describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018. according to the road map , the first set of capabilities was delivered by the end of september 2014 and included a foundation for future functionality , such as an enhanced graphical user interface and enterprise messaging infrastructure . however , a recent independent assessment of health information technology ( it ) at va reported that lengthy delays in modernizing vista had resulted in the system becoming outdated . further , this study questioned whether the modernization program can overcome a variety of risks and technical issues that have plagued prior va initiatives of similar size and complexity . although va 's under secretary for health has asserted that the department will complete the vista evolution program in fiscal year 2018 , the chief information officer has indicated that the department is reconsidering how best to meet its future electronic health record system needs . in prior reports , gao has made numerous recommendations to va to improve the modernization of its it systems . among other things , gao has recommended that va address challenges associated with interoperability , develop goals and metrics to determine the extent to which the modernized systems are achieving interoperability , and address shortcomings with planning . va generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
the mtw demonstration gives 39 participating public housing agencies the flexibility to use funding for hud - approved purposes other than housing assistance , such as developing affordable housing ; change hud 's tenant rent calculation ; and impose work requirements and time limits on tenants . in 2015 , congress authorized the expansion of mtw by adding 100 new agencies . gao was asked to evaluate the mtw demonstration . gao examined hud oversight of mtw agencies , including its monitoring of demonstration effects on tenants . for this report , gao reviewed hud and mtw agency policies and documentation ; interviewed officials at hud and seven mtw agencies ( selected based on type of policy changes , size , and geographic diversity ) ; and interviewed tenants served by selected agencies . gao also conducted a statistical analysis comparing data for mtw and non - mtw agencies on public housing occupancy rates , voucher utilization rates , and program expenses . the department of housing and urban development ‘ s ( hud ) oversight of the moving to work ( mtw ) demonstration has been limited . improving oversight — particularly for information collection and analysis — would help hud assess what mtw agencies have done , including funding use . hud took steps to improve oversight and reporting , but gao found limitations in the following areas : workforce planning . while hud has taken steps to address staffing to oversee the current 39 mtw agencies , hud has not finalized its workforce planning for 100 agencies to be added to the demonstration . according to a 2015 hud analysis , a large number of additional staff would be needed for the expansion . hud officials said field office staff might assume greater oversight responsibilities to fill this gap , but a joint ( headquarters - field ) oversight structure is not final and hud 's workforce analysis has not been updated to reflect this proposed oversight structure . data collection . due to limited data , hud can not fully determine the extent to which demonstration flexibilities affected the performance of mtw agencies , especially in relation to outcomes that affect the number of tenants served — occupancy and voucher utilization rates and program expenses . gao found that mtw agencies had lower yearly median rates for public housing occupancy and housing choice voucher ( voucher ) unit utilization and higher yearly median program expenses than comparable non - mtw agencies . the differences may be partly the result of demonstration funding flexibilities , such as the ability to use public housing and voucher funding for purposes such as gap financing for affordable housing ( a nontraditional activity ) . but limitations in hud data ( such as not differentiating expenses for nontraditional activities ) make it difficult to fully explain differences in outcomes gao analyzed . oversight of reserves . hud has not implemented a process to monitor mtw reserves or agencies ' plans for such reserves , which led to agencies accruing relatively large amounts of unused funds that could be used for vouchers . according to hud data as of june 30 , 2017 , the 39 mtw agencies had more voucher reserves than the 2,166 non - mtw agencies that administer the voucher program combined ( $ 808 million compared to $ 737 million ) . without a monitoring process , hud can not provide reasonable assurance that mtw agencies have sound plans for expending reserves . monitoring the effect of rent reform , work requirements , and time limits on tenants . hud is limited in its ability to evaluate the effect of mtw policies on tenants . hud does not have a framework — including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans — for monitoring the effect of rent - reform , work - requirement , and time - limit policies . hud guidance instructs agencies to analyze the impact of their rent reform activities , describe how they will reevaluate them , and develop a tenant hardship policy for such policies ( but not for time limits or work requirements ) . but the guidance does not describe what must be included in the analyses or policies , leading to wide variation in how agencies develop them . also , hud does not assess the results of agencies ' analyses . gao makes 11 recommendations to hud , which include completing workforce planning , developing processes to track use of funds and monitor agencies ' reserves , and developing a framework — including clear guidance on reporting requirements and analysis plans — to monitor effects on tenants . hud generally agreed with eight of the recommendations and disagreed with three , citing the need for flexibility . gao maintains the recommendations , as discussed further in the report .
given the role of derivatives in contributing to the 2007 — 2009 financial crisis , the dodd - frank act includes various provisions that subject the swap market and its participants to greater regulation , including section 716. proponents of section 716 sought to prohibit banks from engaging in riskier swap activities that could cause the banks to need federal assistance backed by taxpayers . opponents of section 716 maintained that swaps trading by banks did not significantly contribute to the financial crisis . in late 2014 , section 716 was amended to narrow its scope of prohibited swap activities . banks generally were required to begin complying with the amended section 716 in july 2015. gao was asked to examine various effects of the amended and original versions of section 716. this report examines the provision 's effect on u.s. banks and their bhcs , end - users of swaps , and taxpayers in light of other dodd - frank act reforms . gao analyzed publicly available data on swaps and derivatives held by banks and their bhcs and reviewed laws and regulations applicable to swaps as well as academic , industry , and gao reports , research , and other materials . gao also interviewed federal banking and swaps regulators , 15 u.s. banks that were registered as swap dealers and thus covered by section 716 , end - users that were or would have been affected by section 716 , an industry association , and experts , such as academics researching the swaps market . since the 1980s , banks have been engaging in swaps : financial contracts ( derivatives ) in which two parties “ swap , ” or exchange , payments based on changes in asset prices or other values . a variety of firms ( end - users ) use swaps to hedge risk , to speculate , or for other purposes . for example , an airline may use swaps to lock in its fuel price to hedge against a future price rise . end - users engage in swaps through swap dealers , and some large banks act as swap dealers , exposing them to risks . section 716 of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) — also known as the “ swaps push - out rule ” — requires banks registered as swap dealers , in effect , to stop engaging in certain swap activities to remain eligible for federal financial assistance but allows them to “ push out ” such activities to nonbank affiliates within the same bank holding company ( bhc ) . as originally enacted , section 716 would have covered certain equity , commodity , and credit default swaps activities , but amendments made in 2014 now cover only certain swap activity based on asset - backed securities . gao analyses of the effects of the amended and original versions of section 716 on u.s. banks and their bhcs , swap end - users , and taxpayers in light of other dodd - frank act reforms found the following : a significantly larger volume of swaps would have been pushed out under the original section 716. the amended section 716 affected four u.s. banks and caused them to push out an estimated $ 265 billion of swaps in notional value as of september 30 , 2016 , or less than 1 percent of their total derivatives . the original version would have affected 11 u.s. banks ( including the 4 banks ) and could have affected an estimated $ 10.5 trillion of swaps in notional value , or about 6 percent of their total derivatives , if the provision had not been amended . section 716 increases risks and costs for bhcs and end - users . under the amended version , banks moved their covered swap activities to nonbank affiliates , requiring the affiliates and clients to incur legal and operational costs . banks and end - users told gao that moving the swaps can increase their risks and , in turn , costs . such risks and costs likely would have been greater under the original version because of its broader scope . other dodd - frank act provisions mitigate risks . section 716 seeks to reduce a bank 's risk of failure and potential need for federal assistance , but the act 's other reforms also seek to mitigate such risks . for example , regulators have subjected banks to enhanced prudential and other requirements that can help to mitigate their swap - related risks . consistent with such requirements , gao 's analyses indicate the 11 u.s. banks that would have been affected by the original section 716 held financial resources needed to support their swap - related credit , liquidity , and market risk exposures as of september 30 , 2016. federal banking regulators and bhcs with the largest bank swap dealers are continuing to develop resolution strategies that seek to resolve a large bhc in an orderly manner and without federal assistance if it were to fail . these strategies , if successful , can help bhcs to wind - down or sell their swaps in an orderly manner and avoid value destruction .
terrorist attacks against u.s. diplomats and personnel overseas have led to increased attention of state 's diplomatic security efforts . in this special publication , gao identifies key issues affecting diplomatic security for congressional oversight . these issues were identified from a body of related gao work and state and other reports . gao also interviewed u.s. officials from state and other agencies to obtain their views on key issues , obtain updated information and data , and follow up on actions they have taken on past gao and other oversight report recommendations . in response to increasing threats to u.s. personnel and facilities at overseas diplomatic posts since 1998 , the department of state ( state ) has taken a number of steps to enhance its risk management and security efforts . state 's bureau of diplomatic security ( diplomatic security ) leads many of these efforts with assistance from other bureaus and u.s. government agencies . given the ongoing threats and the amount of resources needed to counter them , gao has identified 11 key issues regarding diplomatic security that warrant significant congressional oversight to monitor the cost , progress , and impact : diplomatic security funding : diplomatic security funding has increased considerably in reaction to a number of security incidents overseas and domestically . in fiscal year 2016 , total funding for diplomatic security operations -- which includes its bureau managed funds as well as other funding such as personnel salaries -- was almost $ 4.8 billion . diplomatic security staffing challenges : diplomatic security 's workforce -- including 3,488 direct - hire , 1,989 other u.s. government , and 45,870 contract personnel -- continues to grow . however , potential challenges exist regarding the distribution of domestic and overseas positions , posting fully qualified individuals in the assignments with the greatest needs , and ongoing efforts to fill language - designated positions . physical security of u.s. diplomatic facilities : diplomatic security and the bureau of overseas buildings operations collaborate to meet safety standards when constructing new embassies and mitigating risks at existing facilities . however , gao made recommendations to address gaps in state 's security related activities and processes . physical security of diplomatic residences and other soft targets : state has taken steps to address residential security vulnerabilities and manage risks at schools and other soft targets overseas . however , gao recommended actions to address weaknesses in state 's efforts . security training compliance : while state has robust security training requirements , it lacks consistent monitoring and enforcement processes , particularly for its foreign affairs counter threat training and for security refresher briefings at posts . embassy crisis and evacuation preparedness : gaps in state 's implementation and monitoring of crisis and evacuation preparedness could endanger staff assigned to overseas posts and the family members accompanying them . gao has recommended actions to address these issues . department of defense ( dod ) support to u.s. diplomatic missions : following the benghazi attacks , dod increased its support to u.s. diplomatic missions by creating dedicated military forces to respond to crises and expanding the marine security guard program at overseas missions . however , state and dod reported that they have experienced some logistical and other challenges . dissemination of threat information : state has processes for communicating threat information to post personnel and u.s. citizens in - country . however , post personnel -- including locally employed staff -- have not always received important information in a timely manner . gao has recommended steps state needs to take to address this concern . countering human intelligence threats : foreign intelligence entities from host nations and third parties are motivated to collect information on u.s. operations and intentions . state has established measures to counter the human intelligence threat and works with other u.s. government agencies to identify and assess this threat . ensuring information security : gao has designated federal information security as a government - wide high - risk area and made recommendations to address these issues . state faces evolving threats and challenges to maintaining obsolete technology , defining clear roles and responsibilities for information security , and overseeing technology contractors . status of recommendations made in reports following the benghazi attack : in response to the benghazi attack , state formed interagency teams to evaluate the security at 19 dangerous posts , convened an accountability review board ( arb ) to investigate the attack , and established panels to conduct further assessments . as of june 2017 , state reported having addressed recommendations as follows : 268 of 287 made by the interagency teams , 26 of 29 by the arb , and 64 of 75 by the panels . while state has taken steps to close recommendations made in past gao reports , gao identified 27 open recommendations from these reports ( as of august 2017 ) that it believes should be given high priority for implementation . of the 27 priority recommendations , 24 were related to diplomatic security .
tickets for concerts , theater , and sporting events can be purchased — typically online — from the original seller ( primary market ) or a reseller ( secondary market ) . some state and federal officials and others have raised issues about ticketing fees , the effect of the secondary market on ticket prices , and the transparency and business practices of some industry participants . event ticketing is not federally regulated . however , federal legislation enacted in 2016 restricts bots ( ticket - buying software ) . also , the federal trade commission ( ftc ) has taken two enforcement actions related to deceptive marketing by ticket sellers under its broad ftc act authority . gao was asked to review issues around online ticket sales . this report examines what is known about online ticket sales , consumer protection issues related to such sales , and potential advantages and disadvantages of selected approaches to address these issues . gao focused on concert , theater , and major league sporting events for which there is a resale market . gao analyzed data on fees , ticket volume , and resale prices from a variety of sources ; reviewed the largest ticket sellers ' websites and purchase processes ; and reviewed federal and state laws and relevant academic literature . gao also interviewed and reviewed documentation from government agencies ; consumer organizations ; ticket sellers ; venue operators ; promoters and managers ; sports leagues ; and academics ( selected for their experience and to provide a range of perspectives ) . ticket pricing , resale activity , and fees for events vary . tickets to popular events sold on the primary market sometimes are priced below the market price , partly because performers want to make tickets affordable and maintain fans ' goodwill , according to industry representatives . tickets are often resold on the secondary market at prices above face value . in a nongeneralizable sample of events gao reviewed , primary and secondary market ticketing companies charged total fees averaging 27 percent and 31 percent , respectively , of the ticket 's price . consumer protection issues include difficulty buying tickets at face value and the fees and marketing practices of some market participants . professional resellers , or brokers , have a competitive advantage over consumers in buying tickets as soon as they are released . brokers can use numerous staff and software ( “ bots ” ) to rapidly buy many tickets . as a result , many consumers can buy tickets only on the resale market at a substantial markup . some ticket websites gao reviewed did not clearly display fees or disclosed them only after users entered payment information . “ white - label ” resale sites , which often appear as paid results of internet searches for venues and events , often charged higher fees than other ticket websites — sometimes in excess of 40 percent of the ticket price — and used marketing that might mislead users to think they were buying tickets from the venue . selected approaches gao reviewed , such as ticket resale restrictions and disclosure requirements , would have varying effects on consumers and businesses . nontransferable tickets . at least three states restrict nontransferable tickets — that is , tickets whose terms do not allow resale . nontransferable tickets allow more consumers to access tickets at a face - value price . however , they also limit consumers ' ability to sell tickets they can not use , can create inconvenience by requiring identification at the venue , and according to economists , prevent efficient allocation of tickets . price caps . several states cap the price at which tickets can be resold . but according to some state government studies , the caps generally are not effective because they are difficult to enforce . disclosure requirements . stakeholders and government research gao consulted generally supported measures to ensure clearer and earlier disclosure of ticket fees , although views varied on the best approach ( for example , to include fees in an “ all - in ” price or disclose them separately ) . some market - based approaches are being used or explored that seek to address concerns about secondary market activity . these approaches include technological tools and ticket - buyer verification to better combat bots . in addition , a major search engine recently required enhanced disclosures from ticket resellers using its advertising platform . the disclosures are intended to protect consumers from scams and prevent potential confusion about who is selling the tickets .
gsa is responsible for contracts providing telecommunications services for federal agencies . transitions involving previous contracts faced significant delays resulting in increased costs . because gsa 's current telecommunications program , networx , expires in may 2020 , planning for the next transition has begun . gao was asked to review preparations for the transition . this report addresses the extent to which gsa 's plans and guidance to agencies incorporate lessons learned from prior transitions , and agencies are following established planning practices in their transitions . in performing this work , gao analyzed gsa lessons learned and transition guidance . gao also selected five agencies — usda , dol , dot , sec , and ssa — based on size , structure , and networx spending . gao then reviewed the agencies ' documentation to determine how they followed five planning practices identified in previous gao reports . the general services administration 's ( gsa 's ) transition guidance to agencies addressed roughly half of its previously identified lessons learned . gsa identified 35 lessons learned from previous telecommunications contract transitions that identify actions that agencies should take . in transition guidance released to agencies , gsa fully addressed 17 of the 35 lessons . two lessons from previous transitions were not appropriate for the current transition . gsa partially addressed an additional nine lessons . seven lessons were not addressed at all ( see figure ) . for example , gsa 's guidance did not address the previous lesson that agencies should not assume that a transition to a new contract with the same vendor will be easier than a change in vendors . by not including all lessons learned in its plans and guidance to agencies , gsa limits agencies ' ability to plan for actions that will need to be taken later in the transition . as a result , agencies face an increased risk that they could repeat prior mistakes , including those that could result in schedule delays or unnecessary costs . selected agencies — the departments of agriculture ( usda ) , labor ( dol ) , and transportation ( dot ) ; the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , and the social security administration ( ssa ) — have yet to fully apply most of the five planning practices previously identified by gao as key to a successful telecommunications transition . the practices encompass : developing inventories , incorporating strategic needs into transition planning , incorporating strategic needs into transition planning , developing a structured transition - management approach , identifying resources necessary for the transition , and establishing transition processes and measures of success . sec fully implemented one practice , partially implemented three practices , and did not implement another . the other four agencies partially implemented each of the five practices . agencies provided various reasons for not following planning practices , including uncertainty due to delays in gsa awarding the new contracts , plans to implement practices later as part of established agency procedures for managing it projects , and a lack of direction and contractor assistance from gsa . if agencies do not fully implement the practices in the next transition , they will be more likely to experience the kinds of delays and increased costs that occurred in previous transitions . gao recommends that gsa disseminate guidance that includes all agency - directed lessons learned . in addition , gao recommends that usda , dol , dot , sec , and ssa complete adoption of the planning practices to avoid schedule delays and unnecessary costs . five agencies agreed with all of our recommendations . ssa agreed with two recommendations , partially disagreed with one , disagreed with two , and provided updated information . gao stands by the recommendations , as discussed in the report , and revised the report based on ssa 's new information .
the 2005 brac round was the costliest and most complex brac round ever . in contrast to prior rounds , which focused on the goal of reducing excess infrastructure , dod 's goals for brac 2005 also included transforming the military and fostering joint activities . gao was asked to review dod 's performance outcomes from brac 2005. this report examines the extent to which dod has measured the achievement of its goals for brac 2005 and implemented prior gao recommendations on brac 2005 and addressed any additional challenges to improve performance for any future brac round . gao reviewed relevant documents and guidance ; met with a nongeneralizable selection of 26 military organizations and 12 communities involved with brac 2005 ; and interviewed dod officials . the department of defense ( dod ) components generally did not measure the achievement of goals — reducing excess infrastructure , transforming the military , and promoting joint activities among the military departments — for the 2005 base realignment and closure ( brac ) round . in march 2013 , gao recommended that , for any future brac round , dod identify measures of effectiveness and develop a plan to demonstrate achieved results . dod did not concur and stated that no action is expected . without a requirement for dod to identify measures of effectiveness and track achievement of its goals , congress will not have full visibility over the expected outcomes or achievements of any future brac rounds . of the 65 recommendations gao has made to help dod address challenges it faced in brac 2005 , as of october 2017 dod had implemented 33 of them ( with 18 pending dod action ) . dod has not addressed challenges associated with communication and monitoring mission - related changes . specifically : some military organizations stated that they could not communicate to brac decision makers information outside of the data - collection process because dod did not establish clear and consistent communications . for example , army officials at fort knox , kentucky , stated that there was no way to communicate that excess facilities were ill - suited for relocating the human resources command and moved forward without full consideration of alternatives for using better - suited excess space at other locations . as a result , dod spent about $ 55 million more than estimated to construct a new building at fort knox . dod implemented brac recommendations that affected units ' ability to carry out their missions because dod lacked specific guidance to monitor and report on mission - related changes . for example , dod spent about $ 27.7 million on a landing field for a marine corps f - 35 training squadron at eglin air force base , florida , even though it had been previously decided to station the f - 35 aircraft and personnel at another base . by addressing its communication and monitoring challenges , dod could better inform decision making , better ensure that its infrastructure meets the need of its force structure , and better position itself to achieve its goals in any future brac round . congress should consider requiring dod to identify and track appropriate measures of effectiveness in any future brac round . also , gao recommends that in any future brac round dod take steps to establish clear and consistent communications while collecting data and provide specific guidance to the military departments to monitor and report on mission - related changes during implementation . gao also continues to believe that dod should fully implement gao 's prior recommendations on brac 2005. dod objected to congress requiring dod to identify and track performance measures , but gao continues to believe this to be an appropriate action for the reasons discussed in the report . lastly , dod concurred with the two recommendations .
the u.s. navy spends at least $ 18 billion per year on shipbuilding — a portion of which is spent after ships are delivered . during the post - delivery period — after delivery from the shipbuilder and before the ships enter the fleet — navy ships undergo a variety of tests , trials , and construction . gao was asked to assess the post - delivery period , including quality and completeness of ships when they are delivered to the fleet . the senate report on the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included additional questions about ship status after delivery . this report assesses the extent to which the navy provides complete and quality ships to the fleet , has a ship delivery policy that supports those efforts , and reports ship quality and completeness to congress . gao reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of eight navy ships , six of which have entered the fleet and two that recently began the post - delivery period . gao reviewed program documentation and interviewed navy officials . gao reviewed six ships valued at $ 6.3 billion that had completed the post - delivery period , and found they were provided to the fleet with varying degrees of incomplete work and quality problems . gao used three quality assurance metrics , identified by navy program offices , to evaluate the completeness of the six ships — lpd 25 , lha 6 , ddg 112 , littoral combat ships ( lcs ) 3 and 4 , and ssn 782 — at delivery and also at the time each ship was provided to the fleet . although the navy resolved many of the defects by the end of the post - delivery period , as the table below shows , quality problems persisted and work was incomplete when the selected ships were turned over to the operational fleet . fleet officials reported varying levels of concern with the overall quality and completeness of the ships , such as with unreliable equipment or a need for more intense maintenance than expected . for cvn 78 and ddg 1000 , the navy plans to complete significantly more work and testing during the post - delivery period than the other six ships gao reviewed . as such , these ships are at a greater risk of being provided to the fleet at the end of their post - delivery periods with incomplete construction work and unknowns about quality . the navy 's ship delivery policy does not facilitate a process that provides complete and quality ships to the fleet and practices do not comport with policy . the policy emphasizes that ships should be defect - free and mission - capable , but lacks clarity regarding what defects should be corrected and by when . without a clear policy , navy program offices define their own standards of quality and completeness , which are not always consistent . further , because the navy 's board of inspection and survey ( insurv ) does not inspect ships at the end of the post - delivery period , it is not in a position to verify each ship 's readiness for the fleet , as required by navy policy . the navy has not assessed the costs and benefits of ensuring insurv does this . addressing these policy concerns would improve the likelihood of identifying and correcting deficiencies before fleet introduction and increase consistency in how the navy defines quality . the navy does not use consistent definitions for key milestones in its reports to congress — such as delivery or initial operational capability ( ioc ) — and , therefore , these milestones are not as informative as they could be regarding ship quality and completeness . for example , the navy has routinely declared ioc on new ship classes without having demonstrated that ships are able to perform mission operations — contrary to department of defense ( dod ) guidance , which , for nearly all acquisition models , generally states that ioc should be declared only after successful operational testing that demonstrates performance . the navy should revise its ship delivery policy to identify what kinds of defects should be corrected and by when and study how to best ensure that insurv verifies ships . also , the navy should reflect in its reports to congress key milestones and consistent definitions in line with dod policy . dod did not concur with two recommendations , partially concurred with a third , and fully agreed with a fourth . gao stands by its recommendations , which will help ensure that complete and quality ships are provided to the fleet and that congress is provided with meaningful information on ship status .
the navy and marine corps have identified a need to improve their ability to conduct amphibious operations — an operation launched from the sea by an amphibious force . senate and house reports accompanying bills for the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included provisions for gao to review navy and marine corps training . this report examines the extent to which the navy and marine corps have completed training for amphibious operations priorities and taken steps to mitigate any training shortfalls , these services ' efforts to improve naval integration for amphibious operations incorporate leading collaboration practices , and the marine corps has integrated selected virtual training devices into operational training . gao analyzed training initiatives ; interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of officials from 23 units that were selected based on their training plans ; analyzed training completion data ; and selected a nongeneralizable sample of six virtual training devices to review based on factors such as target audience . this is a public version of a classified report gao issued in august 2017. information that dod deemed classified has been omitted . navy and marine corps units that are deploying as part of an amphibious ready group and marine expeditionary unit ( arg - meu ) completed their required training for amphibious operations , but other marine corps units have been limited in their ability to conduct training for other amphibious operations – related priorities . gao found that several factors , to include the decline in the fleet of the navy 's amphibious ships from 62 in 1990 to 31 today limited the ability of marine corps units to conduct training for other priorities , such as recurring training for home - station units ( see figure ) . as a result , training completion for amphibious operations was low for some but not all marine corps units from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. the services have taken steps to address amphibious training shortfalls , such as more comprehensively determining units that require training . however , these efforts are incomplete because the services do not have an approach to prioritize available training resources , evaluate training resource alternatives , and monitor progress towards achieving priorities . thus , the services are not well positioned to mitigate any training shortfalls . the navy and marine corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services , but have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices to improve integration of the two services — naval integration — for amphibious operations . for example , the navy and marine corps have not defined and articulated common outcomes for naval integration that would help them align efforts to maximize training opportunities for amphibious operations . the marine corps has taken steps to better integrate virtual training devices into operational training , but gaps remain in its process to develop and use them . gao found that for selected virtual training devices , the marine corps did not conduct front - end analysis that considered key factors , such as the specific training tasks that a device would accomplish ; consider device usage data to support its investment decisions ; or evaluate the effectiveness of existing virtual training devices because of weaknesses in the service 's guidance . as a result , the marine corps risks investing in devices that are not cost - effective and whose value to operational training is undetermined . gao recommends that the navy and marine corps develop an approach for amphibious operations training and define and articulate common outcomes for naval integration ; and that the marine corps develop guidance for the development and use of its virtual training devices . the department of defense concurred .
the sfsp , a federal nutrition assistance program , is intended to provide food to children in low - income areas during periods when area schools are closed for vacation . in the last decade , federal expenditures for sfsp have increased as the program has expanded , according to usda data . gao was asked to review the sfsp . this report examines what is known about sfsp participation , other programs that help feed low - income children over the summer , and challenges , if any , in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which usda provides assistance to address these challenges . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance ; analyzed usda 's sfsp data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 ; surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the sfsp in 50 states and the district of columbia ; visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites , selected based on census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations ; analyzed meal site data from the 3 states ; and interviewed usda , state and national organization officials , and sfsp providers , including sponsors and site operators . nationwide , the total number of meals served to children in low - income areas through the summer food service program ( sfsp ) increased from 113 to 149 million ( about 32 percent ) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016. the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) directs states to use the number of meals served , along with other data , to estimate the number of children participating in the sfsp . however , participation estimates have been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year . in 2017 , usda took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates , noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning . however , gao determined that the method usda directs states to use will continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation , hindering usda 's ability to use them for these purposes . other federal and nonfederal programs help feed low - income children over the summer to some extent , according to states gao surveyed and sfsp providers and others gao interviewed . for example , in july 2016 , usda data indicate about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allows school meal providers to serve summer meals . some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith - based organizations and foodbanks , though gao 's state survey and interviews with providers and national organizations indicate the reach of such efforts is limited . states and sfsp providers reported challenges with meal sites , participation , and program administration ; usda has taken steps to address these areas . specifically , in gao 's survey , a majority of states reported challenges with availability and awareness of meal sites , as well as limited program participation and administrative capacity . national , state , and local officials have taken steps to address these issues , such as increasing outreach and offering activities to attract participation . in addition , 17 states in gao 's survey and providers in the states gao visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites are in safe locations . to address this safety issue , usda has granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on - site . however , usda has not broadly communicated the circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility . further , some states and sponsors that have requested this flexibility reported difficulty obtaining data to show these circumstances exist , hampering their ability to ensure safe meal delivery . gao is making four recommendations , including that usda improve estimates of children 's participation in sfsp and communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery . usda generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
one of the goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes to the position they occupied before the crime was committed by providing compensation . various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting , ordering , and collecting restitution for crime victims , including doj and the judiciary . the justice for all reauthorization act of 2016 includes a provision for gao to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. this report addresses , among other things : the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by doj and ordered by courts ; the amount of restitution debt doj collected and the amount that remains outstanding ; and , the extent to which doj has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution . gao analyzed laws , policies and procedures as well as ussc data on restitution orders and doj data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. gao also selected a non - generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with usao officials and federal probation officers . officials from selected u.s. attorney 's offices ( usao ) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls , such as the use of templates and forms , throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate . gao 's analysis of u.s. sentencing commission ( ussc ) data — an agency within the judiciary — showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. specifically , 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158 , or 15 percent , of those offenders . collectively , courts ordered these offenders to pay $ 33.9 billion in restitution . most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug - related offenses . in interviews , usao officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution . gao found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve ussc data . gao 's analysis of department of justice ( doj ) data showed that usaos collected $ 2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , see figure below . however , at the end of fiscal year 2016 , $ 110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding , and usaos identified $ 100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders ' inability to pay . doj identified improving debt collection — including restitution — as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 strategic plan . while doj is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution , it has not established performance measures or goals . performance measures and goals would allow doj to gauge usaos ' success in collecting restitution and , by extension , the department 's success in achieving a major management initiative . gao is making three recommendations . gao is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete . gao is making two recommendations to doj , including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution . the judiciary and doj concurred with the recommendations .
research facilities , including those managed by federal agencies , use a wide range of animals in research and related activities each year . the animal welfare act and the health research extension act have varying requirements for federal agencies and others to protect the welfare of and report on the use of different research animals to aphis and nih . gao was asked to review several issues related to animals used in federal research . this report examines the extent to which aphis and nih have provided federal facilities with guidance for reporting their animal use programs , the extent to which aphis and nih have shared agencies ' animal use information with the public , and stakeholder views on federal agencies ' sharing additional information . gao identified federal agencies that used vertebrate animals in research in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 , reviewed their reports to aphis and nih , and examined publicly available data . gao also surveyed a nongeneralizable sample of stakeholders from federal agencies and animal advocacy , research and science , and academic organizations . the department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) national institutes of health ( nih ) and the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) have provided guidance to federal research facilities on what they must report about their animal use programs under the health research extension act and the animal welfare act , respectively . federal research facilities we reviewed met nih 's reporting instructions . however , aphis 's instructions have not ensured consistent and complete reporting in three areas : research with birds , activities outside the united states , and field studies outside a typical laboratory . by clarifying its instructions , aphis could improve the quality of animal use data it receives from agencies . aphis and nih voluntarily share some information about agencies ' animal research with the public . in particular , aphis posts to its website data on agencies ' annual use of animals covered by the animal welfare act , and nih publicly posts a list of research facilities with approved animal use programs . however , aphis does not describe potential limitations related to the accuracy and completeness of the data it shares as called for by usda guidance . for example , aphis does not explain that the data do not include birds used for activities that are covered by the animal welfare act and may include field studies that are not covered by the act . aphis could increase the data 's usefulness to the public by making such disclosures . federal agencies may have additional information about their animal use programs , including data on vertebrate species used but not reported to aphis ; the purpose of research activities ; and internal inspection reports . however , stakeholders gao surveyed had different views on agencies ' sharing such data with the public . some stakeholders , particularly animal advocacy organizations , cited the need for more transparency and oversight while others , including federal agencies and research and science organizations , raised concerns about the additional administrative burden on agencies . source : gao analysis of the animal welfare act and the office of laboratory animal welfare 's public health service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals . | gao - 18-459 . a the act covers research funded by the public health service agencies of the u.s. government . gao recommends that aphis clarify its reporting instructions and fully describe the potential limitations of the animal use data it makes available to the public . usda stated that aphis will take steps to implement gao 's recommendations , with the exception of clarifying reporting instructions for activities outside the united states . gao continues to believe that aphis needs to ensure complete reporting of such activities by federal facilities .
communities are increasingly deploying iot devices generally with a goal of improving livability , management , service delivery , or competitiveness . gao was asked to examine federal support for iot and the use of iot in communities . this report describes : the kinds of efforts that selected federal agencies have undertaken to support iot in communities and how selected communities are using federal funds to deploy iot projects . gao reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 11 federal agencies identified as having a key role in supporting iot in communities , including agencies that support research or community iot efforts or that have direct authority over iot issues . gao interviewed a non - generalizeable sample of representatives from multiple stakeholder groups in four communities , selected to include a range of community sizes and locations and communities with projects that used federal support . gao also reviewed relevant literature since 2013 and discussed federal efforts and community challenges with 11 stakeholders from academia and the private sector , selected to reflect a range of perspectives on iot issues . gao requested comments on a draft of this product from 11 federal agencies . five agencies provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . six agencies did not provide comments . the internet of things ( iot ) generally refers to the technologies and devices that allow for the network connection and interaction of a wide array of devices , or “ things. ” federal agencies that gao reviewed are undertaking two kinds of efforts that support iot in communities : broad federal research and oversight of iot - related technologies and issues : for example , 8 of the 11 agencies gao reviewed are involved in broad research efforts , often on communication systems — both wired and wireless network systems . in addition , nine agencies have oversight efforts that include providing iot - related guidance , often on data security and privacy . more direct efforts to support communities , including funding community iot projects ( see figure ) and fostering collaboration among the agencies and communities : for example , dot recently awarded $ 40 million in federal funds to a community for a suite of “ smart ” projects related to improving surface transportation performance , and epa awarded $ 40,000 each to two communities to develop strategies for deploying air quality sensors and managing the data collected from them . to foster such collaboration , in july 2016 , the white house formed an interagency task force that has developed a draft smart cities and communities federal strategic plan . a final plan will be released in summer of 2017 , according to federal officials . all four of the communities that gao reviewed are using federal funds in combination with other resources , both financial and non - financial , to plan and deploy iot projects . for example , one community used the $ 40 million dot award to leverage , from community partners , more than $ 100 million in additional direct and in - kind contributions , such as research or equipment contributions . communities discussed four main challenges to deploying iot , including community sectors ( e.g . , transportation , energy , and public safety ) that are siloed and proprietary systems that are not interoperable with one another .
indian tribes and their members hold considerable energy resources and may use these resources to provide economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities . however , gao and others have found that indian energy development is hindered by several factors , such as a complex regulatory framework , bia workforce challenges , and limited access to energy markets . tribes and their members determine how to use their energy resources . in doing so , they work with multiple federal agencies with various roles in the development process — including a regulatory role , a role as provider of technical and financial assistance , or as a purchaser of energy . gao was asked to evaluate issues related to indian energy development . this report examines , among other things , federal efforts to help overcome factors that hinder development , bia 's efforts to address workforce challenges , and federal efforts to implement a preference authority to purchase energy from tribes . gao analyzed federal data and documents and interviewed tribal and federal officials . two key federal initiatives led by the department of the interior ( interior ) — the interagency white house council on native american affairs ' energy subgroup ( energy subgroup ) and interior 's indian energy service center ( service center ) — were implemented to help improve collaboration and the effectiveness of federal efforts to fulfill management responsibilities for indian lands , assist tribes in developing their energy resources , and overcome any related challenges . however , the energy subgroup and the service center have not incorporated leading collaborative practices , which may limit the effectiveness of these initiatives to address the factors that hinder indian energy development . for example , gao found the following : energy subgroup : participating agencies have dedicated few staff and financial resources to the subgroup and have not identified resources needed or a funding model — a leading practice to sustain collaborative efforts . some participating agency officials noted that the effectiveness of the subgroup is limited without dedicated resources . they also stated that key activities completed to date by the subgroup are the result of agencies voluntarily applying budgetary resources to specific activities . without dedicated resources and a funding model to support its activities , the extent to which the energy subgroup will be able to effectively accomplish its goals is unclear . service center : interior has recognized the need for collaboration in the regulatory process and described the service center as a central point of collaboration for permitting that will break down barriers between federal agencies . however , some regulatory agencies , such as the fish and wildlife service , the environmental protection agency , and the u.s. army corps of engineers have not been included as participants . without the involvement of key regulatory agencies , the service center will be limited in its ability to improve efficiencies in the regulatory process for indian energy development . gao and others have previously reported that interior 's bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) has longstanding workforce challenges that have hindered indian energy development . in this review , gao found that bia has high vacancy rates at some agency offices and that the agency has not conducted key workforce planning activities , such as an assessment of work skills gaps . these workforce issues further contribute to bia 's inability to effectively support indian energy development . federal internal control standards recommend agencies identify the key skills and competencies their workforces need to achieve their goals and assess any skills gaps . until bia undertakes such activities , it can not ensure that it has a workforce with the right skills , appropriately aligned to meet the agency 's goals and tribal priorities . a provision in the energy policy act of 2005 authorizes the federal government , the largest single consumer of energy in the nation , to give preference to tribes for purchases of electricity or other energy products . however , the general services administration ( gsa ) , the federal agency with primary responsibility for purchasing energy , has not developed guidance to implement this provision government - wide ; doing so could help to increase tribal access to the federal government 's energy purchasing programs . gao is making 10 recommendations , including that the secretary of the interior identify resources and a funding model for the energy subgroup , involve other agencies in the service center so it is a single point of contact for the regulatory process , and require bia to undertake workforce planning activities . gao is also recommending that the administrator of the gsa develop implementing guidance relating to purchasing energy from tribes . interior , doe , and gsa concurred with gao 's recommendations .
under capta , states perform a range of prevention activities , including addressing the needs of infants born with prenatal drug exposure . the number of children under the age of 1 entering foster care increased by about 15 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2015. child welfare professionals attribute the increase to the opioid epidemic . gao was asked to examine the steps states are taking to implement capta requirements on substance - affected infants and related amendments enacted in 2016. this report examines the extent to which states have adopted policies and procedures to notify cps of substance - affected infants ; state efforts to develop plans of safe care , and associated challenges ; and steps hhs has taken to help states implement the provisions . to obtain this information , gao surveyed state cps directors in all 50 states and the district of columbia and reached a 100 percent response rate . gao also visited 3 states ( kentucky , massachusetts , and pennsylvania ) ; reviewed relevant documents such as federal laws and regulations , and hhs guidance ; and interviewed hhs officials . gao did not assess states ' compliance with capta requirements . all states reported adopting , to varying degrees , policies and procedures regarding health care providers notifying child protective services ( cps ) about infants affected by opioids or other substances . under the child abuse prevention and treatment act ( capta ) , as amended , governors are required to provide assurances that the states have laws or programs that include policies and procedures to address the needs of infants affected by prenatal substance use . this is to include health care providers notifying cps of substance - affected infants . in response to gao 's survey , 42 states reported having policies and procedures that require health care providers to notify cps about substance - affected infants and 8 states reported having policies that encourage notification . the remaining 1 state has a policy requiring health care providers to assess the needs of mothers and infants and if they conclude that infants are at risk for abuse or neglect , cps is notified . in response to gao 's survey , 49 states reported that their cps agency has policies to develop a plan of safe care ; 2 reported not having such a requirement . under capta , states are required to develop a plan of safe care for substance - affected infants . although not defined in law , a plan of safe care generally entails an assessment of the family 's situation and a plan for connecting families to appropriate services to stabilize the family and ensure the child 's safety and well - being . states reported that plans typically address the infant 's safety needs , immediate medical needs , and the caregiver 's substance use treatment needs . however , officials in the 3 states gao visited noted challenges , including uncertainty about what to include in plans and the level of intervention needed for infants at low risk of abuse or neglect . the department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided technical assistance and guidance to states to implement these capta requirements . most states reported in gao 's survey that additional guidance and assistance would be very or extremely helpful for addressing their challenges . nevertheless , hhs officials told gao that the agency does not anticipate issuing additional written guidance , but that states can access technical assistance through their regional offices and the national center on substance abuse and child welfare — a resource center funded by hhs . however , of the 37 states that reported on the helpfulness of the assistance they have received , 19 said it was only moderately helpful to not helpful . states offered suggestions for improving the assistance , such as developing substance abuse training materials for staff and holding video conferences with other states to share information . in october 2017 , hhs officials explained that some states have submitted plans that include details on how they are addressing the capta requirements . hhs officials reported that some of the plans submitted to date indicated that states are not meeting the requirements and those states have been asked to develop program improvement plans . without more specific guidance and assistance to enhance states ' understanding of capta requirements and better address known challenges such as the ones described in this report , states may miss an opportunity to provide more effective protections and services for the children and families most in need . gao recommends that hhs provide additional guidance and technical assistance to states to address known challenges and enhance their understanding of requirements . hhs did not concur with the recommendation . as discussed in the report , gao continues to believe that added guidance would benefit states .
power plants ' electricity output must be matched continuously with demand , which varies depending on the time of day and year . to maintain a reliable supply of electricity , operators of the electricity grid — a complex network of power plants and power lines managed by utility companies and other operators — take steps to ensure power plants are available to generate electricity when needed . increasingly , renewable sources of energy , such as solar and wind , are being integrated into the grid . energy storage allows for electricity to be stored and used later when it is needed and could change the operating capabilities of the electricity grid . batteries and other energy storage technologies can store energy in one form — such as chemical , mechanical , or thermal energy — and transform that energy to generate electrical power at a later time . gao was asked to provide information on the role of energy storage in grid operations . this report describes how energy storage can be used to enhance grid operations and performance ; factors that affect the deployment of energy storage for grid operations ; and federal and state policies and other efforts that address the deployment of energy storage . gao reviewed studies published from 2012 through 2017 ; and interviewed 41 stakeholders , including officials from government agencies and representatives of industry and other groups based on their knowledge of energy storage and grid operations . energy storage can be used in various ways to enhance the reliability , resilience , and efficiency of grid operations , according to studies gao reviewed and stakeholders gao interviewed . such storage can be deployed throughout the electricity system and act as a generation , transmission , distribution , or customer - sited asset to provide various services , address operational challenges and needs , and potentially reduce costs , as shown in the figure below . for example , storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions and the variability of renewable energy resources , such as solar and wind ; relieve transmission congestion ; defer the need for transmission or distribution system upgrades ; and provide backup power during a power outage . examples of potential storage applications on the electricity grid various factors affect energy storage deployment . these include industry and technology readiness , safety concerns and stringency of siting requirements , increasing use of renewable resources , cost - competitiveness of storage and challenges with quantifying the value of storage , and the regulatory environment , according to studies gao reviewed and stakeholders gao interviewed . for example , industry and technical challenges include uncertainty about the performance of certain technologies over time and in various operating conditions . federal and state policymakers have used various policies and other efforts to encourage the deployment of storage and address market barriers . for example , the department of energy has undertaken various efforts , including research and development focused on improving factors that affect the cost and capacity of certain storage technologies . in addition , the federal energy regulatory commission has issued proposed and final rules to address market barriers to storage deployment in wholesale markets . lastly , state policies and other efforts that aim to encourage the deployment of storage or to address market barriers include establishing mandates and targets for storage adoption , revising planning requirements , and offering financial incentives and funding .
dod has until january 1 , 2020 , to equip its aircraft with ads - b out technology that would provide dod , faa , and private citizens the ability to track their flights in real - time and track flight patterns over time . this technology is a component of nextgen , a broader faa initiative that seeks to modernize the current radar - driven , ground - based air transportation system into a satellite - driven space - based system . senate report 114-255 included a provision for gao to assess the national defense implications of faa 's implementation of ads - b . this report assesses the extent to which dod and faa have identified operations and security risks and approved solutions to address these risks to ads - b out - equipped military aircraft ; and dod has implemented key tasks in the 2007 memorandum on implementing nextgen . gao analyzed risks identified by dod and faa related to ads - b vulnerabilities , and how they could affect current and future air defense and air traffic missions . gao also reviewed the tasks in the 2007 nextgen memorandum and assessed whether the eight tasks specifically related to ads - b were implemented . since 2008 , the department of defense ( dod ) and the department of transportation 's federal aviation administration ( faa ) have identified a variety of risks related to automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast ( ads - b ) out technology that could adversely affect dod security and missions . however , they have not approved any solutions to address these risks . compared with other tracking technology , ads - b out provides more information , such as an aircraft 's precise location , velocity , and airframe dimensions , and better enables real - time and historical flight tracking . individuals — including adversaries — could track military aircraft equipped with ads - b out technology , presenting risks to physical security and operations . this readily available public information allowed gao to track various kinds of military aircraft . ads - b out is also vulnerable to electronic warfare and cyber - attacks . since faa is planning to divest radars as part of ads - b implementation , homeland defense could also be at risk , since the north american aerospace defense command relies on information from faa radars to monitor air traffic . dod and faa have drafted a memorandum of agreement that focuses on equipping aircraft with ads - b out but does not address specific security risks . unless dod and faa focus on these risks and approve one or more solutions in a timely manner , they may not have time to plan and execute actions that may be needed before january 1 , 2020 — when all aircraft are required to be equipped with ads - b out technology . of the eight tasks associated with the implementation of ads - b out technology in the 2007 dod nextgen memorandum — issued by the deputy secretary of defense to ensure that the nextgen vision for the future national airspace system met dod 's requirements and the appropriate management of dod 's resources — dod has implemented two , has partially implemented four , and has not implemented two . dod has established a joint program office and identified a lead service , but it has only partially validated ads - b out requirements , developed a directive , issued an implementation plan , and incorporated nextgen into the planning , budgeting , and programming process . dod has not taken significant action to integrate the needs and requirements of dod components related to ads - b into cohesive plans and policies for inclusion in nextgen joint planning and development , and has not provided periodic and recurring nextgen progress reports to the deputy secretary of defense . as a result of dod not fully implementing the 2007 nextgen memorandum , dod components have lacked direction and cohesion while trying to address faa 's requirement to equip military aircraft . this is a public version of a classified report gao issued in january 2018. gao is recommending that dod and faa approve one or more solutions to address ads - b - related security risks ; and that dod implement key tasks to facilitate consistent , long - term planning and implementation of nextgen . dod and the department of transportation generally concurred and described planned actions to implement the recommendations .
during emergencies , reliable communications are critical . disasters , such as 2017 's hurricanes , continue to test the nation 's emergency communications capabilities . as disasters can cross jurisdictional boundaries , collaboration within and across regions is very important . gao was asked to review implementation of the post - katrina act 's provisions related to disaster preparedness , response , and recovery . this report examines : challenges related to emergency communications that selected stakeholders have experienced ; their views on dhs 's emergency communications assistance ; and the regional working groups established by the post - katrina act and their effect on emergency communications capabilities . gao reviewed dhs 's reports and grant data for fiscal years 2011 – 2016 and conducted case studies of three cities — houston , los angeles , and boston — selected based on the number of declared disasters , dhs grant funding , and geographic diversity . gao interviewed dhs officials ; leaders of all 10 regional working groups and other stakeholders , including public safety officials in the case study cities ; and others chosen for their expertise . selected first responders and public safety officials identified various challenges related to emergency communications . these challenges include attaining the interoperability of communication systems , obtaining funding , ensuring ongoing training , and increasing the emphasis on communications during emergency response exercises . for example , some stakeholders told gao about challenges related to equipment that is not interoperable , and others said first responders need training after investments are made in new interoperable communications equipment . to help address these challenges and as required by the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has provided technical assistance , such as training , and federal emergency management agency ( fema ) grants . it has also established regional emergency communications coordination working groups , which bring together stakeholders from different levels of government and the private sector within fema 's 10 regions . while emergency communications challenges persist , stakeholders told gao that dhs 's technical assistance generally meets their needs and that fema grants have helped them enhance emergency communications capabilities . in particular , stakeholders found training for specific communications positions was useful . houston - area officials said this training was critical in preparing first responders for hurricane harvey . some stakeholders told gao that fema grants helped them address needs that would otherwise go unfunded , including interoperable communications networks and equipment . gao found that the regional working groups have enhanced emergency communications capabilities through building relationships and sharing information . within the respective regions , group members have : assisted each other during disasters and emergencies , developed technical solutions to enhance interoperability , and addressed policy concerns , such as the use of interoperable radio channels during emergencies . however , most regional group leaders told gao that more collaboration across the groups was needed . gao 's prior work has also found that including all relevant participants can enhance collaborative efforts . further , dhs 's strategic plan for emergency communications established a vision of collaboration among stakeholders across the nation . while fema has encouraged collaboration among regional working - group leaders , cross - regional efforts have been limited and do not involve all group members . developing and implementing an appropriate ongoing mechanism for collaboration could enhance emergency communications capabilities , such as by helping group members address common challenges . without ways for all members of these groups to collaborate across regions , members may be missing opportunities to share information and leverage the knowledge and experiences of their counterparts throughout the nation . fema should work with regional working - group members to reach consensus and implement an ongoing mechanism , such as a national - level working group , to encourage nationwide collaboration across regions . dhs concurred with this recommendation .
the u.s. commercial space industry has expanded , conducting eight launches in 2015 compared with none in 2011. these launches have traditionally been from federal facilities , but as of july 2016 , there were 10 nonfederal faa - licensed spaceport operators supporting both private and federal space activity . almost all of these spaceport operators are local government entities . the complexity of the arrangements at these spaceports , and a mishap in october 2014 where the spaceport was not adequately insured , have raised questions about insurance coverage for spaceport assets , including potential federal involvement . congress included a provision in statute for gao to report on the potential inclusion of local government property in the existing indemnification regime for commercial space launches . this report examines the insurance coverage spaceport operators have in place and stakeholder views on the need to change the current insurance approach and on options for revising it . gao reviewed key documents ; interviewed faa and nasa officials and representatives of faa - licensed spaceports , launch companies , insurance brokers , and insurance companies ; and selected two spaceports to visit based on launch activity . of the 10 spaceport operators ( entities that host launches from their property ) that are currently licensed by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , 3 have had commercial activity in the last 5 years , and all 3 told gao that they have both property and liability coverage to protect themselves from losses resulting from space launch mishaps . federal laws and regulations do not require spaceport operators to have insurance , but operators of nonfederal spaceports that are located on federal property could have federal contracts that require them to have insurance to protect their own property from damage resulting from space launch mishaps . moreover , for launches licensed by faa , since the commercial space launch act amendments of 1988 , faa has required launch companies ( firms that conduct or will conduct the launch of vehicles and payloads ) to purchase insurance to cover damage to the uninvolved public , as well as damage to federal government property , in case of a launch mishap . launch participants may also choose to negotiate additional insurance coverage through launch - specific contracts . however , spaceport operators said that they find the regulations that determine financial responsibility for commercial space launches to be confusing . specifically , several spaceport operators gao interviewed said that , based on their interpretation of the financial responsibility regulations , they were unsure whether their property would be covered under a launch company 's insurance policy or whether they would need to purchase their own insurance for their property to be covered . faa 's mission includes encouraging , facilitating , and promoting commercial space launches by the private sector , among other things . furthermore , federal internal control standards state that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity 's objectives . unless spaceport operators have a clear understanding of faa 's financial responsibility regulations , a risk exists that they may not obtain adequate insurance against losses in the event of mishap . uninsured losses , in turn , could potentially cause delays in resuming commercial launches following a mishap and unnecessary costs to the federal government , both of which could hinder the development of the domestic commercial launch industry . stakeholders in the space launch industry are divided on the need to change the current insurance approach , in which insurance for spaceports is not required but can be negotiated through contracts between launch companies , which operate launch vehicles , and spaceport operators , which run spaceports . stakeholders identified some positive aspects of the current insurance approach — for example , some said that negotiating contracts specific to each launch allows for greater flexibility . however , they also raised concerns , including a lack of certainty about coverage for potential damage . gao identified two potential options for requiring protection for spaceports : requiring launch companies to purchase insurance to cover spaceport property and requiring spaceport operators to purchase insurance to cover their own property . in general , stakeholders tended to oppose the option in which the burden of purchasing the insurance was on them . specifically , most spaceport operators gao interviewed favored the first option , while most launch companies favored continuing the current approach . stakeholders discussed benefits associated with both options — for example , they said that both options could increase certainty by specifying which party was required to insure spaceport property . however , they also noted challenges , such as higher costs for the party required to purchase the insurance and decreased flexibility to customize their use of insurance depending on the details of a particular launch . gao recommends that faa provide additional communication to clarify its interpretation of the financial responsibility regulations for commercial space launches . the department of transportation provided technical comments .
helicopter air ambulances reduce transport times for critically ill patients during life - threatening emergencies . although patients typically have little to no choice over the service or provider given the often emergency nature of the transports , they might be billed for charges that have potentially devastating financial impacts . gao was asked to review air ambulance pricing . this report examines : the prices charged for air ambulance service , the factors that affect prices , and stakeholders ' views on any actions the federal government could take to address air ambulance pricing . to answer these questions gao analyzed 2 years of data ( 2010 and 2014 — the latest available ) on prices from cms and a private health insurance database ; interviewed 26 stakeholders , such as 8 air ambulance providers chosen to represent a range of types ( hospital - affiliated and independent ) and sizes ; and interviewed dot and cms officials . between 2010 and 2014 , the median prices providers charged for helicopter air ambulance service approximately doubled , from around $ 15,000 to about $ 30,000 per transport , according to medicare data from the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and private health insurance data . air ambulance providers do not turn away patients based on their ability to pay and receive payments from many sources depending on the patient 's coverage , often at rates lower than the price charged . for example , the medicare median payment was $ 6,502 per transport in 2014. air ambulance providers might bill a privately - insured patient for the difference between the price charged and the insurance payment — a practice called balance billing — when the provider lacks an in - network contract with the insurer . however , due to a lack of information it is unclear to what extent patients are balance billed . factors such as a provider 's proportion of transports provided by payer and competition may play a role in air ambulance prices charged , but data to assess these factors are not available . for example , selected providers reported that they adjust prices to receive sufficient revenue from private health insurance to account for certain lower - paid transports , such as those covered by medicare . price increases may also be tied to the industry 's characteristics such as apparent market concentration — the three large independent providers reported operating 73 percent of the industry 's total helicopters in 2016. an analysis of these factors is not possible due to a lack of currently available data such as the number of transports or the industry 's composition by provider . selected stakeholders we spoke to proposed actions to address air ambulance pricing issues , including raising medicare rates , allowing state - level regulation of air ambulance prices , and improving data collection for the purposes of investigations and transparency regarding prices . stakeholders expressed mixed views on the first two proposals but none disagreed with the third . federal internal control standards state that management should identify and communicate information needed to achieve objectives and address risks . the department of transportation ( dot ) has discretionary authority to investigate potentially unfair practices in air transportation or the sale of air transportation , but has not exercised this authority in regards to helicopter air ambulances . dot officials said they need additional information about the air ambulance industry . for example , dot officials note that they have received few air ambulance complaints since 2006 and report that consumers may not think of dot as the place to complain . although dot recently modified its online form to include air ambulance complaints , it has not communicated how to file complaints . without doing so and obtaining more industry data , dot is missing important information needed to put complaints into the context of the overall industry that could affect its assessment on whether to pursue investigations . further , stakeholders such as hospital staff could benefit from greater transparency as they currently have limited ability to make air ambulance decisions that serve both the financial interests and medical needs of the patient . the secretary of transportation should : communicate a method to receive air ambulance , including balance billing , complaints ; take steps to make complaint information publicly available ; assess available data and determine what information could assist in the evaluation of future complaints ; and consider air ambulance consumer disclosure requirements . dot concurred with all but the third recommendation , stating additional information is not needed for such purposes . gao stands by the recommendation , as discussed in this report . dot and cms also provided technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate .
tsa is responsible for securing the nation 's transportation systems and uses security technologies to screen airline passengers and their luggage to prevent prohibited items from being carried on commercial aircraft . tsa has special authority for using otas , which are not subject to certain federal contract laws and requirements . otas provide flexibility to help meet mission needs , but potentially carry the risk of reduced accountability and transparency . gao was asked to examine tsa 's use of otas . this report addresses : the extent and purposes of tsa 's use of otas , and how tsa ensures prices are reasonable and how it oversees otas . to address tsa 's use of otas , gao analyzed data on ota awards and obligations from the federal procurement data system - next generation from fiscal years 2012 to 2016 ( the most recent years for which data were available ) . gao determined that data were sufficiently reliable to report on tsa 's minimum use of otas . to examine how tsa prices and oversees otas , gao selected a nongeneralizable sample of 29 otas from the 8 tsa programs that awarded them based on program size and ota value . gao reviewed relevant documentation , and interviewed contracting and program officials . during fiscal years 2012 through 2016 , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) awarded at least 1,039 other transaction agreements ( ota ) and obligated at least $ 1.4 billion on them . these agreements , which are neither traditional contracts nor grants , were primarily used to reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated with tsa security programs . for example , tsa awarded at least 109 otas and obligated at least $ 783 million from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to reimburse airports for the allowable design and construction costs associated with installing , updating , or replacing checked baggage screening systems . tsa also used otas for intelligence analysis and to offset the costs of providing canines for explosives detection , among other things . tsa used other transaction agreements to reimburse airports for design and construction costs associated with checked baggage screening systems for the selected 29 otas gao reviewed , gao found that the methods tsa used to determine price reasonableness varied depending on the complexity of the requirement . for example , for complex design and construction projects , tsa compared independent government cost estimates with contractor bids . certified program managers monitored project schedule and scope through site visits and status reports . in contrast , tsa independently verified the rates set by the local power authority when reimbursing some airports for electricity costs to operate tsa screening equipment . gao also found that tsa has taken action to address prior lapses in oversight , resulting in improved compliance . in 2015 , tsa identified significant gaps in ota file documentation and data reported in the federal procurement data system - next generation . tsa took action to address these deficiencies by updating its policy , requiring additional training for contracting officers , instituting monthly data verification , and monitoring compliance through quarterly reviews . gao 's analysis confirmed that the quality of the data had improved between fiscal year 2012 and 2016. moreover , the 29 otas generally met key requirements of tsa 's policy that gao identified . gao is not making any recommendations in this report .
the u.s. government procures billions of dollars in goods and services each year on behalf of foreign governments through the fms program . multiple federal agencies are involved in the fms program ; however , dod manages the procurement process . the fms program is a key component of national security and foreign policy . house report 114-537 included a provision for gao to review certain aspects of dod 's acquisition process such as what effect , if any , certain types of contracts may have on the fms process . this report addresses how the use of firm - fixed - price contracts compares to other contract types awarded for fms and the reasons they are used ; and the factors that may contribute to delays or potentially increase costs . gao has other work addressing the fms process and will issue separate reports . gao analyzed fms procurement data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016 , the most current data available to determine trends . gao also selected a non - generalizable sample of 32 fms cases from seven program offices , based on use of different contract types to procure the same item ; reviewed relevant dod and federal acquisition regulations and policies ; and interviewed dod officials . over the past 10 years , firm - fixed - price contracts — where the contractor is paid a set amount regardless of incurred costs — accounted for 99 percent of contract awards and had the highest obligations for foreign military sales ( fms ) . but in recent years , there has been an increased use of fixed - price - incentive contracts — where the government and contractor share in cost savings and risks and the contractor 's ability to earn a profit is tied to its performance . this trend is consistent with recent department of defense ( dod ) contracting practices and aligns with department guidance that emphasizes the use of fixed - price - incentive contracts in certain instances where better pricing outcomes might be achieved . contracting officers generally follow the same acquisition guidance for fms procurements as they do for dod and use various contract types based on assessed risks . for example , for decades , the air force had awarded firm - fixed - price contracts for fms customers to procure an air - to - air missile , but in 2015 transitioned to a fixed - price - incentive contract when it realized the contractor could achieve cost savings through production efficiencies . legislative changes in fiscal year 2017 call for dod to use firm - fixed - price contracts for fms unless a waiver is granted . dod is in the early stages of implementing these revisions and is weighing various factors , such as how waivers will be reviewed . gao found several factors may contribute to delays or increased prices in fms . for example , program officials noted that general acquisition issues , such as delayed contract awards and unforeseen events during production , can similarly affect fms . moreover , military department officials stated that the process for defining requirements is a significant challenge that affects expediency of fms procurements . dod guidance states that programs may combine fms and domestic requirements onto a single contract as a way to lower prices and facilitate timely delivery . however , program offices gao spoke with noted that adequately defining foreign customers ' requirements may prevent them from doing so . to expedite requirements definition , the air force and army implemented checklists to aid foreign partners and program offices when specifying requirements . the navy developed but has not yet disseminated its checklists for use . gao 's analysis of 32 fms cases showed that checklists were not always available to support procurements but that program offices that used them noted increases in timeliness . expanding the use of checklists by dod may better position dod to obtain information needed to deliver equipment and services to fms customers when needed . gao recommends that dod issue department - wide guidance for program offices to expand the use of tools , such as checklists , to aid fms customers in specifying their requirements in a way that dod can act upon in a timely manner . dod concurred with gao 's recommendation .
zika — a virus primarily transmitted through mosquito bites — can cause symptoms that include fever , rash , and joint and muscle pain . in pregnant women , the zika virus can be passed to the fetus and cause severe brain defects . in response to an outbreak in the united states and its territories , congress appropriated $ 932 million in september 2016 through the zika response and preparedness act to hhs and its agencies to prevent , prepare for , and respond to the zika virus and its related health conditions , and conduct related research . the act also included a provision that gao study the activities supported with the appropriated funds . this report describes the status of funds obligated and disbursed from the zika supplemental funding appropriated to hhs and its agencies ; and how selected awardees used their zika supplemental funding , and their experiences with applying for and managing the funding . to do this work , gao reviewed agency documents on zika supplemental funding and activities , and interviewed officials from the hhs agencies and selected awardees . to select awardees , gao identified states based on the amount of initial zika supplemental funding they received from cdc , the centers for medicare & medicaid services , and the health resources and services administration ; and selected states with the highest and lowest funding . in total , gao selected 12 awardees : 10 states , as well as one county and one city from 2 of the 10 states . gao provided a draft of this report to hhs . in response , hhs provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate . as of september 30 , 2017 , department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) agencies had obligated nearly all of the $ 932 million of zika supplemental funding congress appropriated in 2016 through the use of multiple funding mechanisms , including cooperative agreements , grants , and contracts . four hhs agencies had small unobligated balances as of the september 30 , 2017 , obligation deadline ; these balances can not be used to incur new obligations , but may be used to adjust award amounts in future years . disbursement of the obligated funds was ongoing , with about 21 percent of the zika supplemental funding ( approximately $ 195.5 million ) disbursed as of december 31 , 2017. the agencies have until september 30 , 2022 , to disburse the remainder . the 12 awardees gao interviewed — officials from 10 states and two local entities — funded multiple activities with their zika supplemental funding , and had varying experiences applying for and managing the funds . awardees told gao that they used their funding to support such activities as collection of information about individuals affected by the zika virus ( human surveillance ) , mosquito control activities , laboratory capacity building , public outreach , and health care services . for example , florida used zika supplemental funding in its state - run laboratories to purchase materials for testing zika virus - related specimens . a majority of the awardees gao spoke with reported positive experiences applying for and managing the zika supplemental funding , including good communication with agency officials and awardees ' familiarity with the mechanisms used to make the awards . however , some awardees noted challenges , such as time frames to use the funding that varied among multiple awards and identifying the activities that could be funded . these challenges added administrative burdens to applying for and managing the zika supplemental funding while officials were responding to the outbreak , according to the awardees . in october 2017 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) issued a new notice of funding opportunity that agency officials said is intended to help minimize the administrative burden on states and certain localities during emergencies — such as preparing applications — by pre - approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to be eligible to rapidly receive future awards .
demonstrations — which represented roughly a third of the more than $ 300 billion in federal medicaid spending in 2015 — are a powerful tool to test new approaches to providing coverage and delivering medicaid services that could reduce costs and improve beneficiaries ' outcomes . evaluations are essential to determining whether demonstrations are having their intended effects . states are required to evaluate their demonstrations and cms can initiate its own federal evaluations of demonstrations . gao was asked to examine evaluations of demonstrations , including how the results have been used to inform medicaid policy . this report examines state - led evaluations and federal evaluations . gao reviewed evaluation documentation for eight states with high demonstration expenditures that varied in the number of years their demonstrations had been in effect and by geography . gao also reviewed documentation for the ongoing federal evaluations and interviewed state and federal medicaid officials . gao assessed evaluation practices against federal standards for internal control and leading evaluation guidelines . under section 1115 of the social security act , the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) may approve medicaid demonstrations to allow states to test new approaches to providing coverage and for delivering services that can transform large portions of states ' programs . however , gao found that selected states ' evaluations of these demonstrations often had significant limitations that affected their usefulness in informing policy decisions . the limitations included gaps in reported evaluation results for important parts of the demonstrations . ( see table . ) . these gaps resulted , in part , from hhs 's centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) requiring final , comprehensive evaluation reports after the expiration of the demonstrations rather than at the end of each 3- to 5-year demonstration cycle . cms has taken a number of steps since 2014 to improve the quality of state - led evaluations , and in october 2017 , officials stated that the agency planned to require final reports at the end of each demonstration cycle for all demonstrations . however , the agency has not established written procedures for implementing such requirements , which could allow for gaps to continue . cms also plans to allow states to conduct less rigorous evaluations for certain types of demonstrations but has not established criteria defining under what conditions limited evaluations would be allowed . federal evaluations led by cms have also been limited due to data challenges that have affected the progress and scope of the work . for example , delays obtaining data directly from states , among other things , led cms to considerably reduce the scope of a large , multi - state evaluation , which was initiated in 2014 to examine the impact of state demonstrations in four policy areas deemed to be federal priorities . though cms has made progress in obtaining needed data , it is uncertain when results from the multi - state and other federal evaluations will be available to policymakers because cms has no policy for making results public . by not making these results public in a timely manner , cms is missing an opportunity to inform important federal and state policy discussions . gao recommends that cms : establish written procedures for requiring final evaluation reports at the end of each demonstration cycle , issue criteria for when it will allow limited evaluations of demonstrations , and establish a policy for publicly releasing findings from federal evaluations of demonstrations . hhs concurred with these recommendations .
o & s costs — the costs used to operate and sustain a program — can account for up to 70 percent of a program 's total cost . end users rely on o & s funds for maintenance , spares , and personnel . dhs programs initially identify o & s costs in their life - cycle cost estimate at the outset of the acquisition . this estimate informs the program 's budget and affects the amount the department designates for the program 's use . in 2015 , gao found that dhs 's budget requests did not reflect all estimated costs — including o & s — for certain programs , which limits visibility for decision makers . gao was asked to review o & s activities for major acquisition programs at dhs . this report examines the extent that dhs 's budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight , and cost estimates are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated . gao selected a non - generalizable sample of 11 major acquisition programs , based on asset type and acquisition status , as case studies from selected dhs components . gao analyzed selected programs ' o & s cost estimates , funding , and spending . in addition , gao interviewed dhs officials at the headquarters , component , and program office level . while the department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) budget management provides flexibility to conduct operations , such as shifting funds to programs within the same mission area to cover unforeseen needs , budget reporting does not provide congress with insight into specific programs ' operations and support o & s costs . the o & s budget information that dhs reports to congress is oriented by mission — for example , integrated operations — instead of by program — for example , the multi - role enforcement aircraft program . the figure depicts the mission - oriented nature of the budget . while some program - oriented o & s data are available at the component level , this information does not appear in dhs 's budget reports to congress . this disparity is due in part to the manner in which the department reports budget information . however , these limitations are not insurmountable . standards for internal controls state that managers should communicate quality information , in this case full program costs . providing additional data on o & s costs in budget reports would preserve dhs 's flexibility in its use of funds while providing congress a better understanding of the budgetary and programmatic effect of its funding decisions . gao reviewed the o & s portion of the most recently approved cost estimates for selected programs and found that 10 of the 11 estimates provided a complete accounting of all resources and associated cost elements . further , all the programs had appropriately updated their cost estimates as required , a gao best practice in cost estimating . due to the sensitive nature of some programs ' cost models , gao could not verify all aspects of accuracy for all estimates reviewed . gao is making three recommendations , including that dhs work with congress to add program - level o & s funding details to the budget information it provides congress . dhs concurred .
research has found that sports participation yields many benefits for youth . girls ' participation in sports has increased dramatically since the passage of title ix in 1972 , but is still lower than for boys . further , investigations by ocr , which enforces and implements title ix , have highlighted instances of disparities in the resources provided to girls ' and boys ' teams . gao was asked to review how public high schools encourage equal athletic opportunities . this report examines measures public high schools and athletics administrators have taken to encourage equal athletic opportunities for boys and girls , and factors that affect boys ' and girls ' participation levels in public high school sports programs . gao conducted a nationally generalizable probability survey of athletics administrators at 784 public high schools . gao interviewed nine subject matter specialists selected to provide a range of perspectives . gao also reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance and interviewed ocr officials . according to gao 's nationally generalizable survey of athletics administrators , public high schools recently took various measures to encourage equal opportunities for boys and girls in sports . for example , a majority assessed resources such as equipment , travel opportunities , and facilities that they provided to girls ' and boys ' teams and some schools took steps to gauge student interest in specific sports as a means of encouraging equal opportunities , according to gao 's survey . education 's office for civil rights ( ocr ) guidance indicates that title ix coordinators — which school districts are required to designate and make visible per regulations for title ix of the 1972 education amendments ( title ix ) — should work closely with athletics administrators to determine whether action is needed to address any underrepresentation , or to otherwise encourage equal athletic opportunities . however , gao estimates that 51 percent of athletics administrators either were unaware of or unsupported by their title ix coordinator , according to the survey ( see figure ) . these findings raise questions as to whether title ix coordinators are familiar with and using education 's guidance . officials from an association for title ix coordinators said this lack of communication with athletics administrators may be related to some title ix coordinators ' limited understanding of title ix and athletics . ocr officials said that they did not know the extent to which title ix coordinators are working with their athletics administrators to encourage equal athletic opportunities because education generally does not collect this information . better information on title ix coordinators could help education support school districts ' efforts to encourage equal sports opportunities for girls and boys . the factors that most affect boys ' and girls ' participation in public high school sports are the number of , and interest in , participation opportunities offered , according to gao 's survey and interviews with nine subject matter specialists . though the survey provided no clear consensus on factors that discourage students from participating in sports , athletics administrators most often perceived students ' competing responsibilities as discouraging participation . gao is recommending that ocr determine the extent of k - 12 title ix coordinators ' knowledge and use of tools in its existing guidance and use this information in its efforts to encourage them to work with athletics administrators to help ensure equal athletic opportunities . education partially concurred , stating it would consider gao 's recommendation in its complaint investigations , technical assistance activities , and communication practice reviews .
recent data breaches have highlighted the importance of ensuring the security of health information , including medicare beneficiary data . such data are created , stored , and used by a wide variety of entities , such as health care providers , insurance companies , financial institutions , researchers , and others . gao was asked to conduct a study of cms efforts to protect medicare beneficiary data accessed by external entities . gao 's objectives were to identify the major external entities that collect , store , and process medicare fee - for - service beneficiary data ; determine whether requirements for the protection of medicare beneficiary data align with federal guidance ; and assess cms oversight of the implementation of those requirements . gao analyzed information about how external entities access data , reviewed cms documentation on who they share data with , compared federal standards with cms security requirements for external entities , and analyzed results of independent security reviews . gao also interviewed cms officials about their oversight activities . the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) shares medicare beneficiary data with three major types of external entities : medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) that perform processing and distribution functions that support the payment of medicare benefits ; research organizations ( researchers ) that use medicare beneficiary data to study how health care services are provided to beneficiaries ; and qualified public or private entities that use claims data to evaluate the performance of medicare service providers and equipment suppliers . cms has developed requirements for implementing security controls that align with federal guidance for two of the three types of external entities that access medicare beneficiary data . while cms has developed guidance for macs and qualified entities , it has not developed equivalent guidance for researchers . researchers must adhere to broad governmentwide standards , but are not given guidance on which specific controls to implement . according to cms , the lack of specific guidance gives the researchers more flexibility to independently assess their security risks and determine which controls are appropriate to implement ; however , without providing comprehensive , risk - based security guidance to researchers , cms increases the risk that external entities possessing agency data may not have applied security controls that meet cms standards . additionally , cms has established an oversight program for the security of mac data , but has not established a corresponding program to oversee security implementation by researchers and qualified entities . without effective oversight measures in place for researchers and qualified entities , cms can not fully ensure that the security of medicare beneficiary data is being adequately protected . regarding macs , although they are subject to two types of independent annual assessments , which have regularly identified weaknesses in their implementation of security controls , the weaknesses that have been assessed as low - risk have not been consistently tracked in the cms finding tracking system . without more consistent tracking of these low - risk weaknesses , it may be difficult for cms to determine if all weaknesses are being addressed in a timely manner . examples of categories of recurring weaknesses that have been identified during annual assessments are listed in the table . gao recommends that cms develop additional guidance for researchers on implementing security controls required by cms , consistently track results of independent assessments , and provide oversight of researchers and qualified entities . cms concurred with gao 's three recommendations and described actions it has planned or taken to address them .
the use of it is crucial to helping va effectively serve the nation 's veterans , and each year , the department spends over $ 4 billion on it . however , over many years , va has had difficulty managing its information systems , raising questions about the effectiveness of its operations and its ability to deliver intended outcomes needed to help advance the department 's mission . gao has previously reported on a number of the department 's it initiatives . this statement summarizes results from key gao reports related to increasing electronic health record interoperability between va and dod ; system challenges that have contributed to gao 's designation of va health care as a high - risk area ; and va 's development of its system for processing disability benefits , data center consolidation , and legacy systems . gao noted in july 2016 that the department of veterans affairs ( va ) had moved forward with an effort to modernize its health information system — the veterans health information systems and technology architecture ( vista ) — but that the department is uncertain of its long - term plan for addressing its electronic health record system needs beyond fiscal year 2018. beyond modernizing vista , gao reported in august 2015 that va and the department of defense ( dod ) had not identified outcome - oriented goals and metrics to clearly define what they aim to achieve from their efforts to increase electronic health record interoperability ( i.e . , the electronic exchange and use of health records ) between the two departments . moreover , va has begun to modernize vista separate from dod 's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system , even though both departments have many health care business needs in common . in 2014 , gao noted that the departments ' decision to abandon the development of a single system in favor of modernizing their two separate systems was not justified and was identified as an example of duplication among government activities . the departments have not yet provided a comparison of the estimated costs and schedules of their current and previous approaches as gao recommended . in february 2015 , gao designated va health care as a high - risk area , with it challenges being one contributing factor . specifically , gao noted that the outpatient appointment scheduling system , which is currently about 30 years old , is time - consuming to use and error prone . however , the project to modernize that system failed after va spent an estimated $ 127 million over 9 years . va has begun a new initiative to build or purchase another scheduling system . gao reported in september 2015 , that va had made progress implementing the veterans benefits management system ( vbms ) for processing disability benefits . however , the department had not developed a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing vbms . va also had not established goals for system response time , and had not minimized incidences of high and medium severity system defects for future vbms releases . further , the department had not assessed user satisfaction , or established user satisfaction goals . in addition , va 's consolidation and closure of data centers has lagged behind other agencies , as gao reported in march 2016. for example , va 's closure of 20 out of a total of 356 data centers gave the department a 6 percent closure rate through fiscal year 2015 that ranked 19th of the 24 agencies in gao 's study . also , va 's reported $ 19.1 million in cost savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015 was only about 0.7 percent of the total of about $ 2.8 billion that all 24 agencies reported saving . in addition , the department had not met any of the data center optimization areas established by the office of management and budget . va was identified in a may 2016 gao report as using antiquated and expensive to maintain , legacy it systems . at that time , the 53-year - old personnel and accounting integrated data ( paid ) system was slated to be replaced in 2017. further , va has plans to retire the 51-year - old benefits delivery network , which tracks veterans ' claims for benefits , eligibility , and death dates in 2018. gao has made numerous recommendations to va to improve the modernization of its it systems . for example , gao has recommended that va develop goals and metrics for determining the extent to which its modernized electronic health record system is achieving interoperability with dod 's ; address challenges associated with modernizing its scheduling system ; address shortcomings with vbms planning and implementation ; take actions to improve progress in data center optimization ; and modernize or replace obsolete legacy it systems . va agreed with these recommendations and said it has begun taking actions to implement them .
hipaa and its implementing regulations , as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act , require health care providers to give patients , upon request , access to their medical records , which contain protected health information ( i.e . , diagnoses , billing information , medications , and test results ) . this right of access allows patients to obtain their records or have them forwarded to a person or entity of their choice — such as another provider — in a timely manner while being charged a reasonable , cost - based fee . third parties , such as a lawyer or someone processing disability claims , may also request copies of a patient 's medical records with permission from the patient . the 21st century cures act included a provision for gao to study patient access to medical records . among other things , this report describes what is known about the fees for accessing patients ' medical records and challenges identified by patients and providers when patients request access to their medical records . gao reviewed selected hipaa requirements and implementing regulations and guidance , and relevant laws in four states selected in part because they established a range of fees associated with obtaining copies of medical records . gao also interviewed four provider associations , seven vendors that work for providers , six patient advocates , state officials , and department of health and human services ' ( hhs ) officials . the information gao obtained and its analysis of laws in the selected states are not generalizable . hhs provided technical comments on this report . available information suggests that the fees charged for accessing medical records can vary depending on the type of request and the state in which the request is made . under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) and its implementing regulations , providers are authorized to charge a reasonable , cost - based fee when patients request copies of their medical records or request that their records be forwarded to another provider or entity . in the case of third - party requests , when a patient gives permission for another entity — for example , an attorney — to request copies of the patient 's medical records , the fees are not subject to the reasonable cost - based standard and are generally governed by state law . according to stakeholders gao interviewed , the fees for third - party requests are generally higher than the fees charged to patients and can vary significantly across states . the four states gao reviewed have state laws that vary in terms of the fees allowed for patient and third - party requests for medical records . for example , three of the states have per - page fee amounts for patient and third - party records requests . the amounts charged are based on the number of pages requested and vary across the three states . one of the three states has established a different per - page fee amount for third - party requests . the other two do not authorize a different fee for patient and third - party requests . one of the three states also specifies a maximum allowable fee if the provider uses an electronic health records system . the other two do not differentiate costs for electronic or paper records . in the fourth state , state law entitles individuals to one free copy of their medical record . the statute allows a charge of up to $ 1 per page for additional copies . patient advocates , provider associations , and other stakeholders gao interviewed identified challenges that patients and providers face when patients request access to their medical records . patients ' challenges include incurring what they believe to be high fees when requesting medical records — for example , when facing severe medical issues that have generated a high number of medical records . additionally , not all patients are aware that they have a right to challenge providers who deny them access to their medical records . providers ' challenges include the costs of responding to patient requests for records due to the allocation of staff time and other resources . in addition , according to provider associations and others gao interviewed , fulfilling requests for medical records has become more complex and challenging for providers , in part because providers may store this information in multiple electronic record systems or in a mix of paper and electronic records .
to address concerns with the current medicare ffs cost - sharing design , various groups have proposed modernizing the design to make it simpler and include features found in private plans . these proposals have generally included a single deductible , modified cost - sharing requirements ( e.g . , a uniform coinsurance ) , and the addition of a cap on beneficiaries ' annual cost - sharing responsibilities . gao was asked to review how modernized cost - sharing designs would affect beneficiaries ' costs over multiple years . this report describes implications of the current cost - sharing design ; options for modernizing ; and how modernized cost - sharing designs could directly and indirectly affect beneficiaries ' costs . gao reviewed studies related to modernizing medicare 's cost - sharing design and interviewed authors of those studies and other experts . gao also used summarized medicare claims data from 2007 to 2014 ( the most recent data available ) to develop four illustrative modernized designs , each including a single deductible , uniform coinsurance , and an annual cap while maintaining medicare program spending similar to the current design . for each design , gao calculated how beneficiaries ' annual cost - sharing responsibilities compared with the current design over a 1- , 4- , and 8-year time horizon . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate . gao and others have raised concerns about the design of medicare fee - for - service ( ffs ) cost - sharing — the portion of costs beneficiaries are responsible for when they receive care . the current cost - sharing design has been largely unchanged since medicare 's enactment in 1965 , can be confusing for beneficiaries , and can contribute to overuse of services . additionally , the design leaves some beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs that can exceed tens of thousands of dollars annually . the complexity of the design and lack of an annual cap on cost - sharing responsibilities also increases demand for supplemental insurance , which can cost beneficiaries thousands annually and further contribute to overuse of services . modernizing medicare ffs 's cost - sharing design to include features found in private plans could help address these concerns , but would involve design trade - offs . for example , adding an annual cap on cost - sharing responsibilities while maintaining medicare 's aggregate share of costs similar to the current design would involve a trade - off between the level of the cap and other cost - sharing requirements . in analyzing four illustrative ffs cost - sharing designs , gao found that the direct effect of modernizing the design on beneficiaries ' cost - sharing responsibilities — that is , the effect when holding utilization and enrollment constant — would depend on the specific revisions and the time horizon examined . for example , gao found that during year 1 , cost - sharing designs that feature relatively low deductibles ( costs a beneficiary is responsible for before medicare starts to pay ) and relatively high caps would result in a median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility close to or below that of the current design . in contrast , designs with relatively low caps — and therefore greater beneficiary protection from catastrophic costs — would result in a median annual cost - sharing responsibility above that of the current design . by the end of 8 years , there would still be differences in the median annual beneficiary cost - sharing responsibility across different designs , but they would become less pronounced . modernizing the medicare ffs cost - sharing design would also affect beneficiaries ' costs indirectly through altered incentives . the studies gao reviewed and experts gao interviewed identified several types of behavioral responses that would influence the net effect of a modernized design on beneficiaries ' out - of - pocket costs , including changes in beneficiaries ' demand for and insurers ' supply of supplemental insurance ; changes in beneficiaries ' use of services ; changes in medicare beneficiaries ' enrollment in ffs versus medicare 's private plan alternative ; and interactions among these and other behavioral responses , including effects on the price of supplemental insurance .
a careful consideration of federal pay is an essential part of fiscal stewardship and is necessary to support the recruitment and retention of a talented , agile , and high - performing federal workforce . high - performing organizations have found that the life - cycle of human capital management activities — including workforce planning , recruitment , on - boarding , compensation , engagement , succession planning , and retirement programs — need to be aligned for the cost - effective achievement of an organization 's mission . however , despite some improvements , strategic human capital management — and more specifically , skills gaps in mission critical occupations — continues to be a gao high - risk area . this testimony is based on a body of gao work primarily issued between june 2012 and march 2017. it focuses on lessons learned in creating a more market driven , results - oriented approach to federal pay , and opportunities , in addition to pay and benefits , that opm and agencies could use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps . gao 's prior work has shown that implementing a market - based and more performance - oriented federal pay system is both doable and desirable , and should be part of a broader strategy of change management and performance improvement initiatives . in 2005 , gao identified the following key themes that highlight the leadership and management strategies high - performing organizations collectively considered in designing and managing a pay system that is performance oriented , affordable , and sustainable . specifically , they : 1. focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system . 2. examine the value of employees ' total compensation to remain competitive in the labor market . 3. build in safeguards to enhance the transparency and ensure the fairness of pay decisions . 4. devolve decision - making on pay to appropriate levels . 5. provide clear and consistent communication so that employees at all levels can understand how compensation reforms are implemented . 6. build consensus to gain ownership and acceptance for pay reforms . 7. monitor and refine the implementation of the pay system . while the federal compensation system may need to be re - examined , congress has already provided agencies with tools and flexibilities to build and maintain a high - performing workforce . they include , for example : hiring process gao reported in 2016 that the office of personnel management ( opm ) and selected agencies had not evaluated the effectiveness of hiring authorities . by evaluating them , of which over 100 were used in 2014 , opm and agencies could identify ways to expand access to those found to be more effective , and eliminate those found to be less effective . general schedule ( gs ) classification system the federal government has become more highly skilled and specialized than the gs classification system was designed to address at its inception in 1949. opm and stakeholders should examine ways to make the classification system consistent with attributes gao identified of a modern , effective classification system , such as internal and external equity . performance management credible and effective performance management systems are a strategic tool to achieve organizational results . these systems should emphasize “ a line a sight ” between individual performance and organizational success , and use core competencies to reinforce organizational objectives , among other things . human resources capacity the human resources specialist occupation is a mission critical skills gap area . chief human capital officers have reported that human resources specialists do not have the skills to lead strategic human capital management activities . strengthening this capacity could help agencies better meet their missions . over the years , gao has made recommendations to agencies and opm to improve their strategic human capital management efforts . opm and agencies generally concurred . this testimony discusses actions taken to implement key recommendations to improve federal hiring and classification .
the united states belongs to several inter - american organizations , including the oas , paho , iica , and paigh , which promote democracy , security , health care , agricultural development , and scientific exchange in the western hemisphere . the united states helps finance these organizations ' operating expenses through assessed contributions . the united states also provides voluntary contributions through the federal funding of assistance agreements to oas , paho , and iica . this testimony is based on gao 's june and december 2017 reports that , among other things , determined the amounts and percentages of u.s. assessed contributions to the four organizations , assessed the extent to which u.s. agencies included and documented key monitoring provisions as part of their assistance agreements , and assessed the extent to which the organizations ' strategic goals align with those of u.s. agencies . gao analyzed documents and interviewed officials from state , hhs , usaid , usda , and the four organizations . gao analyzed the four organizations ' audited financial reports and a nongeneralizable sample of 12 assistance agreements awarded by state , usaid , hhs , and usda active in calendar years 2014 through 2016. while the united states ' assessed contributions constituted over 57 percent of total assessed contributions by member states to four inter - american organizations from 2014 to 2016 , the u.s. share may be reduced in the near future ( see table ) . in response to a statutory requirement , the u.s. department of state ( state ) said it submitted to congress a strategy that included working with the organization of american states ( oas ) member states toward ensuring that the oas would not assess any single member state a contribution amounting to more than 50 percent of all oas assessed contributions . at the oas general assembly in june 2017 , oas member states voted to draft a proposal to modify its system for determining member states ' assessed contributions to potentially reduce the maximum assessed contribution to below 50 percent . the other three organizations use oas 's system for setting assessed contributions . hence , any change in contributions at oas should also be reflected at pan american health organization ( paho ) , inter - american institute for cooperation on agriculture ( iica ) , and the pan - american institute of geography and history ( paigh ) . state , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) , and the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) provide voluntary contributions to oas , paho , and iica in the form of assistance agreements ( e.g . , grants and cooperative agreements ) . in december 2017 , gao reported that its review of 12 such agreements across the four agencies found that state and usda did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance . state has since taken corrective action . gao also found that all four u.s. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements gao reviewed . for example , usda did not have full documentation , such as financial reports , of any of its 10 required monitoring activities , and usaid did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required activities . state and hhs said they initiated corrective action before our review . if an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities , it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions . gao found that the strategic goals of the oas , paho , iica , and paigh are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of state , usaid , hhs , and usda . according to agency officials , the agencies employ mechanisms to ensure that assistance agreements with these organizations align with u.s. goals . in its december 2017 report , gao recommended that usda ensure inclusion of all monitoring provisions as part of agreements and usaid and usda ensure full documentation of monitoring activities . usda and usaid concurred with gao 's recommendations .
indian tribes and their members hold considerable energy resources and may decide to use these resources to provide economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities . however , according to a 2014 interior document , these resources are underdeveloped relative to surrounding non - indian resources . development of indian energy resources is a complex process that may involve federal , tribal , and state agencies . interior 's bia has primary authority for managing indian energy development and generally holds final decision - making authority for leases , permits , and other approvals required for development . gao 's 2017 biennial update to its high risk list identifies federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members as a new high risk area needing attention by congress and the executive branch . this testimony highlights the key findings of three prior gao reports ( gao - 15-502 , gao - 16-553 , and gao - 17-43 ) . it focuses primarily on bia 's management of indian energy resources and development . for the prior reports , gao analyzed federal data ; reviewed federal , academic , and other literature ; and interviewed tribal , federal and industry stakeholders . in three prior reports on indian energy development , gao found that the department of the interior 's ( interior ) bureau of indian affairs ( bia ) has inefficiently managed indian energy resources and the development process and thereby limited opportunities for tribes and their members to use those resources to create economic benefits and improve the well - being of their communities . gao has also reported numerous challenges facing interior 's bureau of indian education and bia and the department of health and human services ' indian health services in administering education and health care services , which put the health and safety of american indians served by these programs at risk . for the purposes of this testimony , gao is focusing on the concerns related to indian energy . gao categorized concerns associated with bia management of energy resources and the development process into several broad areas , including oversight of bia activities , collaboration , and bia workforce planning . oversight of bia activities . in a june 2015 report , gao found that bia review and approval is required throughout the development process . however , bia does not have a documented process or the data needed to track its review and response times — such as data on the date documents are received , the date the review process is considered complete , and the date documents are approved or denied . gao recommended that bia develop a documented process to track its review and response times . interior generally agreed and stated it would try to implement a tracking and monitoring mechanism by the end of fiscal year 2017 for oil and gas leases . interior did not indicate whether it intends to track and monitor its review of other energy - related documents that must be approved before tribes can develop resources . collaboration . in a november 2016 report , gao found that bia has taken steps to form an indian energy service center that is intended to , among other things , help expedite the permitting process associated with indian energy development . however , bia did not coordinate with key regulatory agencies , including interior 's fish and wildlife service , the environmental protection agency and the u.s. army corps of engineers . gao recommended that bia include other regulatory agencies in the service center so that it can act as a single point of contact or lead agency to coordinate and navigate the regulatory process . interior agreed with our related recommendation and described plans to address it . bia workforce planning . in june 2015 and in november 2016 , gao reported concerns associated with bia 's long - standing workforce challenges , such as inadequate staff resources and staff at some offices without the skills needed to effectively review energy - related documents . gao recommended that bia assess critical skills and competencies needed to fulfill its responsibilities related to energy development , and that it establish a documented process for assessing bia 's workforce composition at agency offices . interior agreed with our recommendations and stated it is taking steps to implement them . in the past 2 years , gao issued three reports and made 14 recommendations to bia to improve its management of indian energy resources , such as to track its review process , improve collaboration , and conduct workforce planning . bia agreed with most recommendations and identified some steps it intends to take to implement them .
superfund is epa 's principal program to address sites with hazardous substances , and some of the most seriously contaminated of these sites are listed on the npl . many of these sites can affect indian tribes or their land . epa has a policy to consult with tribes when epa actions or decisions may affect tribal interests , including on cleanup of npl sites that are on tribal property or that affect tribes . gao was asked to analyze npl sites that are on tribal property or that affect tribes and epa 's consultation with tribes at these sites . this report : examines the extent to which epa has reliable data identifying npl sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes , examines the extent to which epa has reliable data on the agency 's consultation with tribes regarding npl sites , and describes the actions epa has taken to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions at superfund sites . gao reviewed laws and policies , assessed epa data on npl sites , and interviewed epa and tribal officials about cleanup actions and consultations at six non - generalizable npl sites selected in part for their geographic diversity . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) does not have reliable data identifying national priorities list ( npl ) sites that are located on tribal property or that affect tribes . specifically , epa collects data on whether sites are on tribal property or have native american interest ( a data variable indicating sites where tribal members or tribal land would be directly affected by the release of hazardous substances ) , as well as which tribes are associated with npl sites . however , epa 's data are not always accurate or complete for a number of reasons . for example , epa can have difficulty identifying some tribal property boundaries , and npl site boundaries may evolve as the site is investigated and remediated . epa does not have a regular review process for its data on whether an npl site is on tribal property . in addition , epa 's guidance for determining whether a site has native american interest is unclear , and regions may not interpret it consistently . without improving its review process and clarifying its guidance , epa will not have reasonable assurance that its data on tribes that are affected by npl sites are accurate or complete . epa consults with tribes when actions at an npl site may affect tribal interests , but the agency does not have reliable data on its consultations with tribes . data from epa 's system for tracking consultation did not include documentation of some consultations that gao confirmed had occurred . one possible reason that epa data are incomplete is that the agency 's policy is unclear on which interactions are considered consultation and are therefore to be documented in epa 's system of record , which is not consistent with federal standards for internal control . epa 's policy provides a broad definition of consultation and specifies which staff are responsible for determining when consultation may be appropriate . however , the policy does not provide further guidance on the circumstances under which consultation should be considered . for example , it does not specify any specific points in the hazardous substance cleanup process at which consultation should be considered or provide further detail on which tribal interests should be considered when determining if tribal interests on npl sites are affected . without clarifying guidance to clearly define circumstances under which consultation with tribes should be considered , epa can not have reasonable assurance that it is applying its consultation policy consistently . epa has taken various actions to address the unique needs of tribes when making decisions about cleanup actions . these actions include minimizing tribal members ' exposure to contaminants because of tribal lifestyle ( e.g . , greater consumption of local fish and game ) and limiting potential damage to culturally important sites . for example , epa officials said that at one site , they altered the design and route of the roads used to remove contaminated materials to minimize the impact of cleanup activities ' on cultural resources . epa also published a memorandum in 2017 with recommendations on considering tribes ' traditional ecological knowledge in the cleanup process if tribes offer it . gao is making four recommendations to epa , including that it take actions to improve the data it collects and to clearly define circumstances under which consultation with tribes should be considered . epa generally agreed with gao 's recommendations .
dhs plays a key role in federal cybersecurity . fisma authorized dhs , in consultation with the office of management and budget , to develop and oversee the implementation of compulsory directives — referred to as binding operational directives — covering executive branch civilian agencies . these directives require agencies to safeguard federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat , vulnerability , or risk . since 2015 , dhs has issued eight directives that instructed agencies to , among other things , mitigate critical vulnerabilities discovered by dhs through its scanning of agencies ' internet - accessible systems ; address urgent vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices identified by dhs ; and better secure the government 's highest value and most critical information and system assets . gao was requested to evaluate dhs 's binding operational directives . this report addresses dhs 's process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives and the effectiveness of the directives , including agencies ' implementation of the directive requirements . gao selected for review the five directives that were in effect as of december 2018 , and randomly selected for further in - depth review a sample of 12 agencies from the executive branch civilian agencies to which the directives apply . the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has established a five - step process for developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives , as authorized by the federal information security modernization act of 2014 ( fisma ) . the process includes dhs coordinating with stakeholders early in the directives ' development process and validating agencies ' actions on the directives . however , in implementing the process , dhs did not coordinate with stakeholders early in the process and did not consistently validate agencies ' self - reported actions . in addition to being a required step in the directives process , fisma requires dhs to coordinate with the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) to ensure that the directives do not conflict with existing nist guidance for federal agencies . however , nist officials told gao that dhs often did not reach out to nist on directives until 1 to 2 weeks before the directives were to be issued , and then did not always incorporate the nist technical comments . more recently , dhs and nist have started regular coordination meetings to discuss directive - related issues earlier in the process . regarding validation of agency actions , dhs has done so for selected directives , but not for others . dhs is not well - positioned to validate all directives because it lacks a risk - based approach as well as a strategy to check selected agency - reported actions to validate their completion . directives ' implementation often has been effective in strengthening federal cybersecurity . for example , a 2015 directive on critical vulnerability mitigation required agencies to address critical vulnerabilities discovered by dhs cyber scans of agencies ' internet - accessible systems within 30 days . this was a new requirement for federal agencies . while agencies did not always meet the 30-day requirement , their mitigations were validated by dhs and reached 87 percent compliance by 2017 ( see fig . 1 ) . dhs officials attributed the recent decline in percentage completion to a 35-day partial government shutdown in late 2018 / early 2019. nevertheless , for the 4-year period shown in the figure below , agencies mitigated within 30 days about 2,500 of the 3,600 vulnerabilities identified . agencies also made reported improvements in securing or replacing vulnerable network infrastructure devices . specifically , a 2016 directive on the threat to network infrastructure devices addressed , among other things , several urgent vulnerabilities in the targeting of firewalls across federal networks and provided technical mitigation solutions . as shown in figure 2 , in response to the directive , agencies reported progress in mitigating risks to more than 11,000 devices as of october 2018. in addition , gao reviewed dhs policies and processes related to the directives and assessed them against fisma and office of management and budget requirements ; administered a data collection instrument to selected federal agencies ; compared the agencies ' responses and supporting documentation to the requirements outlined in the five directives ; and collected and analyzed dhs 's government - wide scanning data on government - wide implementation of the directives . gao also interviewed dhs and selected agency officials . gao is making four recommendations to dhs : determine when in the directive development process — for example , during early development and at directive approval — coordination with relevant stakeholders , including nist , should occur ; develop a strategy for when and how to independently validate selected agencies ' self - reported actions on meeting directive requirements , where feasible , using a risk - based approach ; ensure that the directive performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified in high value asset assessments aligns with the process dhs has established ; and develop a schedule and plan for completing the high value asset program reassessment and addressing the outstanding issues on completing the required assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance to agencies and third parties . dhs concurred with gao 's recommendations and outlined steps and associated timelines that it planned to take to address the recommendations . another key dhs directive is securing high value assets , an initiative to protect the government 's most critical information and system assets . according to this directive , dhs is to lead in - depth assessments of federal agencies ' most essential identified high value assets . however , an important performance metric for addressing vulnerabilities identified by these assessments does not account for agencies submitting remediation plans in cases where weaknesses can not be fully addressed within 30 days . further , dhs only completed about half of the required assessments for the most recent 2 years ( 61 of 142 for fiscal year 2018 , and 73 of 142 required assessments for fiscal year 2019 ( see fig . 3 ) ) . in addition , dhs does not plan to finalize guidance to agencies and third parties , such as contractors or agency independent assessors , for conducting reviews of additional high value assets that are considered significant , but are not included in dhs 's current review , until the end of fiscal year 2020. given these shortcomings , dhs is now reassessing key aspects of the program . however , it does not have a schedule or plan for completing this reassessment , or to address outstanding issues on completing required assessments , identifying needed resources , and finalizing guidance to agencies and third parties .
amid concerns about the ability of dod 's acquisition process to keep pace with evolving threats , congress included numerous reforms in recent national defense authorization acts that could help to streamline acquisition oversight and field capabilities faster . gao was asked to examine dod 's efforts to implement these reforms . this report addresses the progress dod has made implementing selected oversight reforms related to major defense acquisition programs ; how dod has used middle - tier acquisition pathways ; and challenges dod faces related to reform implementation . gao reviewed five reforms : milestone decision authority designation ; cost , fielding , and performance goals ; independent technical risk assessments ; restructuring of acquisition oversight offices ; and middle - tier acquisition . gao analyzed applicable statutes and implementing guidance , collected information from dod about the number and types of middle - tier acquisition programs , reviewed relevant documentation , and interviewed dod officials . the department of defense ( dod ) has made progress in implementing reforms to restructure the oversight of major defense acquisition programs . as a result of one of these reforms , decision - making authority for many programs shifted from the office of the secretary of defense to the military departments ( see figure ) . questions remain about how some reforms gao reviewed will be carried out . for example , no programs have been required to have cost and fielding goals set under dod 's new process yet , and dod has formed a working group to determine when to delegate risk assessments to the military departments . dod also began using new pathways referred to as middle - tier acquisition to rapidly prototype and field new weapon systems . middle - tier programs are expected to field capabilities within 2 to 5 years . as of march 2019 , military departments were using this authority for 35 unclassified programs ( see table ) . source : gao analysis of department of defense data . | gao - 19-439 dod has yet to fully determine how it will oversee middle - tier acquisition programs , including what information should be required to ensure informed decisions about program selection and how to measure program performance . without consistent oversight , dod is not well positioned to ensure that these programs — some of which are multibillion dollar acquisitions — are likely to meet expectations for delivering prototypes or capability to the warfighter quickly . dod also continues to face implementation challenges , including one related to disagreements about oversight roles and responsibilities between the office of the secretary of defense and the military departments . senior dod leadership has not fully addressed these disagreements . as a result , dod is at risk of not achieving an effective balance between oversight and accountability and efficient program management . gao is making four recommendations , including that dod should identify the types of information needed to select and oversee middle - tier acquisition programs consistently , and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the office of the secretary of defense and the military departments for acquisition oversight . dod concurred with gao 's recommendations and described actions planned to address them .
poverty can have a profound effect on academic outcomes and college readiness and students from low - income families are less likely to go to college . the low rates of degree attainment for low - income students raises questions about whether the students who wish to pursue higher education have access to courses that support their readiness for college . gao was asked to review college preparatory course offerings in u.s. high schools . this report examines the extent to which high schools of different poverty levels offer courses to prepare students academically for college , and describes the challenges students in high - poverty schools face being prepared to attend college . gao analyzed 2015-16 education data on course offerings by school poverty level , type , and size , and developed a generalized linear regression model to explore whether certain school - level characteristics may be associated with course offerings ; reviewed a generalizable sample of public 4-year college websites for course requirements for admission ; and interviewed officials from education and the department of justice . gao also conducted site visits to 12 high - poverty high schools in 3 states selected to provide variation in course offerings , among other things . in this review , gao focused on public 4-year colleges because they offer a bachelor 's degree and are generally a more affordable 4-year option . students in relatively poor and small schools had less access to high school courses that help prepare them for college , according to gao 's analysis of department of education ( education ) data for school year 2015-16 ( the most recent available ) . while most public high schools , regardless of poverty level , offered courses like algebra and biology , disparities in access were associated with school poverty level for more advanced courses like calculus , physics , and those that may allow students to earn college credit , like advanced placement ( ap ) courses ( see figure ) . high - poverty schools were less likely to offer the math and science courses that most public 4-year colleges expect students to take in high school , according to gao 's analysis of college websites . gao 's regression analysis also showed that smaller schools and certain types of schools , like charter schools , are less likely to offer the college preparatory math or science courses that many colleges look for during the admissions process . officials gao interviewed in selected high - poverty high schools said their students can face a number of complex challenges in preparing for college . for instance , officials said that many students are academically behind when they enter high school and are unable to progress to more advanced courses . further , high - poverty schools may not offer rigorous courses , such as ap courses , due to lack of resources or teaching staff . students in high - poverty schools also face other stressors that can make going to college challenging . officials at 9 of the 12 schools gao visited cited the effects of poverty on their students , such as homelessness , hunger , and trauma , that make preparing for college difficult . school officials also said the steps involved in applying to and enrolling in college can be difficult to navigate for many students in high - poverty schools . officials in selected schools reported efforts to address these challenges , such as offering free college courses and obtaining outside supports to assist with college advising .
the military services ' 21 depots maintain the readiness of critical weapon systems such as ships , aircraft , and tanks needed for military operations . the condition of depot facilities and equipment directly affects the timeliness of maintenance and the readiness of the weapon systems they repair . the services have invested over $ 13 billion in the depots from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2017. senate report 115-125 included a provision for gao to examine the services ' investment in and performance of their depots . gao evaluated the condition of depot facilities and equipment , their relationship to depot performance , and the services ' tracking of the relationship to depot performance and the extent to which dod and the services have developed an approach for guiding depot investments to address key challenges . gao also provides an overview summary for each depot . gao reviewed data from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 on depot investment , performance , and the age and condition of facilities and equipment ; reviewed agency guidance ; and interviewed dod , service , and depot officials . the condition of facilities at a majority of the department of defense 's ( dod ) depots is poor and the age of equipment is generally past its useful life , but the services do not consistently track the effect that these conditions have on depot performance . twelve of the 21 depots gao reviewed – – more than half – – had “ poor ” average facility condition ratings ( see figure ) . some facilities also serve functions for which they were not designed , reducing their efficiency . in addition , the average age of depot equipment exceeded its expected useful life at 15 of the 21 depots . these factors contributed , in part , to a decline in performance over the same period . from 2007 to 2017 , performance at the depots generally declined , reducing the availability of the weapon systems repaired for training and operations . optimizing facilities and equipment at the depots can improve their maintenance efficiency . for example , the navy estimates that its shipyard optimization effort will save over 325,000 labor days per year , which would allow an additional submarine overhaul annually . however , the services lack data on the effect that facilities and equipment conditions have on maintenance delays , hindering dod 's ability to effectively target investments to the highest priorities . dod and the services ' approach for managing investments to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its depots lacks elements important to addressing key challenges . the services have efforts underway to complete their plans by february 2019 to address their depots ' facility and equipment needs . however , gao found that these plans are preliminary and will not include key elements , such as analytically - based goals ; results - oriented metrics ; a full accounting of the resources , risks , and stakeholders ; and a process for reporting on progress . addressing the poor conditions at dod 's 21 depots will cost billions and require sustained management attention over many years . however , the dod office responsible for depot policy does not monitor or regularly report on depot improvement efforts to dod decision makers and congress . until dod and the services incorporate these key elements into the management approach for their depot investments , they risk continued deterioration of the depots , hindering their ability to meet the secretary of defense 's goals for improving readiness and reducing operating and support costs . gao is making 13 recommendations to improve data collection on the effect of facilities and equipment condition on depot performance , and develop plans that incorporate key elements to guide depot investments . dod concurred with 12 recommendations , but did not agree to monitor and report on depot investments . we continue to believe monitoring and reporting will enhance dod 's efforts to improve its depots .
va is responsible for providing benefits and services to veterans , including health care , disability compensation , and various types of financial assistance . in fiscal year 2019 , va received a total budget of $ 201.1 billion and a discretionary budget of $ 86.6 billion — the largest in va 's history — to carry out its mission . gao , along with the va inspector general and other entities , continues to identify significant deficiencies in va 's governance structures and operations — all of which can affect the care provided to our nation 's veterans . this testimony focuses on the status of va 's efforts to address gao 's high - risk designations and open gao recommendations in the following areas : va health care , acquisition management , and disability claims workloads and benefit eligibility criteria , among other areas . it is primarily based on gao 's march 2019 high - risk update and a body of work that spans more than a decade . the department of veterans affairs ( va ) has longstanding management challenges . as a result , gao added several va programs to its high - risk list . this list focuses attention on government operations that are most vulnerable to fraud , waste , abuse , or mismanagement , or in need of transformation . these include managing risks and improving va health care , va acquisition management , and improving and modernizing va disability programs , including managing claims and updating eligibility criteria . va health care was designated high risk in 2015 due to concerns about va 's ability to ensure the cost - effective and efficient use of resources to improve the timeliness , quality , and safety of health care for veterans . gao identified five areas of concern : ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes ; inadequate oversight and accountability ; information technology challenges ; inadequate training for va staff ; and unclear resource needs and allocation priorities . va 's efforts to address each of these areas have been impeded by leadership instability . however , since his july 2018 confirmation , secretary wilkie has demonstrated his commitment to address the department 's high - risk designations . his actions to date have allowed the department to maintain its leadership commitment rating of partially met in gao 's 2019 high - risk update . va also partially met the action plan criteria . as of march 2019 , it did not meet the other three criteria for removal from the high - risk list ( agency capacity , monitoring , and demonstrated progress ) . this is , in part , because gao continues to have audit findings that illustrate that the five areas of concern have not been fully addressed . for example : in a series of reports from 2012 through 2018 , gao found va 's wait time data unreliable for primary and specialty care as well as for care in the community . gao also found that va did not measure the full wait times that veterans experience in obtaining care across these settings . in november 2017 , gao reported that va medical center officials did not always conduct or document timely required reviews of providers when allegations of wrongdoing were made against them . in april 2019 , gao found that va 's governance plan for modernizing its electronic health record system was not fully defined , potentially jeopardizing its fourth attempt at modernization . in april 2019 , gao reported that va 's appraisal process for assessing medical center director performance relies heavily on a system with long - identified deficiencies that remain unaddressed , thus diminishing va 's ability to hold officials accountable . in its 2019 high - risk report , gao added va acquisition management as a high - risk area in light of the department 's numerous contracting challenges and the significant federal investment in serving veterans . to date , gao has identified challenges in the following areas : outdated acquisition regulations and policies ; lack of an effective medical supplies procurement strategy ; inadequate acquisition training ; contracting officer workload challenges ; lack of reliable data systems ; limited contract oversight and incomplete contract documentation ; and leadership instability . for example , as of may 2019 , va does not have updated acquisition regulations and officials expect to have a full update by 2021 ; a process which has been in place since 2011. gao designated improving and modernizing federal disability programs , including va 's program , as high risk in 2003. gao identified two areas of concern related to va : managing disability claims workload and updating disability benefit eligibility criteria . as a result of these concerns , veterans may not have their disability claims and appeals processed in a timely manner . gao reported in march 2018 that va is making a major effort to reform its appeals process by onboarding new staff and implementing new technology . however , its appeals planning process does not provide reasonable assurance that it will have the capacity to successfully implement the new process and manage risks . va agreed with gao 's recommendation to better assess risks associated with appeals reform . va leadership has committed to addressing gao 's high - risk concerns and has launched several transformational efforts . for example , va is currently implementing the veterans health administration plan for modernization , a framework that aims to modernize the department , as well as the va mission act of 2018. this act requires va to consolidate programs that allow veterans to receive care outside va. if successful , these efforts could be transformative for va. however , such success will only be achieved through sustained leadership attention and detailed action plans that include metrics and milestones to monitor and demonstrate va 's progress . sustained congressional oversight will also be essential . since 2000 , gao has made more than 1,200 recommendations to reduce va 's high - risk challenges , and va has implemented approximately 70 percent . gao will continue to monitor va 's progress in implementing the remaining open recommendations .
following hurricane katrina , congress required fema to establish advance contracts for goods and services to enable the government to quickly and effectively mobilize resources in the aftermath of a disaster , like those that affected the united states in 2017. gao was asked to review the federal government 's response to the three 2017 hurricanes and california wildfires . this report assesses , among other things , fema and usace 's use of advance contracts , fema 's planning and reporting of selected advance contracts , and challenges , if any , with fema 's use of these contracts . gao analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation through may 31 , 2018 ; selected a non - generalizable sample of 14 fema and usace advance contracts that were competed and obligated over $ 50 million , or non - competed and obligated over $ 10 million , in response to the 2017 disasters ; and interviewed fema and usace officials . in response to hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , as well as the 2017 california wildfires , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) relied heavily on advance contracts . as of may 31 , 2018 , fema and usace obligated about $ 4.5 billion for various goods and services through these contracts , see figure below . gao found limitations in fema 's use of some advance contracts that provided critical goods and services to survivors , including an outdated strategy and unclear guidance on how contracting officers should use advance contracts during a disaster , and challenges performing acquisition planning . fema also did not always provide complete information in its reports to congressional committees . specifically , gao found 29 advance contract actions that were not included in recent reports due to shortcomings in fema 's reporting methodology , limiting visibility into its disaster contract spending . fema identified challenges with advance contracts in 2017 , including federal coordination with states and localities on their use . fema is required to coordinate with states and localities and encourage them to establish their own advance contracts with vendors . however , gao found inconsistencies in that coordination and the information fema uses to coordinate with states and localities on advance contracts . without consistent information and coordination with fema , states and localities may not have the tools needed to establish their own advance contracts for critical goods and services and quickly respond to future disasters . gao is making nine recommendations to fema , including that it update its strategy and guidance to clarify the use of advance contracts , improve the timeliness of its acquisition planning activities , revise its methodology for reporting disaster contracting actions to congressional committees , and provide more consistent guidance and information to contracting officers to coordinate with and encourage states and localities to establish advance contracts . fema concurred with our recommendations .
federal law encourages individuals to save for retirement through tax incentives for 401 plans and iras — the predominant forms of retirement savings in the united states . in 2017 , u.s. plans and iras reportedly held investments worth nearly $ 17 trillion dollars . federal law also allows individuals to withdraw assets from these accounts under certain circumstances . dol and irs oversee 401 plans , and collect annual plan data — including financial information — on the form 5500. for both iras and 401 plans , gao was asked to examine : the incidence and amount of early withdrawals ; factors that might lead individuals to access retirement savings early ; and policies and strategies that might reduce the incidence and amounts of early withdrawals . to answer these questions , gao analyzed data from irs , the census bureau , and dol from 2013 ( the most recent complete data available ) ; and interviewed a diverse range of stakeholders identified in the literature , including representatives of companies sponsoring 401 plans , plan administrators , subject matter experts , industry representatives , and participant advocates . in 2013 individuals in their prime working years ( ages 25 to 55 ) removed at least $ 69 billion ( + / - $ 3.5 billion ) of their retirement savings early , according to gao 's analysis of 2013 internal revenue service ( irs ) and department of labor ( dol ) data . withdrawals from individual retirement accounts ( ira ) — $ 39.5 billion ( + / - $ 2.1 billion ) — accounted for much of the money removed early , were equivalent to 3 percent ( + / - 0.15 percent ) of the age group 's total ira assets , and exceeded their ira contributions in 2013. participants in employer - sponsored plans , like 401 plans , withdrew at least $ 29.2 billion ( + / - $ 2.8 billion ) early as hardship withdrawals , lump sum payments made at job separation ( known as cashouts ) , and loan balances that borrowers did not repay . hardship withdrawals in 2013 were equivalent to about 0.5 percent ( + / - 0.06 percent ) of the age group 's total plan assets and about 8 percent ( + / - 0.9 percent ) of their contributions . however , the incidence and amount of certain unrepaid plan loans can not be determined because the form 5500 — the federal government 's primary source of information on employee benefit plans — does not capture these data . stakeholders gao interviewed identified flexibilities in plan rules and individuals ' pressing financial needs , such as out - of - pocket medical costs , as factors affecting early withdrawals of retirement savings . stakeholders said that certain plan rules , such as setting high minimum loan thresholds , may cause individuals to take out more of their savings than they need . stakeholders also identified several elements of the job separation process affecting early withdrawals , such as difficulties transferring account balances to a new plan and plans requiring the immediate repayment of outstanding loans , as relevant factors . stakeholders gao interviewed suggested strategies they believed could balance early access to accounts with the need to build long - term retirement savings . for example , plan sponsors said allowing individuals to continue to repay plan loans after job separation , restricting participant access to plan sponsor contributions , allowing partial distributions at job separation , and building emergency savings features into plan designs , could help preserve retirement savings ( see figure ) . however , they noted , each strategy involves tradeoffs , and the strategies ' broader implications require further study . gao recommends that , as part of revising the form 5500 , dol and irs require plan sponsors to report the incidence and amount of all 401 plan loans that are not repaid . dol and irs neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation .
epa is responsible for reviewing chemicals in commerce and those entering the marketplace . currently there are more than 40,000 active chemical substances in commerce , with more submitted to epa for review annually . epa 's iris database contains the agency 's scientific position on the potential human health effects that may result from exposure to various chemicals in the environment . epa 's iris program , which produces toxicity assessments , has been criticized in the past for timeliness and transparency issues . in response , the iris program committed to making program improvements starting in 2011 , which the national academy of sciences ( nas ) recently commended . tsca as amended in 2016 provides epa with additional authority to review both existing and new chemicals and to regulate those that epa determines pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment . this report describes the extent to which the iris program has addressed identified challenges and made progress toward producing chemical assessments ; and the extent to which epa has demonstrated progress implementing tsca . gao reviewed nas and epa documents and interviewed officials from epa and representatives from two environmental and two industry stakeholder organizations . the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) integrated risk information system ( iris ) program , which prepares human health toxicity assessments of chemicals , has made progress addressing historical timeliness and transparency challenges in the assessment process . efforts to address timeliness include employing project management principles and specialized software to better plan assessments and utilize staff . to address the need for greater transparency in how the program conducts assessments , iris officials and the iris program have implemented systematic review , which provides a structured and transparent process for identifying relevant studies , reviewing their methodological strengths and weaknesses , and integrating these studies as part of a weight of evidence analysis . since the process improvements were implemented , the program made progress toward producing chemical assessments through may 2018. in june 2018 , the epa administrator 's office told iris officials that they could not release any iris - associated documentation without a formal request from epa program office leadership . in august 2018 , according to iris officials , program office leadership was asked to reconfirm which ongoing chemical assessments their offices needed . in late october 2018 , these offices were asked to limit their chemical requests further , to the top three or four assessments . at the same time — 4 months after iris assessments were stopped from being released — 28 of approximately 30 iris staff were directed to support implementation of the toxic substances control act of 1976 ( tsca ) , as amended , with 25 to 50 percent of their time , according to officials . then on december 19 , 2018 , the office of research and development released its iris program outlook , which provided an updated list of 13 assessments . eleven of the 13 chemicals on the iris program outlook were requested by two epa program offices . a memorandum issued earlier in december , gave no indication of when additional assessments could be requested or what the iris program 's workflow would be in the near term . epa has demonstrated progress implementing tsca , which was amended in june 2016 , by responding to statutory deadlines . for example , epa finalized rules detailing the general processes for prioritizing and evaluating chemicals , known as the framework rules , but three of the four rules have been challenged in court . environmental organizations have argued , among other things , that tsca requires epa to consider all conditions of use in prioritizing and evaluating chemicals , rather than excluding , for example , uses that epa believes are `` legacy uses , '' for which a chemical is no longer marketed . epa argued that tsca grants it discretion to determine what constitutes a chemical 's conditions of use . amendments to tsca in 2016 increased epa 's responsibility for regulating chemicals and in turn , its workload . as such , epa is required to prioritize and evaluate existing chemicals by various deadlines over an extended period and to make a regulatory determination on all new chemicals . senior management told gao that they were confident that ongoing hiring and reorganization would better position the office that implements tsca . gao made recommendations previously to improve the iris program and tsca implementation . epa provided comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the united states have raised questions about the security of the u.s. government 's process for adjudicating nivs , which are issued to foreign nationals , such as tourists , business visitors , and students , seeking temporary admission into the united states . for example , the december 2015 shootings in san bernardino , california , led to concerns about niv screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the united states under a niv . in 2017 , the president issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting , and establishing nationality - based visa entry restrictions , which the supreme court upheld in june 2018. gao was asked to review niv screening and vetting . this report examines outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated niv applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , and key changes made to the niv adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. gao analyzed state niv adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , the most recent and complete data available . gao visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors . gao reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations , and documents related to implementing these actions . this is a public version of a sensitive report issued in june 2018. information that dhs , state , and the office of the director of national intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed . the total number of nonimmigrant visa ( niv ) applications that department of state ( state ) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016 , and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. niv adjudications varied by visa group , country of nationality , and refusal reason : visa group . from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 , about 80 percent of niv adjudications were for tourists and business visitors . during this time , adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent . country of nationality . in fiscal year 2017 , more than half of all niv adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality : china ( 2.02 million , or 16 percent ) , mexico ( 1.75 million , or 14 percent ) , india ( 1.28 million , or 10 percent ) , brazil ( 670,000 , or 5 percent ) , colombia ( 460,000 , or 4 percent ) , and argentina ( 370,000 , or 3 percent ) . refusal reason . state data indicate that over this time period , 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused ; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought , and a small percentage ( 0.05 percent ) were due to terrorism and security - related concerns . in 2017 , two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the president required , among other actions , visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern , the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards , and changes to niv screening and vetting procedures . gao 's analysis of state data indicates that , out of the nearly 2.8 million niv applications refused in fiscal year 2017 , 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions . state , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the u.s. government for all immigration benefits , such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks . further , state sought and received emergency approval from the office of management and budget in may 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants , such as email addresses and social media handles .
gender - related price differences occur when consumers are charged different prices for the same or similar goods and services because of factors related to gender . while variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences , some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor . while the equal credit opportunity act and fair housing act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions , no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders . gao was asked to review gender - related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the united states . this report examines , among other things , how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women , and potential reasons for any price differences ; what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender , such as mortgages ; and the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender - related price differences . to examine these issues , gao analyzed retail price data , reviewed relevant academic studies , analyzed federal consumer complaint data , and interviewed federal agency officials , industry experts , and academics . firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent . products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes . of 10 personal care product categories ( e.g . , deodorants and shaving products ) that gao analyzed , average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women 's products than for men 's in 5 categories . in 2 categories — shaving gel and nondisposable razors — men 's versions sold at a significantly higher price . one category — razor blades -- had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed , and two others — disposable razors and mass - market perfumes — showed no significant gender price differences . gao found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified , but gao did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender - related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors , such as different advertising costs . though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes , such as product size and packaging type , all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed . studies gao reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender — mortgages , small business credit , auto purchases , and auto repairs . for example , with regard to mortgages , women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men , in part due to weaker credit characteristics , such as lower average income . however , after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors , three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women , while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans . in addition , one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics , and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk . while these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs , several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics , such as credit scores , which could affect analysis of gender disparities . also , several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier , which limits the generalizability of the results . in their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes , the bureau of consumer financial protection , federal trade commission , and department of housing and urban development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender - related pricing differences . gao 's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012 – 2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender - related price differences . the agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness . however , given the limited consumer concern , they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender - related price differences into their existing consumer education resources .
three catastrophic hurricanes affected more than 28 million people living in texas , florida , puerto rico , and the u.s. virgin islands in 2017. hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria — which all made landfall within four weeks — caused a combined $ 265 billion in damage , and led to unprecedented demands for food and shelter , according to fema . fema and the red cross are the primary agencies responsible for coordinating mass care under the federal disaster response framework . gao was asked to review their efforts . this report examines fema 's and the red cross ' coordination of mass care in response to the 2017 hurricanes , and fema 's support and use of assessments of mass care capabilities for the 2017 hurricanes . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , federal frameworks , and written agreements between federal , state , or local governments and various voluntary organizations providing mass care services . gao also interviewed state , territorial , local , and voluntary organization officials in florida , puerto rico , texas , and the u.s. virgin islands ; as well as officials from red cross , fema , other relevant federal agencies , and voluntary organizations . following the three major u.s. hurricanes in 2017 , disaster relief efforts of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and the american red cross ( red cross ) benefitted from locating key partners in the same place . in - person coordination was critical to maintaining communication in puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands given the prolonged power outages and damage to public structures ( see photo ) . however , some needs related to mass care — such as shelter , food , and supply distribution — were unmet . for example , local officials in texas said flooded roads prevented trucks from delivering supplies . providers encountered challenges in part because state and local agreements with voluntary organizations did not always clearly detail what mass care services could be provided . additionally , fema guidance and training materials do not explicitly encourage states and localities to include in their written agreements the specific assistance each agency or organization can provide . this limits the benefits of mass care coordination and may put disaster victims at risk . state , territorial , and local grantees of federal disaster preparedness grants are required to regularly submit information on their capabilities to fema , and fema has provided related guidance and technical assistance . however , the information some grantees provided to fema was not specific enough to aid its response in 2017. moreover , fema does not require grantees to specify the organizations providing mass care services in their capabilities assessments . also , fema does not have systematic protocols for providing feedback to grantees to improve their assessments . these limitations hinder fema 's efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness . gao is making six recommendations , including that fema emphasize the importance of defining roles and responsibilities in its guidance to states and localities , require them to solicit information from key mass care providers in assessing capabilities , and develop protocols for providing feedback to grantees on capability assessments . fema agreed with all but one of gao 's recommendations ; gao maintains its recommendations are valid .
dod manages a portfolio of real property assets that as of fiscal year 2016 reportedly included about 568,000 facilities with a combined plant replacement value of about $ 1 trillion and 27.2 million acres of land . dod requires the military services and washington headquarters services to collect and maintain information about each of the assets in their inventories to assist the department with management decision making . in may 2017 , the house armed services committee , subcommittee on readiness , asked gao to review dod 's management and use of its real property data . this report evaluates how accurately and completely rpad reflects dod 's real property assets , dod 's processes to ensure accuracy and completeness in recording and reporting real property data , and dod 's actions to ensure it has addressed risks that may affect the use of real property information for managing its assets . gao analyzed the rpad and military services ' data for fiscal years 2014-2016 ; reviewed documentation ; conducted site visits ; and interviewed dod officials . gao found that the department of defense 's ( dod ) real property assets database ( rpad ) contained inaccurate data and lacked completeness , although certain data that gao reviewed had improved their accuracy since fiscal year 2014. rpad is a department - wide database of real property data annually compiled by the office of the secretary of defense from the inventories of the military services and dod 's washington headquarters services , which manages real property in the national capital region . dod uses rpad to report on dod 's real property to congress and other federal agencies , such as the office of management and budget and the general services administration to assist in managing federal real property . dod has weaknesses in its processes for recording and reporting real property data that have led to inaccurate and incomplete information . gao and others found military services have not consistently recorded real property transactions ( i.e . , acquisition of , change to , and disposal of a real property asset ) and physical inventories of assets . gao also found that the military services have not corrected identified discrepancies in their data systems , such as missing entries for utilization and facility condition and overdue asset reviews . gao reviewed records of 120 facilities with identified discrepancies in fiscal year 2015 rpad data and compared them to the records in the respective data system in 2017 and found that 61 discrepancies remained . the military services had corrected the data in the remaining 59 reviewed facilities in their data systems . dod 's efforts to prepare for an upcoming financial audit have helped identify issues and improve accuracy of some data . however , if dod does not require the military services to fully monitor recording processes and implement corrective actions to resolve data discrepancies , the department will continue to have incomplete and inaccurate real property data and unreliable rpad information . dod has not addressed three risks that can adversely affect its ability to use its information to manage its real property . specifically , dod has unfilled real property positions limiting its capacity to manage its data , lacks a department - wide approach to improving its data quality , and has not identified how it will complete implementation of an effort to improve access to data . these risks exist , in part , because dod has not developed a strategy that identifies and addresses risks with accompanying time frames and performance metrics . if dod does not develop a strategy that identifies and addresses risks to data quality and information accessibility , dod may miss the opportunity to reasonably ensure that the information needed for effective decision making by dod , congress , and other federal agencies is available to meet real property accountability and reporting objectives . gao is making six recommendations to improve dod 's real property data , including fully monitoring recording processes ; developing and implementing corrective actions for identified data discrepancies ; and developing a strategy to address risks associated with data quality and information accessibility . dod concurred or partially concurred with all draft recommendations . in response , gao agreed to combine two recommendations .
gao has previously found that dhs 's components had acquisition programs that did not meet requirements and that those requirements were , in some cases , poorly defined . poorly defined requirements increase the risk that acquisitions will not meet the needs of users in the field — for example , border patrol agents or emergency responders . gao was asked to examine dhs components ' practices for developing requirements . this report addresses the policies , organizations , and workforce that selected dhs components use to develop requirements for their acquisition programs . gao selected seven dhs components with significant acquisition programs and a non - generalizable sample of programs — based on cost , component , and acquisition phase — as case studies . gao analyzed policies and program documentation ; and interviewed dhs and component officials , as well as end users of dhs programs . gao compared components ' practices to industry best practices and federal internal control standards . gao has identified several best practices to ensure that operational requirements for acquisitions are well - defined and found some department of homeland security 's ( dhs ) components met them while others did not . these practices include a formal policy for developing requirements , an independent requirements organization , and an understanding of workforce needs and training . the table below shows gao 's assessment of seven of dhs 's components against these practices . establishing a formal policy to guide the process is critical to developing well - defined requirements . however , only the coast guard has an approved policy for requirements development among the seven components reviewed . without well - defined requirements , components are at risk of acquiring capabilities that will not meet mission needs . dhs officials told gao that components have generally prioritized obtaining funding and starting programs over developing requirements . three components have a requirements development organization , separating requirements from acquisition in addressing capability gaps . officials from components without such organizations told gao that they have fewer major acquisitions and rely on dhs to assist in requirements development . dhs policy and best practices , however , maintain the importance of this separation regardless of the number of major acquisitions to guard against possible bias by acquisition officials toward a specific materiel solution . two components have assessed requirements development workforce needs , but both need to be updated ; and one component has provided requirements development training and certification . other component officials told gao that they lack the resources necessary to take these steps . best practices indicate that without an appropriately sized and trained workforce , components remain at risk of acquiring capabilities that fail to meet end user needs . gao is making 25 recommendations , including to individual components to establish policies and independent organizations for requirements development , assess workforce needs , and establish training and certifications . dhs concurred with all the recommendations .
some of the largest federal programs , including medicare , social security , and postal services , are funded through trust funds and other dedicated funds , which link collections that have been dedicated to a specific purpose with the expenditures of those collections . while these funds have the ability to retain accumulated balances , these collections do not necessarily fund the full current or future cost of the government 's commitments to the designated beneficiaries . gao was asked to review issues related to federal trust funds and other dedicated funds . this report examines how the size and scope of federal trust funds and other dedicated funds in the federal budget have changed over time , the extent to which these funds are supported by their dedicated collections , and the extent to which these funds support mandatory programs , including major entitlement programs . gao analyzed omb data on trust funds and other dedicated funds for fiscal year 2014 through 2018 and the department of the treasury 's ( treasury ) fiscal year 2018 combined statement of receipts , outlays , and balances . gao also examined 13 case study accounts in nine agencies , selected to include the largest of each type of these funds and a variety of program designs . gao reviewed agency reports , cbo trust fund estimates for 2018 and projections for 2019 to 2029 , and prior gao reports , and interviewed omb staff and officials from treasury and each of the case study agencies . gao also is providing an online dataset of these funds at https : / / www.gao.gov / products / gao - 20-156 . every major federal department has at least two trust funds or other dedicated funds . according to gao analysis of office of management and budget ( omb ) data , balances in these funds , which can be used to support covered programs , grew 13 percent in nominal terms from fiscal year 2014 through 2018. fund balances are affected by complex interactions of factors , but the total increase was driven largely by military and civilian retirement fund balances . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) projects the total balance to start declining in fiscal year 2022 as decreases in medicare and social security will exceed increases in military and civilian retirement balances . to offset the overall decrease , the federal government is projected to borrow more from the public . gao found that 11 of 13 case studies recently received general revenue — collections that are not dedicated by law for a specific purpose . for example , medical insurance premiums for medicare part b are set to cover 25 percent of expected costs ; the remaining 75 percent are covered by general revenues . even funds that rely primarily on their dedicated collections may not be fiscally sustainable . for example , the social security old - age and survivors insurance trust fund only uses dedicated collections for benefit payments , but its balances are projected to be depleted by 2034. nearly 98 percent of outlays and transfers from trust funds and other dedicated funds was through mandatory authority , which allows agencies to make payments without further congressional action . most of the 23 largest funds also have entitlement authority , which generally requires payments to eligible parties based on legal requirements . status as a trust fund , mandatory program , or entitlement does not prevent congress and the president from changing related laws to alter future collections or payments .
since 2005 , the federal government has enacted various statutes aimed at accelerating the environmental review process for highway and transit projects . in addition , the clean water act and the endangered species act may require three federal agencies — the corps , fws , and nmfs — to issue permits or perform consultations before a project can proceed . gao is required by statute to assess the extent to which statutory provisions have accelerated and improved environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . this report examines , among other things : 1 ) the impact of streamlining provisions on consulting and permitting time frames , and additional actions used by federal resource agencies to streamline their reviews . gao analyzed permitting and consulting data from the 3 federal agencies and interviewed officials from the 3 agencies , 16 agency field offices , and 7 state dots for their perspectives on the effect of streamlining provisions and other efforts . gao selected these offices to include a range of locations and those with a greater number of permits and consultations , among other factors . federally funded highway and transit projects must be analyzed for their potential environmental effects , as required by the national environmental policy act , and may be subject to other environmental protection laws , including the clean water act and the endangered species act . these laws may require the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) to issue permit decisions and the u.s. fish and wildlife service ( fws ) and the national marine fisheries service ( nmfs ) to conduct consultations before a project can proceed . these three agencies are referred to as “ resource agencies ” for this report . the three most recent transportation reauthorization acts include provisions that are intended to streamline various aspects of the environmental review process ; 18 of these provisions could potentially affect time frames for the environmental permitting and consulting processes for highway and transit projects . while officials gao interviewed at resource agencies and state departments of transportation ( state dot ) noted that some actions called for by the 18 statutory provisions have helped streamline the consultation and permitting processes for highway and transit projects , gao found that a lack of reliable agency data regarding permitting and consulting time frames hinders a quantitative analysis of the provisions ' impact . officials said , for example , that a provision that allows federal liaison positions at resource agencies to focus solely on processing applications for state dot projects has helped avoid delays in permit and consultation reviews . however , none of the three resource agencies could provide enough reliable data to analyze changes in the durations of consultations and permit reviews over time for any of the provisions . further , gao identified limitations , such as negative or missing values , and inconsistent data entry practices for fws and nmfs data . fws and nmfs have limited controls , such as electronic safeguards and other data - entry procedures , to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their data on the duration of consultations . left unaddressed , these data quality issues may impair the agencies ' ability to accurately determine whether they are meeting their 135-day statutory and regulatory deadlines to complete consultations and provide biological opinions , and could affect their ability to provide accurate data on time frames for efforts of the office of management and budget to track agencies ' performance in conducting environmental reviews . while fws and nmfs officials stated that the agencies plan to improve their tracking systems , the agencies do not have documented plans or time frames for the improvements and it is unclear whether the efforts will include internal controls to improve data reliability . some federal resource agency and state dot officials gao interviewed identified additional actions that have been used to streamline the consultation and permitting processes to avoid delays in agency reviews . for example , 16 of the 23 resource agency and state dot officials said that field office staff provided training to state dot staff about the information field offices required for permit or consultation applications . resource agency and state dot officials also identified electronic systems with environmental data and for submitting documents as streamlining actions that have been helpful . gao is making two recommendations , one to fws and one to nmfs , to develop plans and time frames for improving their tracking systems and to develop internal controls to improve data reliability . the departments of commerce and interior concurred with our recommendations .
usms mission areas include fugitive apprehension , witness protection , and federal prisoner transportation , among others . usms whistleblowers recently alleged that usms officials engaged in improper promotion practices — such as routinely preselecting favored candidates . investigations have substantiated multiple whistleblower allegations which has raised questions about the integrity of usms 's merit promotion process . usms announces about 260 law enforcement promotion opportunities annually . gao was asked to review usms 's promotion processes and policies and effects that usms promotion practices have on employee morale . this report examines the extent to which the usms 's merit promotion policies are aligned with federal guidelines ; the extent to which usms monitors its merit promotion processes ; and the steps , if any , usms has taken to understand and address employee concerns about its merit promotion policies and processes . gao analyzed data and documents on usms promotions from october 2015 through april 2017 , and found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of gao 's study . gao also analyzed usms documentation , and interviewed usms officials and non - generalizable groups of employees ( 85 in total ) in four district locations . the u.s. marshals service 's ( usms ) merit promotion policy aligns with relevant provisions in title 5 of the united states code and code of federal regulations , which are the government - wide laws and related provisions agencies must follow to make federal appointments . agencies must design and administer merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection for promotion based on merit and these programs must conform to five key requirements outlined in title 5. gao found that the usms merit promotion plan , as revised in november 2016 , aligned with each of these five requirements . for example , the first requirement states that agencies must establish merit - based procedures for promoting employees that are available in writing to candidates . the usms merit promotion plan , which is available to employees , outlines such procedures . usms is taking steps to improve how it monitors the implementation of the scoring component of its process to rate promotion applications , but lacks documented guidance to ensure consistent compliance with its merit promotion policy . gao found that usms does not adequately monitor the rating process , which allowed for conflicts of interest with raters who may compete with candidates whose applications they score . usms also does not monitor the rating process to ensure that raters complied with a key requirement — that raters decline to score applications of candidates with whom there is a conflict of interest , such as a supervisor - employee relationship . usms is implementing a process change that , if implemented effectively , can address these two deficiencies . the new process entails having a third - party contractor , rather than usms employees , determine candidates ' scores . finally , gao found that usms lacks documented guidance on rater scoring . usms only provides verbal guidance to instruct raters on how to score the experience category of merit promotion packages , creating inconsistent application of the guidelines . employees gao met with expressed the view that such discrepancies create the perception that the rating process is unfairly subjective . developing clear and specific documented guidance on how raters should apply the benchmark guidelines could minimize scoring inconsistency and potential rater subjectivity for both the current rating process and the new competency - based assessment . usms has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about the promotion process . an estimated 41 percent of usms respondents to the 2016 office of personnel management federal employee viewpoint survey strongly disagreed or disagreed that usms promotions are merit - based , while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed , and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed . during discussion groups gao held at four usms district locations across the u.s. , employees frequently expressed negative views and many indicated low or no trust that the process is fair and merit - based . although usms has acknowledged employees ' negative perceptions of the promotion process , it has not developed an agency - wide action plan in accordance with federal guidance to better understand the nature and causes of employee concerns across districts and divisions . providing specific and consistent information to employees about key steps in the merit promotion process and internal management decisions could improve transparency and help mitigate employee perceptions of favoritism that have negatively impacted employee morale . gao recommends that usms develop specific rater guidance and develop and implement an agency - wide action plan to better understand and address employee concerns , among other steps . usms concurred with the recommendations .
protecting federal employees and facilities from security threats is of critical importance . most federal agencies are generally responsible for their facilities and have physical security programs to do so . gao was asked to examine how federal agencies assess facilities ' security risks . this report examines : how selected agencies ' assessment methodologies align with the isc 's risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures and what management challenges , if any , selected agencies reported facing in conducting physical security assessments and monitoring the results . gao selected four agencies — cbp , faa , ars , and the forest service — based on their large number of facilities and compared each agency 's assessment methodology to the isc standard ; analyzed facility assessment schedules and results from 2010 through 2016 ; and interviewed security officials . gao also visited 13 facilities from these four agencies , selected based on geographical dispersion and their high risk level . none of the four agencies gao reviewed — u.s . customs and border protection ( cbp ) , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , the agricultural research service ( ars ) , and the forest service — used security assessment methodologies that fully aligned with the interagency security committee 's risk management process for federal facilities standard ( the isc standard ) . this standard requires that methodologies used to identify necessary facility countermeasures — such as fences and closed - circuit televisions — must : 1. consider all of the undesirable events ( i.e . , arson and vandalism ) identified by the isc standard as possible risks to facilities . 2. assess three factors — threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences — for each of these events and use these three factors to measure risk . all four agencies used methodologies that included some isc requirements when conducting assessments . cbp and faa assessed vulnerabilities but not threats and consequences . ars and the forest service assessed threats , vulnerabilities , and consequences , but did not use these factors to measure risk . in addition , the agencies considered many , but not all 33 undesirable events related to physical security as possible risks to their facilities . agencies are taking steps to improve their methodologies . for example , ars and the forest service now use a methodology that measures risk and plan to incorporate the methodology into policy . although cbp and faa have updated their methodologies , their policies do not require methodologies that fully align with the isc standard . as a result , these agencies miss the opportunity for a more informed assessment of the risk to their facilities . all four agencies reported facing management challenges in conducting physical security assessments or monitoring assessment results . specifically , cbp , ars , and the forest service have not met the isc 's required time frame of every 3 years for conducting assessments . for example , security specialists have not conducted required reassessments of two ars and one forest service higher - level facilities . while these three agencies have plans to address backlogs , cbp 's plan does not balance conducting risk assessments with other competing security priorities , such as updating its policy manual , and ars and the forest service lack a means to monitor completion of future assessments . furthermore , cbp , ars , and the forest service did not have the data or information systems to monitor assessment schedules or the status of countermeasures at facilities , and their policies did not specify such data requirements . for example , ars and the forest service do not collect and analyze security - related data , such as countermeasures ' implementation . faa does not routinely monitor the performance of its physical security program . without improved monitoring , agencies are not well equipped to prioritize their highest security needs , may leave facilities ' vulnerabilities unaddressed , and may not take corrective actions to meet physical security program objectives . this is a public version of a sensitive report that gao issued in august 2017. information that the agencies under review deemed sensitive has been omitted . gao recommends : that cbp and faa update policies to require the use of methodologies fully aligned with the isc standard ; that cbp revise its plan to eliminate the assessments backlog ; and that all four agencies improve monitoring of their physical security programs . all four agencies agreed with the respective recommendations .
jwst , a large , deployable telescope , is one of nasa 's most complex projects and top priorities . the project has delayed its planned launch three times since september 2017 due to problems discovered in testing . in june 2018 , nasa approved new cost and schedule estimates for jwst . since the project established its cost and schedule baselines in 2009 , the project 's costs have increased by 95 percent and the launch date has been moved back by 81 months . conference report no . 112-284 , accompanying the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2012 , included a provision for gao to assess the project annually and report on its progress . this is the seventh report . this report assesses the considerations nasa took into account when updating the project 's cost and schedule commitments and the extent to which nasa has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of jwst , among other issues . gao reviewed relevant nasa policies , analyzed nasa and contractor data , and interviewed nasa and contractor officials . in june 2018 , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) revised the cost and schedule commitments for the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) to reflect known technical challenges , as well as provide additional time to address unanticipated challenges . for example , the revised launch readiness date of march 2021 included 5.5 months to address a design issue for the cover of the sunshield ( see image ) . the purpose of the sunshield is to protect the telescope 's mirrors and instruments from the sun 's heat . nasa found that hardware on the cover came loose during testing in april 2018. the new cost estimate of $ 9.7 billion is driven by the schedule extension , which requires keeping the contractor 's workforce on board longer than expected . before the project enters its final phase of integration and test , it must conduct a review to determine if it can launch within its cost and schedule commitments . as part of this review , the project is not required to update its joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis — an analysis that provides the probability the project can meet its cost and schedule commitments — but government and industry cost and schedule experts have found it is a best practice to do so . such analysis would provide nasa officials with better information to support decisions on allocating resources , especially in light of the project 's recent cost and schedule growth . nasa has taken steps to improve oversight and performance of jwst , and identified the jwst project manager as responsible for monitoring the continued implementation of these changes . examples of recent changes include increasing on - site presence at the contractor facility and conducting comprehensive audits of design processes . sustaining focus on these changes through launch will be important if schedule pressures arise later and because of past challenges with communications . gao will follow up on the project 's monitoring of these improvements in future reviews . gao recommends nasa update the project 's joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis . nasa concurred with the recommendation made in this report .
in 2017 , the u.s. freight rail system moved over 1.5-billion tons of goods . the largest freight railroads — class is — dominate the industry and account for more than 90 percent of its annual revenue . in recent years , railroad workers and local communities have expressed safety concerns related to longer freight trains , and recent accidents involving such trains are currently under investigation by fra . fra does not currently place limits on freight train length . gao was asked to review the safety and other impacts of longer freight trains . this report examines : changes in freight train length over time , safety considerations for operating longer freight trains , and the extent to which fra is assessing any safety risks . gao reviewed relevant statutes , regulations , and federal agencies ' reports and plans ; analyzed available data on freight train length from railroads ; and interviewed federal officials and various stakeholders , including state and local officials and first responders from five states ( selected to represent different railroads and regions ) , and officials from the railroad industry , unions , and advocacy groups . freight train length has increased in recent years , according to all seven class i freight railroads . data on train length are not publicly available ; however data provided to gao by two class i railroads indicated that their average train length has increased by about 25 percent since 2008 , with average lengths of 1.2 and 1.4 miles in 2017. officials from all seven class i railroads said they are currently operating longer than average trains on specific routes , although some said such trains are a small percentage of the trains they operate . one railroad said it runs a 3-mile - long train twice weekly . officials identified increased efficiencies and economic benefits among the advantages of longer freight trains . stakeholders said that the arrangement of train cars and locomotives — known as “ train makeup ” — and the potential for blocking highway - railroad crossings are issues to consider to safely operate longer freight trains . to prevent derailment , stakeholders said it is important that longer trains are arranged appropriately and that crews are trained to operate them . while class i railroads and others said that longer trains may decrease the frequency of blocked crossings , some state and local officials said these trains can prolong their duration , posing challenges for emergency responders unable to cross the tracks . the federal railroad administration ( fra ) is studying the safety risks of and strategies for operating longer trains . as part of the study , fra plans to analyze train - handling and braking capabilities under varying conditions . fra officials said they plan to share their research results with relevant stakeholders ; however , fra currently has no documented strategy for sharing the results of its research . fra officials are also analyzing which parts of the country are reporting frequently blocked crossings . however , fra officials said they do not plan to use information from either of these efforts to determine whether longer freight trains might contribute to increases in blocked crossings , and the officials believe the issues are unrelated . developing and implementing a strategy for sharing fra 's research results and identifying any potential impacts of longer freight trains on highway - railroad crossings would enable fra and stakeholders to better determine what , if any , actions are needed to ensure the safe operation of longer freight trains . gao recommends that fra develop and implement a strategy to share the results of its study on longer trains and work with railroads to engage state and local governments to identify and reduce impacts of longer freight trains on highway - railroad crossings . fra concurred with gao 's recommendations .
medicare 's physician fee schedule contains over 8,000 billing codes for office visits , surgical procedures , or other services provided to beneficiaries . some provider groups have concerns that these codes do not sufficiently account for the lccp - type services they provide to medicare beneficiaries with complex medical needs . the bba included a provision that gao examine billing codes that may be used for lccp - type services for beneficiaries with a serious or life - threatening illness . gao identified , among other things , existing medicare physician fee schedule billing codes that can be used to bill lccp - type services ; and trends in medicare spending on these services from 2013 through 2017. gao reviewed centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) billing code manuals and american medical association ( ama ) code descriptors to identify existing codes containing key components of lccp - type services ; analyzed medicare part b claims data from 2013 to 2017 ( the most recent available at the time of gao 's review ) ; and interviewed officials from cms and 19 stakeholders , including the ama , national physician groups , and other provider groups that had previously given input on the topic to congress . gao provided a draft of this report to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . in response , hhs provided technical comments , which gao incorporated as appropriate . the 2018 bipartisan budget act ( bba ) defined longitudinal comprehensive care planning ( lccp ) as services involving an interdisciplinary team of providers who develop and communicate a care plan to medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with a serious or life - threatening illness . gao identified at least 58 billing codes in medicare 's physician fee schedule that could be used by providers to bill for services that cover some or all of the lccp service components as defined in the 2018 bba — referred to by gao as lccp - type services . the 58 billing codes may be used individually or in combination , depending on a beneficiary 's medical needs . stakeholders representing providers told gao their members generally use one or a combination of these codes to bill for lccp - type services . forty - five of the 58 codes are broadly - defined longstanding codes that can be used for lccp - type services as well as other services such as the treatment of a specific medical complaint . the remaining 13 codes are more recent narrowly - defined codes introduced starting in 2013 that only cover lccp - type services . they include transitional care management services introduced in 2013 , chronic care management starting in 2015 , advance care planning in 2016 , and behavioral health integration in 2017. gao found that overall medicare spending on lccp - type services that were billed to the 58 codes increased from $ 26 billion in 2013 to almost $ 29 billion in 2017. while narrowly - defined services accounted for a small share of this total spending ( $ 467 million in 2017 ) , spending on these narrowly - defined services such as chronic care management increased rapidly . moreover , spending growth on narrowly - defined services was driven by increased use of these services rather than increases in reimbursement rates . from 2013 through 2017 , more beneficiaries received and more providers billed for narrowly - defined services . the number of medicare beneficiaries receiving these services grew from about 267,000 to about 2.5 million . the number of providers billing these services grew from about 31,000 to about 100,000 .
school - age children without internet access may have difficulty in completing homework . those without in - home fixed access may go online wirelessly outside the home to do homework . a provision was included in statute for gao to review wireless internet access for school - age children in lower - income households . this report examines challenges lower - income school - age children who lack in - home fixed internet face in doing homework involving internet access , and selected school district efforts to expand wireless access for students and the federal role in those efforts . gao analyzed 2017 cps data ; reviewed six local projects that were selected based in part on education industry stakeholders ' recommendations , that included a range of geographic locations , and that took steps to address the homework gap ; compared fcc efforts to federal standards for internal controls and pilot - program design best practices ; reviewed fcc and department of education documents ; and interviewed 17 stakeholders , including school districts . according to gao 's analysis of 2017 census bureau current population survey ( cps ) data , children ages 6 to 17 in lower - income households are more likely than peers in higher - income households to lack high - speed in - home internet and rely on mobile wireless service . gao found that students who use mobile wireless for homework may face challenges , including slower speeds and limitations smartphones present in completing tasks like typing papers . these “ underconnected ” students may seek out ways to access wireless internet outside of the home to do homework ; however , these methods also pose challenges ( see figure ) . the inequity in internet access — and therefore in the ease of doing homework involving access — between students of varying income levels is known as the “ homework gap. ” efforts by six selected projects involving seven school districts expanding wireless access for students who may lack it at home varied . according to officials with most school district projects gao reviewed , rules for the federal communications commission 's ( fcc ) e - rate program , which allows schools to purchase discounted internet equipment , may limit schools ' ability to provide wireless access off - premises . specifically , off - premises access is not eligible for e - rate support , and schools that provide such access using existing services supported by e - rate must reduce their e - rate discounts . fcc conducted a pilot project in 2011 and 2012 to help decide whether to make wireless off - premises access eligible for e - rate support , but fcc did not determine and execute a methodology to assess the potential costs , benefits , and challenges of doing so . in 2016 , fcc received two requests from school districts seeking waivers of rules to allow them to use e - rate program support to provide off - premises access , but fcc has not made a decision on the waivers . determining and executing a methodology to analyze data about the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of easing e - rate rules on off - premises use and publishing the results could provide transparency to stakeholders such as school districts . this step could also help fcc act on pending and future waiver - of - rule requests and broader changes to rules that may help schools address the homework gap . gao recommends that fcc take steps to assess and publish the potential benefits , costs , and challenges of making off - premises wireless access eligible for e - rate support . fcc agreed with gao 's recommendation .
the need for ltss to assist individuals with limited abilities for self - care is expected to increase , in part due to the aging of the population . medicaid is the nation 's primary payer of ltss , with spending estimated at $ 167 billion in 2016. state medicaid programs are generally required to cover ltss provided in institutions , such as nursing homes , but coverage of the same services outside of institutions — that is , hcbs — is generally optional . in recent years there have been efforts to shift the balance of ltss away from institutions through the expanded use of hcbs . national spending for hcbs has increased and now exceeds that for services in an institution . however , the extent to which medicaid programs cover hcbs varies by state , as does the structure of states ' hcbs programs . gao was asked to review the approaches states use to provide coverage for hcbs in the medicaid program . for selected states , this report describes decisions that influenced the structure of medicaid hcbs programs , and challenges providing hcbs to medicaid beneficiaries and efforts to respond to these challenges . gao reviewed information and conducted interviews with officials from a nongeneralizable sample of five states , which gao selected to obtain variation in the percentage of total medicaid ltss expenditures used for hcbs , geography , and other factors . gao also reviewed information and interviewed officials from four mcos — two in each of the two selected states that used managed care to provide hcbs . the mcos varied in enrollment size and population served . all state medicaid programs finance coverage of long - term services and supports ( ltss ) , which help beneficiaries with physical , cognitive , or other limitations perform routine daily activities , such as eating , dressing , and making meals . when these services are provided in beneficiaries ' homes or other community settings instead of nursing homes , the services are known as home - and community - based services ( hcbs ) . the structure of the 26 hcbs programs we reviewed in five states — arizona , florida , mississippi , montana , and oregon — reflected decisions about which populations to cover , whether to limit eligibility or enrollment , and whether to use managed care . populations : four of the five states had multiple hcbs programs that targeted specific populations . for example , mississippi had separate hcbs programs for aged or physically disabled individuals and individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities . the fifth state , arizona , had one program that targeted two specific populations . eligibility : all five states had at least one hcbs program that limited eligibility to beneficiaries whose needs would otherwise require care in a nursing home or other institutional setting . enrollment : four of the five states limited enrollment in one or more of their hcbs programs ; 19 of the 26 programs had enrollment caps , and 12 of these programs maintained a waiting list . managed care : two of the five states used managed care to provide hcbs , paying managed care organizations ( mco ) a fixed fee for each beneficiary rather than paying providers for each service delivered . state and mco officials identified several challenges providing hcbs and described their efforts to respond to them : hcbs workforce : officials cited challenges recruiting and retaining hcbs providers , particularly given the low wages these providers typically receive . to respond to this , officials from mississippi , montana , and two of the mcos reported offering providers higher payment rates . complex needs : officials described challenges serving beneficiaries with complex medical and behavioral health needs , including individuals who display aggressive or other challenging behaviors . officials from montana and one mco reported responding to this challenge by providing behavioral health training for providers . hcbs funding : state officials reported that limitations on overall hcbs funding levels posed a challenge , which they responded to by providing their state legislatures with information on the projected need for hcbs to inform future funding decisions , and leveraging other available resources , such as federal grants . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
snap is the largest federally funded nutrition assistance program . in fiscal year 2017 , it provided about $ 63 billion in benefits . usda and the states jointly administer snap and partner to address issues that affect program integrity , including improper payments and fraud . gao has previously reported on various aspects of snap , including state snap e & t programs , improper payment rates , recipient fraud , and retailer trafficking . this testimony discusses gao 's prior and ongoing work on snap e & t programs , including program participants , design , and usda oversight , and usda 's efforts to address snap program integrity , including improper payments , as well as recipient and retailer fraud . as part of its ongoing work on snap e & t programs , gao analyzed e & t expenditures and participation data from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 , the most recent data available ; reviewed relevant research from usda ; and interviewed usda and selected state and local officials . the prior work discussed in this testimony is based on four gao products on e & t programs ( gao - 03-388 ) , improper payments ( gao - 16-708t ) , recipient fraud ( gao - 14-641 ) , and retailer trafficking ( gao - 07-53 ) . information on the scope and methodology of our prior work is available in each product . overseen by the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) and administered by states , supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) employment and training ( e & t ) programs served about 0.5 percent of the approximately 43.5 million snap recipients in an average month of fiscal year 2016 , according to the most recent usda data available . these programs are generally designed to help snap recipients increase their ability to obtain regular employment through services such as job search and training . some recipients may be required to participate . according to usda , about 14 percent of snap recipients were subject to work requirements in an average month of fiscal year 2016 , while others , such as children and the elderly , were generally exempt from these requirements . states have flexibility in how they design their e & t programs . over the last several years , states have 1 ) increasingly moved away from programs that mandate participation , 2 ) focused on serving able - bodied adults without dependents whose benefits are generally time - limited unless they comply with work requirements , and 3 ) partnered with state and local organizations to deliver services . usda has taken steps to increase support and oversight of snap e & t since 2014 , including collecting new data on participant outcomes from states . gao has ongoing work reviewing snap e & t programs , including usda oversight . usda and the states partner to address issues that affect program integrity , including improper payments and fraud , and usda has taken some steps to address challenges in these areas , but issues remain . improper payments . in 2016 , gao reviewed snap improper payment rates and found that states ' adoption of program flexibilities and changes in federal snap policy in the previous decade , as well as improper payment rate calculation methods , likely affected these rates . although usda reported improper payment estimates for snap in previous years , usda did not report an estimate for benefits paid in fiscal years 2015 or 2016 due to data quality issues in some states . usda has since been working with the states to improve improper payment estimates for the fiscal year 2017 review . recipient fraud . in 2014 , gao made recommendations to usda to address challenges states faced in combatting recipient fraud . for example , gao found that usda 's guidance on the use of transaction data to uncover potential trafficking lacked specificity and recommended usda develop additional guidance . since then , usda has provided technical assistance to some states , including on the use of data analytics . gao has ongoing work reviewing states ' use of data analytics to identify snap recipient fraud . retailer trafficking . in 2006 , gao identified several ways in which snap was vulnerable to retailer trafficking — a practice involving the exchange of benefits for cash or non - food items . for example , usda had not conducted analyses to identify high - risk retailers and target its resources . since then , usda has established risk levels for retailers based on various factors . gao has ongoing work assessing how usda prevents , detects , and responds to retailer trafficking and reviewing the usefulness of usda 's estimates of the extent of snap retailer trafficking . gao is not making new recommendations . usda generally concurred with gao 's prior recommendations .
u.s airspace system is one of the safest in the world , but incidents and near misses at and around u.s. terminal areas still occur . faa oversees the safety of runways and taxiways and works with industry partners — including airlines , airports , pilots , and others — to improve safety in these areas . despite faa 's continued efforts , the number of reported terminal area incidents has increased over time . gao was asked to review various issues related to runway safety and to update its prior work on airport terminal areas . this report examines : the extent to which faa uses data to analyze terminal area incidents and efforts faa and others have implemented to improve terminal area safety , and how faa assesses their effectiveness . gao analyzed faa data ; interviewed officials from 10 airports selected based on high runway incident rates in the past 3 years , among other factors ; and interviewed federal and industry officials . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) uses data to analyze some types of incidents in airport “ terminal areas ” — runways , taxiways , and ramps . for example , faa uses data to analyze runway “ incursions ” — the incorrect presence of an aircraft , vehicle , or person on the runway . according to faa data , the rate of reported runway incursions nearly doubled from fiscal years 2011 through 2018 , with most of this increase due to a rise in reports of less severe incursions , or those without immediate safety consequences . however , gao found that faa has not identified or removed all duplicates from its data on runway “ excursions ” — when an aircraft veers off or overruns a runway — which limits faa 's ability to accurately analyze these incidents . additionally , faa does not use data to analyze incidents that occur in ramp areas — the parts of terminal areas where aircraft are prepared for departure and arrival — where injuries to workers and damage to aircraft can occur . without a process to leverage accurate excursion and ramp incident data , faa may not be able to assess the risk these incidents pose to passengers , airport staff , and others . faa , airports , and airlines have implemented multiple efforts to improve terminal area safety , but faa has not assessed the effectiveness of many of its efforts . for example , faa has funded multiple technologies to improve runway safety , such as airport surface detection equipment , model x ( asde - x ) — a ground surveillance system that enables air traffic controllers to track landing and departing aircraft and alerts controllers of potential collisions . however , faa has not assessed the effectiveness of asde - x . similarly , faa has not assessed the effectiveness of its runway safety program , whereby faa staff , along with local airport stakeholders , provide data and support to local air traffic managers to help identify and manage terminal area safety incidents . faa has taken steps to evaluate some of its terminal - area safety efforts , such as tracking the number of runway excursions safely stopped by a lightweight , crushable concrete designed to stop or greatly slow an aircraft that overruns the runway . however , without assessing how all of faa 's efforts contribute to its goal of improving runway and taxiway safety , faa can not determine the extent to which it is targeting its limited resources to the most effective strategies . gao is making five recommendations including that faa identify and remove duplicate excursion data , develop processes to analyze ramp area incidents , and establish a plan to assess the effectiveness of its terminal area safety efforts . faa concurred with the recommendations .
ihs provides care to american indians and alaska natives through a system of health care facilities . the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) provided states with the option to expand their medicaid programs , and created new coverage options beginning in 2014 , including for american indians and alaska natives . gao was asked to review how ppaca has affected health care coverage and services for american indians and alaska natives . in this report , gao describes trends in health insurance coverage and third - party collections at federally operated and tribally operated facilities from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , and the effects of any changes in coverage and collections on these facilities . to address these objectives , gao analyzed ihs data on coverage , third - party collections , and prc . gao interviewed ihs officials from headquarters and all 12 area offices , as well as from 17 facilities selected to include a mix of federally operated and tribally operated hospitals and health centers in states that both had and had not expanded their medicaid programs as of september 2018. gao interviewed officials from 11 federally operated ihs facilities and 6 tribally operated facilities . gao provided a draft of this report to the secretary of health and human services for comment . the department did not have any comments on the draft report . gao 's analysis of indian health service ( ihs ) data shows that from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , the percent of patients at federally operated ihs hospitals and health centers that reported having health insurance coverage increased an average of 14 percentage points . while all federally operated ihs facilities reported coverage increases , the magnitude of these changes differed by facility , with those located in states that expanded access to medicaid experiencing the largest increases . federally operated ihs facilities ' third - party collections — that is , payments for enrollees ' medical care from public programs such as medicaid and medicare , or from private insurers — totaled $ 1.07 billion in fiscal year 2018 , increasing 51 percent from fiscal year 2013. although exact figures were not available , tribally operated facilities , which include hospitals and health centers not run by ihs , also experienced increases in coverage and collections over this period , according to officials from selected facilities and national tribal organizations . increases in health insurance coverage and third - party collections helped federally operated and tribally operated facilities continue their operations and expand the services offered , according to officials from 17 selected facilities . these officials told gao that their facilities have been increasingly relying on third - party collections to pay for ongoing operations including staff payroll and facility maintenance . officials at most facilities with increases in third - party collections also stated that they expanded their onsite services , including increasing the volume or scope of services offered by , for example , adding new providers or purchasing medical equipment . increased coverage and collections also allowed for an expansion in the complexity of services provided offsite through the purchased / referred care ( prc ) program , which enables patients to obtain needed care from private providers if the patients meet certain requirements and funding is available . according to ihs and facility officials , increases in coverage have allowed some patients to access care offsite using their coverage , and an expansion of onsite services has reduced the need for some patients to access prc . officials gao interviewed from federally operated and tribally operated facilities stated that facilities ' expansion of onsite and offsite services has led to enhancements in patients ' access to care in some instances .
the presidential policy directive on united states cyber incident coordination states that significant cyber incidents are occurring with increasing frequency impacting public and private infrastructure in the united states . section 1648 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2016 included a provision that dod develop a comprehensive plan for cybercom to support civil authorities in responding to cyberattacks by foreign powers against the united states . section 1648 also included a provision that gao review dod 's plan . this review assesses the extent to which dod 's section 1648 report addressed the statutorily required submission elements . to conduct this work , gao assessed dod 's section 1648 report against the elements outlined in the statute . gao also discussed the section 1648 report with dod policy , joint chiefs of staff , combatant commands , and military service officials . the department of defense ( dod ) did not develop a comprehensive plan for u.s. cyber command ( cybercom ) ; instead , the department submitted a report consisting of a collection of documents that fully addressed two of the six statutorily required elements ; partially addressed three elements ; and did not address the sixth element on dod training activities . legend : ○ did not address : submission does not include required element . gao also found that , in addition to not addressing the training element in the report , dod had not ensured that staff are trained as required by the presidential policy directive on united states cyber incident coordination or dod 's significant cyber incident coordination procedures , which were included dod 's section 1648 report . taking action to improve these areas should help dod sustain progress it has already made . with the president 's decision to elevate cybercom to a unified combatant command , such actions will also help as dod continues to plan to support civil authorities in response to a cyber incident and where cybercom has a significant role . gao has previously recommended that dod take actions on elements of the section 1648 report that were partially addressed . gao is making two new recommendations that dod update cyber incident coordination training and maintain a list of officials trained in the national incident management system . dod concurred with maintaining a list of trained officials and partially concurred on updating cyber training . gao continues to believe the updating recommendation is warranted .
tsa is responsible for ensuring that all airline passengers and their property are screened for items that could pose a threat to airplanes and passengers at 440 airports across the united states . since 2016 , tso basic training — initial training for newly hired tsos , including both tsa - employed and private screeners — has consisted of an intensive two - week course at the tsa academy located at fletc . tsa has obligated about $ 53 million for the program from its inception through march 2018. in 2015 and 2017 , the department of homeland security inspector general raised questions about the effectiveness of checkpoint screening , which prompted concerns about training . gao was asked to review tsa 's training of new tsos . this report describes the reasons why tsa established the tso basic training program ; discusses factors otd considers when updating tso basic training curriculum ; and assesses the extent to which tsa evaluates its tso basic training program . gao reviewed documents on the development and modification of tso basic training curriculum ; visited fletc ; interviewed tsa officials ; and compared tsa 's program evaluation to leading practices . the transportation security administration ( tsa ) established the transportation security officer ( tso ) basic training program at the tsa academy at the federal law enforcement training centers ( fletc ) in glynco , georgia to obtain benefits from centralized training . prior to the basic training program , tso training was conducted at individual airports , often by tsos for whom instruction was a collateral duty . according to a business case developed by tsa for congress in 2017 and tsa officials , tsa expected implementation of the tso basic training program to provide efficiencies to the delivery of new - hire training for tsos and to enhance the professionalism and morale of newly hired screeners . for example , gao observed that tso basic training facilities have airport checkpoint equipment and x - ray image simulators for students to practice skills , eliminating the challenge of finding available equipment and training times in a busy airport environment . according to program officials , centralized training also provides trainees with an increased focus on the tsa mission and instills a common culture among tsos . tsa 's office of training and development ( otd ) updates and modifies the tso basic training curriculum in response to evolving security threats and evaluations of effectiveness , among other factors . for example , otd holds regular meetings with tsa 's office of security operations — the office responsible for managing tso performance — to discuss issues such as imminent threats . the offices also discuss analyses of tso effectiveness identified through covert tests , in which role players attempt to pass threat objects — such as knives , guns , or simulated improvised explosive devices — through the screening checkpoints . the two offices identify ways to address issues identified in covert testing , which are then incorporated into tso basic training . otd also gathers input from tso basic training instructors and from participants to adjust training curriculum . tsa has implemented a training evaluation model but has not yet established specific program goals and performance measures to assess tso basic training . the kirkpatrick model used by tsa is a commonly - accepted training evaluation model endorsed by the office of personnel management and used throughout the federal government . while tsa reported expected benefits of tso basic training in its business case and implemented the kirkpatrick model to begin assessing training , it has not yet identified specific goals that the program is expected to achieve , nor has it developed applicable performance measures to evaluate progress toward goals , as called for by leading management practices for training evaluation . tsa officials told gao that tso basic training is a relatively new program and they planned to collect more data on tso screening performance before further evaluating the potential impacts of the training program . however , tso basic training serves as the foundation for tsos to learn core skills and procedures , and it is important to establish goals and measures to better assess the effectiveness of the training they receive . this will help tsa determine the extent to which tsos are able to fulfill their important role in ensuring passenger safety while also showing results for the funds spent on such training each year . gao recommends that tsa establish specific goals and performance measures for the tso basic training program . tsa concurred with the recommendation .
fta 's capital investment grants program is the primary source of federal financial assistance to support transit projects that are locally planned , implemented , and operated . fta evaluates and rates projects seeking funding through this program according to statutory criteria and recommends to congress which projects to fund . the funding that project sponsors receive is subject to congressional appropriation . map - 21 includes a provision for gao to biennially review fta 's implementation of the capital investment grants program . this report discusses : fta 's progress in addressing statutory provisions contained in map - 21 and the fast act and how the evaluation and rating process fta has established for core capacity improvement projects enables fta to verify that statutory requirements are met before recommending such projects for funding . gao reviewed the relevant laws and fta 's guidance . gao also interviewed fta officials and six project sponsors , representing seven of the eight core capacity improvement projects in the capital investment grants program at the time of gao 's review . the federal transit administration ( fta ) has not addressed three statutory provisions concerning the capital investment grants program contained in the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ( map - 21 ) and the fixing america 's surface transportation act ( fast act ) . specifically , fta has not : issued regulations regarding the evaluation and rating process for core capacity improvement projects , which are a category of eligible projects within the program ; established a program of interrelated projects designed to allow for the simultaneous development of more than one transit project within the capital investment grants program ; or implemented a pilot program designed to create a fast - track approval process for transit projects that meet specific statutory criteria . throughout this review , fta officials told gao they do not have immediate plans to address these three statutory provisions . officials cited a proposal by the president to phase out the capital investment grants program as one of the factors influencing this decision . however , in march the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 , provided the program with more than $ 2.6 billion and required fta to continue to administer the program in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements specified in statute . subsequently , fta officials told gao that they are reviewing the act and determining next steps . however fta officials did not indicate that they intend to address these provisions . if fta does not implement the outstanding provisions , fta and project sponsors — that is , local transit agencies — may be missing opportunities to deliver transit projects more efficiently . based on a review of fta 's policy guidance , on fta 's instructions for applying to the capital investment grants program , and on other documentation supporting the two core capacity improvement projects that fta has recommended for funding as of june 2017 , gao found that fta has established a process to verify that proposed core capacity improvement projects meet statutory requirements before recommending projects for funding . core capacity improvement projects are capital investments designed to increase the capacity of an existing transit system and must meet specific statutory requirements to be eligible for funding through the program . gao found that prior to recommending a project for funding fta works with project sponsors to verify that their proposed project includes elements that will increase transit system capacity versus maintaining the current system , that the required amount of local funding is committed to the project , and that sponsors have the technical and financial capacity to complete the project they are proposing , among other statutory requirements . fta should initiate a rulemaking regarding the evaluation and rating process for core capacity improvement projects and take steps to address two other statutory provisions . fta agreed with the recommendations but disagreed with certain findings on which they are based . gao believes these findings are valid , as discussed in this report .
the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 included provisions that va and dod jointly develop and implement electronic health record systems or capabilities and accelerate the exchange of health care information . the act also required that these systems be compliant with applicable interoperability standards . further , the act established a joint interagency program office to act as a single point of accountability for the efforts , with the function of implementing , by september 30 , 2009 , electronic health record systems that allow for full interoperability . this testimony discusses gao 's previously reported findings on the establishment and evolution of the interagency program office over the last decade . in developing this testimony , gao summarized findings from its reports issued in 2008 through 2018 , and information on the departments ' actions in response to gao 's recommendations . since its establishment in 2008 , the department of defense ( dod ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) interagency program office has been involved in various approaches to increase health information interoperability . however , the office has not been effectively positioned to function as the single point of accountability for the departments ' electronic health record system interoperability efforts . for example , between july 2008 and january 2010 , gao issued reports on va 's and dod 's efforts to set up the office , which highlighted steps the departments had taken , but also identified deficiencies , such as vacant leadership positions and a lack of necessary plans . gao recommended that the departments improve management of their interoperability efforts by developing a project plan and results - oriented performance goals and measures . in april 2009 , the interagency program office was assigned responsibility for establishing a lifetime electronic record for servicemembers and veterans , called the virtual lifetime electronic record . gao reported in february 2011 that , among other things , the office had not developed and approved an integrated master schedule , a master program plan , or performance metrics for the initiative , as outlined in the office 's charter . accordingly , gao recommended that the departments correct these deficiencies to strengthen their efforts to establish the virtual lifetime electronic record . in march 2011 , va and dod committed to jointly developing a new , common integrated electronic health record system and empowered the interagency program office with increased authority , expanded responsibilities , and increased staffing levels for leading the integrated system effort . however , in february 2013 , the departments abandoned their plan to develop the integrated system and stated that they would again pursue separate modernization efforts . in february 2014 , gao reported on this decision and recommended that va and dod take steps to better position the office to function as the single point of accountability for achieving interoperability between the departments ' electronic health record systems . va and dod stated that they agreed with the above gao recommendations . however , in several cases the departments ' subsequent actions were incomplete and did not fully address all recommendations . in june 2017 va announced that it planned to acquire the same electronic health record system that dod has been acquiring . gao testified in june 2018 that a governance structure had been proposed that would be expected to leverage existing joint governance facilitated by the interagency program office . at that time , va 's program officials had stated that the department 's governance plans for the new program were expected to be finalized in october 2018. however , the officials have not yet indicated what role , if any , the interagency program office is to have in the governance process . ensuring that the role and responsibilities of the office are clearly defined within these governance plans is essential to va successfully acquiring and implementing the same system as dod . gao recommends that va clearly define the role and responsibilities of the interagency program office in the governance plans for acquisition of the department 's new electronic health record sys .
misuse and abuse of prescription opioids can lead to overdose and death . according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , 47,600 overdose deaths in the united states in 2017 involved an opioid . gao and other federal entities have raised concerns about opioid misuse and abuse in medicare . the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2016 ( cara ) authorized cms and medicare plan sponsors to establish voluntary dmps that may limit access to frequently abused prescription drugs , such as opioids , for medicare beneficiaries who are identified as being at risk for prescription drug abuse . dmps will become mandatory in medicare starting in january 2022. cara included a provision for gao to review dmps under medicare . this report : 1 ) describes how medicare identifies beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse and abuse and how it attempts to mitigate that risk ; and 2 ) identifies the factors likely to affect the success of medicare dmps . gao reviewed cdc 's guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain , cms regulations , and other relevant cms guidance . gao also interviewed officials from cms , the five largest medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors , and officials from six other stakeholder organizations representing medicare plan sponsors , physicians ( including pain specialists ) , pharmacy benefit managers , state medicaid programs , and patients . medicare 's drug management programs ( dmp ) identify beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse or abuse , and attempt to mitigate that risk through the use of case management and coverage limitations . dmps are overseen by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and voluntarily implemented by medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors ( private health plans ) . cms established a two - step framework for identifying at - risk beneficiaries under dmps . first , cms identifies potentially at - risk beneficiaries based on key factors , such as beneficiaries ' daily dosage of opioids and the number of prescribers and pharmacies from which they receive opioids , with higher numbers possibly putting the beneficiary at more risk . second , medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors ' clinicians coordinate the provision of care among prescribers and pharmacists ( referred to as case management ) to determine if those potentially at - risk beneficiaries are actually at risk . if a patient is deemed to be at risk , coverage limitation tools — such as limiting a beneficiary to a selected prescriber or pharmacy , and implementing point - of - sale restrictions on certain drugs or amounts — can be used to limit the at - risk beneficiary 's access to opioids . beneficiaries have an opportunity to appeal an at - risk designation . none of the five plan sponsors gao interviewed expressed concerns about beneficiaries not receiving clinically appropriate doses of opioids under the medicare dmps . medicare part d prescription drug plan sponsors and other stakeholders gao interviewed reported several factors beyond the case management process that could contribute to the success of dmps . these factors included communication among sponsors , opioid prescribers , and pharmacies dispensing opioids to reduce potential resistance to participating in dmps by opioid prescribers or beneficiaries . according to plan sponsors and stakeholders , plan sponsors could communicate with stakeholders to ensure that dmps are not viewed as a punitive tool by beneficiaries , but rather as tools for keeping them safe . plan sponsors and stakeholders noted that it is important for plan sponsors to have flexibility in varying coverage limitation features to fit regional and other differences in population groups . they noted that cms should periodically reassess and adjust the elements of the dmp program where appropriate , to incorporate evidence from the outcomes of the dmp — such as how at - risk beneficiaries are identified , or which drugs are selected as frequently abused drugs . finally , cms officials told gao that they are taking steps to assess the dmps and gather the information required to make periodic changes to the dmp program . for example , cms officials plan to analyze data for at - risk beneficiaries that dmps are required to report to cms , update their medicare part d audit protocol , and obtain feedback from plan sponsors about how the dmps are working . the department of health and human services provided technical comments on a draft of this report , which gao incorporated as appropriate .
according to fema — a component within dhs — the 2017 disasters affected 47 million people , or about 15 percent of the nation 's population . federal contracts have played a key role in responding to these disasters and in long - term community recovery . so far , fema has obligated billions of dollars on these contracts . this testimony is based primarily on gao 's recent reports on disaster contracting — specifically advance contracting and post - disaster contracts related to the 2017 disasters — which detail much of fema 's disaster contracting activities . it addresses key challenges fema faced contracting for goods and services in response to these disasters . to conduct this work , gao analyzed data from the federal procurement data system - next generation through june 30 , 2018 , the latest and most complete data available for the 2017 disasters . gao also analyzed fema guidance and documentation and interviewed fema officials to discuss the use of contracts to respond to the 2017 disasters . following hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , and the 2017 california wildfires , federal agencies entered into disaster - related contracts worth about $ 9.5 billion , according to data as of june 30 , 2018 — the latest and most complete data at the time of gao 's review ( see figure ) . the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) obligated about $ 2.9 billion of this total through advance contracts , which it establishes prior to a disaster to rapidly mobilize resources . fema obligated an additional $ 1.6 billion through post - disaster contracts , which are established after disasters hit . in its december 2018 and april 2019 reports , gao made 10 recommendations to strengthen fema 's ability to address challenges gao identified in how fema plans , coordinates , and tracks its contracts : planning : fema has an outdated strategy and unclear guidance on how contracting officers should use advance contracts and has not fully assessed its contracting workforce needs . effectively planning its contract use is critical to fema quickly providing critical goods and services . coordination : fema did not fully coordinate with states and localities on certain contracts and encountered communication and coordination challenges with other federal agencies . effective coordination helps fema ensure stakeholders have the tools needed to facilitate their disaster response efforts . tracking : the full extent of 2017 disaster contracting activities , for fema and other agencies , is unknown . gao found that codes used to track obligations for these disasters in a federal procurement data system were closed without full consideration of user needs or due to inconsistent implementation of criteria established by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) and other agencies , limiting visibility over federal disaster contracts . gao has made a total of 19 recommendations — most of which were to fema — related to contracting activities in response to the 2017 disasters . ten of these are described in this statement . dhs concurred with most of these recommendations , and has some actions underway , but it has not fully implemented them . attention to these recommendations can assist fema as it uses contracts to respond to future disasters .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed federal agencies ' strategic plans submitted in response to the government performance and results act of 1993 , focusing on : summarizing its observations on agencies ' september plans ; and providing additional information on how the next phase of the results act 's implementation -- performance planning measurement -- can be used to address the critical planning issue gao observed in reviewing the september strategic plans . gao noted that : on the whole , agencies ' september plans appear to provide a workable foundation for congress to use in helping to fulfill its appropriations , budget , authorization , and oversight responsibilities and for agencies to use in setting a general direction for their efforts ; agencies ' strategic planning efforts are still very much a work in progress ; gao 's reviews of september plans indicate that continued progress is needed in how agencies address three difficult planning challenges -- setting a strategic direction , coordinating crosscutting programs , and ensuring the capacity to gather and use performance and cost data ; gao found that agencies can build upon their initial efforts to set a strategic direction for their programs and activities ; the next stage in the results act 's implementation -- performance planning and measurement -- can assist agencies in addressing the challenge of setting a strategic direction ; as an agency develops its performance plan , it likely will identify opportunities to revise and clarify those strategic goals in order to provide a better grounding for the direction of the agency ; also , as agencies develop the objective , measurable annual performance goals as envisioned by the act , those goals can serve as a bridge that links long - term strategic goals to agencies ' daily operations ; the results act 's requirements for annual performance plans and performance measurement can also provide a structured framework for congress , office of management and budget , and agencies to address agencies ' crosscutting programs -- the second critical planning challenge ; gao found that although agencies have begun to recognize the importance of coordinating crosscutting programs , they must undertake the substantive coordination that is needed for the effective management of those programs ; the third critical planning challenge is the need for agencies to have the capacity to gather and use sound program performance and cost data to successfully measure progress toward their intended results ; under the results act , agencies are also to discuss in their annual performance plans how they will verify and validate the performance information that they plan to use to show whether goals are being met ; and verified and validated performance information , in conjunction with augmented program evaluation efforts , will help ensure that agencies are able to report progress in meeting goals and identify specific strategies for improving performance .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the sales practices for over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives , mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) , and structured notes , focusing on the : federal sales practice requirements applicable to these products and the dealers marketing them ; extent of end - user satisfaction with sales practice , product use , and related disputes and the costs of these disputes ; views of end - users and dealers on the nature of their relationship and responsibilities ; actions dealers and end - users have taken to reduce the potential for sales practice disputes ; and actions regulators have taken to address sales practice issues . gao noted that : the extent to which otc derivatives are subject to federal sales practice requirements intended to protect end - users varies , depending , in part , on whether they are considered to be securities , futures , or neither ; when they are considered to be securities or futures , their sale is covered by the federal securities or commodities laws , and they are regulated by the securities exchange commission ( sec ) and the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , respectively ; to the extent that these products are not securities or futures , end - users with sales practice disputes would need to seek redress against a dealer by asserting primarily state statutory or common law claims ; in contrast to most otc derivatives , mbs and structured notes are typically securities and , thereby , subject to the federal securities laws , except when exempted from specific provisions ; the extent to which sales practice requirements apply to the dealers marketing otc derivatives in the united states also varies , depending on whether the dealer offering them is regulated ; when otc derivatives are marketed by banks , they are subject to supervisory guidance issued by federal bank regulators ; securities , futures , and insurance firms , unlike banks , typically market otc derivatives that they consider to be neither securities nor futures from affiliates that are not subject to any direct federal financial regulatory oversight , although some individual transactions may be subject to such oversight ; although sales practice requirements vary by product and dealer , according to gao 's survey , most end - users were generally satisfied with the sales practices of the dealers with whom they entered transactions ; gao 's survey also found that relatively few organizations reported using otc derivatives ; gao 's review of regulatory and public records , covering 1993 through 1996 , indicated that cases involving actual or alleged deficiencies in dealer sales practices were limited in number ; however , the dealers and end - users involved in these cases often experienced significant costs ; although generally satisfied with dealer sales practices , end - users ' views on the nature of counterparty relationships sometimes differed from those of dealers ; in addition , bank regulators have taken certain actions to address sales practice issues ; and although sec and cftc do not directly regulate the affiliates that securities and futures firms use to conduct their otc derivatives activities , sec and cftc worked with the most active of these firms to produce one of two sets of voluntary guidance .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the impact of title i assistance on : sustainable economic development in recipient countries ; and long - term market development for u.s. agricultural goods in those countries . gao found that : u.s. agricultural exports and world food aid have decreased because there are other donor countries and new programs such as the department of agriculture 's ( usda ) market development program ; title i has had minimal effect on sustainable economic development in recipient countries ; the primary way in which title i food aid can contribute to broad - based sustainable development in the recipient country is to give the country the foreign exchange savings it needs to invest in long - term economic development projects ; the link between title i and market development is uncertain , since usda and other agency studies have not shown a link between title i assistance and the establishment of a long - term commercial market share for u.s. agricultural products ; price - sensitive exports restrict title i market development opportunities ; title i program management has been streamlined by assigning title i programs to usda and titles ii and iii to the agency for international development ( aid ) ; and while the objectives of p.l . 480 legislation can support u.s. foreign policy and trade interests , they can also impede the development of an effective program strategy .
pursuant to congressional requests , gao reviewed bank and thrift sales of mutual funds , focusing on : the extent and nature of bank and thrift mutual fund sales activities ; banks ' and thrifts ' disclosure of their mutual fund sales practices ; and the regulatory framework for overseeing bank and thrift mutual fund operations . gao found that : as of the end of 1993 , about 2,300 banks and thrifts were involved in mutual fund sales and about 114 institutions had established their own mutual funds ; during the 5 previous years , the value and numbers of bank - owned funds grew faster than the mutual fund industry as a whole and banks and thrifts became major sellers of nonproprietary funds ; banks and thrifts sell mutual funds to retain customers and increase fees ; in february 1994 , bank regulators issued guidelines on policies and procedures that financial institutions are to follow in selling nondeposit investment products due to their concern that banks and thrifts are not disclosing the risks of investing in mutual funds ; gao visits to selected banks and thrifts in 1994 disclosed that only about one - third of the institutions followed the disclosure guidelines , while nearly one - fifth of the institutions failed to disclose any risks ; the bank regulators are including steps in their examinations to assess how well these institutions are complying with the guidelines ; the existing regulatory framework is inadequate to deal with the rapid increase in banks ' and thrifts ' involvement in securities sales and management ; banks that directly sell to customers are predominantly regulated by bank regulators , while securities regulators mainly oversee banks which sell or advise through affiliates or third party brokers ; the existing regulatory framework could lead to inconsistent or overlapping regulatory treatment of the same activity and to conflict among the regulators ; and conflicts of interest may arise between banks ' mutual fund activities and traditional banking functions .
in december 2017 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) updated its policy on pregnant women , removing language that stated that pregnant women would generally not be detained except in extraordinary circumstances or as mandated by law . within dhs , cbp temporarily holds individuals in its facilities and processes them for further action , such as release or transfer to ice . ice manages the nation 's immigration detention system . ice utilizes various facility types to detain individuals , such as those owned and operated by ice and contract facilities . gao was asked to review issues related to the care of pregnant women in dhs facilities . this report examines what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in dhs facilities , dhs policies and standards that address the care of pregnant women , and what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in dhs facilities . gao analyzed available dhs data and documents from calendar years 2015 through 2019 , including detention data , inspection reports and data , and complaints ; reviewed policies related to the care of pregnant women ; and interviewed agency officials and three national non - governmental organizations . gao also interviewed a non - generalizable sample of 14 pregnant women detained or released by dhs and five non - governmental organizations in four field locations that had the greatest number of detentions of pregnant women , among other things . gao 's analyses of u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) and u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) data on pregnant women found : ice detained pregnant women over 4,600 times from calendar year 2016 through 2018 , with more than 90 percent resulting from cbp arrests . sixty - eight percent of these detentions were for 1 week or less , while 10 percent were for more than 30 days . seventy - eight percent of these initial detentions occurred at facilities staffed with ice medical personnel . ice has policies and detention standards that address a variety of topics regarding the care of pregnant women , such as pregnancy testing requirements , for which non - governmental organizations , professional associations , and federal agencies have issued recommended guidance . however , some facility types — which vary based on who owns , operates , and provides medical care at the facility — did not address all these pregnancy - related topics in their policies and standards , such as prenatal vitamins , as of december 2019. ice has plans to address the gaps gao identified in these facility types , including updating some of its policies and detention standards in february 2020. in regards to cbp , its facilities are designed for holding individuals for no more than 72 hours , and therefore are not equipped to provide long - term care . nonetheless , cbp has some policies and standards regarding pregnant women for its short - term facilities , including those related to nutrition and the circumstances in which restraints could be used . gao 's analyses of inspections and complaint mechanisms offered the following insights into the care provided to pregnant women : ice inspections found 79 percent or greater compliance with most of its pregnancy - related performance measures . for example , inspections found 91 percent of pregnant woman were seen by an obstetrician - gynecologist within 30 days of pregnancy confirmation , from december 2016 through march 2019. according to ice officials and agency documentation , ice has processes in place to address non - compliance . additional inspections identified pregnancy - related issues at 13 facilities from january 2015 through july 2019. the facilities or ice have taken actions to address the issues . cbp generally relies on offsite care for pregnant women , and as a result has limited information on care cbp provided . however , cbp has efforts underway to enhance medical support at selected facilities . over 100 complaints were filed about ice 's and cbp 's care of pregnant women from january 2015 through april 2019. of these complaints , 3 were substantiated or partially substantiated , and 24 were unsubstantiated or partially unsubstantiated . in most cases there was not enough information for the investigating agency to determine whether proper care had been provided .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the postal service 's ( usps ) development and marketing of new products and provided information on the expense and revenues associated with the products , focusing on : the statutory and regulatory authorities and constraints covering all major groups of new products ; the potential impact that enactment of h.r . 22 and usps ' proposed reform legislation could have on new products ; providing information on usps marketing department 's new product development process and determining , for three selected products , how closely that process was followed ; and providing information , including financial data , on all new postal and nonpostal products usps marketed or had under development during fiscal years ( fy ) 1995 , 1996 , and 1997. gao noted that : the statutory and regulatory authorities governing usps provide usps broad latitude to develop and market a wide variety of new products ; gao 's analysis shows that usps is subject to at least three constraints in developing and marketing new products ; since it is the underlying statutory mission of usps to provide postal services to bind the nation together , usps needs to be able to explain how any new product it develops will further that mission ; under its statutory authority , before marketing a new domestic postal product , usps must request a recommended decision from the postal rate commission ( prc ) regarding the propriety of usps ' proposed classification , rates , or fees for the new product ; prior to issuing its recommended decision , prc is required to hold hearings on usps ' proposal ; the postal board of governors may reject or modify prc 's recommended decision ; usps is not required to request a recommended decision from prc in the case of nonpostal products ; usps ' ability to market new products can be constrained by congressional oversight , restrictions imposed during the appropriations process , or other legislative actions ; adoption of either h.r . 22 or legislative changes offered by usps would amend usps ' current statutory authority to develop , test , approve , and market new products ; h.r . 22 should place new restrictions on the introduction of new , nonpostal products and international postal products ; however , h.r . 22 would provide usps with broader latitude to test market experimental postal products ; usps ' marketing department established the new business initiatives and products group , which implemented a new product development process , customerperfect ! . ; it is intended to ensure effective management control through a formalized system of checks and balances that require top management buy - in at four critical stages : concept ; business plan ; test ; and implementation ; three judgmentally selected products showed that in developing these products , the marketing department 's new business initiatives and products group generally followed the customerperfect ! . new product development process ; information and financial data show that during fiscal years 1995 , 1996 , and 1997 , usps marketed , or had under development , 19 new products that had been publicly announced ; and total revenues and expenses for the 19 products , from inception through fy 1997 were $ 148.8 million and $ 233.5 million .
cleaning up doe 's former uranium enrichment sites will cost billions of dollars and span decades . these sites , near oak ridge , tennessee ; paducah , kentucky ; and portsmouth , ohio , are contaminated with radioactive and hazardous materials . em is responsible for their cleanup . this report examines the extent to which em has managed cleanup of the gdps compared with relevant program management leading practices and the status of the cleanup effort ; what em has spent on cleanup at the gdps , and the extent to which em 's cost estimates for completing gdp cleanup are reliable ; and the extent to which the d & d fund is sufficient to cover em 's estimated cleanup costs of the gdps and challenges , if any , that could affect the sufficiency of the fund . gao reviewed relevant legislation and doe reports to congress on gdp cleanup ; compared program management to relevant leading practices ; assessed em expenditure and cost estimation documents ; and interviewed em and state regulatory officials at the three gdps . since 2007 , the department of energy ( doe ) has stated in reports to congress that it intends to manage its three former gaseous diffusion plants ( gdp ) in an integrated manner . also , a decontamination and decommissioning ( d & d ) fund was established by law to pay for the cleanup costs of the gdp sites , so that doe 's office of environmental management ( em ) must coordinate and make trade - offs in its use of resources among the three gdps . however , em has managed the cleanup of the three gdps as three individual sites . in addition , em is not following relevant leading practices gao reviewed for managing the cleanup as a program ( having a program management plan ; a reliable integrated master schedule ; and a reliable , integrated , comprehensive life - cycle cost estimate . by managing the three gdps as an integrated program and following these program management leading practices , em would have more reasonable assurance that it is taking every opportunity to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its management activities . em has reported spending a total of about $ 15.5 billion on gdp cleanup as of fiscal year 2018. however , em 's cost estimates for completing cleanup at the three sites are not reliable . gao assessed em 's cost estimates for the gdps individually by comparing them with best practices for developing high - quality , reliable cost estimates . em 's cost estimates for completing cleanup of the gdps do not fully or substantially meet all of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate until em ensures that its site - specific cost estimates fully incorporate best practices for cost estimation , em , doe , regulators , and congress will not have the information needed to understand the level of resources required to achieve cleanup of the three gdps . under em 's current cost estimates , remaining gdp cleanup costs exceed the balance of the d & d fund by at least $ 25 billion and em faces challenges that could affect cleanup progress and the sufficiency of the fund . for example , doe 's reporting to congress on the sufficiency of the d & d fund is based on old financial data , incomplete information , and unclear scope . these limitations reduce the quality of the information congress receives for making decisions about the sufficiency of the fund and allocating resources to the fund . for example , doe reported to congress on the status of the d & d fund and gdp cleanup in may 2019. the report was based on financial data as of september 2016 and on cost estimates prepared in 2013 for one gdp and in 2014 for the other two . given that doe estimates the fund will be exhausted in 2020 , there is urgency for doe to communicate current information on the fund on a timely basis to congress . by regularly reporting on the status of the d & d fund and cleanup efforts at the three gdps with current information that contains details on challenges in reaching agreement with regulators and a clear scope of work , doe will be able to provide better information for congressional decision - making on the sufficiency of the fund . gao is making five recommendations , including that doe manage the cleanup of the three gdps as an integrated program and follow program management leading practices , ensure cost estimates fully incorporate cost estimating best practices , and report regularly on the status of the d & d fund and cleanup efforts at the three gdps . doe agreed with four of them and partially agreed with one . gao believes all of the recommendations should be implemented at all three sites .
dod 's mtfs are critical to the medical readiness of servicemembers and providing readiness training for about 107,000 active - duty medical providers . about 9.6 million beneficiaries are eligible for dod health care through mtfs and civilian network providers . to further support readiness , the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2017 required dod to plan to restructure mtfs . dod 's february 2020 plan included decreasing capabilities at 43 mtfs and closing five . the ndaa included a provision for gao to review the plan . this report addresses the extent to which 1 ) the plan 's methodology prioritized statutory elements and considered complete information , and 2 ) dod is positioned to execute mtf restructuring transitions . gao reviewed dod 's plan , mtf workload and cost data , and interviewed dod leaders and officials at 11 mtfs selected on the basis of military department , restructuring action , and location . the department of defense 's ( dod ) methodology to determine medical treatment facilities ' ( mtf ) restructuring actions in its implementation plan ( the plan ) prioritized statutory elements . these included military readiness , adequacy of nearby civilian health care , and cost - effectiveness . however , dod based part of its methodology on incomplete and inaccurate information . civilian health care assessments did not consistently account for provider quality . dod generally assumed that identified providers were of sufficient quality . gao found that dod considered the quality of nearby civilian providers for one of 11 selected mtfs . in this instance , information from the mtf about the variable quality of nearby civilian health care led to dod 's determination that such care was not yet adequate to support mtf restructuring . officials gao interviewed from other mtfs discussed concerns about quality of care from nearby civilian providers . civilian health care assessments did not account for access to an accurate and adequate number of providers near mtfs . dod may have included in its assessments providers who do not meet dod 's access - to - care standards for certain beneficiaries . for 11 selected mtfs , gao found that about 56 percent of civilian primary care providers and 42 percent of civilian specialty providers that dod identified as being nearby exceeded dod 's drive - time standards . including such providers in its assessments means that dod could have overestimated the adequacy of civilian health care providers in proximity to some mtfs . cost - effectiveness assessments were based on a single set of assumptions . dod concluded that civilian health care was more cost - effective than care in its mtfs without considering other assumptions that could affect its conclusions . for example , dod applied assumptions about the cost of military personnel salaries , mtf workloads , and reimbursement rates for tricare that likely underestimated the cost - effectiveness of mtfs . gao also found that dod conducted limited assessments of mtfs ' support to the readiness of military primary care and nonphysician medical providers — an issue dod officials stated they will address during mtf transitions . until dod resolves methodology gaps by using more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness , dod leaders may not fully understand risks to their objectives in restructuring future mtfs . dod 's plan identified actions needed to facilitate mtf restructuring , but the department is not well positioned to execute the transitions . dod 's plan poses challenges for the military departments and the defense health agency ( dha ) related to mtf providers ' readiness . yet , dod plans to move forward with restructuring without a process to monitor progress and challenges . by establishing roles and responsibilities for executing and monitoring mtf restructuring transitions , dod can be better positioned to navigate organizational boundaries between the dha that manages the mtfs and the military departments that provide staff . additionally , by defining measurable objectives and progress thresholds , dod can better ensure it is meeting objectives and facilitating timely adjustments to mtf restructuring transitions , as needed . gao is making six recommendations , including that future mtf assessments use more complete and accurate information about civilian health care quality , access , and cost - effectiveness ; and that dod establish roles , responsibilities , and progress thresholds for mtf transitions . dod partially concurred with four recommendations and concurred with two . as discussed in the report , gao continues to believe that all six recommendations are warranted .
human health and well - being require clean and safe water , according to the water research foundation . the fourth national climate assessment states that the potential impacts of extreme weather events from climate change will vary in severity and type and can have a negative effect on drinking water and wastewater utilities . gao 's previous work on climate change and resilience to extreme weather and disasters has shown how the federal government can provide information and technical and financial assistance to promote and enhance climate resilience . in 2015 , gao reported that enhancing climate resilience means taking action to reduce potential future losses by planning and preparing for climate - related impacts , such as extreme rainfall . this report examines federal technical and financial assistance to utilities for enhancing climate resilience , and options experts identified for providing additional assistance , among other things . gao reviewed relevant federal laws , regulations , and guidance from four federal agencies — epa , fema , hud , and usda — and interviewed federal officials , representatives from 15 water utilities selected for diversity of size and geography , and 10 experts selected to represent different views . four federal agencies — the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) , and the departments of housing and urban development ( hud ) and agriculture ( usda ) — provide technical and financial assistance ( e.g . , loans and grants ) , to drinking and wastewater utilities . technical assistance . epa provides technical assistance to drinking water and wastewater utilities to enhance their infrastructure 's resilience to climate change . however , according to epa officials , epa 's program is small and can not assist utilities nationwide . all of the selected experts gao interviewed stated that utilities need additional technical assistance on an ongoing basis to manage climate risks , and most experts said that organizing a network of existing technical assistance providers , including federal and state agencies , universities , and industry groups , would be needed to provide such assistance . under a presidential policy directive , epa is to work to enable efficient information exchanges among federal agencies and to help inform planning and operational decisions for water and wastewater infrastructure . by identifying existing technical assistance providers and engaging them in a network to help utilities incorporate climate resilience into their infrastructure projects on an ongoing basis , epa would have better assurance that climate information was effectively exchanged among federal agencies and utilities . financial assistance . federal agencies have taken some actions to promote climate resilience when providing financial assistance for water infrastructure projects , but agencies do not consistently include the consideration of climate resilience when funding such projects . most selected experts suggested that federal agencies should require that climate information be considered in the planning of water infrastructure projects as a condition of providing financial assistance . moreover , representatives from several utilities said that such a requirement could be an effective and feasible way to help enhance utilities ' climate resilience . a requirement would ensure that utilities consider climate resilience in planning for water infrastructure projects and potentially limit future fiscal exposures . for example , from fiscal years 2011 through 2018 , the federal government provided at least $ 3.6 billion in disaster recovery financial assistance for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure related projects ( see figure ) . gao recommends that epa identify technical assistance providers and engage them in a network to help water utilities incorporate climate resilience into infrastructure projects . also , congress should consider requiring that climate resilience be considered in planning for federally funded water infrastructure projects . epa neither agreed nor disagreed . gao believes the recommendation is still warranted .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the procurement practices of the district of columbia financial responsibility and management assistance authority , focusing on whether : applicable procurement regulations and procedures were followed in awarding and administering selected contracts on behalf of the authority 's former chief of management officer and to thompson , cobb , bazilio and associates ; and the authority and the district received the goods and services that they contracted and paid for in the contracts that gao reviewed . gao noted that : the authority did not always comply with its procurement regulations and procedures or follow sound contracting principles when it awarded and administered the 9 contracts that gao assessed ; the authority 's contract files for these contracts were incomplete ; the files did not generally contain documentation of the key contract award and administration decisions as required by the authority 's procurement regulations ; as a result of the incomplete contract files , the authority could not demonstrate that its objectives of : acquiring goods and services at the lowest price or best value ; and treating offerors fairly were achieved for several of the contracts gao reviewed ; the authority 's procurement regulations provide for a preference for competitively awarded contracts and require written justification and approval of sole source contracts ; the authority 's contract files contained evidence that it sought competition for 7 of the 9 contracts assessed ; however , contrary to regulations , the authority did not : document its basis for contract selection for 3 contracts ; include written justification for 1 sole source contract award or a series of modifications to another contract that , in effect , was a sole source award ; or comply with other requirements in several cases ; none of the contract files for the 9 contracts assessed contained certification or any other evidence that the contractor performed satisfactorily prior to payment of invoices ; for the 2 emergency sole source contracts awarded by the district government , the district 's chief procurement officer did not comply with the authority 's contract review and approval regulations governing district contracts or procurement regulations ; several factors appeared to contribute to the authority 's failure to comply with its procurement regulations ; and according to the authority 's former executive director , the magnitude of the tasks and the short timeframe in which the authority had to complete them contributed to the authority 's procurements not being as `` tidy '' as the authority would have liked .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on whether federal prison industries ( fpi ) collects and maintains data that would enable it to make reliable , generalizable statements about the satisfaction of its federal agency customers with respect to the quality , cost , and timely delivery of fpi 's products , focusing on : if fpi has data , either from its management information system or other sources , to support overall conclusions about how federal customers who buy and use its products and services view their timeliness , price , and quality ; and whether agencies who are among the largest buyers of fpi products and services monitor fpi 's performance the same way they do commercial vendors in terms of timeliness , price , and quality . gao noted that : fpi has been the subject of substantial debate over the years , much of which has centered on the timeliness , price , and quality of its products ; missing from this debate have been convincing data that show whether federal customers who buy and use fpi products and services are satisfied with fpi 's performance ; fpi has a variety of management information systems that allow it to track customer orders and react to complaints ; however , fpi does not have a systematic or structured process for collecting and analyzing customer satisfaction data so that conclusions can be drawn about customer satisfaction ; fpi 's efforts to gauge customer satisfaction have been limited to relying on narrowly scoped surveys as well as other efforts ; without convincing data on customer satisfaction , fpi : remains vulnerable to assertions by its critics that federal customers are dissatisfied and , in turn , should no longer be required to buy fpi products ; and may miss opportunities to improve its operations by having better data on how federal customers view its performance in the areas of timeliness , price , and quality ; furthermore , fpi 's lack of a systematic approach for collecting these data appears inconsistent with contemporary management principles used by both public - and private - sector organizations ; regarding agencies ' efforts to monitor fpi performance , major customer agencies that gao contacted stated that they consider price when awarding contracts and monitor factors like quality and timeliness while administering contracts for all vendors , including fpi ; it should be recognized , however , that the contracting officer 's leverage in resolving procurement problems is different for fpi than for private - sector vendors since the rules that typically govern contracts with private - sector vendors do not apply to fpi ; in this regard , on september 13 , 1993 , the acting attorney general issued a legal opinion that fpi , as a seller of goods to the federal government , is not covered by the federal acquisition regulations ( far ) , and must be treated under its authorizing legislation far subpart 8.6 ; furthermore , agencies can not use past performance information to deny awarding a contract to fpi because , under the law , fpi is a mandatory source of supply ; and however , at fpi 's discretion , agencies can use it to negotiate with fpi factors such as product quality or delivery time frames , or to seek a waiver from fpi so that they can buy from a commercial vendor that can better meet their quality or delivery requirements .
the federal records act , a subsequent directive , and nara regulations establish requirements for agencies to ensure the transparency , efficiency , and accountability of federal records , including those in electronic form . in addition , nara plays an important role in overseeing and assisting agencies ' records management efforts . gao was asked to evaluate federal agencies ' implementation of the aforementioned requirements related to electronic records . the objectives were to determine the extent to which selected agencies ' policies and procedures address the electronic recordkeeping requirements in the managing government records directive and the presidential and fra amendments of 2014 and nara assisted selected agencies in managing their electronic records . to do so , gao selected 17 agencies and reviewed their records management policies and procedures . gao also reviewed laws and requirements pertaining to nara 's roles and responsibilities for assisting agencies in managing their electronic records . further , gao analyzed nara guidance and other documents that discussed nara 's efforts in carrying out these responsibilities . seventeen agencies gao selected for review varied in the extent to which their policies and procedures addressed the electronic recordkeeping requirements in the managing government records directive and the federal records act ( fra ) and its amendments . more specifically , 14 of the 17 agencies established records management programs , while three agencies did not . of those 14 agencies with established records management programs , almost all addressed requirements related to incorporating electronic records into their existing programs , but many did not have policies and procedures to fully incorporate recordkeeping functionalities into electronic systems , establish controls and preservation considerations for systems , and issue instructions on email requirements ( see table ) . nara provided guidance and assistance to the selected agencies , including guidance on electronic records management and training . all of the agencies stated that the assistance was generally helpful and that they relied on it to some extent for implementing the key requirements discussed in this report . further , nara oversaw the selected agencies ' implementation of federal records management regulations through their self - assessment progam . however , nara had not ensured that the selected small or micro agencies that self - assessed to be at high risk of improper records management in calendar year 2017 were taking appropriate actions to make improvements to their records management programs . nara officials stated they conduct follow - up with the agencies that report poor scores , but they do not proactively require the agencies to address their weaknesses . until nara requires these agencies to develop plans to make necessary improvements , these agencies will likely miss important opportunities to improve their record management practices . gao is making 40 recommendations to 14 of the 17 selected agencies to improve their management of electronic records . gao is also recommending that nara require high - risk smaller agencies to create improvement plans and monitor progress on a regular basis . six agencies , including nara , agreed with the recommendations , while 11 did not state whether they agreed or disagreed , or had no comments .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao assessed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) performance during the 1997 tax filing season , focusing on : the ability of taxpayers seeking answers to questions to reach irs via the telephone ; the number of returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method ; irs ' efforts to deal with returns that have missing or incorrect social security numbers ( ssn ) ; the use of banks , known as lockboxes , to process certain tax payments ; and performance of the imaging system irs uses to process certain tax returns . gao noted that : the irs met or exceeded most of its 1997 filing season related performance goals ; of particular note is the substantial improvement in two important areas where gao has criticized irs ' performance in past filing seasons -- telephone accessibility and the use of alternative filing methods ; according to irs data , telephone accessibility increased from 20 percent during the 1996 filing season to 51 percent during the 1997 filing season ; the number of tax returns filed by means other than the traditional paper method increased by 25 percent over the last year , with the number of returns filed by telephone ( telefile ) showing the most significant increase -- 65 percent ; although the revised tax package apparently contributed to an increase in the use of telefile , it also apparently contributed to a decrease in the performance of the service center recognition / image processing system ( scrips ) -- a document imaging and optical character recognition system that irs implemented in 1994 to process forms 1040ez and certain other tax documents ; another major change during the 1997 filing season involved the procedures irs used to process returns that were filed with missing or incorrect ssns ; in 1997 , as authorized by the welfare reform act of 1996 , irs began treating missing or incorrect ssns as math errors rather than as issues that , in the past , had to be resolved through a lengthy notice process ; as of september 1 , 1997 , according to irs , it had protected about $ 1.46 billion in revenue through the disallowance of claimed credits or dependent exemptions in 1997 , more than doubling the amount disallowed using the procedures irs followed in 1996 ; one issue that gao discussed in a previous report that continues to be of concern is the cost - effectiveness of irs ' use of lockboxes to process 1040 tax payments ; additional information gao obtained this year heightened its concern by calling into question a key assumption irs and the department of the treasury 's financial management service ( fms ) have used to calculate the interest cost savings associated with this use of lockboxes ; and although fms had planned a study to further assess interest cost savings , those plans have been deferred , and there is no assurance when such a study will be done .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined : the extent of legalized gaming in the united states ; currency transaction reporting requirements for casinos ; whether the same transaction reporting requirements apply to tribal casinos ; and the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) efforts to ensure that casinos are complying with currency transaction reporting requirements . gao found that : 48 states permit some form of legalized gaming , including riverboat casino gaming and indian gaming ; the amount of cash wagered annually in casinos has grown from $ 117 billion in 1984 to $ 407 billion in 1994 ; the bank secrecy act ( bsa ) requires casinos to report currency transactions over $ 10,000 , obtain additional identifying information about customers opening a line of credit , and develop bsa compliance programs that meet certain requirements ; although nevada casinos report customers that purchase chips in cash amounts over $ 10,000 , they do not report customer identification information on verified winnings over $ 10,000 or cash exchanges involving small denomination bills over $ 2,500 ; tribal casinos are not subject to bsa , but they must report currency transactions in accordance with the internal revenue code ( irc ) provision regarding cash received in a trade or business ; irs has made efforts to educate tribal casino officials on irc reporting requirements to ensure that they are complying with federal regulations ; irs needs to use its enforcement resources to complete compliance reviews of other nonbank financial institutions and to ensure that individuals and businesses are complying with tax laws ; and new bsa regulations will relieve some of the pressure on irs by requiring casinos to take a more active role in ensuring their own compliance with bsa .
dod relies on pme and jpme to prepare its military personnel throughout their careers for the intellectual demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically involve more than a single military service . however , according to dod 's summary of the 2018 national defense strategy , pme “ has stagnated , focused more on the accomplishment of mandatory credit at the expense of lethality and ingenuity. ” the conference report accompanying the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 included a provision for gao to evaluate dod pme and jpme institutions . this report examines the extent to which the military services ' pme programs have met civilian and jpme accreditation requirements , osd has assessed the effectiveness of the military services ' pme programs , and usd ( comptroller ) has monitored the military services ' pme program budget data . gao analyzed applicable laws and policy , analyzed accreditation and budget information , and interviewed officials from the military services ' intermediate - and senior - level resident pme programs . all of the military services ' intermediate - and senior - level officer professional military education ( pme ) programs have met civilian and met or partially met joint pme ( jpme ) accreditation requirements . however , not all of the military services ' pme programs met the jpme seminar student mix requirement of at least one student from the nonhost military department . for example , the army 's intermediate - level pme program did not meet its sea service ( i.e . , navy , marine corps , and , in certain instances , coast guard ) requirement ( see table ) . gao 's analysis found that the navy could have assigned officers to air force and army programs while not harming participation in its own seminars . without taking steps to improve sea service participation , students lose opportunities to interact with students from other military departments , which officials have identified as critical to joint acculturation . the office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) has taken steps to improve its oversight of the military services ' pme programs , but is limited in its ability to assess their effectiveness . department of defense ( dod ) guidance states that performance measurement is a means of evaluating efficiency , effectiveness , and results and that a balanced performance measurement scorecard includes nonfinancial and financial measures focusing on quality , cycle time , and costs . while osd is in the process of developing some performance measures , it is not planning to require the military services to track program costs . implementing its planned measures and establishing costs as a performance measure will better position osd to assess the effectiveness of pme programs . the under secretary of defense ( usd ) ( comptroller 's ) ability to monitor the military services ' pme programs is limited by incomplete and inconsistent reporting of service budget request data . dod guidance does not require the marine corps to submit an annual budget request data exhibit for its senior - level pme program and existing guidance for programs that are reported does not specify how to uniformly account for costs . without complete and uniform budget request data , usd ( comptroller ) is challenged in monitoring these programs . gao is making seven recommendations , including that dod take steps to determine its ability to assign navy officers to pme programs of other services , implement performance measures – including tracking of costs , and issue guidance for service reporting of pme budget request data . dod concurred with all of gao 's recommendations .
in may 2018 , gao reported that the trust fund , which pays benefits to certain coal miners , faced financial challenges . the trust fund has borrowed from the u.s. treasury 's general fund almost every year since 1979 to make needed expenditures . gao 's june 2019 testimony included preliminary observations that coal operator bankruptcies were further straining trust fund finances because , in some cases , benefit responsibility was transferred to the trust fund . this report examines how coal mine operator bankruptcies have affected the trust fund , and how dol managed coal mine operator insurance to limit financial risk to the trust fund . gao identified coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016 using bloomberg data . gao selected these years , in part , because bankruptcies were more likely to be resolved so that their effects on the trust fund could be assessed . gao analyzed information on commercially - insured and self - insured coal operators , and examined workers ' compensation insurance practices in four of the nation 's top five coal producing states . gao also interviewed dol officials , coal mine operators , and insurance company representatives , among others . coal mine operator bankruptcies have led to the transfer of about $ 865 million in estimated benefit responsibility to the federal government 's black lung disability trust fund ( trust fund ) , according to dol estimates . the trust fund pays benefits when no responsible operator is identified , or when the liable operator does not pay . gao previously testified in june 2019 that it had identified three bankrupt , self - insured operators for which benefit responsibility was transferred to the trust fund . since that time , dol 's estimate of the transferred benefit responsibility has grown — from a prior range of $ 313 million to $ 325 million to the more recent $ 865 million estimate provided to gao in january 2020. according to dol , this escalation was due , in part , to recent increases in black lung benefit award rates and higher medical treatment costs , and to an underestimate of patriot coal 's future benefit claims . dol 's limited oversight of coal mine operator insurance has exposed the trust fund to financial risk , though recent changes , if implemented effectively , can help address these risks . in overseeing self - insurance in the past , dol did not estimate future benefit liability when setting the amount of collateral required to self - insure ; regularly review operators to assess whether the required amount of collateral should change ; or always take action to protect the trust fund by revoking an operator 's ability to self - insure as appropriate . in july 2019 , dol began implementing a new self - insurance process that could help address past deficiencies in estimating collateral and regularly reviewing self - insured operators . however , dol 's new process still lacks procedures for its planned annual renewal of self - insured operators and for resolving coal operator appeals should operators dispute dol collateral requirements . this could hinder dol from revoking an operator 's ability to self - insure should they not comply with dol requirements . further , for those operators that do not self - insure , dol does not monitor them to ensure they maintain adequate and continuous commercial coverage as appropriate . as a result , the trust fund may in some instances assume responsibility for paying benefits that otherwise would have been paid by an insurer . gao is making three recommendations to dol to establish procedures for self - insurance renewals and coal operator appeals , and to develop a process to monitor whether commercially - insured operators maintain adequate and continuous coverage . dol agreed with our recommendations .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed federal workforce downsizing , focusing on the projected costs and savings from federal workforce buyouts and reductions - in - force ( rif ) over a 5-year period . gao found that : employee buyouts could produce over $ 60,000 more in net savings over 5 years than rif for each vacated position because buyouts can be used at higher grade levels that generate more savings in salaries and benefits when downsized ; if federal agencies separate retirement - eligible employees who do not displace lower - grade employees , rif could produce about $ 29,000 more in net savings over 5 years than buyouts ; displacing employees in the same competitive areas but lower - tenure groups or with less service within the same tenure groups reduces rif savings because those savings represent the salaries and benefits of lower - grade employees ; savings from buyouts or rif could be reduced if the vacated positions are refilled or privatized ; federal agencies may need more buyouts than rif to achieve their downsizing targets because normal attrition slows prior to buyouts ; buyouts avoid or reduce the non - economic adverse effects of rif , such as reduced diversity , decreased productivity , and lower morale ; and buyouts may help federal agencies improve diversity , since buyouts typically affect older white males .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the internal revenue services 's ( irs ) use of information gathering projects ( igp ) , focusing on : the number of igps nationwide and in irs ' georgia district during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 ; descriptions and results of igps in georgia during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 ; and controls and procedures irs has in place for igps . gao noted that : irs reported that it had about 1,000 igps open nationwide during both fiscal year ( fy ) 1995 and fy 1996 ; data on the nationwide number of igps in fy 1994 were not readily available ; according to irs officials , nationwide tracking records were discarded or lost during irs ' reorganization efforts , which involved consolidating 63 districts into 33 and shifting responsibility for igp records ; of the 76 igps that were open in georgia during fiscal years 1994 through 1996 , over half focused on : business taxpayers that potentially underreported their income or overreported expenses ; business taxpayers that potentially did not properly report or pay taxes , such as the excise tax on fuels ; individual taxpayers who potentially claimed an improper exemption , filing status , or earned income credit ; and business and individual taxpayers who potentially did not file required tax returns ; of these 76 georgia igps , 41 had closed as of june 1997 ; the duration of these closed audits varied from several months to several years ; the audit results , such as additional taxes recommended plus penalties , also varied , with the additional tax amounts ranging from $ 0 to $ 269 million ; for most of these igps , irs audited relatively few tax returns ; irs closed about three - quarters of these igps after auditing fewer than 50 returns , including 9 that closed without any audits being done ; for years , irs has had several controls and procedures designed to limit the vulnerability of igps to misuse as an audit selection technique ; irs has always required that proposed igps undergo review and approval processes at high levels within the examination division in each of the districts ; to oversee igps , irs has a unit at each of its 33 district offices ; these units monitor how returns were selected for audit and whether the audit results justified continuance of the project ; further , irs recently has started adding processes to enhance the contribution of igps to compliance research ; in 1997 , irs began implementing compliance initiative proposal processes ; and irs is involving its research division in the processes for approving and overseeing igps in the hope of making igps more useful for research purposes .
in response to a congressional request , gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) processes for handling undeliverable mail , focusing on the : amount of and reasons for undeliverable mail ; and impact of undeliverable mail on taxpayers and irs . gao found that : irs estimates that it had about 6.5 million pieces of undeliverable mail in 1986 and about 15 million pieces in 1992 ; undeliverable mail is principally caused by taxpayers failing to leave forwarding addresses , the u.s. postal service not delivering or forwarding mail , and irs incorrectly recording taxpayers ' addresses in its files ; taxpayer interest and penalties can substantially increase because of undeliverable mail , which eventually can lead to irs attachment of taxpayers ' liquid assets ; irs loses millions of dollars in revenue annually and incurs increased operating costs because of undeliverable mail ; the irs collection division plans to start processing undeliverable mail after the first occurrence and send only two instead of four service center notices to decrease collection costs ; irs has implemented only a few recommendations to decrease its undeliverable mail because it expects its tax systems modernization initiative to resolve its undeliverable mail problem ; senior irs management recently requested responsible irs offices to develop action plans to decrease the amount of undeliverable mail in a recent internal irs report ; irs needs to increase taxpayers ' awareness of the need to provide address changes to minimize the volume of undeliverable mail ; and more efficient processing of undeliverable mail could result if irs consolidates mail processing functions into one centralized unit .
gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) taxpayer compliance measurement program ( tcmp ) , focusing on : program plans for tax year 1994 ; and the plans ' potential effects on measuring taxpayer compliance . gao found that : the 1994 tcmp survey will differ significantly from previous surveys and include over 150,000 tax returns from individuals , small corporations , partnerships , and s corporations ; irs plans to analyze survey results by types of businesses and individuals and measure compliance on both a national and smaller geographical area basis ; irs plans to use computers to record audit adjustments , tax issues , and the reasons for the adjustments , provide auditors with tax return data for 1992 through 1994 and other tax information on each taxpayer , use an economic reality audit technique to compare the taxpayer 's lifestyle to the information reported on the tax return , and identify the causes of noncompliance and the associated tax ; irs has not met its timetable for tcmp planning decisions which jeopardizes its planned october 1995 start date for the survey ; irs is addressing its lack of a research plan and its lack of data on partnerships and s corporations ; and irs plans to collect information on employees who incorrectly file as self - employed and other known compliance problems , and develop a mechanism to retrieve tcmp audit workpapers for researchers .
for decades , the government has contracted and entered into agreements to sponsor academic , nonprofit , or private organizations to operate ffrdcs . dod military departments and other dod components sponsor 10 ffrdcs to help develop innovative solutions to diverse national security threats . five ffrdcs — referred to as s & a centers — aim to provide independent analyses to support dod policy development . federal regulation and dod guidance specify sponsors ' oversight activities , including the establishment , use , and review of ffrdcs . a senate armed services committee report included a provision that gao review dod 's use of ffrdcs . this report describes , among other objectives : dod obligations ( in dollars ) to dod 's ffrdcs from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 ; factors that led dod to use s & a centers for research ; and how dod used this research . gao analyzed obligation data for dod 's 10 ffrdcs . gao focused further review on dod 's five s & a centers that primarily provide studies and analysis . gao analyzed sponsoring agreements , comprehensive reviews , and 22 s & a center research projects selected based on factors such as obtaining a mix of project costs , and interviewed dod and ffrdc representatives . from fiscal years 2013 through 2018 , the department of defense ( dod ) obligated about $ 2 billion annually to 10 dod - sponsored federally funded research and development centers ( ffrdc ) , excluding obligations related to two intelligence programs and capital equipment costs ( such as antenna or radar systems ) . of these obligations , roughly $ 400 million annually went to a subset of five ffrdcs called study and analysis ( s & a ) centers . note : obligation amounts were not adjusted for inflation and totals may be affected by rounding . a numbers in parentheses refer to the number of ffrdcs within each category . dod primarily cited strategic relationships between the sponsor ( the agency responsible for the overall use of the ffrdc ) and the ffrdc and the core competencies of the ffrdc as factors when sponsoring s & a centers and initiating projects . for example : strategic relationships . the army determined that an s & a center was uniquely qualified to conduct a research project that required knowledge of defense planning scenarios , noting that awarding the project to an industry contractor would have given that contractor a competitive advantage . core competencies . the center for naval analyses has core competencies in navy policy , strategy , and doctrine , among other things . s & a centers perform hundreds of research projects annually on behalf of dod , and dod reported using them to inform decisions , shape guidance , and identify opportunities to improve efficiency . for example , one s & a center 's study on the causes of weapons system cost overruns found dod needed to re - examine its assumptions when estimating program cost , schedule , and performance . dod officials told us the study contributed to policy , process , and training updates .
gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) efforts to have its information systems function correctly when processing dates beyond december 31 , 1999 , focusing on : irs ' progress in converting its systems according to the guidelines in gao 's year 2000 assessment guide ; the risks irs faces to completing the year 2000 effort on time ; and risks to the continuity of irs operations in the event of year 2000-induced system failures . gao noted that : according to irs , before january 1999 , it needs to complete 12 steps of its 14-step process for converting : the applications for its existing systems ; the telecommunications networks ; and systems software and hardware for mainframes , minicomputers / file servers , and personal computers ; in addition , before january 1999 , irs needs to : ensure that external data exchanges will be year 2000 compliant ; implement the integrated submission and remittance processing system and , at a minimum , the year 2000 portions of mainframe consolidation ; and modify application software to implement tax law changes for the 1999 and 2000 filing seasons ; if these efforts are not completed , irs ' tax processing and collection systems may fail to operate or may generate millions of erroneous tax notices , refunds , interest calculations , and account adjustments ; for the conversion of its existing systems , irs has made more progress on its applications than on its information systems infrastructure ; specifically , as of april 24 , 1998 , irs reported that it had completed the first 12 steps of its 14-step conversion process for applications for about 46 percent of the 127 systems it has deemed as mission - critical ; irs expects to convert the applications for the remaining 54 percent of the mission - critical systems by january 1999 ; the two major systems replacement efforts , which are also expected to follow irs ' 14-step conversion process , are experiencing some schedule slippages ; irs officials said they expect to complete the year 2000 portions of the mainframe consolidation by the original completion date of december 1998 ; gao identified two risk areas for irs ' year 2000 effort : the lack of an integrated master conversion and replacement schedule ; and a limited approach to contingency planning ; since gao 's briefing , irs has decided to have a contractor develop an integrated schedule of its year 2000-related efforts , including making all of the necessary tax law changes for 1999 ; irs officials said they hope to have a baseline , master integrated schedule in june 1998 ; and in part , due to irs officials ' concerns that the same resources that are doing year 2000 conversion work would be needed to do contingency planning , irs officials decided to develop a process that would minimize the number of contingency plans that would have to be developed .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao responded to a series of questions about federal pension costs and retirement policy , focusing on : the number of federal retirees , if any , whose pensions have come to exceed the final salaries that they earned while working ; why these retirees ' pensions came to exceed their final salaries ; the difference , if any , in these retirees ' pension amounts if current cost - of - living - adjustment ( cola ) policy that is , the cola policy enacted in 1984 , which established the formula and schedule used today by the office of personnel management ( opm ) , had been in effect without interruption since 1962 ; and any difference in the number of retirees whose pensions would have exceeded their final salaries . gao noted that : an estimated 459,000 ( or about 27 percent ) of the 1.7 million retirees who were on the federal pension rolls as of october 1 , 1995 , were receiving pensions that had come to exceed their final salaries when these salaries were not adjusted for inflation ; however , when their salaries were adjusted for inflation -- i.e . , expressed in constant dollars , no retiree was receiving a pension that was larger than his or her final salary ; as a general rule , using constant dollars provides a more meaningful way to compare monetary values across time , because the use of constant dollars corrects for the effects of inflation or deflation ; although no retiree 's pension exceeded his or her final salary in constant dollar terms , gao 's analysis confirmed that three factors played an important role in explaining why the retirees ' pensions came to exceed their unadjusted final salaries : the number and size of colas that retirees received , the number of years that they had been retired , and the number of years of their federal service ; gao 's analysis of the effects that cola policies have had on retiree pensions suggests that the policies have played an important role in maintaining the purchasing power of retiree pensions since automatic colas began ; it also suggests that the effects cola policies actually have had on retiree pension amounts can not be summarized easily because of numerous changes that have been made in cola policies over the past 35 years ; cola policy changes have affected individual retirees differently , depending on when their retirements began ; if current cola policy , that is , the policy that was enacted in 1984 , had been in effect without interruption since automatic colas began in 1962 the pensions of some of the sample retirees would have been smaller than the pension that they actually received , and the pensions of other retirees would have been larger ; gao 's comparison of the effects of current and historical cola policy on pension amounts suggests that other factors being equal , a majority of those who retired before 1970 would have received smaller pensions had current cola policy been continuously in effect during their retirement , and about 90 percent of those who retired after 1970 would have received larger pensions ; and the changes that would have occurred in the sample retirees ' pension amounts under current policy were enough to cause about a 3 percentage point ( 3.0 ) increase in the number of retirees whose pensions would have come to exceed their unadjusted final salaries .
gao reviewed the federal bureau of investigation 's ( fbi ) national crime information center ( ncic ) wanted person file , focusing on the : length of time it takes federal law enforcement agencies to enter fugitives onto the file ; information that agencies have on data entry times and the means used to monitor entry times ; and agencies ' plans to reduce entry delays . gao found that : fbi and the u.s. marshals service ( usms ) require that fugitives be entered onto the wanted persons file within one day after an arrest warrant is issued ; the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms ( atf ) allows up to ten days for data entry if the delay serves a valid law enforcement purpose ; the customs service requires data entry after reasonable efforts to locate a fugitive have failed ; the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) has no policy regarding the timeliness of data entry ; 28 percent of fbi , usms , atf , and customs ' entries are made one day after issuance of the arrest warrant , 54 percent within one week , and 70 percent within four weeks ; data entry times for dangerous fugitives do not differ substantially from overall data entry times ; atf and customs do not monitor their data entry times or know the reasons for delays in entering fugitives on the wanted persons file ; fbi found that there are delays in between 30 and 50 percent of its data entries , with a median delay of about one week ; and all the federal law enforcement agencies plan to take action to minimize data entry delays .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of commerce 's and the federal trade commission 's ( ftc ) controls over the acceptance and reporting of nonfederally reimbursed travel by their employees , focusing on : whether commerce and ftc met their review and reporting requirements ; and the implications of commerce denying the office of government ethics ( oge ) access to its records of reimbursed travel in 1992. gao found that : although commerce generally met applicable requirements for accepting and reporting travel reimbursements , certain procedural improvements could be implemented in the receipt and reporting of these funds ; commerce did not ensure that travel requests contained all of the required information , were prepared and reviewed before trips were approved , accurately disclosed the circumstances of each trip , or adequately documented the actual expenses reimbursed ; although ftc consistently met the requirements for controlling the acceptance and reporting of travel reimbursements by its employees , it could improve its reporting by better detailing the nature of events attended by ftc employees ; commerce 's decision to deny oge access to its travel records was based on its view that oge was not responsible for the applicable travel regulations ; and although commerce changed its position and acknowledged that oge did have the authority to review such records , the overall effect of commerce 's temporary denial of access was minimal .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on personnel management in the district of columbia ( d.c. ) courts , focusing on : staffing and workload levels for the courts from 1989 through 1998 ; how the courts evaluate the sufficiency of the levels of nonjudicial staff who work on processing and disposition of cases ; and a comparison of the d.c. courts ' staffing methodology to other available methodologies . gao noted that : overall staffing levels in the d.c. courts increased between 1989 and 1990 , declined slightly with some fluctuations through 1997 , and then decreased below the 1989 level in 1998 ; cases available for disposition increased slightly during this time in the d.c. superior court , the largest part of the courts , while its backlog increased substantially ; the cases available for disposition , and the backlog , of the far smaller d.c. court of appeals increased steadily over this period ; in both courts , the mix of different types of cases has changed over this period ; district of columbia court officials said that they consider caseload data , along with other data , in judging whether staffing levels are appropriate ; according to court officials , staffing decisions are made on a year - by - year basis and are made individually for each division of the superior court and court of appeals ; the courts ' methodology does not provide a comprehensive review of what staffing levels should be because it does not consider the amount of staff time and resources that are needed for case processing ; caseload trends alone do not show whether a unit is overstaffed or understaffed because they do not account for how much time is needed to process differing types of cases or for productivity improvements ; methodologies that consider the amount of staff time and resources required to process different types of cases in determining the sufficiency of staffing levels do exist ; and the national center for state courts has devised a database system to determine staffing levels needed for a given workload , and the administrative office of the u.s. courts uses a database system to distribute resources among the federal courts .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the government printing office 's ( gpo ) procedures for managing its inventory of excess publications , particularly its management of a major inventory reduction that took place in september 1996 , focusing on : whether gpo followed existing policies and procedures ; and how 3,258 copies of the senate 1789-1989 , a four - volume set written by senator byrd , were destroyed as part of that reduction . gao noted that : when for the first time in 15 years a potential financial loss was identified in gpo 's sales program in june 1996 , the superintendent of documents , who heads the sales program , initiated several actions intended to improve the program 's long - term financial condition ; the superintendent of documents said he wanted to dispose of the excess inventory by september 30 , 1996 , to take the losses in fiscal year ( fy ) 1996 rather than in later years , when it otherwise would have been identified , disposed of , and charged to expense ; the superintendent of documents also said he had erroneously believed that it was necessary to physically remove excess publications from inventory storage by september 30 , 1996 , in order to record them as an expense in the financial records for fy 1996 ; although the superintendent of documents had policies and procedures in place to prevent the disposal of publications that the issuing agency still wanted , in june 1996 he instructed his staff to disregard those policies that would interfere with his goal of disposing of as much excess publications inventory as possible by september 30 , 1996 ; acting under the superintendent 's overall instructions , gpo sales program staff disregarded a policy that has existed since at least 1984 , which provides that , before disposing of any excess copies of publications , gpo should offer them to the issuing agencies ; in explaining its inventory reduction to senator byrd , gpo said that it had found that it was generally more cost - effective to dispose of excess inventory and reprint if necessary , than to hold it in storage indefinitely ; however , gpo officials said that they knew that the reprint costs would substantially exceed the holding costs for these copies , given their relatively high printing and binding costs ; in july 1997 , after senator byrd inquired about the major inventory reduction , the superintendent of documents orally instructed his staff to retain the remaining volumes of the senate history and , at gao 's recommendation , put this instruction in writing in august 1997 ; and the superintendent further said that gpo was developing a new integrated processing system that would help designate publications that should not be excessed and , at gao 's recommendation , agreed to develop a systematic process for identifying publications to be held indefinitely for valid reasons .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined whether the movement of funds from bank deposits into mutual funds affects the availability of credit for residential , consumer , or commercial purposes . gao found that : the amount of money in mutual funds grew from $ 994 billion at year - end 1989 to $ 2,172 billion at year - end 1994 , mainly due to an increase of net customer inflows ; during the same period , bank deposits declined from $ 3.55 billion to $ 3.46 billion ; as much as $ 700 billion of the growth in mutual funds may have come at the expense of bank deposits between 1990 and 1994 ; the movement of money into mutual funds has resulted partly from the relatively lower interest rates paid on bank deposits , but this should have little effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds , since mutual funds also lend or invest a major portion of the funds they receive ; there was insufficient data on whether the different categories of borrowers were affected by the shift of money from bank deposits to mutual funds ; all categories of borrowers have recently increased their access to financing obtained through the securities markets ; and flows of deposits out of smaller banks could reduce the availability of finance for small businesses whose primary source of finance is loans from such banks .
improper payments — payments that should not have been made or that were made in incorrect amounts — continue to be an area of fiscal concern in the federal government . improper payments have been estimated to total almost $ 1.7 trillion government - wide from fiscal years 2003 through 2019. from fiscal year 2003 through 2016 , a government - wide estimate and rate had been included in government - wide financial reports based on the programs and activities that reported estimates . however , financial reports for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 did not include a government - wide improper payment estimate or rate . agency - reported improper payment estimates are posted on the office of management and budget 's paymentaccuracy.gov website . ipera requires igs to annually determine and report on whether executive branch agencies complied with six ipera criteria , such as conducting risk assessments and publishing and meeting improper payment reduction targets . this report summarizes federal agencies ' reported improper payment estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 , and reasons for substantial changes between years , and cfo act agencies compliance with ipera criteria for fiscal year 2018 , as determined by their igs , and overall compliance trends for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. gao summarized improper payment estimates from agency financial reports and paymentaccuracy.gov and information on cfo act agencies ' ipera compliance reported in igs ' fiscal year 2018 ipera compliance reports and prior gao reports . agency - reported improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2019 totaled about $ 175 billion , based on improper payment estimates reported by federal programs , an increase from the fiscal year 2018 total of $ 151 billion . of the $ 175 billion , about $ 121 billion ( approximately 69 percent ) was concentrated in three program areas : medicaid , medicare , and earned income tax credit . about $ 74.6 billion ( approximately 42.7 percent ) of the government - wide estimate was reported as monetary loss , an amount that should not have been paid and in theory should or could be recovered . however , the federal government 's ability to understand the full scope of its improper payments is hindered by incomplete , unreliable , or understated agency estimates ; risk assessments that may not accurately assess the risk of improper payment ; and agencies not complying with reporting and other requirements in the improper payments elimination and recovery act of 2010 ( ipera ) . eight years after the implementation of ipera , half of the 24 chief financial officers act of 1990 ( cfo act ) agencies — whose estimates account for over 99 percent of the federal government 's reported estimated improper payments — complied with ipera overall for fiscal year 2018 , as reported by their inspectors general ( ig ) . based on the igs ' fiscal year 2018 compliance reports , agencies were most frequently reported as noncompliant with the requirement to publish and meet annual targets for improper payment reduction . out of the 14 agencies for which this requirement was applicable , eight agencies were noncompliant . the second most - frequently reported area of noncompliance related to the requirement for agencies ' reported improper payment rates to be below 10 percent for programs that published estimates . out of the 15 agencies for which this requirement was applicable , five agencies were noncompliant . chief financial officers act of 1990 agencies ' fiscal year 2018 compliance with ipera criteria , as reported by their igs the igs reported that 21 programs were noncompliant with ipera for each of the past 3 fiscal years ( 2016 – 2018 ) . these programs represented about $ 78 billion , or approximately 52 percent of the $ 151 billion government - wide reported improper payment estimates for fiscal year 2018 .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed research studies regarding the cycle of sexual abuse , focusing on the likelihood that individuals who are victims of sexual abuse as children will become sexual abusers of children in adulthood . gao found that : there was no consensus among the 23 retrospective and 2 prospective studies reviewed that childhood sexual abuse led directly to the victim becoming an adult sexual abuser ; the retrospective studies , which sought to determine whether a sample of known sex offenders had been sexually abused as children , differed considerably in the types of offenders studied , use of control or comparison groups , and definition and reporting of childhood sexual abuse ; although some of the retrospective studies concluded that childhood sexual abuse may increase the risk that victims will commit sexual abuse later , most of the studies noted that the majority of sex offenders had not been sexually abused as children ; the prospective studies , which tracked sexually abused children into adulthood to determine how many became sex offenders , studied sample populations that may not be representative of the entire population of childhood sexual abuse victims ; and the prospective studies found that victims of childhood sexual abuse were not more likely than nonvictims to be arrested for sex offenses .
federal obligations under sba 's 8 business development program totaled about $ 10.9 billion in fiscal year 2019 , according to federal procurement data reported as of october 7 , 2019. sba 's 8 program is one of the federal government 's primary vehicles for developing socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses , including firms owned by ancs . one of the key benefits of this program is the ability for anc - owned firms to receive federal contract awards that have been set aside solely for 8 firms . from 2006 through 2016 , gao issued three reports detailing the limitations of sba 's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 program . gao 's testimony discusses the highlights of the aforementioned three reports and the extent to which sba has addressed the recommendations gao made in those reports , as of october 2019. gao examined sba files and other documents , conducted site visits , and interviewed program officials to perform the work of those reports . in three reports issued between 2006 and 2016 , gao has found persistent weaknesses in the small business administration 's ( sba ) oversight and monitoring of tribal 8 firms , in particular the alaska native corporations ' ( anc ) subsidiary firms ( anc - owned firms ) that participate in sba 's 8 program . over the course of the program , qualified small , disadvantaged businesses , including anc - owned firms , can receive federal contract awards that have been set aside solely for such businesses , and business development support from sba , such as mentoring , financial assistance , and other management and technical assistance . in its three reports , among other things , gao found that sba had incomplete information and documentation on anc - owned firms and their compliance with regulatory requirements ; limitations in its ability to track and share key program data needed to enforce its own program ; insufficient staffing in its alaska district office to carry out necessary and critical monitoring tasks ; and inadequate or vague program guidance for clearly communicating to staff how to interpret new regulations . gao made 21 recommendations to sba that address weaknesses in sba 's oversight and monitoring of anc - owned firms participating in the 8 program . sba has taken steps to implement many of those recommendations , including enhancing training for sba staff that emphasized program rules , and developing and implementing a regulation that helps sba better enforce rules against anc - owned firms obtaining contracts for which they were not necessarily eligible . however , sba has not yet implemented recommendations that , if implemented as intended , could significantly improve its oversight of the 8 program . for example , sba has not yet addressed limitations raised in gao 's 2006 and 2016 reports regarding sba 's tracking of revenue information for anc - owned firms , which limits sba 's oversight of 8 rules prohibiting multiple subsidiaries under one anc from generating revenue in the same primary line of business — which 8 program regulations intend to limit . sba officials informed gao of the agency 's plans to develop an information system capable of addressing this issue . however , at the time of gao 's 2016 report , sba could not provide detailed information or plans about this system , and as of today , the agency could not provide documentation that this system is operational . as another example , sba has not addressed gao 's 2006 recommendation to consistently determine whether other small businesses are losing contracting opportunities when sba awards contracts through the 8 program to anc - owned firms , as required in regulation — an area where gao found that sba had fallen short in its oversight . instead , in 2009 , sba reported that it performed a single analysis of a limited set of procurement data from a limited period and concluded the data did not indicate that other small 8 firms ( e.g . , black - owned , hispanic - owned , and others ) were losing contracting opportunities to anc - owned firms . however , sba 's actions did not address the intent of gao 's recommendation to “ consistently ” perform this oversight . absent action on these recommendations , the program continues to be at risk of noncompliance . gao made multiple recommendations in its reports from 2006 through 2016 , many of which sba has taken steps to implement . however , sba has not addressed key gao recommendations , including tracking and sharing anc - related information across sba regional offices , considering the establishment of criteria thresholds for contract modifications , and developing policies to consistently assess whether other small businesses are losing 8 contracts to anc - owned firms . gao continues to believe that implementing these recommendations would enhance sba 's oversight and monitoring of firms in the 8 program .
gao has reported on the inherent fragmented nature of the federal and nonfederal resources needed to protect the nation from potentially catastrophic biological threats . gao called for a strategic approach to help the federal government better leverage resources and manage risk the white house issued the national biodefense strategy and the presidential memorandum on the support for national biodefense to promote a more efficient and coordinated biodefense enterprise . the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 included a provision that gao review the strategy . this testimony highlights key findings from our february 2020 report , which analyzed the extent to which the strategy and related implementation efforts are designed to allow an enterprise - wide approach . issued in september 2018 , the national biodefense strategy ( strategy ) and implementation plan , along with national security presidential memorandum - 14 ( nspm - 14 ) , are designed to enhance national biodefense capabilities . nspm - 14 established a governance structure composed of relevant federal agencies and chaired by the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) to guide implementation . it also required federal agencies with biodefense responsibilities to collect and assess data on their biodefense activities to , among other things , identify gaps . there are a number of challenges , however , that could limit long - term implementation success . among other things , there was no documented methodology or guidance for how data are to be analyzed to help the enterprise identify gaps and opportunities to leverage resources , including no guidance on how nonfederal capabilities are to be accounted for in the analysis . agency officials were also unsure how decisions would be made , especially if addressing gaps or opportunities to leverage resources involved redirecting resources across agency boundaries . although hhs officials pointed to existing processes and directives for interagency decision making , gao found there are no clear , detailed processes , roles , and responsibilities for joint decision - making , including how agencies will identify opportunities to leverage resources or who will make and enforce those decisions . as a result , questions remain about how this first - year effort to catalogue all existing activities will result in a decision - making approach that involves jointly defining and managing risk at the enterprise level . without clearly documented methods , guidance , processes , and roles and responsibilities for enterprise - wide decision - making , the effort runs the risk of failing to move away from traditional mission stovepipes toward a strategic enterprise - wide approach that meaningfully enhances national capabilities . in the february 2020 report , gao made four recommendations to the secretary of hhs , including working with other agencies to document methods for analysis and the processes , roles , and responsibilities for enterprise - wide decision making . hhs concurred with all the recommendations and described steps to implement them .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the consumer product safety commission 's ( cpsc ) project selection , use of cost - benefit analysis and risk assessment , and information release procedures , focusing on : the criteria cpsc uses to select projects and the information it relies upon in making these choices ; the information cpsc draws on to perform risk assessment and cost - benefit analyses and cpsc 's methodology for conducting cost - benefit analyses ; and cpsc 's procedures for releasing manufacturer - specific information to the public and whether evidence exists that cpsc violated its statutory requirements concerning the release of such information . gao noted that : although cpsc has established criteria to help select new projects , with the agency 's current data these criteria can be measured only imprecisely , if at all ; although cpsc has described itself as `` data driven , '' its information on product - related injuries and deaths is often sketchy ; this makes it more difficult not only for agency management to monitor current projects but also for staff and commissioners to assess and prioritize the need for new projects in different hazard areas ; cpsc has insufficient data on both internal agency efforts and external product hazards to assess the impact and cost of each project ; to help evaluate alternative methods of addressing potential hazards , cpsc may perform a risk assessment to estimate the likelihood of injury associated with a hazard or conduct a cost - benefit analysis to assess the potential effects of a proposed regulation ; although cpsc does not complete either a risk assessment or cost - benefit analysis for every project , the agency conducts these analyses more often than it is required to by law ; nevertheless , cpsc 's data are often insufficient to support a thorough application of these analytical techniques ; to evaluate relative risks , it is usually necessary to have information on how many consumers use the product -- information that cpsc frequently does not have ; risk assessment of consumer products requires measurement of the number of harmful incidents ; cpsc 's imprecise and incomplete death and injury data make risk assessment and cost - benefit analysis at best less reliable and at worst impossible to do ; the cost - benefit analyses conducted by cpsc between 1990 and 1996 were often not comprehensive ; cpsc has established procedures to implement statutory requirements concerning the release of manufacturer - specific information ; when releasing information to the public that identifies a specific manufacturer , cpsc is required to verify the information and allow the manufacturer an opportunity to comment ; evidence from the industry and from legal cases suggests that cpsc has met its statutory requirements in this area ; individuals within cpsc , as well as some industry representatives and consumer groups , expressed dissatisfaction with the requirements of this law ; and some of these individuals have proposed statutory changes that range from reducing to expanding the current requirements .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the honor and conduct adjudicatory systems at the department of defense ( dod ) service academies , focusing on : how the systems at each academy compare ; the due process protections of these systems ; and the students ' attitudes and perceptions toward these systems . gao found that : although the honor systems at the academies have many similarities , there are some prominent differences among them ; the honor codes at the military and air force academies include non - toleration clauses that make it an honor offense to know about an honor offense and not report it , while at the naval academy failure to act on a suspected honor violation is a conduct offense ; differences also exist in the standard of proof that is used in honor hearings , `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' used at the air force academy versus `` a preponderance of the evidence '' used at the other academies ; academy honor hearings provide students with the majority of the protections typically associated with procedural due process , with some exceptions and limitations ; the most prominent limitations exist on the right to representation by counsel and the right to remain silent and avoid self - incrimination ; all three academies impose a limitation on the right to counsel by prohibiting military or civilian lawyers from representing cadets and midshipmen in the hearing itself ; the right to remain silent is not granted until the individual is actually charged with an offense ; responses to a gao questionnaire indicated that academy students generally saw their honor systems as fair ; in some cases , whether an act constitutes an honor violation is not completely clear because the intent of the accused must be inferred from the investigative and hearing processes ; there was considerable reluctance among students to report their fellow students for honor violations ; in general , the administrative conduct systems at the military and naval academies provide several due process protections , with some exceptions and limitations on others ; the cadet disciplinary board proceedings at the air force academy , on the other hand , provided fewer due process protections than proceedings at the other two academies ; as of january 1 , 1995 , the air force academy eliminated the cadet disciplinary board and implemented a two - step process aimed at improving timeliness and fairness in dealing with major conduct offenses ; while the conduct systems are characterized by academy officials as administrative , rather than judicial , they offer less due process protection than is mandated across dod for other nonjudicial disciplinary proceedings ; a large majority of the students questioned the reasonableness of many of the minor rules and regulations in the conduct codes ; and many students perceive academy handling of conduct offenses , the application of rules and regulations , and the imposition of disciplinary actions as inconsistent .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed events related to personnel reassignments , appointments , and activities at the small business administration ( sba ) . gao noted that : sba made hundreds of appointments during the 1990s using competitive procedures for career appointments , special noncompetitive hiring authority for the office of advocacy , and political appointment procedures for other appointments ; for the appointments that gao reviewed , gao found that sba adhered to the different procedural requirements ; for example , although 6 of the 42 district director appointees were hired from outside sba to the career positions , and 2 of them had political backgrounds , gao found nothing procedurally amiss in the hiring process ; gao determined , however , that in several cases sba did not follow applicable federal regulations when setting the starting salary at a rate higher than the minimum rate for the grade ; sba could not provide the documentation required by federal regulations to support the advanced salary settings ; sba has developed draft procedures that , if properly implemented , should help prevent such situations from recurring ; gao also determined that sba poorly controlled its interagency detailing of employees , with the result that cost reimbursements were not always being collected ; and sba officials advised gao that they are developing new procedures to better control interagency details and collections of reimbursements .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed how well kinship care is serving foster children , focusing on the : quality of care that children in kinship care receive compared with that received by other foster children , as measured by a caseworker 's assessment of a caregiver 's parenting skills , the extent to which a foster child is able to maintain contact with familiar people and surroundings , and a caregiver 's willingness to enforce court - ordered restrictions on parental visits ; frequency with which state child welfare agencies pursue various permanent living arrangements and the time children in kinship care have spent in the system compared with other foster children ; and recent state initiatives intended to help ensure that children in kinship care receive good quality foster care and are placed in permanent homes in a timely manner . gao noted that : gao 's survey of open foster care cases in california and illinois showed that in most respects the quality of both kinship and other foster care was good and that the experiences of children in kinship care and children in other foster care settings were comparable ; gao found that caregivers both in kinship care and in other foster care settings demonstrated good parenting skills overall ; gao also confirmed the belief that there is more continuity in the lives of children in kinship care before and after they enter foster care than there is in other foster children 's lives ; in cases in which the courts have restricted parental visits with foster children to ensure the children 's safety , the proportion of cases in which the caseworker believed that the caregiver was likely to enforce the restrictions was somewhat smaller among kinship care cases than among other foster care cases ; some of the standards that california and illinois use to ensure good quality foster care and the level of support each state provides to foster caregivers are lower for kinship care than other types of foster care ; previous research on children who have left foster care has shown that children who had been in kinship care were less likely to be adopted and stayed longer in foster care than other foster children ; between california and illinois , gao 's survey showed no consistent findings regarding the relationship between kinship care and permanency goals or the time foster children had spent in the system ; in illinois , kinship care cases were more likely to have a permanency goal of adoption or guardianship than other foster care cases ; illinois has found that kinship caregivers are willing to adopt , and illinois is actively pursuing adoption in kinship care cases ; in california , kinship care cases were less likely than other foster care cases to have adoption or guardianship as a goal ; according to california officials , this may be because , at the time of gao 's survey , the state had only recently begun to offer adoption and guardianship options specifically designed for a foster child 's relatives ; in california , there was no significant difference between the average length of time that children in kinship care and children in other settings had spent in the system ; in illinois , children in kinship care had spent significantly less time in the system than other foster children ; and both california and illinois are now taking steps to better ensure the good quality of kinship care and to encourage kinship caregivers to provide permanent homes for foster children who can not return to their parents .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the impact of peace operations on the u.s. military forces ' capability to respond to regional conflicts , focusing on the : force structure limitations that affect the military 's ability to respond to other national security requirements while engaged in peace operations ; and options available for increasing force flexibility and response capability . gao found that : peace operations have heavily stressed some u.s. military capabilities , including army support forces and specialized air force aircraft ; because there are relatively few support forces in the military 's active force , some of these units and personnel have been deployed to consecutive operations , the tempo of operations has increased , and the time available to prepare for combat missions has been reduced ; extended participation in multiple or large scale peace operations could impede the services ' ability to timely respond to major regional conflicts ( mrc ) ; disengaging support units and specialized aircraft from a peace operation and redeploying them to mrc could be more difficult than estimated because some of these units need training and supplies before deploying to another major operation ; the options available to dod to meet the demands of peace operations while maintaining the capability to respond to mrc include changing the mix of active and reserve forces and making greater use of reserves and contractors ; and the united states needs to determine the resources it needs and degree of risk it is prepared to take if it wishes to continue participating in sizeable peace operations for extended periods and still maintain the capability needed to rapidly respond to simultaneous mrc .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed large bank holding company mergers and the impact of such mergers on low - and moderate - income ( lmi ) areas , focusing on : the federal reserve board 's ( frb ) legal responsibilities in assessing bank holding company act of 1956 ( bhc ) mergers for community reinvestment act of 1977 ( cra ) performance ; frb 's process for assessing the cra performance of six large bhc merger applicants , including how frb addressed the principal public concerns related to the cra performance ; and the premerger and postmerger mortgage lending in lmi and minority communities for three large bhc mergers . gao noted that : in acting on a bhc merger application , frb must consider the convenience and needs of the community to be served under the bhc act and take into account the record of the relevant depository institutions under cra ; neither the bhc act nor cra , or their legislative histories , provide guidance on how frb is to take these factors into account when considering a bhc merger application ; the depository institutions ' primary federal regulators have developed guidance for their assessments of a depository institution 's cra performance ; however , frb has not developed guidance on how it evaluates the cra records of the merging bhcs ; for the six bhc merger applications that gao reviewed , frb attempted to balance the regulators ' ratings of the depository institutions ' cra performance and information presented through public comments that raised concerns with the institutions ' cra records ; all of the bank subsidiaries included in the six mergers had satisfactory or outstanding performance ratings in their most recent cra examinations ; the principal cra concerns raised by commenters included insufficient home mortgage lending , insufficient small business lending , and branch closures in lmi areas ; frb analyzed home mortgage disclosure act of 1975 ( hmda ) and small business data to address concerns of insufficient home mortgage and small business lending , respectively ; frb 's consideration of branch closures was generally limited to a determination of whether the applicant had an adequate branch closure policy and its past branch closure record ; frb approved all six mergers , but four of the mergers were approved with conditions for the reporting of subsequent branch closures ; frb 's lack of written guidance on how it addresses public comments raising cra concerns contributed to the concerns voiced by community groups and the bhc applicants regarding the lack of transparency in the merger application process ; on the basis of gao 's analysis of home mortgage lending , bhc merger activity had not been associated with adverse changes in single - family home mortgage lending in minority and lmi areas in the major metropolitan areas served by the acquired bhcs for the three bhc mergers gao analyzed ; and nbd corporation 's acquisition of first chicago and chemical banking corporation 's acquisition of chase manhattan bank have been associated with stable to increased lending in the relevant areas .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the readiness of the insurance industry to meet the year 2000 date change , focusing on : what state regulators were doing to oversee the year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry ; how the regulatory oversight of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness compared with the oversight of the banking and securities industries ; the status of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; and the nature and extent of year 2000 liability exposures that insurers face and the mitigation efforts taken to address such exposures . gao noted that : the 17 state insurance regulators gao visited differed in their approach and level of oversight activity directed to the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; these state regulators also differed in how they assessed and ranked insurance companies in terms of year 2000 readiness ; such variations raise a question about the extent to which states can rely on one another 's judgments regarding the preparedness of nondomiciled insurance companies doing business in their states ; this question is especially applicable to those states where the level of year 2000 oversight is relatively limited or the criteria for assessing readiness may be considered lax ; variations in oversight approaches among state regulators also made it difficult to ascertain the overall status of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness ; regulatory oversight of the insurance industry 's year 2000 readiness began later than the oversight of the banking and securities industries ; the state insurance regulators gao visited were less active in their efforts to promote year 2000 readiness and efforts to validate information on the status of companies ' readiness ; they were also less active in planning for and pursuing formal enforcement actions against companies identified as inadequately preparing for 2000 and at a high risk of not being ready for the millenium change ; regulatory information on the year 2000 readiness of the nation 's insurance industry , consisting primarily of self - reported information obtained through surveys , does not provide the necessary information to judge whether the industry will be ready for 2000 ; insurance regulators and other observers gao contacted generally have a favorable view of the industry 's year 2000 readiness ; these regulators and industry observers expressed confidence that companies were actively preparing for the year 2000 date change because of competitive pressures and the business need to process date - sensitive information before 2000 ; the magnitude of insurers ' year 2000-related liability exposures can not be estimated at this time , and the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate these exposures remains uncertain ; costs associated with year 2000-related exposures could be substantial for some property - casualty insurers , due to potential claims and legal defense costs ; and despite efforts to mitigate potential exposures , the year 2000-related costs that may be incurred by insurers will remain uncertain until key legal issues and actions on pending legislative initiatives are resolved .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the internal revenue service 's ( irs ) program to audit income tax returns through correspondence , focusing on : the number , results , and duration of correspondence audits as well as the characteristics of the audited returns ; and processes and requirements that irs has had for years to govern correspondence audits . gao noted that : several weaknesses were found in irs ' correspondence audit processes ; these weaknesses , individually or in combination , can erode the integrity of the correspondence audit processes , which are designed to help ensure that taxpayers pay the correct tax amounts and are treated properly ; during fiscal years 1992-1997 , the annual number and results of correspondence audits conducted by irs varied considerably ; the number ranged annually from just over 200,000 to about 1.1 million audits ; the rate at which irs auditors closed audits without recommending additional taxes ranged from 13 percent to 46 percent ; when they did recommend additional taxes , the average amounts ranged from $ 1,300 to $ 2,800 ; the rate at which taxpayers did not respond to these recommended additional taxes after being requested to do so by irs ranged from 29 percent to 63 percent ; these variations resulted , in part , from an increase in the number of correspondence audits of returns claiming an earned income credit ( eic ) ; for the traditional correspondence audits closed in fiscal year 1996 , the time between the filing of a return and the start of the correspondence audit averaged 10 months ; it then took 11 more months before irs assessed any taxes that were recommended during the audits ; as for the characteristics of these 1996 returns , an estimated 75 percent had reported adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 15,000 ; in part , this percentage reflects the correspondence audit 's focus on simple tax issues and eic ; irs had weaknesses in implementing the correspondence audit requirements for four processes ; not all of the traditional correspondence audits closed in 1996 were manually reviewed ( or classified ) to identify all issues for audit , as required by irs ; support for recommended audit findings was not adequately documented in the audit workpaper files , as required , for about one - third of the audits ; the taxpayer documentation that was required to justify eic claims varied from service center to service center ; gao found weaknesses in the reviews that irs did on a sample of closed audits to measure their quality ; and in addition to the weaknesses in implementing the requirements , irs allowed service centers to exclude certain types of audits that did not have all required documentation from being measured against the audit standard on workpaper documentation .
gao reviewed the department of veterans affairs ' ( va ) efforts to improve and monitor veterans ' access to health care . gao noted that : va has taken important steps to improve the efficiency of its health care system and veterans ' access to it ; va medical centers have increased efficiency by expanding the use of outpatient care ; for example , va has increased the percentage of surgical procedures performed on an outpatient basis from 34 percent in fiscal year 1993 to 66 percent by mid - fiscal year 1997 ; this has allowed it to reduce bed - days of care , operating beds , and staff ; at the pittsburgh , pennsylvania , medical center , the increase in outpatient surgeries saved more than $ 7.5 million from october 1995 through may 31 , 1997 ; preventive care , including health assessments and patient education , has also increased , which va officials told gao can lead to efficiencies because patients can be kept healthier , avoiding expensive hospital stays ; furthermore , va is increasing efficiency by integrating services both within and among medical centers ; va is improving access to health care in several ways ; for example , va has begun to emphasize primary care , in which generalist physicians see patients initially and coordinate any specialty care that patients may need ; by increasing the number of primary care teams , va has improved access to routine care and expedited referrals to specialty care ; va is also improving access to health care by providing outpatient care at additional community - based outpatient clinics , expanding evening and weekend hours for clinics , and exploring other innovations ; these efforts have shortened the time veterans spend waiting for an appointment as well as that spent waiting to be seen upon arrival for an appointment ; all of the medical centers gao visited have established primary care teams and increased the number of veterans assigned to primary care ; as networks and medical centers continue to respond to incentives to improve the efficiency of their operations , headquarters ' monitoring of the impact of such responses is necessary to help ensure that they do not compromise the appropriateness of health care veterans receive ; and gao found that although va has implemented health care monitoring mechanisms to assess some of the changes networks and medical centers are introducing , these mechanisms have not fully succeeded .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the contents of the final report of the special action committee on okinawa ( saco ) , focusing on : the impact on readiness of u.s. forces based on okinawa after implementation of the report recommendations ; the u.s. cost of implementing the recommendations ; and the benefit or necessity of having u.s. marine corps forces on okinawa . gao noted that : the department of defense ( dod ) believes that marine corps forces along with other u.s. forces on okinawa satisfy the u.s. national security strategy by visibly demonstrating the u.s. commitment to security in the region ; these forces are thought to deter aggression , provide a crisis response capability should deterrence fail , and avoid the risk that u.s. allies may interpret the withdrawal of forces as a lessening of u.s. commitment to peace and stability in the region ; okinawa 's proximity to potential regional trouble spots promotes the early arrival of u.s. military forces due to shorter transit times and reduces potential problems that could arise due to late arrival ; the cost of this presence is shared by the government of japan , which provides bases and other infrastructure on okinawa rent - free and pays part of the annual cost of okinawa - based marine corps forces ; the saco final report calls on the united states to : return land that includes one base and portions of camps , sites , and training areas on okinawa to japan ; implement changes to three operational procedures ; and implement changes to five noise abatement procedures ; the united states has established requirements that japan must meet as it designs , builds , and pays for the sea - based facility before the marine corps air station futenma is closed and operations are moved to the sea - based facility ; such a facility has never been built and operated ; annual operations and maintenance costs for the sea - based facility were initially estimated at $ 200 million ; the united states requested that the japanese government pay the cost to maintain the new sea - based facility , but as of the date of this report , it had not agreed to do so ; excluding the cost to operate the sea - based facility , the current estimated cost to the united states to implement the saco land return recommendations is about $ 193.5 million over about 10 years ; the united states and japan are negotiating an arrangement under which japan would assume some saco - related responsibilities consistent with their domestic laws ; this arrangement could result in reduced u.s. costs ; while final implementation of the saco recommendations is intended to reduce the burden of u.s. forces ' presence in okinawa , two environmental issues could arise ; the first issue concerns the potential for environmental contamination being found on military facilities returned to japan and responsibility for cleanup of those facilities ; and the second issue concerns the potential adverse effects that the construction and operation of the sea - based facility could have on the environment .
gao assessed the cost - effectiveness of organizing the air force 's airlift and refueling force into fewer , larger - sized squadrons and wings , focusing on : the effect that reorganization may have on mission accomplishment ; whether costs could be reduced through redistributing aircraft among fewer wings ; and five possible options for redistributing c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft among fewer wings at lower operating costs . gao noted that : the air force could reduce costs and meet peacetime and wartime commitments if it reorganized its c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft into larger - sized squadrons and wings at fewer locations ; these savings would primarily result from fewer people being needed to operate these aircraft ; for the reorganization options gao developed , up to $ 209 million dollars could be saved annually ; creating larger - sized squadrons and wings would still allow the air force to accomplish its peacetime and wartime missions with the existing number of aircraft ; in peacetime deployments , reserve component c - 130 and kc - 135 personnel do not participate as part of entire squadrons or wings but rather as individual volunteers ; thus , creating larger - sized squadrons and wings should not compromise these missions ; for wartime deployments , requirements for c - 130 and kc - 135 aircraft are typically stated by the number of aircraft rather than by squadrons or wings ; moreover , war plans where existing flying squadrons are assigned can be changed to accomodate larger - sized squadrons ; specific reserve component wings are not usually assigned in existing war plans ; thus , the impact of reducing them would be minimal ; redistributing the reserve component 's c - 130 and kc - 135 existing aircraft into fewer , larger - sized squadrons and wings would reduce operating costs ; for example , redistributing 16 c - 130 aircraft from two 8-aircraft wings to one 16-aircraft wing would save about $ 11 million annually , primarily from personnel savings ; gao developed five options to illustrate the kind of savings that can be achieved by creating larger - sized squadrons ; these savings range from about $ 51 million to $ 209 million annually ; and sufficient personnel could be recruited and most locations ' facilities could be inexpensively expanded to accomodate the unit sizes in gao 's options .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the department of defense 's ( dod ) training projects that support nondefense activities , focusing on the : extent , nature , and cost of civil military projects ; consistency of dod 's guidance on the innovative readiness training ( irt ) program with statutory requirements ; conformity of selected projects to statutory requirements , especially those dealing with military training ; and effectiveness of the office of the secretary of defense 's ( osd ) and service secretaries ' oversight of such projects . gao noted that : dod does not know the full extent and nature of the irt program because some project information is not consistently compiled and reported ; furthermore , although dod knows the amount of supplemental funds spent on the program , it does not know the full cost of the program because the services and components do not capture those costs , which are absorbed from their own appropriations ; available records indicate that at least 129 projects were conducted in fiscal year ( fy ) 1997 and that most of these were engineering , infrastructure , or medical projects ; the dod directive for civil military projects is consistent with the statutory requirements for such projects ; specifically , it reiterates the statutory requirements and provides further delineation of how the projects are to be selected and implemented ; the directive does not , however , provide any additional guidance for military organizations to use in meeting the statutory requirement that the provision of assistance not result in a significant increase in the cost of training ; the six projects gao reviewed generally met the statutory requirements ; for example , the benefitting organizations were eligible for the assistance and the provision of assistance did not interfere with units ' or individuals ' military functions ; however , while the statute requires that individuals providing assistance perform tasks directly related to their military specialties , gao found that in two cases some individuals ' tasks were not directly related to their specialties ; thus , it appeared that the goal of completing a project took priority over the goal of providing valid military training ; in addition , gao could not determine whether the assistance had resulted in a significant increase in the cost of training for any of the six projects because dod has established no basis for making such a determination ; osd has provided limited and inconsistent oversight of irt projects and the delivery of support and services under them ; for the most part , osd limited oversight to those projects that received supplemental program funding ; even for those projects , osd did not always follow its own processes for ensuring that statutory requirements for civil military projects were met and did not have procedures in place to ensure that military organizations were not providing assistance that significantly increased training costs ; and the service secretaries have not established any additional formal oversight procedures .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed department of education and national collegiate athletic association ( ncaa ) efforts to promote gender equity in intercollegiate athletics by implementing title ix of the education amendments of 1972 , focusing on : steps taken by states to promote gender equity in college athletic programs ; and what existing studies show about progress made since 1992 in promoting gender equity in intercollegiate athletics . gao found that : since 1992 , the department of education 's office of civil rights ( ocr ) has focused on prevention of title ix violations by clarifying its policies on title ix compliance and increasing technical assistance to help colleges meet title ix requirements while it continues to investigate the relatively few complaints filed each year ; ncaa created a task force to examine gender equity issues and now requires certification that athletic programs at all division i schools meet ncaa - established gender equity requirements ; state efforts to promote or ensure gender equity in intercollegiate athletics vary considerably ; of the 22 states that reported having laws or other requirements to specifically address gender equity in intercollegiate athletics , 13 reported having full - or part - time staff responsible for gender equity issues ; and results from 8 national gender equity studies show gains in the number of women 's sports that schools offer , number of female students participating in athletics , and percentage of scholarship funds available to female students , but many women 's athletics programs lag behind those for men in the percentage of female head coaches , salaries paid to coaches , and proportion of women athletes to total undergraduate enrollment .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the military health services system 's ( mhss ) psychopharmacology demonstration project ( pdp ) , focusing on the : need for prescribing psychologists in the mhss ; implementation of the pdp ; and pdp 's costs and benefits . gao noted that : the mhss has more psychiatrists than it needs to meet its current and upcoming readiness requirements , according to gao 's analysis of the department of defense 's ( dod ) health care needs ; therefore , the mhss needs no prescribing psychologists or any other additional mental health care providers authorized to prescribe psychotropic medication ; moreover , dod does not even account for prescribing psychologists when determining its medical readiness needs ; although dod met its goal to train psychologists to prescribe drugs , it faced many difficulties in implementing the pdp ; not all of these were resolved ; for example , the mhss never had a clear vision of the prescribing psychologist 's role , did not meet recruitment goals , and repeatedly changed the curriculum ; consequently , the american college of neuropsychopharmacology recommended in 1995 that unless these issues were addressed , the pdp should end ; the total cost of the pdp , from start - up through the date the last participants will complete the program , is about $ 6.1 million or about $ 610,000 per prescribing psychologist , according to gao 's estimate ; ultimately , the pdp will have added 10 mental health care providers who can prescribe drugs to an mhss that already has a surplus of psychiatrists ; opinions differ on the effect of adding these prescribing psychologists to the mhss concerning such issues as quality of care and collaboration between psychologists and physicians ; without a clear purpose or role for prescribing psychologists and given the uncertainty about the extent to which they would replace higher cost providers , gao can not conclude that the benefits gained from training prescribing psychologists warrant the costs of the pdp ; and training psychologists to prescribe medication is not adequately justified because the mhss has no demonstrated need for them , the cost is substantial , and the benefits are uncertain .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on whether : the social security administration 's ( ssa ) plan to process 8.1 million continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) during fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will result in cdrs being done for all beneficiaries for whom cdrs are required by law ; and disability determination services ' ( dds ) cdr processing capacity and the cdr funding authorized by congress for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will be sufficient to process the cdrs required by law . gao noted that : by the end of fiscal year ( fy ) 2002 , if ssa completes its new cdr plan as envisioned , all cdrs required by law will be complete or under way , including those that are overdue and those due to be started by the end of fy 2002 ; when ddss award disability benefits , they set due dates for starting cdrs , and every month these prescheduled cdr start dates come due for many beneficiaries ; because cdrs can require up to 1 year to complete from the time beneficiaries are selected for cdrs , many cdrs can not be completed by the end of the fiscal year in which they become due ; ssa estimates that about 835,000 of the required cdrs due to be started in fy 2002 will not be completed by yearend ; these cdrs will be completed in fy 2003 , according to ssa ; of the 8.1 million cdrs planned for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 , ssa plans to complete 53 percent through brief questionnaires mailed to selected beneficiaries and 47 percent through full medical reviews conducted by ddss ; according to ssa , in formulating its plan , ssa consulted with ddss to plan caseloads that will not exceed the ddss ' case processing capacity ; however , ddss could potentially encounter additional caseloads not envisioned in ssa 's plan ; for several beneficiary groups , ssa is still working to develop statistical formulas for selecting appropriate mailer recipients ; if ddss have to conduct more full medical reviews to replace cdr mailers , the authorized funds could prove inadequate because full medical reviews cost significantly more than mailers ; if ssa 's assumptions about economic growth and unemployment do not prove accurate or if the test results for ssa 's disability process redesign plan are not positive , the volume of initial disability applications and requests for reconsideration of denied applications could potentially be larger than assumed by ssa ; if so ddss could face even larger backlogs of these non - cdr cases in order to complete cdr full medical reviews in a timely manner ; recognizing the potential uncertainty of the cdr and non - cdr workloads , ssa plans to monitor them closely ; ssa acknowledged that its cdr plan may require revisions and that unexpected workload increases , if they occur , could lead ssa to decide to increase the case processing capacity of state ddss ; and potential barriers to the timely expansion of dds capacity exist as well , such as shortages of qualified applicants and office space , state hiring freezes , and the time required to train and mentor new staff .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the air force 's management of its reparable parts inventory , focusing on : commercial airline industry practices to streamline logistics operations and improve customer service ; air force reengineering efforts to improve its logistics system and reduce costs ; and barriers to the air force 's reengineering efforts . gao found that : the commercial airline industry , including certain manufacturers , suppliers , and airlines , are using leading - edge practices to improve logistics operations and reduce costs ; in recognition of increasing budgetary pressures , the changing global threat , and the need for radical improvements in its logistics system , the air force has begun a reengineering program aimed at redesigning its logistics operations ; gao has urged these changes and supports them , and has identified additional private - sector practices that may result in even greater savings ; there are several major barriers to bringing about change that must be addressed and resolved if the air force is to reengineer its logistics system and save billions of dollars ; the air force reengineering effort addresses inherent problems with its logistics system , but additional steps can be taken to maximize potential improvements ; additional steps gao identified that could enhance this program include establishing a top - level dod champion of change to support the air force initiatives , greater use of third - party logistics services , closer partnerships with suppliers , encouraging suppliers to use local distribution centers , centralizing repair functions , and modifying repair facilities to accommodate these new practices ; the success of the air force in achieving a quantum leap in system improvements hinges on its ability to address and overcome certain barriers , such as inherent organizational resistance to change ; top - level dod officials must be supportive of and engaged in air force reengineering efforts to remove these barriers and drive success ; information systems do not always provide air force managers and employees with accurate , real - time data on the cost , amount , location , condition , and usage of inventory ; and without the support of top - level dod management and accurate , real - time inventory information , the expansion of the air force 's reengineering efforts could be seriously impaired .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the major educational and legal issues involved with public single - gender education . gao found that : single - gender educational programs are thought to reduce dropout rates and improve overall academic performance among urban males and academic achievement in mathematics and science among females ; single - gender settings are believed to reduce the distraction boys and girls create for each other , particularly during the middle school years ; some studies of minority students in private single - gender schools have suggested that both boys and girls improve academically in such settings ; the effectiveness of single - gender programs may be due more to students ' and parents ' motivation and commitment and small student populations ; some experts fear that single - gender educational programs will lead to unequal resource allocations and reinforcement of stereotypes ; some believe that training teachers in diversity and equity , creating smaller classes , and providing more individual attention would be just as effective in coeducational settings ; some public schools have terminated or modified their single - gender programs because of federal and state limitations on single - gender educational programs ; and the department of education has received numerous complaints regarding single - gender educational settings .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on : the changes that have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing ; the changes that have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate / professional students who work and the number of hours they work ; how undergraduate borrowing and work patterns differ by type of school , year in school , dependency status , family income , and race / ethnicity ; and information concerning the amounts of education debt parents incur . gao based its review in large part on an analysis of data collected by the department of education as part of the national postsecondary student aid study . gao noted that : over the past several years , students have turned increasingly to borrowing to cope with rising education costs ; at the undergraduate level , the percentage of postsecondary students who had borrowed by the time they completed their programs ( received a bachelor 's degree , associate degree , or award or certificate ) increased from 41 percent in 1992-93 to 52 percent in 1995-96 ; the average amount of debt per student increased from about $ 7,800 to about $ 9,700 in constant 1995-96 dollars ; for graduating seniors ( recipients of bachelor 's degrees ) and who had borrowed , the average rose from about $ 10,100 to about $ 13,300 ; the portion of these graduates with $ 20,000 or more of student debt grew from 9 percent to 19 percent during the period ; students attending 4-year public institutions showed the largest increase in the number of borrowers ; sixty percent of seniors graduating from these schools in 1995-96 borrowed at some point in their program , up from 42 percent in 1992-93 and about even with the percentage of borrowers at private 4-year schools ; students at 2-year public institutions borrowed least often and in lesser amounts ; at the graduate and professional levels , the percentage of borrowers and the level of debt generally increased ; higher borrowing levels were especially pronounced at professional schools , where average debt among borrowers completing their programs climbed from about $ 45,000 in 1992-93 to nearly $ 60,000 in 1995-96 ; more full - time undergraduates worked while attending school in 1995-96 than in 1992-93 ; more than two - thirds of full - time undergraduate students held jobs during 1995-96 , working an average of 23 hours a week while enrolled ; at graduate and professional schools , the percentage of full - time students who worked changed little over the same period ; about two - thirds of master 's and doctoral students worked , usually in part - time jobs directly related to their field of study ; at professional schools , less than half worked while enrolled ; some variations in borrowing and work patterns can also be seen on the basis of the cost of attendance , dependency status , family income , and gender ; however , most characteristics are not very strong predictors of how much undergraduates were likely to borrow or work ; little information is available about amounts of debt parents accumulate in order to pay for their children 's postsecondary education ; and in general , household debt for education remains a small share of household debt .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed medicare payments to health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) , focusing on : current trends in medicare beneficiary enrollment in hmo ; flaws in medicare 's rate - setting method that prevent it from realizing potential savings from hmo ; and the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) efforts to test hmo payment reforms . gao found that : since 1993 , the annual increase in medicare beneficiary hmo enrollment has exceeded 20 percent ; hmo enrollment increases have been concentrated in 15 states ; medicare links hmo payment rates to the average cost of fee - for - service care and fails to adjust hmo payment rates to reflect beneficiaries ' health status or local differences in utilization rates ; strategies to improve medicare hmo payments include giving hcfa new authority to use competitive bidding or to negotiate with hmo , modifying the hmo rate - setting formula to include a health status risk adjuster , and requiring larger discounts from hmo in areas where hmo payment rates are too high ; hcfa could generate the most savings if it combines all three cost - reduction strategies and tailors the strategy to local conditions ; and although hcfa is planning demonstration projects using competitive bidding and improved risk adjustments , hcfa needs to gather and use available data to adjust hmo payments .
gao provided information on the department of defense 's ( dod ) projected revenues from property sales from closed military bases , focusing on the : revenues the government has received and expects to receive from military base property sales ; amount of additional resources the government has given to support communities ' reuse plans ; and factors which delay the transfer of property to communities . gao found that : revenues from military base property sales are expected to be far less than dod anticipated ; the majority of the disposed property will be retained by dod or transferred to other federal agencies , states , and localities at no cost ; where congress has not specifically authorized a property transfer without reimbursement , it has specified that agencies receiving transferred property should reimburse dod for 100 percent of the property 's estimated fair - market value or acquire a reimbursement waiver ; $ 69.4 million of the projected $ 92 million in revenues from military base property sales has been realized and an additional $ 22.2 million is expected from pending property sales ; about $ 19 million in property sales has been the result of interagency transfers ; dod could increase its revenues by selling an additional 9,400 acres of military property ; dod continues to reduce its property sales revenue estimates as it obtains better property value and property availability information ; in addition to transfers of large portions of land at no cost , many communities have asked the government for cash grants , marketable revenue - producing properties , and building and infrastructure upgrades ; as of may 1994 , 37 communities have received $ 107 million in cash grants ; additional funding requirements will increase as the base closure process continues ; and reasons for the delays in property transfers include disagreements over reuse plans between competing interests , changing laws and regulations , and unresolved environmental cleanup efforts at some bases .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the department of defense 's ( dod ) base closure accounts and its budget request for base closure activities , focusing on opportunities for offsetting the budget request for fiscal year ( fy ) 1999 , including the validity of two proposed military construction ( milcon ) projects included in that request . gao noted that : dod and the military services have reduced the previous high unobligated balances in the 1990 base closure account ; however , there are opportunities to offset the 1999 budget request ; gao 's analysis of the 1990 account and the fy 1999 base realignment and closure ( brac ) budget request raises questions about the need for $ 131.1 million included in the request ; and specifically : from the 1990 base closure account , $ 35.7 million in proceeds generated by brac activities that has not been reported to congress ; $ 12.5 million previously allocated but not needed for brac 1991 milcon projects ; $ 7.8 million allocated but not needed for brac 1991 operation and maintenance activities ; and $ 8.5 million previously allocated but not needed for brac 1991 environmental projects ; from the fy 1998 brac appropriations , $ 26 million previously withheld but ultimately was not needed for other higher priority programs ; and from 1999 brac budget request , $ 40.6 million requested for two separate milcon projects may no longer be needed because the requirements for one project have not been determined and the other has already been funded .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed intermodal freight transportation issues , focusing on : the department of transportation 's ( dot ) efforts to track how states use intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) funds to facilitate intermodal transportation ; the nature and extent of istea funds used by states for intermodal freight projects ; how some local and regional areas that handle large volumes of freight have considered intermodal freight transportation issues as part of their planning processes ; impediments some areas face in improving intermodal freight transportation ; and trends in intermodal freight transportation . gao found that : dot has not developed the statutorily required database on public and private intermodal transportation investments , or tracked how states use istea funds for such projects ; dot says that its limited role in allocating funds , states ' inconsistent identification of projects , and intermodal projects ' multiple financing sources make establishing the database difficult ; as of september 1995 , 10 states had obligated about $ 35.6 million in istea funds for 23 intermodal - freight - related projects ; as of december 1995 , 9 states had obligated $ 68.4 million , or 36 percent of the $ 191.8 million in istea funds authorized , for 20 priority intermodal freight projects ; the total amount of funds obligated for intermodal freight projects through the first four istea fiscal years equals less than 1 percent of istea funds apportioned to the states for highways and other nontransit infrastructure projects during the same period ; metropolitan planning organizations have to balance intermodal freight issues with a wide range of other transportation needs ; public transportation planners lack experience and planning tools for intermodal transportation , but states are slowly developing such expertise and tools ; local and regional planners are addressing problems specific to their areas ; and impediments to improving intermodal freight transportation include obtaining necessary proprietary information on freight movements and coordinating public and private - sector planning , but public - private partnerships may help overcome such impediments .
gao reviewed the department of state 's management of its overseas properties , focusing on : the problems state faces in managing its overseas real property ; and how state can strengthen its overseas real property management . gao found that : many of state 's improvements in overseas real property management have focused on facility maintenance ; state 's maintenance improvements include assigning skilled maintenance personnel overseas , conducting global maintenance surveys , a 5-year major rehabilitation plan , a comprehensive maintenance plan for new buildings , additional maintenance funding , establishing maintenance assistance centers , and implementing a facilities evaluation and assistance program ; although state has strengthened its real property management program , significant problems still exist including questionable or inappropriate use of routine maintenance funds , and overseas posts ' failure to conduct or complete annual assessments of government - owned and long - term leased facilities , deobligate unneeded funds , properly use the real estate management system to manage routine and preventive maintenance programs , and adequately plan for the sale or use of undeveloped properties in state 's inventory ; state implemented a financial audit program in 1990 that improved its oversight of overseas posts ' real property programs and resulted in the return of nearly $ 4 million in unused funds ; and state has implemented an information resources management system to strengthen its budgeting and planning process and has continued to upgrade its real estate management system , but its information systems still contain weaknesses .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed : the new european union ( eu ) procedures for approving new drug applications ( nda ) ; and why the european medicines evaluation agency ( emea ) was established , how it operates , and how it is financed . gao found that : because member states did not always accept eu or other members ' drug approvals , the eu commission of european communities makes decisions on drug approvals and dispute resolutions that are binding on all members ; eu has also established new approval procedures for biotechnology , other high - technology , and innovative products ; regulating drug prices and reimbursement policies remains the responsibility of member states ; the centralized approval procedure for biotechnology and some innovative products is expected to take between 298 and 448 days ; the decentralized procedure allows manufacturers to seek approval from member states and appeal denied approvals ; the decentralized procedure is expected to take between 300 and 686 days ; industry officials are concerned about drug evaluators ' qualifications and whether eu - wide interests will be upheld over national interests ; emea is responsible for the timeliness and coordination of new drug approvals , administrative duties , ensuring that drugs meet the highest standards of safety , efficacy , and quality , and maintaining information on the drugs and their adverse reactions ; the commission and industry application fees fund emea , which has a small permanent staff and 2 scientific evaluation committees that draw on eu - wide scientific expertise ; and emea also provides advice to companies on their trial procedures and other matters .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the : status of the national weather service ( nws ) systems modernization ; and most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's ( noaa ) marine data . gao noted that : although nws is nearing completion of its systems modernization effort , two significant challenges face it this year : deploying the final system of modernization ; and ensuring that all of its mission - critical systems are year 2000 compliant ; nws has made progress on both fronts ; in the noaa fleet area , noaa now outsources for more of its research and data needs but plans to spend $ 185 million over the next five years to acquire four new replacement noaa fisheries research ships ; and thus , gao believes that continued congressional oversight of this area , as well as noaa 's budget requests for replacement or upgraded ships , is needed to ensure that noaa is pursuing the most cost - effective alternatives for acquiring marine data .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the recent proposal that would require the social security administration ( ssa ) to place on the personal earnings and benefit estimate statements ( pebes ) an individualized estimate of the rates of return workers receive on their contributions to the social security program , focusing on the : general implications of using a rate of return for social security ; and challenges of including this information on the pebes . gao noted that : there is substantial disagreement about whether the rate of return concept should be applied to the social security program ; supporters of such an application point out that a rate of return would provide individuals information about the return they receive on their contributions to the program ; however , others contend that it is inappropriate to use rate of return estimates for social security because the program is designed to pursue social insurance goals , such as ensuring that low - wage earners have adequate income in their old age or that dependent survivors are adequately provided for ; in addition , calculations for rates of return rely on a number of assumptions that affect the resulting estimates ; for individuals , the actual rates of return can vary substantially from the estimates due to various uncertainties , such as a worker 's actual retirement age and future earnings ; to be clearly understood , the underlying assumptions and their effect on the estimates should be explained in any presentation of rate of return information ; furthermore , comparing rate of return estimates for social security with estimates for private investments could be difficult for various reasons ; for example , the comparisons would need to indicate whether the estimates for other investments include the transaction and administrative costs and the differences in risk associated with the social security trust funds and private investments ; providing rate of return information on the pebes could further complicate and lengthen an already complex and difficult - to - understand statement ; in gao 's previous work , it concluded that the current pebes is too long and its explanations of social security 's complex programs are not easy for the public to understand ; and adding rate of return estimates to the pebes would require detailed explanations about how the calculations were made and what assumptions were used about comparing a rate of return for social security with rates for private investments .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the issue of social security reform and women 's retirement income , focusing on : why women 's benefits are lower than men 's under the current social security system ; the possible differential effects on women of the new privatization reform proposals ; and what can be done to minimize the possibly negative effect on women of certain elements of the social security reform proposals . gao noted that : women 's average social security benefits are lower than men 's for a number of reasons , most of which relate to women 's lower rates of labor force participation and lower earnings levels ; although the labor market differences between men and women have narrowed over time , the bureau of labor statistics does not project that they will disappear entirely , even in the long term ; the reform proposals that would create individual private savings accounts and change the way benefits would be distributed from those accounts are the most likely to affect women and men differently ; a retirement income system that is based in large part on mandatory contributions of a fixed percentage of earnings and on individuals ' making their own investment decisions could lead to women 's receiving relatively lower benefits than man ; working women earn less than men , on average , and therefore would have fewer funds to invest in their individual accounts ; gao 's analysis of women in their prime earning and saving years suggests that they are less likely than men to invest in potentially higher yielding , though riskier , assets such as stocks , which would generally leave them at risk of having accumulated relatively less in their accounts at retirement ; even if men and women enter retirement with equal amounts in their individual accounts , women may receive a lower monthly benefit if they buy an individual annuity -- a monthly benefit for the life of the worker or the worker and a spouse -- because it is adjusted for their greater longevity ; changes over time in women 's labor force behavior and experience are projected to reduce , but not completely eliminate , the differences in men 's and women 's labor force participation rates and earnings ; any reform of the system that bases benefits on earnings will continue to produce different benefit levels for men and women ; if a reformed social security system were to rely largely on individual investment , better education about investment strategies and general financial principles might help women workers increase their retirement benefits ; in addition , requiring that retirement savings be annuitized would be better protect dependent spouses ; and annuities purchased with individual account balances might give rise to differential benefit levels for men and women with the same level of lifetime earnings because women are charged higher annuity prices , based on their longer average lifespan .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the reliability and mission capability of c - 5 aircraft and the department of defense 's ( dod ) plan for modifying c - 5 aircraft . gao found that : dod is relying on c - 5 aircraft to deliver about half of the wartime cargo carried by military aircraft , but c - 5 mission - capable rates have fallen short of the air force 's goal and those of other aircraft , because of a lack of spare parts and the complexity and poor reliability of the c - 5 ; the air force could improve the c - 5 mission capable rate by conducting a readiness evaluation similar to the one it completed for b - 1b aircraft and by giving a higher priority to certain c - 5 modernization initiatives ; the air force has not prioritized proposed c - 5 modifications and decisionmakers have not fully assessed the impact that these proposed improvements would have on overall aircraft mission capability ; and if peacetime c - 5 mission capable rates were raised to the air force 's goal , dod could better meet its airlift requirements .
gao reviewed the air force 's and navy 's policies and procedures for procuring aviation spare parts , focusing on whether their requirements and budgets reflect the amounts they actually need . gao found that : the air force and navy budgeted $ 132 million more than needed for aviation spare parts because they used questionable policies to determine their requirements and assign accountability for depot maintenance assets ; the air force did not include $ 72 million of its on - hand assets in preparing its fiscal year ( fy ) 1996 budget request ; the navy twice counted $ 60 million in depot maintenance requirements when preparing its fy 1997 budget request ; air force and navy computation errors were a result of unsupported and incorrect maintenance replacement rates , demand rates , planned program requirements , repair costs , lead times , due - out quantities , and asset quantities on hand and on order ; and errors found in the sample items reviewed totalled $ 35 million and resulted in some requirements being overstated by as much as $ 25 million and some being understated by $ 10 million .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided additional information on the social security administration 's ( ssa ) implementation of the new eligibility standard . gao noted that : ssa has made considerable progress in implementing the welfare reform changes in eligibility for supplemental security income ( ssi ) children ; it has taken important steps to safeguard fairness by identifying children whose benefits may have been terminated inappropriately and establishing remedial action to rereview their cases ; however , because ssa 's medical listings reflect multiple levels of severity , ssa also needs to expedite updating and modifying its medical listings to ensure that all children are assessed against a uniform severity standard ; the need to revise the listings is a long - standing problem that gao reported 3 years ago ; moreover , ssa needs to take concerted action to follow through on its plan for monitoring and continually improving the quality of decisions regarding children ; and consistent with its legislative mandate , gao will continue to focus its work on ssa 's efforts to provide reasonable assurance that it can administer the program consistently and improve the accuracy of childhood disability decisions .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on u.s. antidrug efforts in peru , focusing on the : rationale for , and costs associated with , the construction , maintenance , and operations of the santa lucia antidrug base ; rationale for discontinuing support of the santa lucia base ; and current status of u.s. efforts to restructure antidrug programs in peru . gao found that : the santa lucia base was constructed to place u.s. personnel in the safest possible environment from which to conduct antidrug activities ; between fiscal years 1988 and 1993 , the state department spent about $ 49.2 million to construct , maintain , and operate the santa lucia base ; in december 1993 , the u.s embassy restructured its antidrug programs in peru because it could not continue to support the base while also supporting other u.s. antidrug efforts ; although the executive branch has approved a formal mobile basing concept to implement antidrug efforts , the u.s. embassy has been slow in implementing the concept because of maintenance problems with helicopters , internal differences within the u.s. embassy over how the operational planning group would function to coordinate law enforcement operations , and the decision to stop sharing information with the government of peru that could be used to shoot down civilian aircraft suspected of drug trafficking ; and although legislation has been passed to allow information sharing on drug activities , the administration has not reached agreement with peru on certain required preconditions .
gao reviewed the theater high altitude area defense ( thaad ) user operational evaluation system ( uoes ) program , focusing on whether planned testing would reasonably demonstrate the capabilities of uoes as an interim system before funds are committed to interceptor production . gao found that : the army purchased 20 interceptors for demonstration and validation flight tests , of which only 14 will be used in these tests ; the army plans to commit funds for uoes production based on the results of the first 7 of the 14 scheduled flight tests ; transporting uoes interceptors from the united states to a theater of operations will require significant airlift resources that may not be available unless uoes is afforded a high priority ; the cost estimate for the 40 uoes interceptors has increased from $ 80 million to $ 165 million , and thaad project officials expect that estimate to rise to $ 220 million ; and delivery of the 40 uoes interceptors will be delayed due to increased delivery lead times and reduced fiscal year ( fy ) 1997 funding .
in his fy2010 budget request , president obama sought $ 147.620 billion for r & d , a $ 555 million ( 0.4 % ) increase from the estimated fy2009 r & d funding level of $ 147.065 billion ( not including fy2009 r & d funding provided under the american recovery and reinvestment act ( p.l . 111-5 ) . according to the obama administration , preliminary allocations of r & d funding provided under p.l . 111-5 brought total fy2009 r & d funding to $ 165.400 billion . unless otherwise noted in this report , comparisons of fy2009 and fy2010 r & d funding do not incorporate funding provided under p.l . 111-5. to the extent possible , the agency discussions in this report include an analysis of house and senate actions with respect to r & d funding . in some cases , however , there is insufficient information to parse agency r & d funding from other spending to determine precise agency funding levels ; estimated funding levels are provided for these agencies . congress continues to play a central role in defining the nation 's r & d priorities , especially with respect to two overarching issues : the extent to which the federal r & d investment can grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding will be prioritized and allocated . a low or negative growth rate in the overall r & d investment may require movement of resources across disciplines , programs , or agencies to address priorities . six federal agencies received 95.1 % of total federal r & d spending in the president 's fy2010 request : the department of defense ( 54.0 % ) , department of health and human services ( 21.0 % ) , national aeronautics and space administration ( 7.7 % ) , department of energy ( 7.3 % ) , national science foundation ( 3.6 % ) , and department of agriculture ( 1.5 % ) . the president 's fy2010 request included $ 30.884 billion for basic research ; $ 28.139 billion for applied research ; $ 84.054 billion for development ; and $ 4.543 billion for r & d facilities and equipment . the fy2010 request included funding for three multiagency r & d initiatives : national nanotechnology initiative , $ 1.637 billion ; networking and information technology r & d program , $ 3.927 billion ; and climate change science program , $ 2.026 billion . president obama requested increases in the r & d budgets of the three agencies that were targeted for doubling in the america competes act and by president bush as part of his american competitiveness initiative : the department of energy office of science ( up 3.5 % ) , the national science foundation ( up 8.6 % ) , and the department of commerce national institute of standards and technology 's core research and facilities ( up 1.2 % ) . congress has completed action on all twelve regular fy2010 appropriations bills the final bill , the department of defense appropriations act , 2010 , was passed by congress and signed into law on december 19 , 2009. for the past four years , federal r & d funding and execution has been affected by mechanisms used to complete the annual appropriations process — the year - long continuing resolution for fy2007 ( p.l . 110-5 ) and the combining of multiple regular appropriations bills into the consolidated appropriations act , 2008 for fy2008 ( p.l . 110-161 ) , the omnibus appropriations act , 2009 ( p.l . 111-8 ) , and the consolidated appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l . 111-117 ) . completion of appropriations after the beginning of each fiscal year may cause agencies to delay or cancel some planned r & d and equipment acquisition .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the air force 's selection of a source of repair for depot maintenance work at the closing sacramento air logistics center ( alc ) , focusing on whether the : air force 's procedures for conducting the sacramento competition provided substantially equal opportunity for the public and private offerors to compete for the work without regard to performance location ; procedures for conducting the competition were in compliance with 10 u.s.c . 2469a and other applicable laws and regulations ; appropriate consideration was given to factors other than cost ; and award resulted in the lowest total cost to the department of defense ( dod ) for performance of the work . gao noted that : the air force 's competition for work at the sacramento alc showed that : the competition procedures provided an equal opportunity for public and private competitors without regard to where the work could be performed ; the procedures did not appear to deviate in any material respect from applicable laws and regulations ; the air force appropriately considered factors other than cost in the selection ; and within the framework set forth for the competition , the award resulted in the lowest total cost to dod for performance of the work ; and gao also identified several issues that may be useful for the air force to consider in future competitions .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on canadian grain exports to the united states , focusing on the operations of the canadian wheat board ( cwb ) and the trade remedies applicable to the activities of state trading enterprises ( ste ) . gao noted that : the cwb is a ste with a monopoly on certain canadian grain sales and receives canadian government subsidies in a number of direct and indirect ways ; the canadian government also provides other assistance to its wheat and barley farmers ; the cwb 's operating environment is undergoing changes , some of which are expected to make the united states a more attractive market for canadian grain ; at the same time , there is a greater presence of u.s. grain companies operating in canada , and the cwb is dealing more frequently with private companies in the sale of canadian grain ; little information on actual cwb contracts is publicly available ; although u.s. customs service and the department of agriculture collect a great deal of information on imports of canadian grain into the united states , these data can not be used to ascertain cwb export prices ; the format that countries use to report on their stes ' activities to the world trade organization has recently been revised ; however , u.s. officials are concerned that it does not go far enough to increase the openness of the pricing practices of certain stes , such as the cwb ; trade remedies to combat disruptive or trade - distorting imports under u.s. trade laws do not treat stes any differently from other entities involved in international trade ; these u.s. trade laws can address trade issues such as dumping , actionable subsidies , and surges in imports ; in addition , ste activities may be subject to dispute settlement provisions under international trade agreements if the activities are inconsistent with an obligation agreed to by the government of the ste ; and relatively few trade remedy actions have been taken involving stes .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on local programs that help teenage mothers complete their secondary education as a step toward self - sufficiency . gao found that : communities have responded to the growth of unwed teenage mothers by creating programs to help them achieve economic self - sufficiency by completing their secondary education ; three of the five programs studied increased secondary education completion by actively monitoring school attendance and providing access to child care and transportation ; innovative approaches to help teenage mothers complete high school included alternative public schools for pregnant and parenting students , residential facilities for homeless teenage mothers on welfare , and home visiting ; all of the 15 cities surveyed required teenage mothers on welfare to continue their secondary education , but 12 of the cities did not monitor the teenage mothers ' attendance ; and states use of these successful approaches will depend on congress ' decision on whether welfare benefits should be provided to teenage mothers .
on june 11 , 2009 , the house and senate appropriations committees announced a conference agreement on h.r . 2346 , a bill providing supplemental appropriations for the remainder of fy2009 . the house passed the conference report ( 226 to 202 ) on june 16 ; the senate passed it ( 91 to 5 ) on june 18. president obama signed it into law ( p.l . 111-32 ) on june 24. on key issues , the agreement includes : $ 5 billion , as in the senate bill , to support u.s. loans to the international monetary fund , does not include a senate provision allowing the secretary of defense to exempt photos of military detainees from release under the freedom of information act ; does not include $ 80 million requested for the department of defense and the department of justice to facilitate closure of the guantanamo bay prison ; prohibits the release of guantanamo detainees in the united states and prohibits transfers of prisoners except to be prosecuted ; provides $ 1.9 billion for h1n1 pandemic flu preparedness ( declared to be a pandemic by the world health organization on june 11 ) , along with $ 5.8 billion more , contingent on the president determining it is needed ; and $ 1 billion for the `` cash for clunkers '' program to provide payments to consumers who trade in their inefficient vehicles and purchase more fuel efficient ones . including the contingent influenza funding , the bill provides a total of $ 105.9 billion in supplemental appropriations . the total includes $ 79.9 billion for defense and intelligence activities in iraq and afghanistan ; $ 10.4 billion for international affairs ( including food aid ) ; $ 5 billion for imf loans ; $ 7.7 billion for influenza measures ; $ 250 million , as requested , for domestic fire fighting ; $ 847 million , as in the senate bill , in unrequested funds for the corps of engineers for flood control projects ; $ 72 million , as requested , for capitol police radios ; and $ 1 billion for the `` cash for clunkers '' program . the decision to exclude the senate provision on detainee photos was reportedly approved in the conference only after the president agreed in a letter to take steps to prevent release of photos or videos of prisoner abuse . because the bill does not include that provision , democratic leaders said they were able to get enough support from house democrats who initially opposed the bill to overcome opposition from republicans who objected to imf funding . h.r . 2346 provides funds , with some adjustments , that the administration requested in four supplemental appropriations proposals , including an april 9 request for $ 83.4 billion in supplemental funding for defense , international affairs , domestic fire fighting , and other purposes ; an april 30 request for $ 1.5 billion for influenza preparedness and response ; and a may 12 request for $ 5 billion to support international monetary fund borrowing authority . on june 2 , the administration submitted an additional request for $ 2.0 billion more for influenza response , for expanded authority to transfer funds from other appropriations for influenza measures , and for $ 200 million in additional humanitarian assistance to pakistan .
following world war ii , the united states led efforts to establish an open and nondiscriminatory trading system with the expressed goal of raising the economic well - being of all countries and bolstering world peace . these efforts culminated in the creation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) in 1948 , a provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules that governed world trade for 47 years . the world trade organization ( wto ) succeeded the gatt in 1995 and today serves as a permanent body that administers the rules and agreements negotiated and signed by 153 participating parties , as well as a forum for dispute settlement and negotiations . section 125 of the uruguay round agreements ( p.l . 103-465 ) , which is the law that approved and implemented the agreements reached during the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations , provided that the u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) must submit to congress every five years a report that analyzes the costs and benefits of continued u.s. participation in the wto . the ustr submitted its report to congress on march 1 , 2010 , triggering a 90 legislative day timetable in which any member of congress may introduce a privileged joint resolution withdrawing congressional approval of the wto agreement ( to date no withdrawal resolution has been introduced in the 111th congress ) . most observers maintain that u.s. withdrawal from the wto is at best highly unlikely for both substantive and procedural reasons . substantively , the withdrawal of u.s. participation could undermine a multilateral system of trade rules and practices , formulated and implemented under u.s. leadership , that on balance has contributed to increased economic prosperity and security at home and abroad . procedurally , a withdrawal resolution would have to pass both the house and senate and then surmount a likely presidential veto via an override with a two - thirds majority vote . nevertheless , such a resolution provides an opportunity for members of congress periodically to debate `` whether the wto is an effective organization '' and ways it could better serve u.s. interests . the purpose of this report is to analyze some of the main issues in any debate on u.s. participation in the wto and to address some of the criticisms leveled at the organization . academic studies indicate that the united states benefits from broad reductions in trade barriers worldwide , but some workers and industries might not share in those gains . decisions in the wto are made by member governments , which determine their negotiating positions , file dispute challenges , and implement their decisions . however , some argue that smaller countries are left out of decision - making and that governments tend to represent the interests of large corporations disproportionately . the united states has been a frequent participant in wto dispute proceedings , both as a complainant and as a respondent . there have been complaints that countries do not adhere to decisions and that u.s. trade remedy laws have not been judged properly . it is also argued that this multilateral dispute settlement process is unique and that the united states has successfully used the process to advance its economic interests . certain advocates for the environment , food safety , labor , development , and financial regulation have criticized the wto . much of the criticism is based on interpretations of various wto agreements or rulings that have been controversial . an appendix sets out the legislative procedures for the wto withdrawal resolution . this report will be updated as events warrant .
the 111th congress passed comprehensive food safety legislation in december 2010 ( the fda food safety modernization act , or fsma , p.l . 111-353 ) . although numerous agencies share responsibility for regulating food safety , this newly enacted legislation focused on foods regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) and amended fda 's existing structure and authorities , in particular via the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ; 21 u.s.c . §§ 301 et seq . ) . the new law does not directly affect activities at the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , which oversees the safety of most meat and poultry . fsma generally expands or modifies existing fda authorities rather than creating a new food safety structure or authorities . among its many provisions , the new law will increase frequency of inspections at food facilities , tighten record - keeping requirements , extend more oversight to certain farms , and mandate product recalls if a firm fails to institute them voluntarily . the new law will require food processing , manufacturing , shipping , and other regulated facilities to conduct an analysis of the most likely safety hazards and to design and implement risk - based controls to prevent them . fsma also will facilitate the establishment of science - based `` performance standards '' for the most significant food contaminants . other provisions in the new law are also intended to improve the nation 's foodborne illness surveillance systems . fsma also mandates increased scrutiny of food imports , which account for a growing share of u.s. consumption ; food import shipments will have to be accompanied by documentation that they can meet safety standards that are at least equivalent to u.s. standards . such certifications might be provided by foreign governments or other so - called third parties accredited in advance . fsma also contains provisions for certifying or accrediting laboratories , including private laboratories , to conduct sampling and testing of food , among other provisions . this report provides a detailed overview of these and other major provisions in the newly enacted law . the 112th congress will likely provide oversight and scrutiny of how the law is implemented , including fda 's coordination with other federal agencies . implementation of the law will depend largely on the availability of discretionary appropriations , and some have questioned whether funding should be provided in the current budgetary climate . in addition , the 112th congress may consider changes to other food safety laws and policies that continue to be actively debated in congress . continued congressional interest in reforming the nation 's food safety laws and in monitoring food safety issues is expected , given other perceived problems with the current food safety system .
two of the major goals of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( p.l . 107-110 ; nclb ) , are to improve the quality of k - 12 teaching and raise the academic achievement of students who fail to meet grade - level proficiency standards . in setting these goals , congress recognized that reaching the second goal depends greatly on meeting the first ; that is , quality teaching is critical to student success . thus , nclb established new standards for teacher qualifications and required that all courses in `` core academic subjects '' be taught by a highly qualified teacher by the end of the 2005-2006 school year . during implementation , the nclb highly qualified teacher requirement came to be seen as setting minimum qualifications for entry into the profession and was criticized by some for establishing standards so low that nearly every teacher met the requirement . meanwhile , policy makers have grown increasingly interested in the output of teachers ' work ; that is , their performance in the classroom and the effectiveness of their instruction . attempts to improve teacher performance led to federal and state efforts to incentivize improved performance through alternative compensation systems . for example , through p.l . 109-149 , congress authorized the federal teacher incentive fund ( tif ) program , which provides grants to support teacher performance pay efforts . in addition , there are various programs at all levels ( national , state , and local ) aimed at reforming teacher compensation systems . the most recent congressional action in this area came with the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l . 111-5 ) and , in particular , enactment of the race to the top ( rttt ) program . in november 2009 , the u.s. department of education released a final rule of priorities , requirements , definitions , and selection criteria for the rttt . the final rule established a definition of an effective teacher as one `` whose students achieve acceptable rates ( e.g . , at least one grade level in an academic year ) of student growth ( as defined in this notice ) . . that is , to be considered effective , teachers must raise their students ' learning to a level at or above what is expected within a typical school year . states , leas , and schools must include additional measures to evaluate teachers ; however , these evaluations must be based , `` in significant part , [ on ] student growth . . this report addresses issues associated with the evaluation of teacher effectiveness based on student growth in achievement . it focuses specifically on a method of evaluation referred to as value - added modeling ( vam ) . although there are other methods for assessing teacher effectiveness , in the last decade , vam has garnered increasing attention in education research and policy due to its promise as a more objective method of evaluation . the first section of this report describes what constitutes a vam approach and how it estimates the so - called `` teacher effect . . the second section identifies the components necessary to conduct vam in education settings . third , the report discusses current applications of vam at the state and school district levels and what the research on these applications says about this method of evaluation . the fourth section of the report explains some of the implications these applications have for large - scale implementation of vam . finally , the report describes some of the federal policy options that might arise as congress considers legislative action around these or related issues .
under the rule of populist president hugo chávez , first elected in 1998 , venezuela has undergone enormous political changes , with a new constitution and unicameral legislature , and even a new name for the country , the bolivarian republic of venezuela . human rights organizations have expressed concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of expression under the chávez government . president chávez won reelection to another six - year term on october 7 , 2012 , by a margin of 11 % , capturing about 55 % of the vote compared to 44 % for opposition candidate henrique capriles . on december 11 , 2012 , however , chávez faced a fourth difficult operation in cuba for an undisclosed form of cancer that has raised questions about venezuela 's political future . because of significant health complications , vice president nicolás maduro announced on january 8 , 2013 , that president chávez would not be sworn into office on january 10 as planned , but that he would be sworn into office at a later date , a decision supported by venezuela 's supreme court . looking ahead , if president chávez does not recover , the constitution calls for a new election to be held within 30 days if the president dies or is incapacitated during the first four years of his term . u.s. policy the united states traditionally has had close relations with venezuela , a major supplier of foreign oil , but there has been friction in relations under the chávez government . over the years , u.s. officials have expressed concerns about human rights , venezuela 's military arms purchases , its relations with iran , and its efforts to export its brand of populism to other latin american countries . declining cooperation on anti - drug and anti - terrorism efforts has been a major concern . the united states has imposed sanctions : on several venezuelan government and military officials for allegedly helping the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) with drug and weapons trafficking ; on three venezuelan companies for providing support to iran ; and on several venezuelan individuals for providing support to hezbollah . despite tensions in relations , the obama administration remains committed to seeking constructive engagement with venezuela , focusing on such areas as anti - drug and counter - terrorism efforts . in the aftermath of president chávez 's reelection , the white house , while acknowledging differences with president chávez , congratulated the venezuelan people on the high level of participation and the relatively peaceful election process . legislative initiatives as in past years , there were concerns in the 112th congress regarding the state of venezuela 's democracy and human rights situation and its deepening relations with iran , and these concerns will likely continue in the 113th congress . the 112th congress approved h.r . 3783 ( p.l . 112-220 ) , which requires the administration to conduct an assessment and present `` a strategy to address iran 's growing hostile presence and activity in the western hemisphere . . other initiatives that were not approved include : h.r . 2542 , which would have withheld some assistance to the organization of american states unless that body took action to invoke the inter - american democratic charter regarding the status of democracy in venezuela ; h.r . 2583 , which included a provision prohibiting aid to the government of venezuela ; and h.res . 247 , which would have called on the secretary of state to designate venezuela as a state sponsor of terrorism . in action on fy2013 foreign aid appropriations , the report to the house appropriations committee bill , h.r . 5857 ( h.rept . 112-494 , reported may 25 , 2012 ) , directs that $ 5 million in economic support funds be provided for democracy programs in venezuela , the same amount appropriated in fy2012 , and $ 2 million more than requested by the administration . in contrast , the report to the senate appropriations committee bill , s. 3241 ( s.rept . 112-172 , reported may 24 , 2012 ) , recommends $ 3 million for democracy programs in venezuela to be administered by the national endowment for democracy . ultimately , the 112th congress did not complete action on a fy2013 full - year foreign operations appropriations measure , but it did approve a continuing appropriations resolution , fy2013 ( p.l . 112-175 ) in september 2012 , which funds regular foreign aid accounts at the same level as in fy2012 , plus 0.612 % through march 27 , 2013. specific country accounts , however , are left to the discretion of responsible agencies . the 113th congress will need to address foreign aid appropriations for the balance of fy2013 . note : this report provides background on political and economic changes in venezuela , u.s. policy , and u.s. legislative action and initiatives from 2009-2012 covering the 111th and 112th congress . it will not be updated .
congress and the executive branch have historically identified the asia pacific economic cooperation forum ( apec ) as potentially important in the promotion of liberalized international trade and investment in asia , and possibly the rest of the world . apec 's commitment to the goal of trade and investment liberalization is embodied in its bogor goals , in which apec members pledged to free and open trade and investment in the asia - pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies . the 2009 apec leaders ' and ministerial meetings focused on balanced growth , resisting protectionism , fostering trade and investment liberalization , accelerating regional economic integration , and enhancing human security . in the leaders ' declaration , apec presented a new `` growth paradigm '' based on balanced , sustainable , and inclusive growth . in the ministerial meeting , one of the main topics was efforts to be taken at , behind , and across borders to promote regional economic integration . the next two years may be a critical period for apec and its achievement of the bogor goals . the 2010 meetings are to be held in yokohama , japan — the target year for apec 's industrialized members to achieve the bogor goals . the united states will host the 2011 meetings . the obama administration has chosen honolulu as the host city for the 2011 leaders ' meeting , but has not given a clear indication of apec 's role in u.s. trade policy . several alternative avenues for the promotion of trade integration in asia have emerged , challenging the past u.s. focus on apec . the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) is promoting the creation of various forms of an all - asian free trade association that could exclude the united states . in november 2009 , the obama administration announced it would to enter into negotiations with the trans - pacific strategic economic partnership agreement ( tpp ) , a free trade agreement between brunei darussalam , chile , new zealand , and singapore . critics of apec have referred to the association as a `` talk shop , '' that has produced few results . however , studies conducted by apec reveal a substantial drop in members ' average tariff rates , the elimination of a number of non - tariff trade barriers , and a major reduction in the transaction costs associated with international trade — all of which is likely attributable at least in part to apec initiatives . historical trade data is consistent with the premise that apec has been successful in promoting greater trade within its member economies and with the rest of the world . both the exports and imports of apec members have grown faster than global trade since the creation of apec . however , apec 's greater trade growth may be attributable to other factors than the liberalization of trade and investment policies among its members . the 111th congress may reexamine u.s. policy towards apec . it has already increased apec - related funding in fy2009 , in part to provide for the preparations for the 2011 apec meetings to be held in the united states . in addition , there are other actions congress may choose to take with respect to apec , depending on its determination of apec 's role in relation to trade promotion initiatives in asia . congressional attitudes and actions may also be influenced by the obama administration 's trade policies in asia — and the role apec plays in those policies . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
increasing focus on current cyber threats to federal information technology systems , nonfederal critical information infrastructure , and other nonfederal systems has led to numerous legislative cybersecurity proposals and executive branch initiatives . the proposed national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( ndaa fy2010 ) and the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2010 ( iia fy2010 ) both contain provisions that would affect programs and funding for current and future cybersecurity - related programs . in may 2009 , the obama administration issued its 60-day review of cybersecurity policy , declaring that u.s. information networks would be treated as a strategic national asset . there is no single congressional committee or executive agency with primary responsibility over all aspects of cybersecurity ; each entity involved pursues cybersecurity from a limited vantage point dictated by committee jurisdiction . many different initiatives exist , but because of fragmentation of missions and responsibilities , `` stove - piping , '' and a lack of mutual awareness between stakeholders , it is difficult to ascertain where there may be programmatic overlap or gaps in cybersecurity policy . drawing from common themes found in the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative ( cnci ) , a study by the center for strategic and international studies ( csis ) commission for the 44th presidency , and the proposed near - term action plan from the president 's recent cyberspace policy review , this report identifies cybersecurity policy issues that have been proposed for priority consideration . the report lists and synopsizes current legislation at the time of this writing that has been developed to address various aspects of the cybersecurity problem . it then lists the status of the legislation and compares legislation with existing executive branch initiatives at the time of writing . finally , analysis of information contained in executive branch initiatives and congressional legislation is used to further highlight cybersecurity - related considerations for congress . this report will not be updated .
president obama requested a total of $ 123.1 billion for the agencies included in h.r . 3288 , the transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriations ( thud ) bill for fy2010 . this request represented an increase of approximately $ 14.1 billion ( 12.9 % ) over the $ 109.1 billion provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act ( division i of p.l . 111-8 ) . the enacted legislation provided $ 122.1 billion , less than 1 % ( $ 977 million ) below the president 's request and 12 % ( $ 13.4 billion ) more than the comparable fy2009 funding ( not including the fy2009 emergency funding ) . the single largest new item in the budget request was $ 5 billion for a new independent federal agency — a national infrastructure bank — that would provide federal funding for , and promote investment from other sources in , infrastructure projects of national or regional significance . neither the house nor the senate funded this request ; the conference report encourages the administration to pursue the creation of such a program through the regular authorization process . the fy2010 request for dot totaled $ 72.4 billion , $ 5.2 billion ( 7.7 % ) more than the total of $ 67.2 billion in funding provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act ( the house and senate both reported the request as $ 77.4 billion , as they considered the $ 5 billion request for an infrastructure bank as part of the dot request ) . the actual requested increase is somewhat less , as the reported funding level for fy2009 was reduced by a $ 3.5 billion rescission of contract authority which did not actually reduce the level of funding provided . the house - passed bill provides a total of $ 75.8 billion in funding for dot , $ 3.4 billion ( 8 % ) more than the requested level . the senate - passed bill provided $ 75.8 billion . the enacted legislation provided $ 75.7 billion , $ 3.3 billion ( 5 % ) more than the original dot request . the fy2010 request for hud totaled $ 45.5 billion , $ 4.0 billion ( 7.7 % ) more than the comparable amount of new funding provided in the regular annual appropriation for fy2009 . the house - passed bill provided $ 47.1 billion , the senate - passed bill provided $ 45.8 , and the enacted legislation provided $ 46.1 billion,1 % more than the requested amount . throughout this report , the amounts being considered for fy2010 are compared to the amounts provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act . however , dot and hud also received significant amounts of supplemental funding in fy2009 through the economic stimulus act ( the american recovery and reinvestment act , p.l . 111-5 / h.r . 1 ) , which congress passed in february of 2009. that act provided $ 48.1 billion in emergency supplemental funding for dot and $ 13.7 billion for hud , a total of $ 61.8 billion in additional funding . that represented an increase of 52 % to the total new funding provided in the fy2009 thud appropriations act . not every office and program in the thud bill received funding from that supplement , and not all of that additional funding was expended in fy2009 .
military personnel issues typically generate significant interest from many members of congress and their staffs . ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan , along with the emerging operational role of the reserve components , further heighten interest in a wide range of military personnel policies and issues . the congressional research service ( crs ) has selected a number of the military personnel issues considered in deliberations on the house - passed and senate versions of the national defense authorization act for fy2011 . this report provides a brief synopsis of sections that pertain to personnel policy . the house version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 , h.r . 5136 , was introduced in the house on april 26 , 2010 , reported by the house committee on armed services on may 21 , 2010 ( h.rept . 111-491 ) , and passed by the house on may 28 , 2010. the senate version of the ndaa , s. 3454 , was introduced in the senate on june 4 , 2010 and reported by the senate committee on armed services on june 4 , 2010 ( s.rept . 111-201 ) . however , s. 3454 was never passed by the senate . instead of a conference committee to resolve differences , a new bill ( h.r . 6523 ) was introduced in the house of representatives on december 15 , 2010. it was passed by the house on december 17 , 2010 and passed by the senate on december 22 , 2010. the bill , the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2011 , was signed by the president on january 7 , 2010 and became p.l . 111-383. where appropriate , related crs products are identified to provide more detailed background information and analysis of the issue . for each issue , a crs analyst is identified and contact information is provided . some issues were addressed in the fy2010 national defense authorization act and discussed in crs report r40711 , fy2010 national defense authorization act : selected military personnel policy issues , coordinated by [ author name scrubbed ] . those issues that were previously considered in crs report r40711 , fy2010 national defense authorization act : selected military personnel policy issues are designated with a `` * '' in the relevant section titles of this report . this report focuses exclusively on the annual defense authorization process . it does not include appropriations , veterans ' affairs , tax implications of policy choices or any discussion of separately introduced legislation .
since at least the 1980s , the border has played a central role in u.s. policy discussions . policymakers have for years debated the best strategy for providing border protection . what has emerged from these efforts has been a generally agreed upon framework of mission and goals . however , some question whether the strategy has been sufficiently mapped out in a comprehensive fashion . the broad framework currently in place is generally supported by a collection of agency or function - specific strategic elements that show some commonalities . for congressional policymakers , the current state of border protection strategy presents at least three questions : ( 1 ) what does the current border protection framework consist of ? . ( 2 ) is it working ? . and ( 3 ) are there more effective alternatives to achieve border protection ? . this report addresses these three questions through two competing models for conceptualizing a border protection system , through the analysis of existing documentation and data , and through the presentation of various legislative options . for critics and advocates of u.s. border protection policy , there are a host of competing policy alternatives for how to effectively protect the border . while some individuals want more enforcement and stricter admission criteria , others want to lessen these restrictions . ultimately , the policy choices are rooted in competing visions of what u.s. border policy should look like . these visions can be grouped into at least two camps : ( 1 ) the unilateral security model based on a metaphorical `` fortress '' and ( 2 ) an interdependence ( or cooperation - based ) model based on a metaphorical `` complex organism . . the current border protection framework can be understood as consisting of a mission , three goals , and five strategic elements . the mission is securing and managing the u.s. border . the current border protection framework can be summarized as obtaining effective control of the borders , safeguarding lawful trade and travel , and identifying and disrupting transnational criminal organizations . finally , the five strategic elements to achieve these goals consist of department of homeland security leadership , deployment of layered security , maximizing domain awareness , promotion of a shared agency culture , and expansion of the border through international and domestic partnerships . analysis of available data suggests that despite some support for the viability of the current border protection approach in its present state , it is not seemingly providing sufficient deterrence to overcome labor market demand for illegal workers . yet , definitive conclusions of effectiveness can not be made because the current border protection operation is an incomplete version of what policymakers envisioned . the border protection framework goals are necessarily vague , as the breadth of the threats and activities at the border are wide . but these goals are rooted in the notion that a strategy based on enforcement can ultimately prevent or deter most actions that are undesirable . this assumption has been the source of much debate and continues to be the source of skepticism in certain circles . as suggested above , few conclusive claims about the effectiveness of the current border protection framework can be made . yet , even if enforcement - only measures do provide some level of deterrence and prevention against border violations , these efforts are both costly and do not necessarily address the underlying causes of such activities . moreover , they can have unintended consequences . this report will not be updated .
title i , part a , of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) authorizes federal aid to local educational agencies ( leas ) for the education of disadvantaged children . title i - a grants provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other pupils attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from low - income families . in recent years , they have also become a `` vehicle '' to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public k - 12 education for all pupils have been attached as a condition for receiving title i - a grants . these include requirements for assessments of pupil achievement ; adequate yearly progress ( ayp ) standards and determinations for schools , leas , and states ; consequences for schools and leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more ; plus teacher and paraprofessional qualifications . the esea was initially adopted in 1965 , and was most recently reauthorized and amended by the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ) , p.l . 107-110. currently , although the authorization for esea title i - a has expired , appropriations have continued to be provided , and the program continues to be implemented under the policies established by the most recent authorization statute . the 111th congress is expected to consider proposals to extend and amend the esea . for the allocation of funds to states and leas , title i - a has four separate formulas : the basic , concentration , targeted , and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas . once these funds reach leas , they are no longer treated separately ; they are combined and used without distinction for the same program purposes . while there are numerous complications and special features associated with the title i - a allocation formulas , each has the same underlying structure . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a `` population factor , '' consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an `` expenditure factor '' based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the population and expenditure factors , and / or the population factor is modified to direct increased funds to leas with concentrations of poverty . major title i - a reauthorization issues regarding allocation formulas are likely to include the following : should annual variations in the poverty estimates used to calculate title i - a grants be reduced through multi - year averaging or other methods ? . has the targeting of title i - a funds on high poverty leas increased since 2001 ? . should the population weighting factors of the targeted and education finance incentive grant ( efig ) formulas be modified to more equally favor leas with large numbers of school - age children in poor families and leas with high poverty rates ? . should the expenditure factors continue to play a major role in the title i - a formulas ? . should there be some consolidation of the four different allocation formulas ? . should the authorization level for title i - a continue to be specified for future years , and if so , at what levels ? . should the effort factor in the efig formula be modified ? . should the equity factor in the efig formula be modified ? . should the current provisions for intra - lea allocation be reconsidered ? . should the remaining special constraints on grants to puerto rico , the cap on aggregate population weights in the targeted grant formula , be removed ? . should the temporary assistance to needy families ( tanf ) formula factor be eliminated ? . and finally , should each county portion of new york city and other multi - county leas continue to be treated as separate leas under the title i - a allocation formulas ? . this report will not be updated .
the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for the department of the interior ( doi ) , except for the bureau of reclamation , and for agencies within other departments — including the forest service within the department of agriculture and the indian health service ( ihs ) within the department of health and human services . it also includes funding for arts and cultural agencies , the environmental protection agency , and numerous other entities . the department of the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations act , 2010 ( p.l . 111-88 ) , contained a total of $ 32.29 billion for fy2010 . this was $ 4.45 billion ( 16 % ) higher than the fy2009 appropriation of $ 27.84 billion ( excluding stimulus appropriations ) . the house , senate , and administration had all supported significantly higher levels for fy2010 — ranging between 15 % and 16 % higher — than the fy2009 appropriation of $ 27.84 billion . p.l . 111-5 , the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 , contained an additional $ 10.95 billion in emergency funds for fy2009 for some of the accounts within agencies typically funded by the annual interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations laws . in general , the funds were made available for obligation until september 30 , 2010 ( the end of fy2010 ) . the fy2010 appropriation of $ 32.29 billion in p.l . 111-88 was $ 6.50 billion ( 17 % ) less than the total fy2009 appropriations of $ 38.79 billion , including stimulus appropriations . a variety of funding and policy issues were debated during consideration of the fy2010 interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill . they included oil and gas leasing in the outer continental shelf , wildland fire fighting , indian trust fund management , royalty relief , and climate change . other issues included funding for bureau of indian affairs construction , education , and housing ; indian health service construction and urban indian health ; wastewater / drinking water needs ; land acquisition ; and the superfund program . this report is not expected to be updated .
the united states supreme court in skilling v. united states construed the honest services branch of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes to reach no more than cases involving bribery or kickbacks . the mail and wire fraud statutes , 18 u.s.c . sections 1341 and 1343 , impose criminal penalties for the use of mail or interstate wire communications to deprive another of money or property through a `` scheme or artifice to defraud . . in its 1987 mcnally decision , the court had held that while the fraud statutes reached schemes to deprive another of property rights , they did not cover `` the intangible right of the citizenry to good government . . congress responded almost immediately by enacting the `` honest services '' statute , 18 u.s.c . section 1346 , which declares that the phrase `` scheme or artifice to defraud '' in the mail and wire statutes also encompasses depriving `` another of the intangible right of honest services . . in its 2009 term , the court was presented with three honest services cases — skilling , black , and weyhrauch . each offered the court a slightly different prerequisite for an honest services conviction — for weyhrauch , a public official , it was an underlying state law violation ; for black , in the private sector , it was foreseeable harm ; for skilling , an enron executive , it was private gain . the court instead returned to the pre - mcnally case law which it felt congress intended the honest services statute to revive . in the pre - mcnally world , most of the honest services cases , the core cases , involved bribery or kickbacks . this , the court said , is what congress meant when it spoke of honest services : the deprivation of honest services , public or private , by bribery or kickbacks . to construe the statute otherwise , the court felt , would ground the statute on `` a vagueness shoal . . in fact , three members of the court refused to endorse the majority opinion in full because they thought the honest services statute unconstitutionally vague on due process grounds . should congress desire a more inclusive definition of honest services fraud , the court urged that it `` employ standards of sufficient definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns . . the court sent each of the three cases back to the lower courts — black and skilling , for a determination of whether erroneous jury instructions on honest services fraud had so tainted their convictions as to require a new trial or whether the instructions simply constituted harmless error ; weyhrauch , for the reconsideration in light of the court 's skilling decision . related crs reports include crs report r41930 , mail and wire fraud : a brief overview of federal criminal law , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report r42016 , prosecution of public corruption : an overview of amendments under h.r . 2572 and s. 401 , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
on march 31 , 2010 , the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) in the office of management and budget ( omb ) issued a proposed policy letter on inherently governmental functions and other `` work reserved for performance by federal government employees . . while not final , the policy letter represents the obama administration 's proposed guidance for agencies determining ( 1 ) whether particular functions are inherently governmental and ( 2 ) when functions closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions and critical functions should be performed by government personnel . under existing law , agencies can not contract out inherently governmental functions , and they must give `` special consideration '' to using government personnel in performing functions closely associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions . no limitations upon contracting out critical functions currently exist . in keeping with the requirements of section 321 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act for fy2009 ( p.l . 110-417 ) , which tasked omb with developing a `` single consistent definition '' of `` inherently governmental function , '' the proposed policy letter adopts the definition of the federal activities inventory reform ( fair ) act . the fair act defines an `` inherently governmental function '' as one that is `` so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees . . however , neither the proposed policy letter nor the notice from ofpp introducing it indicates whether or how the obama administration would amend the definitions of `` inherently governmental function '' in the federal acquisition regulation , omb circular a - 76 , or other executive branch regulations and policy documents . the proposed policy letter defines a `` critical function '' as one that is `` necessary to the agency being able to effectively perform and maintain control of its mission and operations . . this definition , and the accompanying guidance on when critical functions and functions associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions should be performed in - house , also respond to the requirements of section 321 of the duncan hunter national defense authorization act . among other things , section 321 tasked omb with developing criteria that agencies could use in identifying critical functions and positions that should be performed by government personnel to ensure that agencies develop and maintain `` sufficient organic expertise and technical capacity . . president obama 's march 4 , 2009 , memorandum on government contracting similarly charged omb with clarifying when outsourcing is `` appropriate . . the proposed policy letter raises several legal and policy issues of potential interest to congress , given recently enacted and proposed legislation regarding inherently governmental functions and other limitations upon contracting out ( e.g . , p.l . 111-8 , p.l . 111-84 , p.l . 111-117 ) . key among these issues are ( 1 ) the relationship between the proposed policy letter and other executive branch authorities on inherently governmental and related functions ; ( 2 ) whether the proposed policy letter would necessarily result in changes in agencies ' use of contractors to perform certain functions that some members of congress and commentators claim are inherently governmental ( e.g . , security services during contingency operations ) ; and ( 3 ) the potential demands of any new requirements upon the acquisition workforce . the office of federal procurement policy has reportedly indicated that a final policy letter will be released `` in early 2011. .
as of the date of this report , members in the 111th congress have introduced nine stand - alone proposals that would control greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions . the proposals offered to date would employ market - based approaches — either a cap - and - trade or carbon tax system , or some combination thereof — to reduce ghg emissions . the legislative proposals are varied in their overall approaches in controlling ghg emissions . some control emissions by setting a quantity ( or cap ) ; others control emissions by setting a price ( or tax / fee ) . in addition , the proposals differ in their inclusion of particular design elements , such as whether or not to allow offsets ( emission reduction opportunities from economic sectors not directly addressed by the primary approach ) . h.r . 2454 , the american clean energy and security act of 2009 ( waxman / markey ) , and s. 1733 , the clean energy jobs and american power act ( kerry / boxer ) , have been the primary energy and climate change legislative vehicles in the 111th congress . on june 26 , 2009 , the house passed h.r . 2454. on november 5 , the committee approved senator boxer 's `` manager 's amendment '' as a substitute , and ordered s. 1733 reported . in addition to establishing a cap - and - trade system to regulate ghg emissions , both h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 would address energy efficiency , renewable energy , and other energy topics . other proposals — h.r . 1862 ( van hollen ) and h.r . 1666 ( doggett ) — would control emissions by limiting quantity , but would differ in their structure and implementation . three of the proposals — h.r . 594 ( stark ) , h.r . 1337 ( larson ) , and h.r . 2380 ( inglis ) — would use a carbon tax approach to address carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions from fossil fuel combustion . other proposals do not fit precisely into either a price or quantity control category . h.r . 1683 ( mcdermott ) would establish a program that may be described as a dynamic carbon tax : its tax rate would be linked with annual emission allocations ( or caps ) . s. 2877 ( cantwell ) would establish a co2 emission control program on fossil fuel producers and importers . although the bill would limit the number of carbon shares auctioned each year , the auctions would include a price safety valve , allowing for the purchase of additional shares . to counter the emissions from these additional shares ( above the cap ) , the price safety - valve revenues would be used to support mitigation efforts outside of the emission control program . on may 12 , 2010 , senators kerry and lieberman released a draft of new climate change legislation . a comprehensive energy and climate change policy proposal , the draft would set ghg reduction goals similar to those of h.r . 2454. the proposal would employ a market - based cap - and - trade scheme for electric generators and industry with a separate set - price mechanism to allocate allowances to cover transportation fuels . a key element in ghg emission reduction bills is how , to whom , and for what purpose the value of emission allowances or carbon tax revenue would be distributed . the distribution strategy is a critical policy decision , because it would affect ( 1 ) the overall cost of the program and ( 2 ) how program costs are distributed throughout the economy . in the early years of the program , h.r . 2454 and s. 1733 would distribute allowances at no cost to both covered and non - covered entities to support various policy objectives . in addition , an increasing percentage of the allowances would be sold through auction . as with the distribution of no - cost allowances , auction revenues would be used to further various policy objectives .
in the 2010 decennial census , the census bureau counted the total population of the united states . this included , as in previous censuses , all u.s. citizens , lawfully present aliens , and unauthorized aliens . some have suggested excluding aliens , particularly those who are in the country unlawfully , from the census count , in part so that they would not be included in the data used to apportion house seats among the states and determine voting districts within them . one question raised by this idea is whether the exclusion of aliens could be done by amending the federal census statutes , or whether such action would require an amendment to the constitution . the constitution requires a decennial census to determine the `` actual enumeration '' of the `` whole number of persons '' in the united states . the data must be used to apportion the house seats among the states , although there is no constitutional requirement it be used to determine intrastate districts . it appears the term `` whole number of persons '' is broad enough to include all individuals , regardless of citizenship status , and thus would appear to require the entire population be included in the apportionment calculation . as such , it appears a constitutional amendment would be necessary to exclude any individuals from the census count for the purpose of apportioning house seats . from time to time , congress has considered legislation that would exclude all aliens or prevent only unauthorized aliens from being included in the census for purposes of apportioning house seats among the states . such legislation would have either amended the census clause of the constitution or enacted or amended federal census statutes . although such legislation has yet to be introduced in the 112th congress , in the 111th congress , legislation was introduced that used both approaches . the fairness in representation act would have statutorily excluded aliens from the population count for apportionment purposes ( h.r . 3797 and s. 1688 ) . under the above analysis , it would not appear to be constitutionally sufficient for congress to amend the federal census statutes in such manner . meanwhile , h.j.res . 11 would take the other approach and amend the constitution so that only u.s. citizens would be counted in the apportionment calculation . other legislation in the 111th congress would not have raised the same constitutional issues since it would not appear to require the exclusion of any individuals for apportionment purposes . an amendment introduced by senator vitter to the commerce , justice , science , and related agencies appropriations act , 2010 ( s.amdt . 2644 to h.r . 2847 ) , would have cut off funding for the census unless the census form included questions regarding citizenship and immigration status . the amendment was subsequently ruled to be non - germane . on the other side of the issue , the every person counts act ( h.r . 3855 ) would have prohibited the census bureau from asking about u.s. citizenship or immigration status .
u.s. international competitiveness has been a topic of heated debate in recent years . in this debate it has been argued that the decline in performance of u.s. firms stems , at least in part , from problems with the federal tax system . in support of these claims , comparisons are often made between provisions of the u.s. tax code and those of the nation 's trading partners — with selected differences offered as explanations for unsatisfactory outcomes . one common argument made by advocates of this position is that the united states ' reliance on direct taxes ( such as income and payroll taxes ) provides a disadvantage when trading with countries that have indirect taxes ( such as a value - added tax or vat ) . this argument follows from the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) allowance for border tax adjustments ( the rebate of indirect taxes on exports and the imposition of indirect taxes on imports ) on indirect taxes , but not for direct taxes . according to this argument , u.s. companies are at a competitive disadvantage because they can not make use of border tax adjustments like many of their international competitors . almost since its inception in 1967 , this provision has been characterized as an export subsidy and as a source of competitive disadvantage . beginning in the johnson administration , high - level discussions have been held concerning this matter . in addition , congress has also instructed u.s. trade negotiators to address this perceived distortion as part of granting fast - track trade authorization in 1974 , 1988 , and 2002. congressional interest in this debate continues today with the introduction of the border tax fairness act ( s. 1043 ) and the border tax equity act of 2009 ( h.r . 2927 ) . in addition to directing u.s. trade negotiators to address this perceived distortion , the acts would impose taxes on imports from countries with border tax adjustments and compensate exporters for border taxes paid . some assert that these provisions would redress issues of u.s. competitiveness ; others maintain this is not the case . economists have long recognized that border tax adjustments have no effect on a nation 's competitiveness . border tax adjustments have been shown to mitigate the double taxation of cross - border transactions and to provide a level playing field for domestic and foreign goods and services . hence , in the absence of changes to the underlying macroeconomic variables affecting capital flows ( for example , interest rates ) , any changes in the product prices of traded goods and services brought about by border tax adjustments would be immediately offset by exchange - rate adjustments . this is not to say , however , that a nation 's tax structure can not influence patterns of trade or the composition of trade . this report explains these common economic findings on the effect of border tax adjustments on international competitiveness , through two perspectives on the issue — first through a discussion on the neutrality of border tax adjustments with respect to cross - border trade and secondly using economic theory to explain the effect of border tax adjustments on the u.s. balance of trade . as a prelude to these explanations , the report begins with a brief explanation of vats and border tax adjustments . this report will be updated as legislative events warrant .
the legal services corporation ( lsc ) is a private , nonprofit , federally funded corporation that helps provide legal assistance to low - income people in civil ( i.e . , non - criminal ) matters . the primary responsibility of the lsc is to manage and oversee the congressionally appropriated federal funds that it distributes in the form of grants to local legal services providers , which in turn give legal assistance to low - income clients . the lsc appropriation for fy2009 is $ 390 million . since its inception , the legal services program has been controversial . congress , through the lsc act and various annual appropriation laws , has imposed many restrictions on activities of lsc - funded legal services programs . the obama administration and certain congressional proposals would eliminate some of these restrictions . under current law , lsc - funded legal services programs may not : ( 1 ) engage in partisan litigation related to redistricting ; ( 2 ) attempt to influence regulatory , legislative , or adjudicative action at the federal , state , or local level ; ( 3 ) attempt to influence oversight proceedings of the lsc ; ( 4 ) engage in litigation related to abortion ; ( 5 ) engage in litigation related to school desegregation ; ( 6 ) engage in litigation related to draft registration or desertion from the military ; ( 7 ) initiate or participate in any class action suit ; ( 8 ) represent certain categories of aliens , except that both lsc and non - lsc funds may be used to represent aliens who have been victims of domestic violence or child abuse ; ( 9 ) conduct advocacy training on a public policy issue or encourage political activities , strikes , or demonstrations ; ( 10 ) represent clients in eviction proceedings if the eviction was based on drug - related activities ; ( 11 ) represent federal , state , or local prisoners ; ( 12 ) participate in efforts to reform a federal or state welfare system ; ( 13 ) solicit clients ; or ( 14 ) engage in activities related to assisted suicide , euthanasia , or mercy killing . the obama administration 's fy2010 budget proposed that funding for the lsc be increased to $ 435 million for fy2010 ( which would exceed the previous all - time high level of $ 400 million ) , and that lsc restrictions on class action suits and attorneys ' fees be eliminated . h.r . 2847 , the fy2010 appropriations bill from the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce , justice , science and related agencies ( cjs ) , as passed by the house ( on june 18 , 2009 ) would have increased funding for the lsc to $ 440 million for fy2010 and would have kept the current restrictions on lsc activities , except for the one relating to attorneys ' fees . h.r . 2847 , as passed by the senate ( on november 5 , 2009 ) , would have increased funding for the lsc to $ 400 million for fy2010 and would have , in effect , allowed non - federal funds that are received by lsc - funded legal services programs to be used to pay for activities that are prohibited by the lsc , except for litigation involving abortion or prisoners . by contrast , the proposed civil access to justice act of 2009 , s. 718 , introduced by senator harkin ( et al . ) . on march 26 , 2009 ( and the house companion bill h.r . 3764 , introduced by representative robert `` bobby '' scott ( et al . ) . on october 8 , 2009 ) , would increase lsc funding to $ 750 million per year and remove most of the restrictions on activities performed by legal services programs that receive lsc funds . p.l . 111-117 , the consolidated appropriations for 2010 ( enacted december 16 , 2009 ) , included a provision that appropriates $ 420 million for the lsc for fy2010 . p.l . 111-117 also continues existing limitations on the use of lsc funds ( and non - lsc funds ) except for the restriction on the ability of lsc - funded programs to claim and collect attorneys ' fees . this report provides background information on the lsc , presents some of the arguments for and against the imposition of the current restrictions on lsc funds , and provides information on when the restrictions were enacted . this report will be updated as warranted .
the caribbean island - nation of jamaica has had a relatively stable parliamentary political system stemming from its history of british colonial rule . current prime minister bruce golding of the jamaica labour party was elected in september 2007 when his party defeated the long - ruling people 's national party led by then - prime minister portia simpson . in late may 2010 , however , jamaica 's stability was challenged after prime minister golding agreed to extradite to the united states an at - large alleged drug kingpin and gang leader , christopher coke . the jamaican government deployed police and soldiers seeking to execute a warrant for coke , but his armed supporters erected barricades and roadblocks to battle the security forces . in the ensuing violence , 76 people were killed , including two policemen and a soldier . human rights organizations have called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation into the killings , especially since jamaica 's police forces have been criticized for many years for extrajudicial killings and the indiscriminate use of force . coke was ultimately captured and extradited to new york in late june 2010 to face drug and weapons trafficking charges . high rates of crime and violence have plagued jamaica for many years . in the 1970s and 1980s there was a high level of politically motivated violence when political parties became allied with armed gangs to deliver votes at election time . jamaica 's gangs initially were involved in the trafficking of marijuana in the 1970s ( jamaica is the caribbean 's largest producer and exporter of marijuana ) , but in the mid - 1980s became involved in cocaine trafficking , with jamaica used as a transit country , as well as weapons trafficking . since the 1990s , much of the violent crime in the country has been associated with this drug trafficking and related intra - gang and internal gang feuds . jamaica 's challenges include bringing down the high levels of gang violence , reforming the police and justice system to prevent extrajudicial killings by police and impunity , and breaking the linkages between the political parties and armed gangs . jamaica 's services - based economy has averaged only modest growth rates over the past two decades , and has been in recession since 2008 because of the global economic crisis , which hurt the tourism sector and reduced the price and demand for jamaican bauxite / alumina exports . a difficult economic challenge for the government is dealing with a large external debt burden , which has limited the government 's ability to respond to the effects of the global economic crisis . in february 2010 , the international monetary fund approved a $ 1.27 billion stand - by arrangement to help the country deal with the consequences of the global economic downturn and support the government 's fiscal , debt , and financial sector reforms . u.s. relations with jamaica are close , and are characterized by significant economic and cultural linkages and cooperation on a range of bilateral and transnational issues , including cooperation on anti - drug trafficking efforts . congress has regularly supported a variety of foreign assistance programs for jamaica , and the country will likely receive funding under the administration 's new caribbean basin security initiative . there had been increasing tension in u.s. - jamaican relations in recent months because of the golding government 's reluctance to extradite christopher coke to the united states , but in the aftermath of the jamaican government 's extradition , u.s. officials commended the golding government for its efforts . for additional information , see crs report rl33951 , u.s. trade policy and the caribbean : from trade preferences to free trade agreements , and crs report r41215 , latin america and the caribbean : illicit drug trafficking and u.s. counterdrug programs .
using federally appropriated funds to procure commodities for international food aid in countries with emergency needs or in nearby countries is a controversial issue . in budget submissions for fy2006-fy2009 , the bush administration proposed allocating up to 25 % of the funds available for u.s. food aid ( title ii of p.l . 480 , or the food for peace act ) to local or regional procurement ( lrp ) of food aid commodities . each time congress rejected the proposal . the administration argued that lrp would increase the timeliness and effectiveness of the u.s. response to overseas food emergencies by eliminating the need to transport commodities by ocean carriers . congressional and other critics of the local procurement proposal maintain that allowing non - u.s. commodities to be purchased would undermine the coalition of commodity groups , agribusinesses , private voluntary organizations , and shippers that participate in and support the u.s. food aid program and would reduce the volume of u.s. commodities provided as aid . the united states is alone in providing practically all of its international food aid in the form of its own commodities . u.s. food aid legislation precludes the provision of any but u.s. commodities to meet international food aid needs . the foreign assistance act ( p.l . 87-195 ) , however , permits the use of some u.s. funds for lrp as part of the u.s. response to international disasters . the european union provides almost all of its food aid via the united nations world food program ( wfp ) in the form of cash ; canada 's food aid also is cash - based . the wfp has been using donor funding to procure commodities locally or regionally in developing countries for more than 30 years . several recent studies have evaluated the timeliness and cost - effectiveness of lrp versus commodity donations and conclude that lrp in sub - saharan africa ( ssa ) costs substantially less than shipping food aid from the united states to africa and that food aid delivery times are substantially shorter . the studies point to risks associated with lrp , including lack of reliable suppliers , poor infrastructure , weak legal systems , donor funding delays , and quality ( i.e . , food safety or nutrition ) considerations , that could impede the efficiency of lrp . on the other hand , the studies suggest that risks associated with lrp are no greater than risks associated with in - kind donations and that they could likely be countered with better market intelligence and effective management of lrp activities . one study suggests that in many food deficit situations , lrp may not be a feasible option . inadequate local supplies or adverse market effects on producers or consumers in a country or region could rule out using lrp . the u.s. department of agriculture has begun implementation of the pilot lrp program established in the 2008 farm bill ( p.l . 110-246 ) . separately , the u.s. agency for international development is implementing lrp activities with funds appropriated in an fy2008 supplemental appropriations act ( p.l . 110-252 ) . in addition , the wfp has initiated a purchase for progress ( p4p ) program that will evaluate how small farmers in developing countries can participate in wfp procurement . the fy2010 foreign operations appropriation ( p.l . 111-117 ) includes funds in international disaster assistance appropriations that could be used to fund lrp and food - security - related activities such as cash vouchers or cash transfers for purchasing food . in addition , p.l . 111-117 directs that $ 1.17 billion of development assistance be allocated to agricultural development and food security efforts . proposed legislation , s. 384 and h.r . 3077 , would authorize a $ 500 million appropriation , separate from p.l . 480 food aid , for responding rapidly to emergency food needs , including with lrp . the fy2010 agriculture appropriations bill ( p.l . 111-80 ) provides $ 1.7 billion to finance provision of u.s. commodities under p.l . 480 .
the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 ( egtrra ; p.l . 107-16 ) , among other tax cuts , provided for a gradual reduction and elimination of the estate tax . under egtrra , the estate tax exemption rose from $ 675,000 in 2001 to $ 3.5 million in 2009 , and the rate fell from 55 % to 45 % . in 2010 , the estate tax was eliminated . the estate tax changes , however , were scheduled to sunset in 2011 , when the exemption would have become $ 1 million ( as scheduled in pre - egtrra law ) and the tax rate would return to 55 % . there was general agreement that some sort of estate tax would be retained . a proposal to make the 2009 rules ( $ 3.5 million exemption and 45 % rate ) permanent was included in president obama 's 2010 and 2011 budget outlines and was passed by the house in december 2009 ( h.r . 4154 ) . senate democratic leaders supported the plan to enact the 2009 rules permanently ( and make them retroactive to 2010 ) . the senate republican leadership proposed a $ 5 million exemption and 35 % rate . this latter provision was adopted for a two - year period , through 2012. at that point the exemption will revert to the pre - egtrra law . for estates of decedents in 2010 , either the 2010 or 2011 rules can be elected . spouses can inherit unused exemptions . with any of the exemption levels , few estates are affected by the tax . in 2011 , the shares of estates taxed are projected by one study to be 1.76 % , 0.25 % , and 0.14 % for the exemption levels of $ 1 million , $ 3.5 million , and $ 5 million , respectively . these numbers would grow to 3 % , 0.46 % , and 0.23 % by 2019. the revenue yield in 2011 is projected to be $ 34.4 billion , $ 18.2 billion , and $ 11.4 billion for the $ 1 million exemption / 55 % rate , $ 3.5 million exemption / 45 % rate , and the $ 5 million exemption / 35 % rate . the estate tax accounts for a small share of revenue . the estate tax is a highly progressive tax ; it not only applies to the largest estates , but within the distribution of estates a large share is concentrated in the over $ 20 million estate level : 72 % for the $ 5 million / 35 % rate . because of exclusions , the effective tax rates are smaller than the statutory rate , with an average of 14 % for the $ 5 million exemption / 35 % rate . when distributed with respect to income , 96 % falls in the top quintile of the income distribution , 72 % in the top 1 % , and 42 % in the top 0.1 % , under the $ 3.5 million exemption / 45 % rate . although concerns have been raised about the effects of the tax on small businesses and farmers , estimates indicate that the share of estate taxes paid by small business estates under the proposed revisions would be small ( 16 % to 18 % ) and the share of estates of small business owners taxed is small ( about 0.2 % of decedents with at least 50 % of their assets in businesses ) . evidence suggests that the number of returns with inadequate liquid assets to pay the estate tax is negligible . other effects are likely small . the effects on savings are uncertain but likely small relative to the economy because the tax is small . moving to either the $ 3.5 million plan or the $ 5 million plan would be projected to decrease charitable contributions by a small amount : 1 % to 2 % . recent evidence suggests that the costs of administration and compliance are around 7 % of revenues . structural reforms that might be considered are inheritance of spousal exemptions , and some reforms directed at abuses . a provision to restrict grantor retained annuity trusts ( grats ) , which can be used to virtually eliminate estate tax by providing an annuity with a remainder , is contained in h.r . 4849. other provisions in president obama 's budget outline include restricting discounts for estates left to family partnerships and conforming fair market value for purposes of the estate tax and future capital gains realizations for heirs .
preferential trade agreements ( ptas ) comprise a variety of arrangements that favor member parties over nonmembers by extending tariff and other nontariff preferences . ptas , particularly free trade agreements ( ftas ) , have proliferated in recent years . in the post - war period , the european union ( eu ) , which is a pta itself , has developed the largest network of ptas in the world . the main findings of this report are as follows . historically , europe 's ptas have differed among its partners in terms of provisions and commitments and they have been characterized by relatively modest ambition in terms of market - opening . in comparison , the u.s. approach has been more standardized in terms of its provisions and more focused on achieving reciprocal market access . these differences in approaches , however , have significantly narrowed since the eu adopted its more commercially oriented global europe strategy in 2006. eu ptas cover nearly twice as much trade ( exports ) in percentage terms ( 70 % versus 40 % ) and seven times as much in value terms ( $ 3.4 trillion versus $ 0.52 trillion ) than u.s. ptas . these numbers can be used to support the argument that u.s. firms may face more discrimination and possibly reduced sales than eu firms . at the same time , the data may overstate the degree of discrimination because the amount of trade covered by ptas is not the same as the amount of trade conducted on a preferential ( duty - free ) basis . concerns about trade discrimination have been a factor in u.s. and eu efforts to negotiate and implement separate but similar ptas with five trading partners ( israel , mexico , morocco , chile , and jordan ) . based on market share data analyzed , neither side appears to have gained a competitive advantage from having negotiated a pta . this , however , does not mean that individual firms and workers have not benefitted or that exports have not risen at faster rates after the pta became effective . in the past , europe 's pta program has not been a major factor affecting u.s. fta policy , which currently is in flux . however , europe 's recently completed fta with south korea raises the concern that u.s. exports will be disadvantaged due to the duty - free price advantage european - based producers will gain in the korean market . the united states has also negotiated an fta with korea , which awaits approval in korea parliament ( congress approved the agreement in 2011 ) . ongoing negotiations between the eu and canada over a comprehensive fta could also affect the u.s. fta debate . if a robust agreement is reached , the eu and the united states would then both have ftas with canada and mexico , making the absence of a fta between the united states and eu all the more glaring after years of discussion . it is not clear where europe 's pta policy is headed . there are only a few remaining major developed countries that fall outside the eu 's network of ptas , including the united states , china , japan , russia and australia . while pta negotiations with these countries could yield large economic benefits and provide a big impact ( for good or ill ) on the world trading system , some of these countries would likely demand liberalization of european agriculture and services , areas where there is widespread opposition in europe .
as the debate on reducing greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) has progressed , increasing concern has been raised about how a u.s. reduction program would interact with those of other countries . in a global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do not — i.e . , differentiated global carbon policies — the potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis - à - vis countries without comparable policies . the risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies , in the absence of similar policies among competing nations , have been central to debates on whether the united states should enact greenhouse gas legislation . specifically , concerns have been raised that if the united states adopts a carbon control policy , industries that must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passed - through by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share ( and jobs ) to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies . in addition , this potential shift in production could result in some of the u.s. carbon reductions being counteracted by increased production in less regulated countries ( commonly known as `` carbon leakage '' ) . there are three basic approaches , which are not mutually exclusive , to assist greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries : ( 1 ) directly supporting domestic industries ; ( 2 ) penalizing foreign competitors ; and ( 3 ) developing alternative sectoral approaches . importantly , these are presumably transitional actions , pending some international agreement that `` levels the playing field . . each approach has its own focus . support for domestic industries , embodied in most legislative proposals , is focused on preserving the industry 's current competitive position and jobs and may , depending on the details , help transition that industry to the future . it does not directly promote an international agreement . trade measures levied against foreign competitors , another approach being proposed , may provide a stick for international negotiation , but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gas - intensive , trade - exposed industries from `` unfair '' competition — producers in countries not imposing comparable carbon control policies . finally , the sectoral approach represents a range of options focused on integrating developing countries ' industrial base into a mutually acceptable international framework that provides a level playing field for all participants . whether any of these approaches would have any appreciable effect on carbon leakage is unclear . the design of an assistance program — the goals , eligible participants , implementation and enforcement — would be difficult to define in a manner that satisfies all parties . there is every incentive for any industry facing a cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished , thereby justifying special consideration by the government . the government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers , sometimes without access to important , but proprietary , data .
in march 2009 , a number of cases of an influenza - like illness and severe respiratory infections in humans were reported in parts of mexico . these cases were later confirmed to be a strain of influenza a ( h1n1 ) , commonly referred to as `` swine flu '' and later called 2009 h1n1 . by the end of april 2009 , confirmed human cases of 2009 h1n1 infection were reported throughout mexico , in parts of the united states , and in several countries worldwide . reports of the outbreak — coupled with the use of the initial moniker `` swine flu '' — initially caused a downturn in domestic and international pork markets . domestic pork demand and prices dropped sharply because of consumer fears that eating pork might result in infection . several pork - importing countries also began to institute trade bans and restrictions on live pig and pork imports from certain countries , including the united states . this initial reaction further rippled throughout pork and other agricultural markets , such as feed grain and other livestock markets , as market analysts attempted to speculate about the short - and long - term consequences of a decline in pork demand and prices . the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , the world health organization ( who ) , and the world organization for animal health ( oie ) confirm that there is no evidence that the 2009 h1n1 virus is transmitted by food and that humans can not get the illness from eating properly handled pork or pork products . four global organizations — who , oie , the world trade organization ( wto ) and the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) — also issued a joint statement that `` pork products handled in accordance with hygienic practices are not a source of infection . . despite these assurances from u.s. and global food and health organizations , several u.s. trading partners began to implement or were considering implementing full or partial trade restrictions on u.s. swine and pork products . administration officials and many in congress are strongly urging u.s. trading partners to base any food safety measures on scientific evidence and to act in accordance with their international obligations under the world trade organization ( wto ) , oie guidelines , and wto member obligations under the sanitary and phytosanitary ( sps ) agreement . oie , among other international organizations , has stated that there currently is no justification for imposing trade measures against the importation of pork and pork products . as some countries are continuing to pursue trade restrictions on north american pork products , some affected exporting countries are considering formal trade actions in the wto . in june 2009 , u.s. trade representative ( ustr ) reported that 16 u.s. trading partners had officially notified the united states of trade restrictions on swine and pork products ; usda reported that as many as 27 countries had imposed such trade restrictions . of these countries , the two largest in terms of their overall importance to u.s. pork markets , china and russia , account for an estimated with 15 % of the value of annual u.s. pork exports . both china and russia lifted their restrictions several months later , following negotiations with the united states . u.s. pork producers hope that efforts to avoid further negative effects on u.s. pork and other agricultural markets are successful . the national pork producers council ( nppc ) has asked usda to provide financial assistance for u.s. pork producers to address the general economic downturn in u.s. hog markets , including assistance to address issues regarding the h1n1 virus .
although the 11th recession of the postwar period officially ended in june 2009 , one economic indicator that is very visible in people 's daily lives — the unemployment rate — has continued to rise . with the unemployment rate at 9.8 % in november 2010 , those still employed or able to find jobs are quite likely to know personally others who have been less fortunate . the still high unemployment rate partly reflects the slow pace at which employers have been adding workers to their payrolls despite enactment of job creation legislation in february 2009 ( the american recovery and reinvestment act , p.l . 111-5 ) , march 2010 ( the hiring incentives to restore employment act , p.l . 111-147 ) , and august 2010 ( the education jobs fund at title i of the faa air transportation modernization and safety improvement act , p.l . 111-226 ) . this report addresses the question of when one might reasonably expect to see sustained improvement in the unemployment rate and a steady resumption of job growth following a recession 's end . it first provides an explanation of why it is unlikely that the unemployment rate would begin trending downward and the number of jobs on employer payroll would begin trending upward immediately after the start of a recovery . it then analyzes the trend in the unemployment rate and jobs data before and after the bottom of the prior 10 business cycles to confirm these statements . the report concludes by noting that the much delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to the ensuing rebounds of the economy being referred to as jobless recoveries . with employment at public and private sector employers similarly having failed to show consistent improvement for well over a year after the recession 's end , many observers think that the nation has been experiencing another jobless recovery .
energy is crucial to the operation of a modern industrial and services economy . concerns about the availability and cost of energy and about environmental impacts of fossil energy use have led to the establishment of a wide variety of federal incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency . these incentives are aimed at the implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and the development and commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies . many of the existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs have authorizations tracing back to the 1970s . many of the programs have been reauthorized and redesigned repeatedly to meet changing economic factors . the programs apply broadly to sectors ranging from industry to academia , and from state and local governments to rural communities . since 2005 , congress has enacted several major energy laws : the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact 2005 ; p.l . 109-58 ) ; the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( eisa ; p.l . 110-140 ) ; the energy improvement and extension act ( eiea ) , enacted as division b of the emergency economic stabilization act ( eesa ; p.l . 110-343 ) ; and the american recovery and reinvestment act ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) . each of those laws established , expanded , or modified energy efficiency and renewable energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment ( rdd & d ) programs . the department of energy ( doe ) operates the greatest number of efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs . the department of the treasury and the department of agriculture ( usda ) operate several programs . a few programs can also be found among the departments of the interior ( doi ) , labor ( dol ) , housing and urban development ( hud ) , and veterans affairs ( va ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) . this report describes federal programs that provide grants , loans , loan guarantees , and other direct or indirect incentives for energy efficiency , energy conservation , and renewable energy . for each program , the report provides the administering agency , authorizing statute ( s ) , annual funding , and the program expiration date . the appendixes provide summary information in a tabular format and also list recently expired programs .
the health care reform debate raises many complex issues including those of coverage , accessibility , cost , accountability , and quality of health care . underlying these policy considerations are issues regarding the status of health care as a constitutional or legal right . this report analyzes constitutional and legal issues pertaining to a right to health care , as well as the power of congress to enact and fund health care programs . the united states supreme court 's decision in nfib v. sebelius , which upheld most of the patient protection and affordable care act ( affordable care act / aca ) , is also discussed . the united states constitution does not set forth an explicit right to health care , and the supreme court has never interpreted the constitution as guaranteeing a right to health care services from the government for those who can not afford it . the supreme court has , however , held that the government has an obligation to provide medical care in certain limited circumstances , such as for prisoners . congress has enacted numerous statutes , such as medicare , medicaid , and the children 's health insurance program , that establish and define specific statutory rights of individuals to receive health care services from the government . as a major component of many health care entitlement statutes , congress has provided funding to pay for the health services provided under law . most of these statutes have been enacted pursuant to congress 's authority to `` make all laws which shall be necessary and proper '' to carry out its mandate `` to … provide for the … general welfare . . congress has also used other constitutional powers , such as its power to regulate interstate commerce and its power to levy taxes , to enact legislation relating to health insurance and health care . in 2010 , congress enacted the affordable care act , a comprehensive health care reform law which includes a requirement , effective in 2014 , that most individuals purchase health insurance , and which significantly expands the medicaid program . a number of lawsuits were filed challenging various provisions of this legislation , and , on june 28 , 2012 , the supreme court upheld the majority of aca 's provisions . significantly , the court upheld the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance as a valid exercise of congress ' taxing power , but the court limited congress ' power to spend for the general welfare by holding that congress can not threaten the states with the loss of all federal medicaid funds if the states decline to expand medicaid coverage as mandated by aca . in addition , several states have passed laws , amended their state constitutions , or entered into interstate compacts to attempt to `` nullify '' or `` opt out '' of the federal individual health insurance mandate and other federal health care provisions . direct conflicts between federal laws and state nullification statutes or state constitutional amendments would raise constitutional issues which are likely to be resolved in favor of federal law under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution . a number of state constitutions contain provisions relating to health and the provision of health care services . state constitutions may provide constitutional rights that are more expansive than those found under the federal constitution since federal rights set the minimum standards for the states .
two amendments to the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) were enacted as part of the usa patriot act . section 206 of the usa patriot act amended fisa to permit multipoint , or `` roving , '' wiretaps by adding flexibility to the degree of specificity with which the location or facility subject to electronic surveillance under fisa must be identified . section 215 enlarged the scope of materials that could be sought under fisa to include `` any tangible thing . . it also lowered the standard required before a court order may be issued to compel their production . a third amendment to fisa was enacted in 2004 , as part of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) . section 6001 ( a ) of the irtpa changed the rules regarding the types of individuals who may be targets of fisa - authorized searches . also known as the `` lone wolf '' provision , it permits surveillance of non - u.s. persons engaged in international terrorism without requiring evidence linking those persons to an identifiable foreign power or terrorist organization . in summer 2013 , media began reporting on several foreign intelligence activities conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) , including the bulk collection of telephone metadata under section 215 of the usa patriot act . after a one - day lapse in the expiring authorities , congress enacted the usa freedom act , which placed new limitations on the scope of the government 's foreign intelligence activities , while simultaneously extending the expired provisions through december 15 , 2019. although these provisions are set to sunset at the end of 2019 , grandfather clauses permit them to remain effective with respect to investigations that began , or potential offenses that took place , before the sunset date .
murder is a federal capital offense if committed in any of more than 50 jurisdictional settings . the constitution defines the circumstances under which the death penalty may be considered a sentencing option . with an eye to those constitutional boundaries , the federal death penalty act and related statutory provisions govern the procedures under which the death penalty may be imposed . some defendants are ineligible for the death penalty regardless of the crimes with which they are accused . children and those incompetent to stand trial may not face the death penalty ; pregnant women and the mentally retarded may not be executed . there is no statute of limitations for murder , and the time constraints imposed by the due process and speedy trial clauses of the constitution are rarely an impediment to prosecution . the decision to seek or forgo the death penalty in a federal capital case must be weighed by the justice department 's capital review committee and approved by the attorney general . defendants convicted of murder are death - eligible only if they are found at a separate sentencing hearing to have acted with life - threatening intent . among those who have , capital punishment may be imposed only if the sentencing jury unanimously concludes that the aggravating circumstances that surround the murder and the defendant outweigh the mitigating circumstances to an extent that justifies execution . the federal death penalty act provides several specific aggravating factors , such as murder of a law enforcement officer or multiple murders committed at the same time . it also permits consideration of any relevant `` non - statutory aggravating factors . . impact on the victim 's family and future dangerousness of the defendant are perhaps the most commonly invoked non - statutory aggravating factors . the jury must agree on the existence of at least one of the statutory aggravating factors if the defendant is to be sentenced to death . the federal death penalty act permits consideration of any relevant mitigating factor , and identifies a few , such as the absence of prior criminal record or the fact that a co - defendant , equally or more culpable , has escaped with a lesser sentence . the federal death penalty act recognizes other capital offenses that do not necessarily involve murder : treason , espionage , large - scale drug trafficking , and attempted murder to obstruct a drug kingpin investigation . the constitutional standing of these is less certain or at least different . this report is available in an abridged form as crs report r42096 , federal capital offenses : an abridged overview of substantive and procedural law , without the footnotes , attributions of authority , or quotations found here .
few issues in federal highway finance have raised such heated debate as how closely each state 's federal highway grants should match its highway users ' payments to the highway trust fund ( htf ) . this `` donor - donee '' state issue has been contentious during every reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs since 1982. it has again emerged during the congressional debate over reauthorization of the current highway funding program , the safe , accountable , flexible , efficient transportation equity act : a legacy for users ( safetea ; p.l . 109-59 ) , which has been extended through december 31 , 2011 . `` donor states '' are states whose highway users are estimated to pay more to the highway account of the highway trust fund than they receive . `` donee states '' receive more than they pay . traditionally , the donor states , located mainly in the south and midwest , have asserted that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in other parts of the country , especially in the northeast . donee state advocates have responded that some transportation needs are inherently federal rather than state , and that a national highway network can not be based solely on state or regional boundaries . although the argument continues , the facts on the ground have changed : federal highway administration figures indicate that for fy2007-fy2009 all 50 states were donee states , because outlays from the highway trust fund exceeded federal highway tax receipts in each year . this report examines the donor - donee issue in the context of the effort to reauthorize federal surface transportation programs . the main questions facing congress are the following : how can the donor - donee controversy be resolved amid efforts to reduce the federal deficit , given that the solution in the past was to give all states more money ? . how might the donor - donee issue be resolved if highway program spending were limited to the annual revenues flowing into the highway account of the htf ? . how can the donor - donee issue be resolved if highway spending over the next several years is restricted to the safetea baseline level ? . has the `` user pays '' principle , under which highway infrastructure is funded by taxes paid by the highway users who benefit from it , been violated and , if so , what are the implications for the `` equity '' of the distribution of federal highway spending ? . in recent years , congress has provided three transfers from the general fund totaling $ 29.7 billion to shore up the highway account . these general fund transfers to the htf are unrelated to highway taxes and thereby weaken the arguments for a guaranteed rate of return on each state 's highway tax payments to the htf . if highway user taxes were to be increased or the highway program budget cut to bring the revenues flowing into the htf into alignment with the funding flowing out , the case for a guaranteed rate of return would be strengthened .
the substance abuse and mental health services administration ( samhsa ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides federal funding to support community - based mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services . samhsa awards formula and competitive grants under its authorities in title v of the public health service act ( phsa ) . the agency also administers the $ 1.8 billion substance abuse prevention and treatment ( sapt ) block grant and the $ 420 million community mental health services ( cmhs ) block grant , both of which are authorized in phsa title xix . samhsa 's funding totaled almost $ 3.6 billion in fy2010 . the agency 's budget increased by 34 % from fy2000 to fy2010 . in real ( i.e . , inflation - adjusted ) dollars , however , the funding increase over that period was only 6 % . funding for samhsa 's two block grants , which together account for 62 % of the agency 's budget , has grown at a much slower pace than funding for its competitive grant programs . samhsa was reauthorized in 2000 , as part of the children 's health act ( p.l . 106-310 ) . the act amended samhsa 's existing authorities to give the agency more flexibility to direct mental health and substance abuse funding ; increased state flexibility to direct the use of block grant funds , creating several new competitive grant programs to expand mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents ; and authorized appropriations through fy2003 . it also added charitable choice provisions that allow faith - based organizations to compete for samhsa substance abuse funding without impairing their religious character . p.l . 106-310 required samhsa to submit two reports to congress , one on providing coordinated care to individuals with co - occurring mental illness and substance abuse , and the other on efforts to improve the flexibility and accountability of the block grants . comprehensive reauthorization has not occurred since 2000. however , several laws have further expanded the agency 's programs and activities in suicide prevention , underage drinking , and prescription drug abuse . the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-148 ) contained new authorizations for samhsa related to depression and behavioral health services for american indians and alaskan natives , as well as additional provisions related to mental health and substance abuse . while reauthorization has not moved out of committee , issues that may be of interest during the next reauthorization of samhsa include increased performance measurement and accountability for samhsa grants and programs , granting specific authority for the access to recovery program that provides vouchers for individuals to seek treatment services , improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response , requiring collaboration between samhsa and other federal agencies , increasing samhsa 's level of emphasis on primary prevention , increasing samhsa 's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce , and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute samhsa 's block grants . this report describes samhsa 's history , organization , authority , and programs , and analyzes some of the issues that may be considered by congress during a reauthorization of the agency . the appendixes include a table describing samhsa 's authorizations and appropriations , a table with samhsa 's funding from fy2000-fy2010 , a matrix of samhsa 's national outcome measures that aim to evaluate progress on substance abuse and mental health prevention and treatment indicators , and a list of samhsa resources .
congress and the executive , as well as outside organizations , have long been attentive to the evaluation of federal programs , with frequent interest paid to the independent status of the evaluator . this interest continues into the current era , with numerous illustrations of the multi - faceted approaches adopted and proposed . an evaluation may provide information at any stage of the policy process about how a federal government policy , program , activity , or agency is working . congress has required evaluations through legislation ( or requested these via its committee and member offices ) ; and the executive branch has pursued evaluations through presidential or agency directives . part of choosing how to carry out an evaluation involves deciding if some kind of `` independence '' would be a desirable attribute . observers often see independence as a means of avoiding or deterring bias and ensuring an objective , impartial assessment . in the context of evaluation , independence may apply to an evaluation or to an evaluator . on one hand , for example , the term may relate to independence of an evaluation from the policy preferences of an individual or group ( `` independent evaluation '' ) , perhaps by prohibiting political appointees from revising or evaluating a program . independence may refer to an entity that conducts evaluations that also is located outside the immediate organization responsible for policy implementation ( `` independent evaluator '' ) . there is some diversity of opinion regarding the definition of independence and how it might be ensured . for example , an evaluator 's `` external '' status , outside the organization that is implementing a program , does not necessarily equate with independence . nor would an evaluator 's `` internal '' status , inside the implementing organization , necessarily equate with a lack of independence for an evaluation ( e.g . , if an expert panel reviewed the internally produced evaluation for bias ) . there is varying opinion concerning when independence is necessary , or possibly counterproductive , and what value it may bring . the differences of opinion among definitions and perceived need notwithstanding , instances of independent program evaluators appear to be growing in number and variety at the federal level . this report focuses on examples of independent evaluators ( ies ) : when an evaluation is to be conducted by an entity outside the immediate organization that is responsible for policy implementation , and the entity also is intended to have one or more dimensions of independence . ies and similar constructs , however , vary across a number of characteristics and attributes : structure , jurisdiction , authority , resources , length of tenure , and specific duties and responsibilities . these differences , in turn , could affect their capabilities , effectiveness , and assistance to others , including their contributions to the oversight of a program or project by congress and the executive branch . after an overview of such entities — which encompass new units created specifically for conducting an evaluation as well as existing ones , such as the government accountability office and offices of the inspectors general — this report suggests possible broad characteristics and criteria of independent evaluators or similar units , which could be valuable in oversight or legislative endeavors . the appendix describes a number of such offices — past , present , and proposed — along with citations to relevant official documents and other materials for each example ( public laws , legislative proposals , executive branch directives , and secondary analyses ) . this report will be updated as conditions warrant .
an issue for congress and state and local governments is whether the pay and benefits of public workers are comparable to those of workers in the private sector . in addition , among the ways to reduce budget deficits , policy makers are considering the pay and benefits of public sector employees . the number of people employed in both the private and public sectors has increased steadily as the u.s. economy has grown . however , after increasing to 19.2 % of total employment in 1975 , the percentage of all jobs that are in the public sector fell to 15.7 % in 1999. in 2013 , public sector jobs accounted for 16.0 % of total employment . the recession that officially began in december 2007 and ended in june 2009 affected employment in both the private and public sectors . from 2007 to 2010 , the number of jobs in the private sector fell by an estimated 7.9 million , while the number of jobs in the public sector increased by almost 272,000. conversely , from 2010 to 2013 , private sector employment grew by approximately 6.7 million jobs , while public sector employment fell by about 626,000 jobs . reflecting the effects of the 2007-2009 recession on the budgets of state and local governments , from 2010 to 2013 , public sector employment as a share of total employment fell from 17.3 % to 16.0 % . among all full - time and part - time workers ages 16 and over , the number of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement has fallen in both the private and public sectors . the decline has been greater in the private sector . in 2009 , for the first time , a majority of workers who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement were employed in the public sector ( 8.7 million workers in the public sector , compared to 8.2 million private sector workers ) . by 2013 , the situation had reversed ; a slight majority of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement were employed in the private sector ( 8.1 million private sector workers , compared to 7.9 million public sector workers ) . in the federal government , except for the postal service and some smaller agencies , employees do not bargain over wages . among workers ages 18 to 64 who work full - time , differences in characteristics that may affect the relative pay and benefits of private and public sector workers include the following : age . reflecting the aging of the u.s. labor force , workers in both the private and public sectors have become older . nevertheless , employees in the public sector are older than private sector workers . in 2013 , 51.7 % of public sector workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 42.4 % of full - time private sector workers . federal workers are older than employees of state and local governments . in 2013 , 56.7 % of federal workers were between the ages of 45 and 64 , compared to 49.7 % of state employees and 52.1 % of employees of local governments . workers who have more years of work experience generally earn more than workers with less experience . gender . reflecting the increased participation of women in the labor force , the share of jobs held by women has increased in both the private and public sectors . in 2013 , women held almost three - fifths ( 57.7 % ) of full - time jobs in state and local governments . by contrast , women held approximately two - fifths of full - time jobs in the federal government and in the private sector ( 42.2 % and 41.7 % , respectively ) . education . on average , public sector employees have more years of education than private sector workers . in 2013 , 53.6 % of workers in the public sector had a bachelor 's , advanced , or professional degree , compared to 34.9 % of private sector workers . generally , workers with more years of education earn more than workers with less years of education . occupation . a larger share of public sector than private sector workers are employed in `` management , professional , and related occupations . . in 2013 , 56.2 % of public sector workers and 37.8 % of private sector workers were employed in these occupations . in part , more public sector workers were employed in these occupations because 25.7 % of all public sector workers were employed in `` education , training , and library '' occupations , compared to 2.3 % of all private sector workers . workers in management and professional occupations generally earn more than workers in other occupations . however , comparisons of the compensation of private and public sector workers that use broad occupational categories may miss differences between detailed occupations . many detailed occupations are concentrated in either the private or public sectors . nevertheless , many detailed occupations may require similar skills . union coverage . although the number of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the private sector than in the public sector , the percentage of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement is greater in the public sector than in the private sector . metropolitan area . private sector workers are more likely than federal workers to live in major metropolitan areas ( i.e . , areas with 5 million or more people ) .
the title i - a program of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind act ( nclb ; p.l . 107-110 ) , is the largest source of federal funding for elementary and secondary education . states that receive title i - a funding must comply with certain requirements related to measuring student achievement by using state - level standards and assessments . the standards and assessment requirements adopted in the nclb have resulted in vast growth in and demand for new types of assessment products . estimates of annual expenditures on nclb - required assessments range from $ 500 million to $ 900 million . the nclb authorized a new grant assessment program to help states pay the additional costs of meeting the expanded assessment requirements . the purpose of this report is to provide an understanding of the factors that influence the overall cost of student assessment and a description of state expenditures on assessment systems . this report describes factors that influence the cost of student assessment systems , including assessment development , scoring , and the effect of certain policy choices and implementation practices . it also reports and examines the results of existing research on state assessment expenditures , which highlight the variability among states in assessment expenditures . next , the report presents the results of an analysis of how state assessment expenditures differ across states of varying populations . results suggest that state assessment expenditures are dependent , in part , on a state 's population ; however , there are other factors that contribute to the overall cost of state assessment systems ( e.g . , design choices regarding assessment development and scoring ) . this report examines assessment issues that congress may address during the reauthorization of the esea . as congress considers reauthorization , it is likely that the standards and assessment provisions will be reviewed and debated . state assessments are currently the primary policy tool used to measure whether schools , leas , and states are meeting certain academic targets . as such , the effectiveness of federal policy is dependent upon a valid state assessment system . designing an assessment system requires states to consider certain tradeoffs in order to meet the federal assessment requirements while meeting state requirements and containing costs . decisions made in the design of a state assessment system have direct implications for the validity of the federal accountability system and direct consequences for schools . this report examines assessment practices that may be cost - effective and could be promoted by federal policy , including the following : the use of various scoring practices — such as distributed scoring , teacher scoring , and artificial intelligence — that may have the potential to lower the cost of state assessment systems while maintaining quality . the use of state consortia that promote information sharing and other collaborative practices across states that may reduce assessment costs by realizing economies of scale . the use of technology , which may increase the efficiency of assessment administration . as technology becomes less expensive , online delivery of state assessments may lower administration and scoring costs .
most federal employees ( 59.1 % ) are paid on the general schedule ( gs ) , a pay scale that consists of 15 pay grades in which an employee 's pay increases are to be based on performance and length of service . some members of congress , citizens , and public administration scholars have argued that federal employee pay advancement should be more closely linked to job performance than it currently is on the gs . with these concerns in mind and with explicit congressional authorization , the department of defense ( dod ) began developing the national security personnel system ( nsps ) in 2003 as a unique pay scale attempting to more closely link employee pay to job performance . nsps was beset by criticisms since it went into effect in 2006. the system faced legal and political challenges from unions and employees who claimed it was inconsistently applied and caused undeserved pay inequities , among other concerns . on october 7 , 2009 , house and senate conferees reported a version of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010 that included language to terminate nsps . on october 8 , 2009 , the house agreed to the conference report . the senate agreed to the conference report on october 22 , 2009. on october 28 , 2009 , the president signed the bill into law ( p.l . 111-84 ) . dod must now return employees currently enrolled in nsps to the gs or to the pay system that previously applied to them or their position . if the employee 's position did not exist prior to nsps or if the previous pay scale was abolished during nsps 's lifetime , dod must determine an appropriate pay scale for the employee . the return to the gs or other pay system must be completed by january 1 , 2012 , pursuant to the law . nsps was initially intended to cover all dod employees , but had a total final enrollment of roughly 227,000 dod employees or 31.7 % of the department 's 717,000-person workforce . in october 2010 , dod sent a report to congress that said 76 % ( 171,985 ) of employees formerly in the nsps pay system had been converted to the gs . of those employees who moved into the gs , 72 % ( 124,200 ) received a pay raise when they were placed in the proper gs grade and step . employees who have not yet been transitioned out of nsps are to be placed in pay scales other than the gs . as of january 2011 , roughly 54,000 dod employees remain in nsps . p.l . 111-84 included language preventing any employee from suffering a loss or decrease in pay as a result of the elimination of nsps . pursuant to statute , 35,117 employees who transitioned to gs have been placed on `` retained pay , '' which allows them to maintain their nsps rate of pay instead of transitioning to the gs pay rate assigned to their job 's grade . in such cases , the gs rate of pay assigned to the employee 's position may not reach the pay level the employee achieved under nsps . retained pay , pursuant to statute , requires that an employee receive half of the annual pay adjustment given to employees who are at the maximum payable rate for their gs grade ( step 10 ) . some nsps employees may argue that the cap on their annual pay increase amounts to a loss in pay , and , therefore , violates p.l . 111-84. the 112th congress may choose to continue congressional oversight of nsps employees ' transition to other pay systems . this report focuses on the transition of employees from nsps to non - nsps pay systems . it does not address the operation of nsps or other pay schedules . the report discusses how the transition is scheduled to occur and analyzes congressional options for oversight or legislative action .
concern has increased over the size and sustainability of the united states ' recent budget deficits and the country 's long - run budget outlook . this concern has brought the issues of the government 's revenue needs and fundamental tax reform to the forefront of congressional debates . congress may choose to address these issues by reforming the set of tax benefits for homeowners . according to the joint committee on taxation , federally provided tax benefits for homeowners will cost approximately $ 136.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2017. reducing , modifying , or eliminating all or some of the current tax benefits for homeowners could raise a substantial amount of revenue , while simultaneously simplifying the tax code , increasing equity among taxpayers , and promoting economic efficiency . this report focuses on the two largest federal tax benefits available to homeowners — the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for state and local property taxes . while other tax benefits for homeowners exist , these two particular benefits are the most expensive in terms of forgone revenue to the federal government . between 2014 and 2017 the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction are estimated to cost around $ 77.3 billion and $ 31.5 billion annually . congress may therefore consider modifying these two tax benefits to raise revenue . the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction are also the two tax benefits proponents most often argue promote homeownership . economists , however , have questioned this claim . the analysis presented in this report is structured along two dimensions . first , the analysis focuses on the rationales commonly offered for providing tax benefits for homeowners , mainly that homeownership ( 1 ) bestows certain benefits on society as a whole such as higher property values , lower crime , higher civic participation , among others ; ( 2 ) is a means of promoting a more even distribution of income and wealth ; and ( 3 ) has a positive effect on living conditions , which can lead to a healthier population . although these benefits may exist , the analysis presented in this report highlights the difficulties that economists have encountered in attempting to establish their existence or magnitude . the analysis then turns to examining the effect that the mortgage interest deduction and state and local property tax deduction have on the homeownership rate , housing consumption , and the economy . the analysis in this report suggests that these tax incentives may have a larger effect on the size of homes purchased than on the decision to become a homeowner . the possibility that attempting to promote homeownership via the tax code may distort the allocation of capital and labor , which could hinder the performance of the economy in the short - run and long - run , is also raised . in the process of conducting the analysis , this report briefly summarizes the historical trends in homeownership and the more recent trends in foreclosures . the report concludes with policy options that congress may find useful as it moves forward , including proposals made by house ways and means chairman dave camp , president obama 's fiscal commission , president george w. bush 's tax reform panel , and the congressional budget office .
medicare is the nation 's health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons . medicare consists of four distinct parts : part a , or hospital insurance ( hi ) ; part b , or supplementary medical insurance ( smi ) ; part c , or medicare advantage ( ma ) ; and part d , the outpatient prescription drug benefit . the part a program is financed primarily through payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers ; these are credited to the hi trust fund . the part b program is financed through a combination of monthly premiums paid by current enrollees and general revenues . income from these sources is credited to the smi trust fund . beneficiaries can choose to receive all their medicare services , except hospice , through managed care plans under the ma program ; payment is made in appropriate parts from the hi and smi trust funds . a separate account in the smi trust fund accounts for the part d drug benefit ; part d is financed through general revenues , beneficiary premiums , and state contributions . the hi and smi trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that provides annual reports to congress . the 2014 report of the medicare board of trustees estimates that the hi trust fund will become insolvent in 2030 , four years later than it had predicted in the 2013 report . because of the way that it is financed , the smi fund can not face insolvency ; however , the trustees project that smi expenditures will continue to grow rapidly , and thus place increasing demands on medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers . additionally , unlike in prior years , the projections in the 2014 report assume that reductions in physician payment rates scheduled under current law will not occur , because these reductions have usually been overridden by congress . the trustees estimate that total medicare costs will increase from 3.5 % of gdp in 2013 to 6.9 % in 2088. although the medicare trustees report that the financial outlook for the medicare program appears to have improved as a result of changes made by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended ( aca , p.l . 111-148 ) , they caution that the projections in the report are somewhat uncertain , due to the potential for future expenditure reductions not to materialize . as it has done each year subsequent to the enactment of aca , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) office of the actuary issued a supplemental analysis that provides illustrative alternative projections based on the assumption that certain aca provisions affecting medicare provider payments will be phased out .
the affordable care act ( aca ) authorized many new discretionary grant programs and provided each one with an authorization of appropriations — typically through fy2014 or fy2015 — to carry them out . the aca also reauthorized funding for numerous existing programs with expired authorizations of appropriations , most of which were still receiving annual funding . the congressional budget office ( cbo ) estimated that fully funding the discretionary grant programs authorized ( or reauthorized ) by the aca , based on the amounts specified in the authorizations of appropriations , would result in appropriations of almost $ 100 billion over the period fy2012-fy2021 . however , the total amount of discretionary funding provided to date falls well below cbo 's estimate for two reasons . first , few of the new grant programs authorized by the aca have received any discretionary appropriations . second , programs that were reauthorized by the aca generally have received discretionary appropriations at levels well below the amounts authorized in the law . the aca included provisions intended to strengthen the health care safety net and improve access to care . for example , it permanently reauthorized the federal health center program and the national health service corps ( nhsc ) . the nhsc provides scholarships and student loan repayments to individuals who agree to a period of service as a primary care provider in a federally designated health professional shortage area . in addition , the aca addressed concerns about the current size , specialty mix , and geographic distribution of the health care workforce . it reauthorized and expanded existing health workforce education and training programs under titles vii and viii of the public health service act ( phsa ) . title vii supports the education and training of physicians , dentists , physician assistants , and public health workers through grants , scholarships , and loan repayment . the aca created several new programs to increase training experiences in primary care , in rural areas , and in community - based settings , and provided training opportunities to increase the supply of pediatric subspecialists and geriatricians . it also expanded the nursing workforce development programs authorized under phsa title viii . as part of a comprehensive framework for federal community - based public health activities , including a national strategy and a national education and outreach campaign , the aca authorized several new grant programs with a focus on preventable or modifiable risk factors for disease ( e.g . , sedentary lifestyle , tobacco use ) . the new law also leveraged a number of mechanisms to improve health care quality , including new requirements for quality measure development , collection , analysis , and public reporting ; programs to develop and disseminate innovative strategies for improving the quality of health care delivery ; and support for care coordination programs such as medical homes and the co - location of primary health care and mental health services . additionally , the aca authorized funding for programs to prevent elder abuse , neglect , and exploitation ; grants to expand trauma care services and improve regional coordination of emergency services ; and demonstration projects to implement alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving medical malpractice claims , among other provisions . the two agencies primarily responsible for implementing the aca 's expansion of insurance coverage and its revenue provisions — the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) and the internal revenue service ( irs ) — have requested an increase in their annual appropriations in each of the past five years ( i.e . , fy2013-fy2017 ) to help cover these costs . but congress has not provided the agencies with any additional discretionary funding for aca implementation . cms , in particular , has relied on funding from a variety of other sources to support these activities .
delegations from more than 190 countries and regions meet from november 28 to december 9 , 2011 , in durban , south africa , to continue discussions of how to address climate change under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) . the year 2012 will mark both the 20th anniversary of the opening for signature of the unfccc in rio de janeiro in 1992 and the end of the first `` commitment period '' ( 2008-2012 ) of the unfccc 's subsidiary kyoto protocol . in 2010 , the conference of the parties ( cop ) to the unfccc adopted a set of decisions referred to as the `` cancun agreements . . these embody pledges to abate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions made by all major emitting parties ; reporting and review systems to ensure `` transparency '' of implementation ; a new green climate fund and a technology mechanism ; and restatement of pledges by the wealthiest countries to mobilize financing for adaptation , mitigation , technology , and capacity - building : pledges approaching $ 30 billion during 2010-2012 , and a goal of approaching $ 100 billion annually by 2020. parties agreed that funding would come from public and private , bilateral and multilateral , and alternative sources . the most vulnerable developing countries have priority for the 2010-2012 funds . parties meeting in durban , south africa , will seek agreements that would clarify and carry out the cancun agreements . the dialogues particularly regard any second commitment period of the kyoto protocol , establishment of the green climate fund and technology mechanism ; and guidelines for the reporting and review mechanisms . this report provides context for the discussions that will ensue in the durban conference , then outlines the main issues and expectations for decisions by the parties . many see agreement on a new commitment period for ghg abatement under the kyoto protocol as key to almost all other decisions . notably , delegations from china , india , and some other middle - income countries say they will not discuss their own possible ghg abatement commitments until the highest - income `` annex i '' parties meet their existing commitments and sign up to further reductions under the kyoto protocol . on the other hand , canada , japan , and russia have stated they will not offer ghg reductions except in an agreement that includes legally binding commitments from all major emitters ( including china , the united states , and others ) . the united states , which declined to ratify the kyoto protocol , has no quantitative and binding ghg commitments . the absence of commitments from the top three global ghg emitters ( china , the united states , and india ) is a matter of consternation among many delegations . in durban , the parties may agree on rules to establish the climate green fund , the standing committee on finance , the adaptation committee , the technology committee , and clean technology centre , and additional decisions to promote mitigation of greenhouse gases and adaptation to impacts of climate change . a proposal exists , but seems unlikely to be adopted , to set a mandate to negotiate by 2015 a new global agreement that would take effect by 2020 .
in response , in part , to overall growth in medicare program expenditures and growth in expenditures per medicare beneficiary , the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) created the independent payment advisory board ( ipab , or the board ) and charged the board with developing proposals to `` reduce the per capita rate of growth in medicare spending . . the secretary of health and human services ( the secretary ) is directed to implement the board 's proposals automatically unless congress affirmatively acts to alter the board 's proposals or to discontinue the automatic implementation of such proposals . the annual ipab sequence of events begins each year , starting april 30 , 2013 , with the chief actuary of the centers for medicare & medicaid services calculating a medicare per capita growth rate and a medicare per capita target growth rate . if the chief actuary determines that the medicare per capita growth rate exceeds the medicare per capita target growth rate , the chief actuary would establish an applicable savings target — the amount by which the board must reduce future spending . this determination by the chief actuary also triggers a requirement that the board prepare a proposal to reduce the growth in the medicare per capita growth rate by the applicable savings target . the board can not ration care , raise premiums , increase cost sharing , or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility . in generating its proposals , the board is directed to consider , among other things , medicare solvency , quality and access to care , the effects of changes in payments to providers , and those dually eligible for medicare and medicaid . if the board fails to act , the secretary is directed to prepare a proposal . board proposals must be submitted to the secretary by september 1 of each year and to the president and congress by january 15 of the following year . board proposals are `` fast - tracked '' in congress , and ipab proposals go into force automatically unless congress affirmatively acts to amend or block them within a stated period of time and under circumstances specified in the act . section 3403 ( d ) of the act establishes special `` fast track '' parliamentary procedures governing house and senate committee consideration , and senate floor consideration , of legislation implementing the board or secretary 's proposal . these procedures differ from the parliamentary mechanisms the chambers usually use to consider most legislation and are designed to ensure that congress can act promptly on the implementing legislation should it choose to do so . ppaca also established a second `` fast track '' parliamentary mechanism for consideration of legislation discontinuing the automatic implementation process for the recommendations of the board . the board 's charge is to develop proposals for the secretary to implement that reduce the per capita growth in medicare expenditures , not to reduce medicare expenditures . therefore , while the cbo projects that the cumulative impact of the board 's recommendations from 2015 through 2019 will reduce total spending by $ 15.5 billion , during the same period , medicare expenditures will total $ 3.9 trillion with average spending per beneficiary forecast to increase from $ 13,374 to $ 15,749 . while the board 's potential impact on total expenditures is likely to be relatively small compared to overall medicare expenditures , its impact on particular medicare providers or suppliers may be significant , particularly if the board alters payment mechanisms . the president 's fy2013 budget , as submitted to congress on february 13 , 2012 , includes a proposal to strengthen the ipab . on march 22 , 2012 , the house passed a combined version of the help efficient , accessible , low - cost , timely healthcare ( health ) act of 2011 ( h.r . 5 ) that contained provisions from h.r . 452 , the medicare decisions accountability act of 2011 , which would repeal the ipab .
congress created the section 1603 grant program as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) . this program , administered by the u.s. department of the treasury , provides cash grant incentives for renewable energy projects . initially , the section 1603 grant program was scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. a one - year extension was enacted as part of the tax relief , unemployment reauthorization , and job creation act of 2010 ( p.l . 111-312 ) at an estimated cost of $ 3 billion . absent congressional action , the section 1603 grant program will expire at the end of 2011. as of december 6 , 2010 , grants totaling approximately $ 5.6 billion had been awarded to 1,495 entities , since section 1603 became law in february 2009. wind has received approximately 84 % of the grant award value , while solar electric represents approximately 75 % of entities that have received grant awards . `` other '' technologies ( qualifying energy property not represented by wind or solar electricity ) have also received grant awards , although the value and number of awards represented by this category is relatively small compared to wind and solar electricity . prior to the availability of section 1603 grants , qualifying renewable energy projects were federally supported primarily through the production tax credit ( ptc ) or investment tax credit ( itc ) . it has been common industry practice for renewable energy developers to partner with tax - equity investors , where the tax - equity investors offer cash in exchange for project ownership , project cash flows , tax credits , and depreciation benefits . the section 1603 grant program was motivated by difficult economic conditions and the perceived lack of tax - equity capacity to support renewable energy projects . analysis of the tax equity marketplace reveals fluctuations in the dollar volume , number of participants , and required rates of return between 2007 and 2010. market response , since section 1603 was established , has been mixed . the solar industry had a record year of installations in 2010 ( 887 megawatts ) and is forecasting another record year in 2011 ( approximately 1,700 megawatts ) . in 2010 , the wind industry experienced a 50 % decline compared to 2009 ( approximately 5 gigawatts installed in 2010 compared to 10 gigwatts installed in 2009 ) . wind industry forecasts for 2011 are approximately 7,000 megawatts . it is important to note , however , that many factors influence annual renewable energy installations , the cash grant being just one . if congress considers additional extensions to or modifications of the section 1603 grant program , economic and cost factors may also be taken into account . grants , as opposed to tax credit , may be a more efficient mechanism for delivering public funds to the renewable energy sector . as is the case with most tax or subsidy programs , however , there are concerns that grants may be going to projects that would have moved forward without added federal incentives . finally , this report presents various policy options congress may want to consider regarding the section 1603 grant and related tax credits for renewable energy . the first option presented is to allow the grant program to expire . even if the grant program were to expire , tax incentives would remain available . a second option is to extend the section 1603 grant program . an extension of the grant program may be considered alongside an extension of the ptc for wind , which is set to expire at the end of 2012. a modification to the itc and ptc , which could potentially enhance the benefits associated with the existing tax incentives , is presented as a third option .
both the house and senate have internal rules encouraging the separation of money and policy decisions . these rules bar legislative provisions from being included in general appropriations measures under most circumstances . limitations within appropriations measures are provisions that negatively restrict the amount , purpose , or availability of funds without changing existing law . the effect of these provisions is to limit the actions for which funds may be used through the capping or outright denial of funds . limitations are distinct from legislative provisions , which have the effect of either making new law or changing existing law . this distinction has been developed and refined over time based on various rulings establishing what type of language is allowable . the procedural contexts within the house and senate for the consideration of limitations on the floor differ in three significant ways . first , although legislative provisions are generally not allowed under the rules of the house , the rules of the senate do allow exceptions under some circumstances . second , house rule xxi designates a particular process for the consideration of limitation amendments , but the senate has no specific procedures relating to such provisions . third , although house rule xxii bans legislative language within conference reports , senate rules contain no such prohibition . there are two forms in which limitations regularly occur . the first form places a total ban on the use of funds by stipulating that none of the funds in the account or bill can be used for a certain purpose . the second form , sometimes referred to as a `` not to exceed '' limitation , provides that the use of funds is not to exceed a specific amount or percentage of total funds for a certain account , item , activity , agency , or bill but does not change existing law . limitations that prohibit the use of funds for certain purposes have been used to prevent federal funding for specific activities , a class of recipients , or to prohibit funding for earmarks . `` not to exceed '' limitations have been used to establish funding ceilings for certain activities or total funding amounts . both types of limitations also have been used to restrict the availability of funds for transfer . limitations and legislative provisions are distinguished both by structure and substance . with respect to structure , a limitation must be phrased as a negative funding prohibition . for substance , a limitation must not effectively waive current law , alter agency discretion , impose new duties upon the official or agency , or provide funding based upon a contingency . additionally , whether the recipient of the funds can be considered `` federal '' and , in the house , if the subject matter of the limitation involves taxes or tariffs , can determine the admissibility of this type of provision . when a limitation provision has been the subject of a point of order , the burden of proof is on its proponent to demonstrate that the restrictions exist within current law or that the new provision does not effectively change agency discretion or impose new duties .
the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l . 111-203 ) substantially overhauled the u.s. financial regulatory system . title x of the dodd - frank act , the consumer financial protection act ( cfp act ) , established the bureau of consumer financial protection ( cfpb or bureau ) within the federal reserve system . the cfp act alters the consumer financial protection landscape by consolidating regulatory authority and , to a lesser extent , supervisory and enforcement authority in one regulator — the cfpb . the cfp act empowers the bureau through : the transfer of existing consumer protection powers from other federal regulators ( `` transferred powers '' or `` transferred authorities '' ) ; and the establishment of enhanced consumer protection authorities that were not explicitly provided by law to federal regulators prior to the dodd - frank act 's enactment ( `` newly established powers '' or `` newly established authorities '' ) . the bureau 's transferred authorities will include the power to prescribe regulations under 18 federal consumer protection laws , such as the truth in lending act , as well as certain consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over some large banks and other depository institutions ; its newly established powers will include consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over certain non - depository financial institutions , such as payday lenders and mortgage brokers . not all of the cfpb 's powers become effective at the same time . some of the bureau 's authorities took effect when the dodd - frank act was signed into law on july 21 , 2010. however , most of the bureau 's authorities will go into effect on the `` designated transfer date '' — a date six to 18 months after enactment , as determined by the secretary of the treasury ( secretary ) . currently , the designated transfer date is july 21 , 2011. in addition to the effective dates set out in the cfp act , the authority to exercise the bureau 's powers may be affected by the appointment of a cfpb director . the bureau is designed to be headed by a single director , who is to be nominated by the president and subject to the advice and consent of the senate . if a director is appointed before the designated transfer date , he will be able to exercise all of the powers provided to the bureau pursuant to the cfp act . however , a bureau director has not yet been appointed . until a cfpb director is appointed , the cfp act provides the secretary the authority to exercise some , but not all of the bureau 's authorities . although not beyond debate , the cfp act appears to provide the secretary the authority to exercise the bureau 's transferred powers , but not the authority to exercise the bureau 's newly established powers . in practice , the limits of the secretary 's authorities may not always be clear . the actions taken thus far by the bureau predominately have been either administrative functions or measures taken in preparation for the exercise of the substantive authorities that will go into effect on the designated transfer date . these actions appear to fall within the secretary 's limited bureau authorities . the secretary 's interim bureau powers arguably will be more expansive after the designated transfer date if a bureau director has not yet been appointed . this expansion of power would increase the likelihood that the bureau would move beyond administrative and preparatory steps to engaging in substantive actions that directly , and potentially significantly , impact financial institutions . parties claiming harm from these potential actions might be inclined to initiate lawsuits arguing that certain actions exceed the secretary 's authority . outcomes of such lawsuits are difficult to predict in the abstract , in part , because of the innumerable facts and circumstances that could give rise to these legal claims .
sentencing for all serious federal noncapital crimes begins with the federal sentencing guidelines . congress establishes the maximum penalty and sometimes the minimum penalty for every federal crime by statute . in between , the guidelines establish a series of escalating sentencing ranges based on the circumstances of the offense and the criminal record of the offender . the guidelines do so using a score - keeping procedure . the guidelines process involves : i. identification of the most appropriate guidelines section for the crime ( s ) of conviction , based on the nature of the offense ( the most commonly applicable are noted in the guidelines index ) ii . identification of the applicable base offense level indicated by the section iii . addition / subtraction of offense levels per section instructions for the circumstances in the case at hand iv . addition / subtraction of offense levels per instructions in those chapters of the guidelines relating to a. victim related matters b. role in the offense c. obstruction d. multiple counts e. acceptance of responsibility v. calculation of the criminal history score vi . consideration of departures ( more / less severe treatment ) which the guidelines permit vii . application guidelines instructions relating to a. imprisonment ( sentencing table ) b. probation c. supervised release d. special assessments e. fines f. restitution g. forfeiture viii . sentencing of organizations ix . deviation based on the sentencing principles in 18 u.s.c . 3553 ( a ) . this is an abridged version of a longer report entitled to crs report r41696 , how the federal sentencing guidelines work : a brief overview , without the footnotes , attribution , citations , or full content found in the longer report .
expanded investment in clean and renewable energy resources continues to be a policy priority of the obama administration and an area of interest to the 112th congress . in recent years , the primary policy vehicle for promoting investment in renewable energy has been tax credits , particularly the renewable energy investment and production tax credits . a lack of tax liability , however , has limited the renewable energy sector 's ability to fully take advantage of these and other tax benefits . the result has been an increased interest in exploring other options for promoting investment in renewable energy . one option might be to allow renewable energy entities access to the master limited partnership ( mlp ) business organizational form . an mlp is a type of business structure that is taxed as a partnership , but whose ownership interests are traded on financial markets like corporate stock . being treated as a partnership for tax purposes implies that mlp income is generally subject to only one layer of taxation in contrast to publically traded c corporations , which are subject to two layers of taxation . the ability to access equity markets in a manner similar to corporations allows mlp to obtain greater amounts of capital . access to a greater pool of capital , when combined with the favorable partnership tax treatment , may allow mlps to secure capital at a lower cost than similar businesses operating under a different organizational structure . the lower cost of capital , in turn , could increase investment in the renewable energy sector . congress first established rules relating to mlps in the 1980s . at that time , the mlp structure was limited to businesses deriving 90 % of their income from primary sources , which included dividends , interest , rents , capital gains , and mining and natural resources income . effectively , this definition allowed oil and gas extraction and transportation activities access to the mlp structure , while renewable energy resources were generally excluded . the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-343 ) expanded the definition of income from qualifying sources to include transportation of certain renewable and alternative fuels , such as ethanol and biodiesel . provisions enacted under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra ; p.l . 111-5 ) enhanced the value of certain renewable energy tax credits for many renewable energy projects . by transforming existing tax credits into cash grants , the section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits program enhanced access to capital for many in the renewable energy sector . the section 1603 grant program is scheduled to expire at the end of 2011. as congress evaluates other policies to attract additional capital to the renewable energy sector , allowing renewable energy entities to structure as mlps might be one option . extending the mlp structure to renewables could possibly attract additional capital to and stimulate investment in the renewable energy sector . there are , however , a number of potential policy concerns to consider . first , expanding access to the mlp structure could narrow the corporate tax base , which is one of the reasons access to this structure was limited in the first place . second , if changes to the tax code allowing renewable entities to access the mlp structure are enacted alongside changes to current passive activity loss rules , there may be concerns about the possibility of renewable energy investments being used as a tax shelter . finally , if the concern is that renewable entities are disadvantaged relative to fossil fuels currently able to use the mlp structure , one option would be to prevent other energy entities from structuring as mlps .
a small group of developing countries are transforming the global economic landscape . led by china , india , and brazil , these rising economic powers pose varied challenges and opportunities for u.s. economic interests and leadership of the global economy . they also raise significant policy issues for congress , including the future direction of u.s. trade policy and negotiations , as well as for the multilateral economic institutions that have historically served as the foundation of an open and rules - based global economy . this report addresses ongoing shifts in global trade and finance and projected future trends resulting from the emergence of these economies . it is the first of a three - part crs series that focuses on how the rising economic powers are affecting u.s. interests and raising challenges for congressional oversight of u.s. international trade and financial policies . the major trends in the global economy identified and discussed in this report are : the balance of global economic power is shifting from the united states and europe to a number of fast - growing and large developing countries . these economies account for rising shares of global gdp , manufacturing , and trade , including a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries ( south - south trade ) . these shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies , particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries . rising economic powers are becoming more important players in international finance . they have increased holdings of foreign exchange reserves , established sovereign wealth funds , borrowed capital from international capital markets , and attracted substantial foreign investment . their multinational corporations , many state - owned , are investing assets globally and are competing with u.s. firms for natural resources and access to other developing - country markets . the long - standing distinction between advanced and developing countries , particularly for rising economic powers , is blurring . the advanced countries may still be the richest countries in terms of per capita income , but their economies may no longer be the largest , the fastest - growing , or the most dynamic . rising economic powers are exerting greater influence in global trade and financial policies and in the multilateral institutions that have underpinned the global economy since world war ii . these developments , in turn , have implications for u.s. global leadership that are subject to debate . while the impact of the rising economic powers is considered by most economists to be strongly positive for the u.s. economy overall , not all groups of americans have benefitted equally . highly educated workers are seen gaining more job opportunities and higher wages than workers with less education . issues for congress on the international trade and finance policies raised by the changing global landscape could include : seizing full advantage of growing markets for u.s. manufacturers , service providers , agricultural producers , and their workers , including preparing for increased competition . the future direction of u.s. trade negotiations and the global trading system , as well as specific policies and issues raised by the global economy . these might include the increasing role of state - owned enterprises , access to developing country markets for services and government procurement , the future role of the dollar as the primary reserve currency , and u.s. participation in global supply chains , among other issues . the evolution of international frameworks for financial integration , as well as multilateral and bilateral frameworks for foreign direct investment and sovereign wealth funds . this report will be updated as events warrant .
considerable congressional attention has been placed on the dollar value of health insurance coverage in terms of out - of - pocket ( oop ) costs placed on policyholders . one method that lowers the dollar value of coverage is the use of annual limits on the dollar amount of coverage . private health insurers use annual limits to require the consumer to assume 100 % of the cost of coverage after a certain amount of spending for the year has been reached . while annual limits may be a benefit design feature in any type of health insurance , they are used as the primary method of cost control for limited benefit plans , which provide low premium coverage typically to low - income part - time or seasonal workers . limited benefit plans generally have annual limits on both the total dollar coverage and on specific coverage categories ( e.g . , hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries ) . without the limited benefit plan option , many of these low - income workers would likely be uninsured . on the other hand , these plans have been criticized as providing little value and giving a false sense of security to policyholders . the patient protection and affordable care act ( p.l . 111-148 , ppaca ) prohibits the use of annual limits effective 2014 and places certain restrictions on their use effective for plan years starting on or after september 23 , 2010. these restrictions would effectively eliminate limited benefit plans . accordingly , the secretary of health and human services has implemented a waiver process for limited benefit plans under the authority provided by section 1001 of ppaca to define restricted annual limits in such a way as to `` ensure that access to needed services is made available with a minimal impact on premiums . . considerable attention has been paid to the fairness and transparency of the waiver process . for context , it is relevant to note that congress has not consistently specified the manner in which information concerning health care waivers is to be released to the public . indeed , the annual limits provision of ppaca does not even have a specific public reporting requirement . as a result of different legal standards , or in some cases the absence of a congressional directive , no standardized practice for releasing information about health care waivers has ever been developed . with respect to the annual limits waivers , no obvious bias could be found in the publicly available application materials . moreover , the government accountability office found that the waivers were granted when an application projected a significant increase in premiums or significant reduction in access to health care benefits and not based on organizations factors ( e.g . , being a union ) .
thirty - five years of experience implementing and enforcing the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the law and led many to propose legislative changes to tsca 's core provisions . stakeholders appear to agree that tsca needs to be updated , although there is disagreement about the extent and nature of any proposed revisions . s. 847 in the 112th congress legislation would amend core provisions of tsca title i. this report compares key provisions of s. 847 , as introduced , with current law ( 15 u.s.c . 2601 et seq . ) . generally , s. 847 would increase the amount of information about chemical toxicity and usage that chemical manufacturers and processors would be required to submit to the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) , and would facilitate epa regulation of toxic chemicals . the bill directs epa to establish , by rule , varied or tiered minimum data set requirements for different chemical substances or categories of substances . data would be required from chemical manufacturers and processors for all chemicals within five years of the date of enactment of s. 847 , earlier for high - priority chemicals . all chemicals already in commerce are to be placed on a list and prioritized by epa into three groups based on the need for risk management . a chemical must be included in the highest priority class if it `` is , or is degraded and metabolized into , a persistent , bioaccumulative , and toxic substance with the potential for widespread exposure to humans or other organisms . . epa is required to determine whether chemicals in the top two priority classes , as well as all new chemicals , meet a stringent new safety standard , given the imposition of any needed restrictions on manufacture , processing , distribution , use , or disposal . the bill would prohibit any activities with respect to an evaluated chemical substance that the epa had not specifically allowed in the safety standard determination . in contrast , current law authorizes data collection from manufacturers only if exposure is expected to be substantial or if epa determines that a chemical may pose an unreasonable risk . tsca as currently written allows all chemicals to enter and remain in commerce unless epa can show that a chemical poses `` an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment . . epa then must regulate to control unreasonable risk , but only to the extent necessary using the `` least burdensome '' means of available control . this tsca standard has been interpreted to require cost - benefit balancing . s. 847 also would add new sections to tsca . of particular significance is a section authorizing actions that would allow u.s. implementation of three international agreements , which the united states has signed but not yet ratified . other new sections would provide authority for epa to support research in so - called `` green '' engineering and chemistry , promote alternatives to toxicity testing on animals , encourage research on children 's environmental health , and require biomonitoring of pregnant women and infants . a `` hot spots '' provision would require epa to identify locations where residents are disproportionately exposed to pollution and to develop strategies for reducing their risks . key provisions of s. 847 are compared with current law in tables 1 through 6 .
sentencing for all serious federal noncapital crimes begins with the federal sentencing guidelines . congress establishes the maximum penalty and sometimes the minimum penalty for every federal crime by statute . in between , the guidelines establish a series of escalating sentencing ranges based on the circumstances of the offense and the criminal record of the offender . the guidelines do so using a score - keeping procedure . the guidelines process involves : i. identification of the most appropriate guidelines section for the crime ( s ) of conviction , based on the nature of the offense ( the most commonly applicable are noted in the guidelines index ) ii . identification of the applicable base offense level indicated by the section iii . addition / subtraction of offense levels per section instructions for the circumstances in the case at hand iv . addition / subtraction of offense levels per instructions in those chapters of the guidelines relating to a. victim related matters b. role in the offense c. obstruction d. multiple counts e. acceptance of responsibility v. calculation of the criminal history score vi . consideration of departures ( more / less severe treatment ) which the guidelines permit vii . application guidelines instructions relating to a. imprisonment ( sentencing table ) b. probation c. supervised release d. special assessments e. fines f. restitution g. forfeiture viii . sentencing of organizations ix . deviation based on the sentencing principles in 18 u.s.c . 3553 ( a ) . this report is available in an abridged version entitled crs report r41697 , how the federal sentencing guidelines work : an abridged overview .
the united states has seen continued growth of electronic card payments ( and a simultaneous decrease in check payments ) . from 2009 through 2012 , debit card transactions have outpaced other payment forms . when a consumer uses a debit card in a transaction , the merchant pays a `` swipe '' fee , which is also known as the interchange fee . the interchange fee is paid to the card - issuing bank ( i.e . , the consumer 's bank that issued the debit card ) as compensation for facilitating the transaction . section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010 ( or title x of the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act , p.l . 111-203 ) , also known as the durbin amendment , authorizes the federal reserve board to prescribe regulations to ensure that the amount of any interchange transaction fee received by a debit card issuer is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer . the federal reserve may consider the authorization , clearance , and settlement costs of each transaction when it sets the interchange fee . the durbin amendment allows the interchange fee to be adjusted for costs incurred by debit card issuers to prevent fraud . debit card issuers with less than $ 10 billion in assets are exempt by statute from the regulation , which means that smaller financial institutions may receive a larger interchange fee than larger issuers . the legislation also prohibits network providers ( e.g . , visa and mastercard ) and debit card issuers from imposing restrictions that would override a merchant 's choice of the network provider through which to route transactions . on june 29 , 2011 , the federal reserve issued a final rule implementing the durbin amendment by regulation ii , which includes a cap of 21 cents plus 0.05 % of the transaction ( and an additional 1 cent to account for fraud protection costs ) on the interchange fee for large issuers . the rule went into effect on october 1 , 2011. merchants expected to benefit from the durbin amendment by having to pay a lower swipe fee . large debit card issuers expected to lose revenue under the regulated cap . many small debit card issuers that were exempt from the rule had also opposed the durbin amendment given concerns about the feasibility of a sustainable two - tiered interchange pricing system . since implementation of the rule , merchants have seen a limited and unequal impact on the amount they pay in swipe fees . likewise , the impact of regulation ii has been uneven for covered institutions . institutions not covered by the regulation ii have reportedly observed minimal change in revenues generated by debit transactions . h.r . 10 , the financial choice act of 2017 , would repeal the durbin amendment . specifically , section 735 of the financial choice act would repeal section 1075 of the consumer financial protection act of 2010. on may 4 , 2017 , h.r . 10 was ordered to be reported by the house financial services committee .
since the deepwater horizon oil spill began on april 20 , 2010 , congress has given much attention to the compensatory liability provisions of the oil pollution act and , to a lesser extent , those of the jones act and the death on the high seas act . however , federal laws possibly relevant to the oil spill also impose civil and criminal money penalties , which may reach dollar amounts in connection with the gulf spill greater than those for compensatory liability . this report summarizes selected federal civil and criminal penalty provisions that may be found violated in connection with the gulf spill and related worker fatalities . it does not purport to be exhaustive . crs stresses that it has no knowledge of the facts surrounding the gulf spill other than what has been publicly reported ; hence the provisions listed here are only an informed guess as to those that ultimately may be found violated . at the outset , the penalty ceilings in the program statutes listed in this report may not be the applicable ones . as for civil penalty ceilings , the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act requires federal agencies to adjust at least once every four years the maximum ( and minimum , if any ) dollar amount on civil penalties within their jurisdiction to reflect movement in the consumer price index . as for criminal penalty ceilings , the criminal fine improvements act often applies . under this statute , the maximum criminal fine a court may impose may be up to the greater of the amount specified in the law setting forth the offense or various alternative ceilings in the criminal fine improvements act . for each statute listed , the report describes any civil administrative penalties , civil judicial penalties , and criminal penalties authorized by the statute that conceivably might be relevant to the gulf spill . the program statutes covered are the clean water act , endangered species act , marine mammal protection act , migratory bird treaty act , oil pollution act , outer continental shelf lands act , and occupational safety and health act . in addition , the report lists several provisions in the federal penal code that are often used in the prosecution of environmental crimes — involving aiding and abetting , conspiracy , false statements to the federal government , mail fraud , wire fraud , and obstruction of justice . an addendum describes the civil complaint filed by the united states on december 15 , 2010 , against several parties allegedly responsible for the gulf spill , and an insurance company .
in march 2010 , the 111th congress passed health reform legislation , the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 ) , as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 ( hcera ; p.l . 111-152 ) and other laws . aca increases access to health insurance coverage , expands federal private health insurance market requirements , and requires the creation of health insurance exchanges to provide individuals and small employers with access to insurance . it also expands medicaid coverage . the costs to the federal government of expanding health insurance and medicaid coverage are projected to be offset by increased taxes and revenues and reduced spending on medicare and other federal health programs . implementation of aca , which began upon the law 's enactment and is scheduled to unfold over the next few years , involves all the major health care stakeholders , including the federal and state governments , as well as employers , insurers , and health care providers . following the enactment of aca , individuals , states , and other entities challenged various provisions of aca on constitutional grounds . many of these suits addressed aca 's requirement for individuals to have health insurance ( i.e . , the individual mandate ) , and claimed that it is beyond the scope of congress 's enumerated powers . the expansion of the medicaid program was also challenged , as state plaintiffs contended that the expansion impermissibly infringes upon states ' rights , coercing them into accepting onerous conditions in exchange for federal funds . on june 28 , 2012 , the supreme court issued its decision in national federation of independent business v. sebelius , finding that the individual mandate is a constitutional exercise of congress 's authority to levy taxes . however , the court held that it was not a valid exercise of congress 's power under the commerce clause or the necessary and proper clause . with regard to the medicaid expansion provision , the court further held that the federal government can not terminate current medicaid program federal matching funds if a state refuses to expand its medicaid program . if a state accepts the new aca medicaid expansion funds , it must abide by the new expansion coverage rules , but , based on the court 's opinion , it appears that a state can refuse to participate in the expansion without losing any of its current federal medicaid matching funds . all other provisions of aca , as amended by hcera , remain intact . this report provides a brief summary of major aca provisions , implementation and oversight activities , and current legal challenges . for more detailed information on aca 's provisions , crs has produced a series of more comprehensive reports , which are available at http : / / www.crs.gov . the information provided in these reports ranges from broad overviews of aca provisions , such as the law 's medicare provisions , to more narrowly focused topics , such as dependent coverage for children under age 26 .
in recent years , the united states has admitted an increasingly diverse group of refugees and other humanitarian cases with a diverse set of needs . there seems to be broad consensus that the u.s. refugee resettlement assistance system is not adequately meeting the needs of these new arrivals and is ripe for reform . the national security council is leading an interagency review of refugee resettlement , the forthcoming results of which may further energize reform efforts . to help inform possible future efforts to reform the refugee resettlement assistance system , this report discusses existing resettlement assistance programs , key challenges and issues in providing effective assistance , and policy options to reform the current system . to assist newly arriving refugees , the department of state ( dos ) administers a program of initial resettlement known as the reception and placement program . under this program , public and private , nonprofit entities provide new refugees with initial resettlement services and referrals to other services , as needed . a separate set of refugee resettlement assistance programs , administered by the office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) in the department of health and human services ' administration for children and families ( hhs / acf ) , provides transitional assistance to refugees and other designated groups . these groups include individuals granted asylum , cuban and haitian entrants , trafficking victims , amerasians , and iraqi and afghan special immigrants . the orr programs — which provide mainly cash assistance , medical assistance , and employment - related services — are intended to help the beneficiaries ( who are referred to collectively as `` refugees '' in this report ) achieve economic self - sufficiency as soon as possible after their arrival in the united states . many observers argue that the dos and orr programs and the refugee resettlement assistance system more broadly are in need of reform . a number of reports have identified perceived shortcomings in the existing system and have offered recommendations for change . several of these reports have focused , in particular , on the recent experience of iraqi refugees resettled in the united states . among the broad challenges facing the refugee resettlement assistance system are interagency coordination and information sharing , and funding . critics also question the system 's self - sufficiency model , which requires refugees to secure employment as quickly as possible . key issues include financial assistance to refugees , which is widely viewed as insufficient , and the `` lottery effect , '' whereby refugees resettled in different parts of the united states receive different levels of financial assistance and services . growing out of these challenges and issues are a variety of options for reforming the existing system with respect to administration and planning and the orr programs .
government advertising can be controversial if it conflicts with citizens ' views about the proper role of government . yet some government advertising is accepted as a normal part of government information activities . it is difficult to calculate the amount of funds spent by the federal government on advertising each year . the reasons for this include ( 1 ) there is no government - wide definition of what constitutes advertising and ( 2 ) there is no central authority to which agencies are required to report advertising expenses . however , an estimate of the federal government 's expenditures on contracts for advertising services can be derived from data in the federal procurement data system . according to these data , federal agencies spent $ 892.5 million on advertising services in fy2013 . agencies ' discretion to advertise is limited primarily by restrictions imposed by congress in authorization and appropriations statutes and by the principles set forth in volume 1 of the government accountability office 's ( gao 's ) principles of federal appropriations law . any oversight of government advertising expenditures rests with agencies ' inspectors general , gao , and congress .
the april 20 , 2010 , explosion of the deepwater horizon offshore drilling rig led to the largest oil spill in u.s. waters . federal government officials estimated that the deepwater well ultimately released ( over 84 days ) over 200 million gallons ( or 4.9 million barrels ) of crude oil . although decreasing amounts of oil were observed on the ocean surface following the well 's containment on july 15 , 2010 , oil spill response officials and researchers have found oil in other places . a pressing question that has been raised by many stakeholders is where did the oil go ? . on august 4 , 2010 , the federal government released an estimate of the oil spill budget for the deepwater horizon incident . on november 23 , 2010 , the federal government released a peer - reviewed `` technical document '' that further explained how the estimates were derived , and in some cases , modified the initial estimates . the oil budget estimates divide the released oil into seven categories , accounting for the following percentages of the total oil released . these categories generally fall into three groups : 1. human intervention : direct recovery from the well ( 17 % ) , in situ burning ( 5 % ) , skimmed ( 3 % ) , chemically dispersed ( 16 % ) . 2. natural processes : naturally dispersed ( 13 % ) , evaporated or dissolved ( 24 % ) . 3. other ( 22 % ) : refers to the oil remaining after subtracting the above estimates from the total estimated release ; possible fates include remaining in the water column , settling to the sea floor , mixing with sediment , ingested by microbes , or collected during shore cleanup activities . direct observation and measurement of the fate of the vast majority of the estimated 200 million gallons of oil presents a considerable challenge . in some cases , the estimates used to calculate these percentages contain considerable uncertainty . even assuming that approximately half of the oil has been removed from the gulf ecosystem through direct recovery , burning , skimming , or evaporation , the fate of the remaining ( `` other '' ) oil is unknown . it is debatable whether the fate of the remaining oil will ever be established conclusively , because multiple challenges hinder this objective : the complexity of the gulf system , resources required to collect data , and varied interpretations over the results and observations . moreover , as time progresses , determining the fate of the oil will likely become more difficult . regardless , the question of oil fate will likely be answered through an incremental process . researchers are continuing to study various components of the gulf , specifically damages to natural resources . some of these efforts may provide clues to the oil 's fate . because evaluating the actual fate of the oil may take time and may prove difficult , perceptions of the oil 's fate may influence congressional interest and action , with consequences for the affected stakeholders . the perception of the spill 's fate may be influenced by multiple factors , including oil spill assessments , the group that prepared the assessment , and the manner in which the assessment is presented . if policymakers have the perception that the oil has degraded with minimal impacts to the environment , attention to the oil spill 's consequences and associated impacts may wane . on the other hand , a perception that a substantial volume of oil remains and poses a threat to the environment could result in continuing pressure on gulf industries and livelihoods .
in early 2011 , many members of congress focused their attention on u.s. rules and practices governing the importation of products and components from north korea . their interest was stimulated by debate over the proposed south korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus fta ) and the question of whether the agreement could lead to increased imports from north korea . some observers , particularly many opposed to the agreement , have argued that the korus fta could increase imports from north korea if south korean firms re - export items made in the kaesong industrial complex ( kic ) , a seven - year - old industrial park located in north korea , where more than 100 south korean manufacturers employ over 45,000 north korean workers . two concerns expressed by critics are ( 1 ) that south korean firms could obtain low - cost kic - made goods or components , incorporate them into finished products and then reship the goods to the united states with `` made in [ south ] korea '' labels so that they would receive preferential treatment under the korus fta ; and ( 2 ) that such exports would benefit the north korean government . at present , north korea 's relative economic isolation and an array of u.s. restrictions have resulted in less than $ 350,000 in u.s. cumulative imports from north korea since 2000. thus , the issue of u.s. imports from north korea is essentially about what might happen in the future . this report examines the issue of u.s. imports from north korea in three parts : u.s. rules and practices governing imports from north korea . the united states does not maintain a comprehensive embargo against north korea . however , imports from north korea require approval from the treasury department 's office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) . this restriction includes finished goods originating in north korea as well as goods that contain north korea - made components . the u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) , of the department of homeland security , is responsible for reviewing an importer 's ofac license as the goods enter the united states . north korea 's exports to south korea ( via the kic ) and china , its dominant export markets . in 2010 , over three - quarters of north korea 's export shipments went to china and south korea . most of north korea 's $ 1.2 billion in exports to china in 2010 were mineral resources or primary products ( such as fish , shellfish , and agro - forest products ) . an increasing proportion of north korea 's exports to south korea have become attributable to activities in the kic , where factories manufactured more than $ 320 million in goods in 2010 , a 25 % increase over 2009. the present south korean government has halted plans for a major expansion of the complex . if a future south korean government resumes these plans , or if china and north korea significantly boost bilateral economic integration , more north korean goods and components could enter global supply chains and test u.s. restrictions against north korean imports . the korus fta 's potential effect on u.s. imports of north korean content . the korus fta appears likely to have only a minimal impact on whether u.s. sanctions on north korean imports are put to the test . at present , the agreement would not give preferential treatment to finished products made in the kic . the agreement would establish a binational committee to discuss whether zones such as the kic should be given preferential treatment in the future . the committee would operate by consensus , and congress would need to pass a law to extend any korus fta tariff benefits to products made in the kic . moreover , the korus fta contains provisions that make it highly unlikely the agreement would constrain the united states ' ability to maintain its restrictions on north korean products . many critics of the korus fta argue that the agreement 's rules of origin would make it possible for south korean exports with north korean components to receive preferential treatment . however , the korus fta 's rules of origin do not appear to limit the united states ' ability to enforce its restrictions on imported products that contain north korean inputs . the issue of how best to handle imports from north korea appears to center on customs controls , cooperation , and enforcement . the complex nature of many types of goods , such as automobiles and electronics , poses a particular challenge for customs and border protection officials to determine the origin of these products . there is no means to determine with one hundred percent certainty that there are no goods or components originating in north korea entering u.s. commerce without proper authorization . this will be true regardless of whether the korus fta is in effect . thus , perhaps the most important factor that will determine whether u.s. restrictions on north korean imports are tested appears to be the degree to which north korean goods enter global supply chains .
president barack obama submitted his fiscal year ( fy ) 2012 request for appropriations to congress on monday , february 14 , 2012. at the time , the federal government was operating under the fourth fy2011 continuing appropriation . congress is currently considering h.r . 1473 , the eighth continuing appropriation . this report explains those government activities funded under the military construction appropriation , examines trends in military construction funding over the past few years , and outlines military construction issues extant in each of the major regions of u.s. military activity . as shown in table 1 , the president 's current request for military construction appropriations is reduced by approximately $ 9.9 billion below the amount enacted for fy2010 and $ 5.2 billion below what he requested for fy2011 . the largest portion of those reductions comes from the military base closure accounts . initiated in late 2005 with the approval of a list of recommendations for base realignment and closure ( brac ) actions , the 2005 brac round is expected to conclude in september 2011. the funding needed in fy2010 and fy2011 for construction and movement of organizations will not be necessary in fy2012 and subsequent years . in addition , the president is requesting less in regular military construction for fy2012 than he did for either fy2010 or fy2011 . finally , funding for construction supporting overseas contingency operations ( oco , or active military operations in iraq and afghanistan ) , for which $ 1.4 billion was appropriated in fy2010 and $ 1.3 billion was requested for fy2011 , has been virtually eliminated , with only $ 80 million in the regular fy2012 appropriation requested for construction at bagram air base , afghanistan . construction issues within the united states center on the relocations associated with the brac movements , the proposed transfer of a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier from norfolk , va , to mayport , fl , and the disestablishment of two major military commands , joint forces command ( jfcom ) and the navy 's second fleet ( 2flt ) , both located in the tidewater region of virginia . in the pacific region , the topics of major interest include planned relocations of u.s. marine forces within the japanese prefecture of okinawa and from okinawa to the u.s. territory of guam , movement of u.s. garrisons in the republic of korea to new concentrations south of the capital of seoul , and the normalization of duty for servicemembers stationed there , which will lengthen their tours and will bring many more military families to korea . troops are also moving within europe and redeploying to the united states . active duty military personnel stationed in europe now number only one - quarter of the force present in 1980 , and garrisons in germany are being concentrated into two large military communities in the south . at least one major combat formation scheduled to move to the united states during the past few years has been retained at its garrison in germany pending a military basing review . military responsibility for africa has been placed under a new africa command ( africom ) . though headquartered in germany , africom does have one enduring military garrison site on the continent , at camp lemonier , djibouti . construction at that site continues to be of interest to congress . press accounts have indicated that a new permanent home for africom headquarters might be located in southeastern virginia . southwest asia , the area of responsibility for u.s. central command , has seen ongoing military operations for almost a decade . since fy2004 , congress has given dod special authority to use some operations and maintenance funds for military construction outside of the normal appropriations process . that authority was extended into fy2011 . funds for military construction had been provided through special emergency supplemental appropriations , but beginning in fy2010 , these funds were folded into the base budget — though still categorized separately from normal construction requests . funding for military construction in support of operations in central command has fallen precipitously with the fy2012 request .
the mail and wire fraud statutes are exceptionally broad . their scope has occasionally given the courts pause . nevertheless , prosecutions in their name have brought to an end schemes that have bilked victims out of millions , and sometimes billions , of dollars . the statutes proscribe ( 1 ) causing the use of the mail or wire communications , including email ; ( 2 ) in conjunction with a scheme to intentionally defraud another of money or property ; ( 3 ) by means of a material deception . the offenses , along with attempts or conspiracies to commit them , carry a term of imprisonment of up to 30 years in some cases , followed by a term of supervised release . offenders also face the prospect of fines , orders to make restitution , and forfeiture of their property . the mail and wire fraud statutes overlap with a surprising number of other federal criminal statutes . conduct that supports a prosecution under the mail or wire fraud statutes will often support prosecution under one or more other criminal provision ( s ) . these companion offenses include ( 1 ) those that use mail or wire fraud as an element of a separate offense , like racketeering or money laundering ; ( 2 ) those that condemn fraud on some jurisdictional basis other than use of the mail or wire communications , like those that outlaw defrauding the federal government or federally insured banks ; and ( 3 ) those that proscribe other deprivations of honest services ( i.e . , bribery and kickbacks ) , like the statutes that ban bribery of federal officials or in connection with federal programs . among the crimes for which mail or wire fraud may serve as an element , rico ( racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act ) outlaws employing the patterned commission of predicate offenses to conduct the affairs of an enterprise that impacts commerce . money laundering consists of transactions involving the proceeds of a predicate offense in order to launder them or to promote further predicate offenses . the statutes that prohibit fraud in some form or another are the most diverse of the mail and wire fraud companions . congress modeled some after the mail and wire fraud statutes , incorporating elements of a scheme to defraud or obtain property by false pretenses into statutes that outlaw bank fraud , health care fraud , securities fraud , and foreign labor contracting fraud . congress designed others to protect the public fisc by proscribing false claims against the united states , conspiracies to defraud the united states by obstructing its functions , and false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of the united states and its departments and agencies . federal bribery and kickback statutes populate the third class of wire and mail fraud companions . one provision bans offering or accepting a thing of value in exchange for the performance or forbearance of a federal official act . another condemns bribery of faithless agents in connection with federally funded programs and activities . a third , the hobbs act , outlaws bribery as a form of extortion under the color of official right . the fines , prison sentences , and other consequences that follow conviction for wire and mail fraud companions vary considerably , with fines from not more than $ 25,000 to not more than $ 2 million and prison terms from not more than five years to life .
foreign nationals seeking asylum must demonstrate a well - founded fear that if returned home , they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics : race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . foreign nationals arriving or present in the united states may apply for asylum affirmatively with the united states citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) in the department of homeland security after arrival into the country , or they may seek asylum defensively before a department of justice executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) immigration judge during removal proceedings . asylum claims ebbed and flowed in the 1980s and peaked in fy1996 . since fy997 , affirmative asylum cases decreased by 79 % and defensive asylum claims dropped by 53 % by fy2009 . asylum seekers from the people 's republic of china ( prc ) dominated both the affirmative and defensive asylum caseload in fy2009 . five of the top 10 source countries of asylum seekers were western hemisphere nations in fy2009 : haiti , mexico , guatemala , el salvador , and colombia . ethiopia was the only african nation that was a top source country for asylum seekers in fy2009 . despite the general decrease in asylum cases since the enactment of the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act ( iirira ) in 1996 , data analysis of six selected countries ( the prc , colombia , el salvador , ethiopia , haiti , and mexico ) suggests that conditions in the source countries are likely the driving force behind asylum seekers . roughly 30 % of all asylum cases that worked through uscis and eoir in recent years have been approved . affirmative asylum cases approved by uscis more than doubled from 13,532 in fy1996 to 31,202 in fy2002 , and then fell to the lowest point over the 14-year period — 9,614 — in fy2009 . the number of defensive asylum cases that eoir judges have approved has risen by 99 % from fy1996 through fy2009 . the prc led in the number of asylum cases approved by uscis and eoir over the decade of fy2000-fy2009 . despite national data trends that appeared to be consistent , approval rates for asylum seekers differ strikingly across regions and jurisdictions . for example , a study of 290 asylum officers who decided at least 100 cases from the prc from fy1999 through fy2005 found that the approval rate of prc claimants spanned from zero to over 90 % during this period . in a separate study , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) analyzed asylum decisions from 19 immigration courts that handled almost 90 % of the cases from october 1994 through april 2007 and found that `` significant variation existed . . at the crux of the issue is the extent to which an asylum policy forged during the cold war is adapting to the competing priorities and turbulence of the 21st century . some assert that asylum has become an alternative pathway for immigration rather than humanitarian protection . others argue that — given the religious , ethnic , and political violence in various countries around the world — it has become more difficult to differentiate the persecuted from the persecutors . some express concern that u.s. sympathies for the asylum seekers caught up in the democratic political uprisings in the middle east , northern africa , and south asia could inadvertently facilitate the entry of terrorists . others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people fleeing human rights violations or gender - based abuses that occur around the world . some cite the disparities in asylum approvals rates and urge broad - based administrative reforms . the refugee protection act of 2011 ( s. 1202 / h.r . 2185 ) would make significant revisions to asylum policy .
the reclamation fund was established in 1902 to fund the development of irrigation projects on arid and semiarid lands of the 17 western states . it originated as a revolving fund for construction projects and was supported by the proceeds of the sale of land and water in the western united states . over time , it was amended to receive proceeds from a number of other sources . it is currently derived from repayments and revenues associated with federal water resources development as well as the sales , rentals , and leases ( including natural resource leasing ) of federal land in the western united states . portions of the fund 's balance are appropriated annually by congress for multiple purposes , including some of the operational expenditures of the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) and the power marketing administrations . through fy2012 , collections deposited into the reclamation fund totaled more than $ 40 billion , while total appropriations from the fund totaled more than $ 30 billion . the reclamation fund did not finance all reclamation investments in the western united states . as a result of limited funding availability , a number of large dams and other reclamation investments were financed by the general fund of the u.s. treasury . notwithstanding advances to the reclamation fund by congress in 1910 and 1931 , deposits into and appropriations out of the fund have been roughly equal over time . from the 1940s until the 1990s , the fund maintained a small , relatively stable balance . beginning in the mid - 1990s , balances in the fund began to increase significantly as receipts from mineral leasing and power sales increased , while appropriations from the fund largely remained static . at the end of fy2012 , the fund had a balance of more than $ 10.8 billion , and it is expected to continue to grow . receipts deposited into the reclamation fund are made available to reclamation by congress through annual discretionary appropriations bills , which are subject to congressional budgetary allocations . some have proposed that congress appropriate some portion of the surplus balance in the reclamation fund to reclamation activities in western states , including new water storage projects or the rehabilitation of existing projects . these interests argue that the reclamation fund was set up to benefit western states and should now be used to increase investments in these areas . as the balance of the reclamation fund continues to increase , congress may reevaluate the reclamation fund 's status , including its financing of new or ongoing activities . the omnibus lands act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-11 ) included provisions that will transfer $ 120 million per year from the fund from fy2020 through fy2034 , without further appropriation , to a separate fund that provides for indian water settlement construction projects . in the 113th congress , a bill before the senate ( s. 715 ) proposes to redirect funding that would otherwise go to the reclamation fund for the construction of rural water projects . major changes to the reclamation fund may have scoring implications in the annual budget and under congressional pay - as - you - go rules .
syria has produced , stored , and weaponized chemical agents , but it remains dependent on foreign suppliers for chemical precursors . the regime of president bashar al asad possesses stocks of nerve ( sarin , vx ) and blister ( mustard gas ) agents , possibly weaponized into bombs , shells , and missiles . the government also has associated production facilities . chemical weapons and their agents can deteriorate depending on age and quality ; little is known from open sources about the current condition of the stockpile . syria continues to attempt to procure new supplies of chemical weapons precursors , which are dual - use , through front companies in third countries . most countries that have had chemical weapons arsenals in the past have destroyed , or are in the process of destroying , these weapons under the chemical weapons convention . the u.s. intelligence community cites iran , north korea , and syria as having active chemical weapons programs . the syrian government acceded to the chemical weapons convention on september 14 , 2013. this convention requires its member states to eliminate all of their chemical weapon stocks , munitions , precursor chemicals , and related production and storage facilities . a major policy concern of the united states has been the use or loss of control of chemical weapons stocks in syria , which could have unpredictable consequences for the syrian population and neighboring countries , as well as u.s. allies and forces in the region . the united states and other countries have assessed that the syrian government has used chemical weapons against opposition forces in the country . the largest - scale use to date was on august 21 , 2013. a u.n. inspection team began working in syria on august 19 , 2013 , and completed their mission on august 31. the u.n. team 's investigative report confirmed the large - scale use of sarin nerve agent against civilians in the ghouta area of damascus on august 21. president barack obama and other world leaders had said that the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population would be met with consequences , which could include the use of military force . for example , president obama suggested during an august 2012 press briefing that the united states might take military action against syria if damascus used or lost control of its chemical weapons , explaining that `` a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized . that would change my calculus . . on august 31 , 2013 , president obama stated that the united states should respond with `` military action against syrian regime targets '' in response to the august 21 attack and added that he would ask congress to grant authorization for the use of military force . the white house had previously announced on june 13 , 2013 , that the syrian government had used chemical weapons `` on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year . . the statement added that , in response to the asad regime 's use of chemical weapons , the president had authorized the expansion of military assistance to the opposition forces in syria . however , president obama subsequently explained in a september 10 speech that he had asked congressional leaders to postpone a vote to authorize the use of military force in order to give the administration time to pursue a new diplomatic initiative . syrian foreign minister walid moallem stated the previous day that damascus had accepted a proposal presented by the russian government , according to which syria would turn over its chemical weapons for international control and supervised destruction . the united nations security council is discussing a draft resolution designed to accomplish this goal . secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov presented a proposed framework for elimination of syrian chemical weapons , which outlines deadlines and actions required . key issues for implementation of chemical weapons destruction in syria include verification , inspectors ' access , destruction method and location , and the security of international personnel . while the united states and other governments have said they believe the asad regime has kept its chemical weapons stocks secure , policy makers are also concerned about what could happen to these weapons in the course of the civil war , such as diversion to terrorist groups or loss of control during a regime collapse . there is also concern that syria could transfer its chemical weapons to hezbollah in lebanon . administration officials have stated that the united states has been working with regional allies to detect the movement of chemical weapons , prepare interdiction scenarios , and mitigate possible use against military or civilian populations . during conflict , the intelligence community and special forces units would likely play a major role in locating and securing such weapons in a combat environment . the nature and recent course of the conflict in syria suggests that rapid changes in control over critical military facilities may occur . u.s. government programs established to secure or remove chemical or other weapons of mass destruction through threat reduction or nonproliferation programs have focused on destruction or scientist redirection in an atmosphere of cooperation . at present , such programs are providing border security assistance to neighboring states . these programs may also be used to contribute financial or in - kind technical assistance to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) mission to eliminate chemical weapons in syria . u.s. policy makers and congress may wish to review and discuss authorities , funding , forces , and scenarios . for additional information on chemical weapons agents , see crs report r42862 , chemical weapons : a summary report of characteristics and effects , by [ author name scrubbed ] . for a broader discussion of u.s. policy options , see crs report rl33487 , armed conflict in syria : background and u.s. response , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
according to a 2012 report released by the world health organization ( who ) and the united nations children 's fund ( unicef ) , roughly 780 million people around the world lack access to clean drinking water and an estimated 2.5 billion people ( roughly 40 % of the world 's population ) are without access to safe sanitation facilities . the united states has long supported efforts to improve global access to clean water , sanitation , and hygiene ( wash ) . in 2000 , for example , the united states signed on to the millennium development goals , one of which includes a target to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. in 2002 , the united states also participated in the 2002 world summit on sustainable development , which emphasized the need to address limited access to clean water and sanitation among the world 's poor . the 109th congress enacted legislation to advance these global goals through the senator paul simon water for the poor act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-121 [ water for the poor act ] ) . in march 2012 , the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) announced that it had joined the sanitation and water for all partnership — a coalition of governments , donors , civil society and development groups committed to advancing sustainable access to clean drinking water and sanitation . congressional support for the act was motivated , in part , by calls to augment funding for wash programs and improve the integration of wash activities into broader u.s. foreign aid objectives and programs , as well as global health efforts . the act called for usaid to bolster support for wash programs , further synthesize wash activities into global health programs , and contribute to global goals to halve the proportion of people without access to clean water and sanitation by 2015. in the 111th congress , the senator paul simon water for the world act of 2010 was introduced , but not enacted . that bill would have amended the water for the poor act and addressed several concerns observers raised regarding the water for the poor act , particularly by creating senior leadership within usaid to address water and sanitation issues , assessing u.s. water and sanitation programs , and strengthening reporting requirements . a new bill , introduced in the 112th congress as the proposed water for the world act ( s. 641 ) , awaits action by the senate committee on foreign relations . several agencies contribute to u.s. efforts to improve global access to clean drinking water and sanitation , of which programs implemented by the millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) and usaid make up roughly 90 % . in fy2010 , for example , the united states invested $ 953 million on water and sanitation programs worldwide , including $ 898 million provided by usaid and mcc . appropriations for water projects are provided to usaid annually , while mcc receives multi - year funding for its country compacts that include support for water projects . as such , spending by mcc on water projects may vary significantly from year to year and may not be requested annually . the president requested $ 302 million for usaid 's water activities for fy2012 and congress appropriated not less than $ 315 million for international water and sanitation programs through the fy2012 consolidated appropriations . the fy2013 request for usaid 's water and sanitation efforts was slightly lower at $ 299.1 million . this report addresses congressional efforts to address limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation , outlines related programs implemented by usaid and mcc , and analyzes issues related to u.s. and international drinking water and sanitation programs that the 112th congress might consider .
the workforce investment act of 1998 ( wia , p.l . 105-220 ) is the primary federal law that provides job training and related services to unemployed and underemployed individuals , including vulnerable young people with barriers to employment . all youth job training programs and related services are authorized under title i of wia and administered by the department of labor ( dol ) . these programs include the wia youth activities formula program , job corps , and youthbuild . the job corps program was established in the 1960s and is the oldest federal job training and employment program ( among recent programs ) for young people . under the pilot and demonstration authority in title i , dol has also carried out the reintegration of ex - offenders program for both youth and adults . although the programs have distinct activities and goals , each of them seeks to connect eligible youth to educational and employment opportunities , as well as leadership development and community service activities . wia authorized funding through september 30 , 2003 ; however , wia programs continue to be funded through annual appropriation acts . both the senate and house of representatives have taken steps toward reauthorizing wia since the 108th congress . this report provides an overview of issues that have been raised by stakeholders about youth programs authorized under wia . first , some policy makers have proposed consolidating these and other workforce programs to make them more efficient and less costly . other stakeholders assert that at - risk youth and other groups with barriers to employment would be overlooked under such a consolidation . another issue is the perceived lack of coordination between the workforce system and other systems that serve youth , such as the education system . stakeholders have suggested that greater coordination can help meet the varied needs of youth , as intended by wia . members of congress and others have also continued to inquire about the effectiveness of programs that serve youth in meeting their objectives and serving the most at - risk youth . to date , only an impact evaluation of job corps has been completed ; however , dol recently awarded a contract to a social policy research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of youthbuild . in addition to these broader issues , congress is interested in issues specific to youth activities and job corps . youth activities provides funding for youth employment and training services overseen by a state workforce investment board ( wib ) and the governor , in coordination with local wibs and community organizations . the program targets youth ages 14 through 21 who are low - income and have one or more barriers to employment . since the start of the program , policy makers and others have considered the extent to which youth have had to prove their eligibility for the program . some local workforce investment boards have reported challenges with documenting income and other eligibility criteria , and some proposals would establish different methods for determining eligibility . further , stakeholders have raised issues about whether the program should focus more on out - of - school youth . local workforce investment boards have reported challenges recruiting and retaining these youth . related to this is the age of youth who ought to be eligible for the program . the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( arra , p.l . 111-5 ) temporarily enabled youth ages 22 through 24 to access services under the program . whether wia ought to target these older youth , particularly in light of the possible cost of doing so , could be addressed in any reauthorization legislation . congress has considered proposals to provide federal funding for states to operate job corps centers , as a state option , or to close centers . this is due to concerns that the program has had mixed performance outcomes , and that some centers are low performing . this report accompanies two crs reports — crs report r40929 , vulnerable youth : employment and job training programs , and archived crs report r40830 , vulnerable youth : federal policies on summer job training and employment , both by [ author name scrubbed ] .
the trio programs are the primary federal programs providing support services to disadvantaged students to promote achievement in postsecondary education . the higher education amendments of 1968 ( p.l . 90-575 ) consolidated a `` trio '' of programs under one overall program . this report provides a description of the trio programs , authorized in title iv - a - 2-1 of the hea . in fy2017 , the trio programs were funded at $ 950 million , and they served more than 800,000 secondary , postsecondary , and adult students . the trio programs have been designed to encourage and prepare qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for success throughout the educational pipeline from secondary school to undergraduate and graduate education . while the trio programs primarily serve low - income , first - generation college students , they also serve students with disabilities , veterans , homeless youth , foster youth , and individuals underrepresented in graduate education . the trio programs are also designed to award prior grantees that implement successful projects and propose high - quality projects with subsequent grants before awarding applicants without prior trio experience . there are now six trio programs , each serving a different demographic . the trio upward bound ( ub ) program serves secondary school students , providing relatively intensive preparation services and encouragement to help students pursue education beyond secondary school . the trio talent search ( ts ) program provides less intensive services than ub in support of the completion of high school and enrollment in postsecondary education , and it encourages primarily students and out - of - school youth . the trio educational opportunity centers ( eoc ) program primarily serves adults . the trio student support services ( sss ) program aims to motivate undergraduate students to complete their undergraduate education . the ronald e. mcnair postbaccalaureate achievement ( mcnair ) program prepares undergraduate students for graduate school . finally , the trio staff development ( training ) program trains trio project staff to be more effective . several key trio program provisions were amended by the higher education opportunity act ( heoa ; p.l . 110-315 ) in 2008. two key heoa amendments address issues pertaining to the application review process : scoring and second reviews ( appeals ) . the first amendment defined outcome criteria that require the secretary and each grantee to agree upon objectives / targets for the criteria . the extent to which grantees meet or exceed these objectives determines the number of prior experience ( pe ) points the grantee may earn as part of its application in the next grant competition . earning more pe points increases the likelihood of funding . the second amendment established an application review process by which those unsuccessful applicants that can identify a specific technical , administrative , or scoring error may have their applications reviewed a second time ( appealed ) . the fy2012 trio ub competition was the first to use the revised application review process .
congress included provisions in the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-96 ) for planning , building , and managing a new , nationwide , broadband network for public safety communications , by creating the first responder network authority ( firstnet ) . the act allocated 10 mhz of additional radio frequency spectrum to accommodate the new network and required that the federal communications commission ( fcc ) assign a license to firstnet , comprising the newly designated frequencies plus 10 mhz previously assigned to states by the fcc for public safety use . in addition , the act designated federal appropriations of over $ 7 billion for the network and other public safety needs . these funds are provided through new revenue from the auction of licenses to the commercial sector in other spectrum bands . the establishment of firstnet is an important step toward reaching what has been a national goal since september 11 , 2001 : the provision of interoperable communications for first responders . the immediate goal for firstnet is to provide a broadband network nationwide to carry data , although it will provide an option for voice communications as well . the cost of constructing and maintaining a nationwide network is estimated by many experts to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the long term . the law anticipates that most of these costs will be covered by partnerships between firstnet and the private sector in return for commercial access to firstnet 's spectrum . in order to maintain control over the quality and nature of communications , many states are likely to continue to invest in and maintain their own land mobile radio ( lmr ) networks that operate on narrowband frequencies under the jurisdiction of state and local public safety agencies . information available to the public indicates that firstnet intends to discourage states from building and operating their own networks within firstnet , in part by limiting the amount of spectrum available for this purpose . firstnet has taken the position that state autonomy in network design decisions and management will jeopardize firstnet 's ability to provide a network that meets its coverage and service goals . p.l . 112-96 was signed into law on february 22 , 2012 , setting in motion the process of setting up firstnet as an `` independent authority within the national telecommunications and information administration , '' as required by the act ; laying out the parameters for partnerships and state , tribal , and federal participation ; and meeting requirements either statutory or practical . after extensive consultation with stakeholders and potential partners in preparing proposals for partnering with firstnet , the initial phases of organization culminated with the deadline for submitting proposals to build and operate the nationwide network , on may 31 , 2016. on november 21 , 2016 , one of the firstnet bidders eliminated from consideration , rivada mercury , filed a lawsuit in the u.s. court of appeals of federal claims over what rivada says is the illegal and wrongful exclusion of the consortium from the firstnet procurement process . the lawsuit is expected to delay the contract award until march 1 , 2017 , at the earliest , although further delays are possible depending on the resolution of the lawsuit . once the contract is awarded , the contractor will have up to 180 days to deliver detailed deployment plans to each state and territory . governors will then have 90 days to decide whether to opt in to firstnet or to opt out and build their own radio access network which must be interoperable with firstnet . as firstnet becomes operational , the potential level of public safety agency participation should be better understood , providing opportunities to evaluate the success of firstnet in meeting the goals congress set for it in 2012. the 115th congress will likely continue monitoring the development and deployment of firstnet through periodic hearings in both the house and senate .
the federal crop insurance program provides farmers with risk management tools to address crop yield and / or revenue losses on their farms . farmers can purchase subsidized policies that pay an indemnity when their production or revenue falls below a guaranteed level . historically , the federal crop insurance program primarily has covered traditional farm program crops such as wheat , corn , and soybeans . however , the crop insurance program has expanded in recent decades , and policies are available now for a wide range of commodities , including specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables . in 2009 , specialty crop policies covered more than 7 million acres , which was roughly one - half to three - quarters of specialty crop area , depending on how total area is calculated . in total , crop insurance is available for over 80 specialty crops , making the program the primary financial safety net for specialty crop producers . the federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized by the federal crop insurance act , as amended ( 7 u.s.c . 1501 et seq . ) . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) risk management agency ( rma ) operates the federal crop insurance corporation ( fcic ) , which is the funding mechanism for the program . insurance policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies . the insurance companies ' losses are reinsured by usda , and their administrative and operating costs are reimbursed by the federal government . federal crop insurance policies for specialty crops ( and other crops as well ) are generally either yield - based or revenue - based . for most yield - based policies , a producer can receive an indemnity if there is a yield loss relative to the farmer 's `` normal '' ( historical ) yield . insurable causes of loss include drought , excess precipitation , hail , frost , freeze , fire ( if due to natural causes ) , and insects and disease . revenue - based policies protect against crop revenue loss resulting from declines in yield , price , or both . nursery crop producers can be protected against loss of an `` asset '' due to weather damage ( but not price loss ) . also relevant for specialty crop producers is whole - farm insurance , which protects against losses in whole farm revenue rather than just for an individual crop . an endorsement is available in some areas for protecting against loss due to quarantine . while additional policies have been introduced in the last 10 years , producers and some members of congress would like to enhance crop insurance for specialty crop producers . in the 112th congress , several legislative proposals have been introduced . the local farms , food , and jobs act of 2011 ( h.r . 3286 / s . 1773 ) would enhance whole farm insurance and insurance for organic crops . the rural economic farm and ranch sustainability and hunger ( refresh ) act of 2011 ( s. 1658 and h.r . 3111 ) would also enhance whole farm insurance . the specialty crop insurance act of 2011 ( s. 1905 ) would support the development of new policies . in the 112th congress , specialty crop provisions in these and other proposals have been included in the senate - passed farm bill ( s. 3240 ) and the house committee - passed farm bill ( h.r . 6083 ) . the bills require usda to conduct more research on higher coverage levels for whole farm revenue insurance and study insurance for food safety and contamination - related losses . a provision would revise the value of crop insurance for all organic crops to reflect prices of organic ( not conventional ) crops . for crops not insurable with crop insurance , additional coverage would become available under the existing noninsured crop assistance program ( nap ) . finally , a provision in s. 3240 would subsidize the purchase of existing private - sector index - based weather insurance , which protects against specific weather events and not actual loss .
section 9401 of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) provides the secretary of education with broad waiver authority with respect to programs authorized under the act . the secretary has used the authority provided under section 9401 to grant numerous waivers over time , including waivers of accountability and general administrative provisions . on september 23 , 2011 , president obama and the secretary announced the availability of an esea flexibility package for states and described the principles that states must meet to obtain the included waivers . the waivers would apply to school years 2011-2012 , 2012-2013 , and 2013-2014. states would have the option to apply for a one - year waiver extension for the 2014-2015 school year . the following waivers are included in the esea flexibility package : 1. flexibility regarding the 2013-2014 timeline for determining adequate yearly progress 2. flexibility in implementation of school improvement requirements 3. flexibility in implementation of local educational agencies ( leas ) improvement requirement 4. flexibility for rural leas 5. flexibility for schoolwide programs 6. flexibility to support school improvement 7. flexibility for reward schools 8. flexibility regarding highly qualified teacher ( hqt ) improvement plans 9. flexibility to transfer certain funds 10. flexibility in the use of school improvement grant funds to support priority schools the waivers would exempt states from various academic accountability requirements , teacher qualification - related requirements , and funding flexibility requirements that were enacted through the no child left behind act of 2001 ( nclb ; p.l . 107-110 ) . state educational agencies ( seas ) could also apply for an optional waiver related to the 21st century community learning centers program . however , in order to receive the waivers , seas must agree to meet four principles established by ed for `` improving student academic achievement and increasing the quality of instruction . . the four principles , as stated by ed , are as follows : ( 1 ) college - and career - ready expectations for all students ; ( 2 ) state - developed differentiated recognition , accountability , and support ; ( 3 ) supporting effective instruction and leadership ; and ( 4 ) reducing duplication and unnecessary burden . taken collectively , the waivers and principles included in the esea flexibility package amount to a fundamental redesign by the administration of the accountability and teacher - related requirements included in current law . given that most states have applied for , or signaled an intent to apply for , the waivers , the esea flexibility package may be in effect in many states by the end of the current school year . if congress continues to work on esea reauthorization during the 112th congress , it is possible that provisions included in any final bill may be similar to or override the waivers and principles established by the administration .
on february 13 , 2012 , the obama administration released its detailed budget request for fy2013 . the administration 's proposed budget included $ 677.8 million in special federal payments to the district of columbia , which was $ 12.2 million more than the district 's fy2012 appropriation of $ 665.6 million in special federal payments . approximately 78 % ( $ 526.7 million ) of the president 's proposed budget request for the district would have been targeted to the courts and criminal justice system . the president 's budget request also included $ 95.6 million in support of education initiatives . this represented 14 % of the administration 's federal payment budget request for the district of columbia . on may 15 , 2012 , the district of columbia council approved a fy2013 budget that included $ 11.4 billion in operating funds and $ 1.1 billion in capital outlays . the mayor signed the measure ( a19-0381 ) on june 15 , 2012. included in the act was a provision that would have granted the district some level of budget autonomy in the expenditure of local funds , if congress failed to pass and the president failed to sign a district of columbia appropriations act before the beginning of the 2013 fiscal year on october 1 , 2012. on june 14 , 2012 , the senate appropriations committee reported s. 3301 , its version of the financial services and general government appropriations act for fy2013 ( fsgg ) , with an accompanying report ( s.rept . 112-177 ) . as reported , the bill recommended $ 676.2 million in special federal payments to the district . this was $ 10.6 million more than appropriated for fy2012 , and $ 1.6 million less than requested by the administration . on june 26 , 2012 , a house appropriations committee approved its version of the financial services and general government appropriations act of 2013 , h.r . 6020 , with an accompanying report ( h.rept . 112-550 ) . the bill included $ 673.7 million in special federal payments to the district . this was $ 8.1 million more than appropriated for fy2012 , $ 4.1 million less than requested by the administration and $ 2.5 million less than recommended by the senate bill . the senate bill , s. 3301 , included changes in two provisions that city officials had sought to eliminate or modify . the bill would have lifted the prohibition on the use of district funds to provide abortion services , but would have continued the prohibition against the use of federal funds . the house bill would have restricted the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to instances involving rape , incest , or a health threat to the life of the pregnant woman . both the house and senate bills would have continued to prohibit the use of federal funds to regulate and decriminalize the medical use of marijuana and would have provided funding for a school voucher program , which was not funded in fy2012 . the private school voucher program was opposed by some city leaders , but supported by others . the administration did not include funding for school vouchers in its budget submission to congress . unable to reach agreement on appropriation measures , including the fsgg , before the beginning of fy2013 , the 112th congress passed h.j.res . 117 extending funding at an annualized rate of 0.6 % above the fy2012 funding levels through march 27 , 2013. the act , which was signed into law as p.l . 112-175 by the president on september 28 , 2012 , ( 1 ) allowed the district to spend its local funds as outlined in the district of columbia budget request act of 2012 and ( 2 ) appropriated $ 9.8 million for expenses associated with the presidential inauguration . on march 26 , 2013 , the president signed into law p.l . 113-6 , the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act , 2013 , which superseded p.l . 112-175. p.l . 113-6 funded special federal payments to the district at the fy2012 funding levels , except for emergency planning and security , which was funded at $ 24.7 million . the act also continued the prohibition on the use of federal funds for abortion services and needle exchange programs .
u.s. forests are crisscrossed by thousands of miles of logging roads . when it rains or snow melts , runoff from these roads can be environmentally harmful , so how to address this runoff under the clean water act ( cwa ) has long been an issue . on march 20 , 2013 , the supreme court in decker v. northwest environmental defense center addressed one aspect of this issue : logging road runoff that is discharged into cwa - covered waters from ditches , culverts , or other channels . such conveyances arguably make the runoff a `` point source '' under the cwa , which normally means that a permit under the act 's national pollutant discharge elimination system ( npdes ) is required . special cwa provisions , however , exempt stormwater runoff , unless , as relevant here , it is `` associated with industrial activity . . in decker , the supreme court upheld 7-1 epa 's long - standing reading of its industrial stormwater rule that logging road runoff , even if channeled , is not `` associated with industrial activity '' and so does not require a npdes permit . this reversed the ninth circuit and affirmed epa 's view that logging road runoff is subject only to a requirement of best management practices . in upholding epa 's reading of its rule as exempting logging road runoff from the npdes program , the court observed that references in the industrial stormwater rule suggest that its natural reading should be confined to traditional industrial buildings , and so does not extend to logging operations . moreover , epa had espoused this reading for a long time ; it had not been adopted recently in response to this litigation . in light of these factors , the court viewed the precept that courts owe deference to agency interpretations of their own rules as applying in full force . finally , the state of oregon had invested much effort in developing best management practices for stormwater runoff from logging roads , so epa , as the court saw it , could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be unnecessary . epa 's response to the ninth circuit ruling was to amend the industrial stormwater rule . the amended rule , issued in november 2012 three days prior to the oral argument before the supreme court , makes explicit the agency 's long - standing position that logging roads do not need cwa discharge permits for stormwater runoff . the supreme court opinion actually deals with epa 's reading of the prior , less explicit version of the industrial stormwater rule . the amended rule may or may not be resurrected on remand to the district court . for the moment , however , the status quo is unchanged : npdes permits have never been required for logging road runoff , and they are not required as of now . epa also is considering designating a subset of stormwater discharges from forest roads for regulation under flexible mechanisms available in the cwa , including non - permitting approaches , but the agency has not issued a proposal or announced a timetable for further action . congressional interest in responding to the ninth circuit ruling has been strong . congress enacted temporary measures that barred epa until september 30 , 2013 , from requiring a permit for stormwater runoff associated with silviculture activities . the 2013 farm bill reauthorization ( h.r . 2642 , p.l . 113-79 ) includes a provision stating that discharges resulting from specified silviculture activities shall not require cwa discharge permits .
the farm commodity provisions of the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , as amended ( p.l . 110-246 , the 2008 farm bill ) expire with the 2013 crop year . consequently , the 113th congress has been considering an omnibus farm bill that would establish the direction of agricultural policy for the next five years . on june 10 , 2013 , the senate approved its version of the farm bill , s. 954 , the agriculture reform , food and jobs act of 2013. the house approved a farm bill ( h.r . 2642 ) without a nutrition title on july 11 , 2013 , and a nutrition title ( h.r . 3102 ) on september 19 , 2013. the house adopted a resolution ( h.res . 361 ) on september 28 that combined the texts of h.r . 2642 and h.r . 3102 into one bill ( h.r . 2642 ) for purposes of resolving differences with the senate . conference on the two measures is pending . among the many provisions , both bills would reshape the structure of farm commodity support , retroactively reauthorize several disaster programs , and expand coverage under the federal crop insurance program . these three areas of federal support for farmers are often collectively called the `` farm safety net . . commodity programs under the original 2008 farm bill cover only crops harvested in 2008 through 2012 , and were extended for an additional crop year in the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ( p.l . 112-240 , the fiscal cliff bill ) . unlike farm commodity programs , the federal crop insurance program , which provides subsidized insurance policies for producers , is permanently authorized under the federal crop insurance act of 1980. five disaster assistance programs under the 2008 farm bill expired on september 30 , 2011 , and under the farm bill extension , congress provided authority to appropriate funds ( but no actual funding ) for three livestock programs and a tree assistance program . under both s. 954 and h.r . 2642 , farm support for traditional program crops is restructured by eliminating direct payments . direct payments — made to producers and landowners based on historical production and fixed payment rates for corn , wheat , soybeans , cotton , rice , peanuts , and other `` covered '' crops — have accounted for most farm program spending in recent years . as under current law , both bills authorize farm programs ( with new program names ) that would make payments when crop prices ( or revenue ) fall below a reference price ( or historical average revenue ) . authority is continued for marketing assistance loans , which provide additional low - price protection at `` loan rates '' specified in current law ( with an adjustment made to cotton ) . the senate bill covers only crop years 2014-2018 , and it suspends permanent price support authority under the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 and agricultural adjustment act of 1949 until program authority in s. 954 expires in 2018. in contrast , the house bill covers crop year 2014 and each succeeding crop year ( i.e . , no program expiration date ) and repeals permanent law . in both bills , approximately three - fourths of the 10-year , $ 46 billion - $ 47 billion in savings ( as estimated by the congressional budget office ) associated with the proposed elimination of current farm programs would be used to offset the cost of revising farm programs ( title i ) , enhancing crop insurance ( title xi ) , and retroactively reauthorizing four disaster programs ( beginning fy2012 ) . the two bills provide programs for covered crops , except cotton , which would have its own program ( a crop insurance product called stacked income protection plan or stax ) . proponents of farm programs and federal crop insurance are attempting to address the issue of `` shallow losses '' — crop losses not covered currently by crop insurance — as well as provide disaster assistance for livestock producers . critics contend that the proposals contain overly generous farm and crop insurance subsidies and shift additional commodity market risk to the federal government .
the people 's republic of china ( prc ) has the world 's largest number of internet users , estimated at 500 million people . despite government efforts to limit the flow of online news , chinese internet users are able to access unprecedented amounts of information , and political activists have utilized the web as a vital communications tool . in recent years , twitter - like microblogging has surged , resulting in dramatic cases of dissident communication and public comment on sensitive political issues . however , the web has proven to be less of a democratic catalyst in china than many observers had hoped . the prc government has one of the most rigorous internet censorship systems , which relies heavily upon cooperation between the government and private internet companies . some u.s. policy makers have been especially critical of the compliance of some u.s. internet communications and technology ( ict ) companies with china 's censorship and policing activities . the development of the internet and its use in china have raised u.s. congressional concerns , including those related to human rights , trade and investment , and cybersecurity . the link between the internet and human rights , a pillar of u.s. foreign policy toward china , is the main focus of this report . congressional interest in the internet in china is tied to human rights concerns in a number of ways . these include the following : the use of the internet as a u.s. policy tool for promoting freedom of expression and other rights in china , the use of the internet by political dissidents in the prc , and the political repression that such use often provokes , the role of u.s. internet companies in both spreading freedom in china and complying with prc censorship and social control efforts , and the development of u.s. internet freedom policies globally . since 2006 , congressional committees and commissions have held nine hearings on internet freedom and related issues , with a large emphasis on china . in response to criticism , in 2008 , yahoo ! , microsoft , google , and other parties founded the global network initiative , a set of guidelines that promotes awareness , due diligence , and transparency regarding the activities of ict companies and their impacts on human rights , particularly in countries where governments frequently violate the rights of internet users to freedom of expression and privacy . in the 112th congress , the global online freedom act ( h.r . 3605 ) would require u.s. companies to disclose any censorship or surveillance technology that they provide to internet - restricting countries . it also would bar u.s. companies from selling technology that could be used for the purposes of censorship or surveillance in such countries . for over a decade , the united states government has sought to promote global internet freedom , particularly in china and iran . in 2006 , the bush administration established the global internet freedom task force , which was renamed the netfreedom task force under the obama administration . congress provided $ 95 million for global internet freedom programs between 2008 and 2012. the broadcasting board of governors has spent approximately $ 2 million annually during the past decade to help enable internet users in china and other internet - restricting countries to access its websites , such as voice of america and radio free asia . some experts argue that support for counter - censorship technology , which has long dominated the u.s. effort to promote global internet freedom , has had an important but limited impact . obstacles to internet freedom in china and elsewhere include not only censorship but also the following : advances in government capabilities to monitor and attack online dissident activity ; tight restrictions on social networking ; and the lack of popular pressure for greater internet freedom . as part of a broadening policy approach , the u.s. government has sponsored a widening range of internet freedom programs , including censorship circumvention technology ; privacy protection and online security ; training civil society groups in effective uses of the web for communications , organizational , and advocacy purposes ; and spreading awareness of internet freedom .
on march 16 , 2010 , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) released connecting america : the national broadband plan . the national broadband plan ( nbp ) identified significant gaps in broadband availability and adoption in the united states , and in order to address those gaps and other challenges , the nbp set specific goals to be achieved by the year 2020. goals were set for next generation broadband service ; universal broadband service ; mobile wireless broadband innovation and coverage ; broadband access of community anchor institutions ; a nationwide , wireless , interoperable broadband public safety network ; and broadband for tracking energy consumption . three years after the rollout of the nbp , available data indicate that there has been progress towards reaching the 2020 goals . the following observations can be made : the united states is much closer to reaching broadband availability goals than broadband adoption goals , which remain a major challenge ; the united states is much closer to achieving broadband download speed goals than upload speed goals ; while the next generation broadband goal of 100 million households with 100 mbps speeds seems within reach ( at least for download speeds ) , the price remains high — affordability could improve in the future depending on technological advances and consumer demand for ultra - high speed next generation performance ; recent rollouts of next generation wireless technologies have led the fcc to state that the united states leads the world in mobile innovation ; on the other hand , the latest organisation for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) data indicate that the united states remains in the middle of the pack with respect to wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 of the population ; while broadband data are incomplete for community anchor institutions , available information indicate that the number of cais with 1 gigabit connections remains relatively low ; and two major initiatives — firstnet and smart grid — are currently underway in order to help reach the goals for a public safety wireless network and for broadband monitoring of energy consumption . many of the key telecommunications issues that are currently being considered by the 113th congress are focused on improving broadband deployment and thus are intended to have a positive impact on the nation 's progress towards reaching one ( or in many cases , several ) of the nbp goals . as the 113th congress considers contentious telecommunications issues such as universal service reform , wireless technology and spectrum policy , and telecommunications regulatory reform , the ongoing progress towards meeting the nbp goals is likely to be part of that debate .
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , amid the perception that the unregulated over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives market contributed to systemic risk , the dodd - frank act ( p.l . 111-203 ) sought to remake the otc market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges . reforms included a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a clearinghouse regulated by one or more federal agencies . clearinghouses require traders to put down cash ( called initial margin ) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses , and they require subsequent deposits ( called maintenance margin ) to cover actual losses to the position . the intended effect of margin requirements is to prevent firms from building up uncapitalized exposures so large that default would have systemic consequences . while addressing systemic concerns , the clearing of derivatives also imposes the cost of posting margin on those trading derivatives . many nonfinancial firms argued during the debate over the dodd - frank act that their use of derivatives posed no systemic threat and thus they should not be subjected to the cost of clearing these otc derivatives . this particular debate came to be known as `` the end user debate . . as a result of these concerns , the dodd - frank act included a broad exemption from the clearing requirement for firms that are primarily nonfinancial in nature . nevertheless , such firms have continued to be concerned that dodd - frank could impose indirect costs on them , or that the rulemaking process by the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and the securities exchange commission ( sec ) could do so . as such , some legislation in the 112th congress , such as h.r . 1610 , s. 947 , s.amdt . 814 to h.r . 2112 , s. 1650 , h.r . 2779 , and h.r . 2682 , addresses potential indirect costs to `` end users . . in addition , concern about derivatives has been fueled by sharp rises in commodity prices — particularly oil — in 2008 and early 2011. such steep jumps , along with high price volatility in a range of commodities , have fostered apprehension that financial speculation in derivatives might be creating such volatility in commodity prices . for instance , during the course of 2008 , oil prices doubled to more than $ 145 per barrel and then fell by 80 % before rebounding , while there was little evidence suggesting disruption of physical supplies . in early 2011 , there was again a run - up of about 20 % , sending gasoline prices to near 2008 highs . such severe fluctuations tend to anger consumers , and thus can become an issue for congress . in the 112th congress , a number of bills , such as h.r . 2328 , s. 1200 , h.r . 3006 , s. 1598 , h.r . 2003 , h.r . 3313 , and s. 1787 seek to address the impact financial speculation and derivatives may have on spot commodity prices . other bills introduced in the 112th congress aim to either tighten or loosen other aspects of derivatives regulation , in the wake of the dodd - frank act , such as h.r . 2586 , h.r . 3045 , h.r . 3283 , and h.r . 1573. this report focuses primarily on legislation introduced in the 112th congress . additional background on how derivatives work , their role in the financial crisis , and the impact of the dodd - frank act on their regulation can be found in another crs report cited below . this report will be updated as events warrant .
this report uses data on the operations of u.s. multinational companies ( mncs ) to examine the extent to which , if any , mncs are moving profits out of high - tax countries ( or out of the u.s. ) and into low - tax countries with little corresponding change in business operations , a practice known as `` profit shifting . . to do this , the profits reported by american firms in two groups of countries are compared with measures of real economic activity in those locations . the first group consists of the five countries commonly identified as being `` tax preferred '' or `` tax haven '' countries , and includes bermuda , ireland , luxembourg , the netherlands , and switzerland . the second group , which provides a baseline for comparison , consists of five more traditional economies . this group includes australia , canada , germany , mexico , and the united kingdom . consistent with the findings of existing research , the analysis presented here appear to show that significant shares of profits are being reported in tax preferred countries and that these shares are disproportionate to the location of the firm 's business activity as indicated by where they hire workers and make investments . for example , american companies reported earning 43 % of overseas profits in bermuda , ireland , luxembourg , the netherlands , and switzerland in 2008 , while hiring 4 % of their foreign workforce and making 7 % of their foreign investments in those economies . in comparison , the traditional economies of australia , canada , germany , mexico and the united kingdom accounted for 14 % of american mncs overseas ' profits , but 40 % of foreign hired labor and 34 % of foreign investment . this report also shows that the discrepancy between where profits are reported and where hiring and investment occurs , as examples of business activity , has increased over time . additional evidence that profit shifting has increased over time is found from a comparison of business profits with economic output ( gross domestic product ) in the two country groups . mnc profits as a share of gross domestic product ( gdp ) in the traditional economies averaged from 1 % to 2 % between 1999 and 2008 , while their profits in the tax preferred countries profits averaged 33 % of gdp in 2008 , up from 27 % in 1999. individual countries within the tax preferred group displayed more dramatic increases in the ratio of profits to gdp . for example , profits reported in bermuda have increased from 260 % of that country 's gdp in 1999 to over 1000 % in 2008. in luxembourg , american business profits went from 19 % of that country 's gdp in 1999 to 208 % of gdp in 2008. this report may be of interest to members of congress for at least four reasons . first , profit shifting has been the specific target of recent congressional action , including a september 2012 hearing held by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations , as well as several bills introduced in the 112th congress . second , anti - abuse provisions have been included in general tax reform proposals in the 112th congress . third , most general tax reform proposals would lower the top corporate rate which would diminish the incentive to shift profits . and fourth , to the extent that profit shifting is reduced , federal tax revenues would increase , although the net effect on federal tax revenues would depend on the existence and magnitude of offsetting revenue changes , which , in turn , would depend on the approach taken to curb profit shifting .
the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , formerly called the food stamp program , is designed primarily to increase the food purchasing power of eligible low - income households to help them buy a nutritionally adequate low - cost diet . this report describes the rules related to eligibility for snap benefits as well as the rules for benefits and their redemption . snap is administered by the u.s. department of agriculture 's food and nutrition service ( usda - fns ) . snap is authorized by the food and nutrition act of 2008. this law , formerly the food stamp act of 1977 , has since 1973 been reauthorized by the `` farm bill , '' omnibus legislation that also typically includes the authorization of other federal agricultural policies and programs . the program was most recently reauthorized by the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 , enacted february 7 , 2014 ) . many farm bill provisions expire in 2018 , and the 115th congress may undertake the next reauthorization of snap . snap eligibility and benefits are calculated on a household basis . financial eligibility is determined through a traditional or a categorical eligibility path . under traditional eligibility , applicant households must meet gross income , net income , and asset tests . specifically , household gross monthly income ( all income as defined by snap law ) must be at or below 130 % of the federal poverty level , and household net ( snap - specified deductions are subtracted ) monthly income must be at 100 % of the federal poverty level . the traditional asset rules are set at $ 2,000 per household ( inflation adjusted ) . ( households that contain an elderly or disabled member have a higher asset limit and also do not have to meet the gross income test . ) . under categorical eligibility , snap eligibility is automatically conveyed based upon the applicant 's participation in other means - tested programs , namely supplemental security income ( ssi ) , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , or general assistance ( ga ) . because tanf is a broad - purpose block grant , the state option to extend snap eligibility to applicants that receive a tanf - funded benefit allows states to offer program eligibility under rules that vary from those discussed in this paragraph , including an elimination of the asset test . applicants are also subject to non - financial rules , which include work - related requirements such as a time limit for able - bodied adults without dependents ( abawds ) . if eligible for snap , an applicant household also undergoes a calculation of its monthly benefit amount ( or allotment ) . this calculation utilizes the household 's net income as well as the maximum allotment , a figure that equals the current value of the `` thrifty food plan '' ( tfp ) . the american recovery and reinvestment act had temporarily increased this value ; this increase ended after october 31 , 2013. benefits are issued on an ebt card , which operates with a declining balance like a debit card . benefits are not cash , may not be accessed at an automatic teller machine , and are redeemable only for foods . benefits may be redeemed for foods at licensed retailers , which may include a wide variety of retailers so long as retailers meet licensing requirements . this report focuses on snap eligibility and the form and function of benefits . for an overview of snap along with the other usda - fns programs , such as the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) , commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) , and national school lunch program ( nslp ) , see crs report r42353 , domestic food assistance : summary of programs . for issues related to snap and the 2014 farm bill , see crs report r43332 , snap and related nutrition provisions of the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) . for a brief overview of the farm bill 's nutrition programs , see crs in focus if10663 , farm bill primer : snap and other nutrition title programs .
the food security act of 1985 ( p.l . 99-198 , 1985 farm bill ) included a number of significant agricultural conservation provisions designed to reduce farm production and conserve soil and water resources . many of the provisions remain in effect today , including the two compliance provisions — highly erodible land conservation ( sodbuster ) and wetland conservation ( swampbuster ) . the two provisions , collectively referred to as conservation compliance , require that in exchange for certain u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) program benefits , a producer agrees to maintain a minimum level of conservation on highly erodible land and not to convert wetlands to crop production . conservation compliance affects most usda benefits administered by the farm service agency ( fsa ) and the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) . these benefits can include commodity support payments , disaster payments , farm loans , and conservation program payments , to name a few . if a producer is found to be in violation of conservation compliance , then a number of penalties could be enforced . these penalties range from temporary exemptions that allow the producer time to correct the violation , to a determination that the producer is ineligible for any usda farm payment and must pay back current and prior years ' benefits . a controversial issue in the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ) debate was whether federal crop insurance subsidies should be included on the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands . ultimately the 2014 farm bill did add federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of benefits that could be lost , but created separate considerations when addressing compliance violations and the loss of federal crop insurance premium subsidies compared with the loss of other farm program benefits . how compliance is calculated , where compliance provisions apply , and traditional exemptions and variances were not amended . the 2014 farm bill also extended limited protection for native sod in select states . the levels of interest and debate generated by the changes to conservation compliance in the 2014 farm bill are likely to continue with implementation , raising additional questions and oversight in congress . recent concerns about a growing backlog of wetland determinations in the northern plains and approaching compliance deadlines for crop insurance policyholders have been raised . additionally , the reduction in soil erosion from highly erodible land conservation continues , but at a slower pace than following the enactment of the 1985 farm bill . the leveling off of erosion reductions leaves broad policy questions related to conservation compliance , including whether an acceptable level of soil erosion on cropland has been achieved ; whether additional reductions could be achieved , and , if so , at what cost ; and how federal farm policy could encourage additional reductions in erosion .
iron emerged in the eighth century b.c . , helping to usher in the use of cavalry instead of chariots . today 's new technologies , including the development of precision - guided weaponry , have given rise to new methods of war fighting , thus bringing dramatic change to the operational battlefield . as will other decision makers , members of congress will confront significant challenges in making their choices about how to adapt to the continually evolving environment , particularly with respect to what are called `` precision strike '' capabilities . the united states took the early lead in the development of precision strike and has enjoyed a monopoly on these systems for over 20 years . however , many experts agree that the u.s. advantage is eroding as these systems spread . a demonstration of this proliferation occurred in 2006 , when hezbollah successfully used a chinese - designed c - 802 anti - ship cruise missile ( ascm ) against an israeli corvette off the coast of lebanon . this event demonstrated a non - state terrorist organization 's successful use of precision strike technology . in addition , access to the global commons is fundamental to global commerce and security — the proliferation of technology could threaten u.s. unfettered access . effective use of precision strike weapons goes beyond that of the weapon itself . the weapon is one part of a much greater , elaborate system of capabilities the actor must either possess or to which it must have access . command , control , communications , computers , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) , in particular , plays a critical role in precision strike . many experts believe the proliferation of precision strike has already begun and will continue to accelerate as more and more countries continue to develop and purchase precision strike weaponry . three such countries include china , iran , and russia . china 's recent military buildup and its strategy with an apparent focus on anti - access / area denial capabilities entails a number of precision strike weapon systems to include the df - 21d anti - ship ballistic missile , which some defense analysts have labeled a `` game changer . . iran , although at a much smaller and less elaborate scale , has also entered the precision - guided munitions regime with an outward belligerence toward closing the economically vital strait of hormuz , where 40 % of the world 's oil passes daily . russia continues to supply arms to the international community and is focusing on developing its own fifth generation fighter comparable to the u.s. f - 22 raptor . finally , a russian defense company is currently marketing a new cruise missile system that can be hidden inside a standard shipping container . the housing of the system blends in with the hundreds of thousands of shipping containers used every day in carrying the world 's commerce . some defense experts have expressed fear that a weapon with such camouflage capability could give any merchant vessel the capability to wipe out an aircraft carrier . the proliferation of precision strike creates potential issues for congress . these issues include whether the department of defense ( dod ) is properly taking adversary precision strike weapons into account in its own plans and programs , and whether congress should approve , reject , or modify proposed dod programs for responding to those weapons .
the u.s. supreme court in district of columbia v. heller held that the second amendment to the u.s. constitution protects an individual right to possess a firearm , unconnected with service in a militia , and the use of that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self - defense within the home . it also held that the second amendment applies to the states in mcdonald v. city of chicago . since then , federal and state firearms laws have been challenged under the second amendment . lower courts have been disputed in determining how to evaluate these provisions , given that the heller decision was not an exhaustive analysis of the scope of the second amendment . this report first discusses the two - step inquiry fashioned by the lower courts to analyze provisions under the second amendment . it proceeds to highlight how this test has been employed on a select number of firearms laws — namely , the federal age requirement and prohibition on possession by those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence ; and state requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit and a state assault weapons ban . how courts have applied the test to these categories may provide some indication as to how future firearms regulations may be considered by the supreme court . the report concludes with a discussion on how varied interpretations by the lower courts of the heller decision may affect the burden upon the federal government to defend firearms provisions , as well as new analytical frameworks that have been suggested .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) administers several educational assistance programs ( gi bills® ) that provide funds to or on behalf of veterans and servicemembers and their family members to facilitate their enrollment in and pursuit of approved programs of education . participation and spending for the post - 9 / 11 gi bill has represented approximately 80 % or more of total gi bill participation and spending in each year since fy2013 . in fy2018 , the program is estimated to benefit almost 800,000 individuals and expend over $ 12 billion . for a description of the other gi bills , see crs report r42785 , gi bills enacted prior to 2008 and related veterans ' educational assistance programs : a primer . the post - 9 / 11 veterans ' educational assistance act of 2008 ( post - 9 / 11 gi bill ) — enacted as title v of the supplemental appropriations act , 2008 ( p.l . 110-252 ) on june 30 , 2008 — is the newest gi bill and went into effect on august 1 , 2009. there were four main drivers for the post - 9 / 11 gi bill : ( 1 ) providing parity of benefits for reservists and members of the regular armed forces , ( 2 ) ensuring comprehensive educational benefits , ( 3 ) meeting military recruiting goals , and ( 4 ) improving military retention through transferability of benefits . the post - 9 / 11 gi bill provides benefits to veterans and servicemembers and their family members . veterans and servicemembers who serve an aggregate minimum of 90 days on active duty after september 10 , 2001 , and continue serving or are discharged honorably may be eligible . in addition , individuals who have been discharged or released for a service - connected disability after serving a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty after september 10 , 2001 , may be eligible . there are two mechanisms by which dependents of individuals with military service may be eligible for post - 9 / 11 gi bill benefits . transferred post - 9 / 11 gi bill benefits may be available to the dependents of servicemembers who serve for at least 10 years . also , the post - 9 / 11 gi bill marine gunnery sergeant john david fry scholarship program may be available to the spouse and children of servicemembers who die while serving on active duty in the line of duty . participants may be eligible for payments to cover tuition and fees , housing , books and supplies , tutorial and relocation assistance , and testing and certification fees . individuals who serve on active duty for 36 months after september 10 , 2001 , may receive a tuition and fees benefit of up to the amount of in - state tuition and fees charged when enrolled in public institutions of higher learning ( ihls ) , or up to $ 22,805.34 when enrolled in private ihls in academic year 2017-2018. in general , the monthly housing allowance is based on the department of defense ( dod ) - determined monthly basic allowance for housing ( bah ) for a member of the armed forces with dependents in pay grade e - 5 and varies depending on location . benefit payments vary depending on the participant 's active duty status , length of qualifying active duty , rate of pursuit , and program of education . for example , participants on active duty are not eligible for a post - 9 / 11 gi bill housing allowance . many post - 9 / 11 gi bill - eligible individuals are eligible for another gi bill or other veterans program that could support educational achievement such as unemployment compensation for ex - servicemembers ( ucx ) . individuals with a single qualifying active duty service period must make an irrevocable election to give up benefits under one other gi bill program to receive benefits under the post - 9 / 11 gi bill . similarly , individuals may not establish post - 9 / 11 gi bill and ucx eligibility based on the same period of service .
the london interbank offer rate ( libor ) is an estimate of prevailing interest rates in london money markets . barclays , a british bank that serves on the panel responding to the libor survey , recently admitted submitting false responses to manipulate the index ( and attempting to manipulate a similar index , the euro interbank offer rate [ euribor ] ) . the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) reached settlements with barclays in which the bank agreed to admit fault and pay a large fine . this report answers several frequently asked questions . how is libor calculated ? . which banks serve on the dollar libor panel ? . how can a single bank manipulate libor ? . how did barclays manipulate libor ? . how is libor used in the u.s. financial systems ? . are there alternatives to libor ? . were u.s. policymakers , such as the federal reserve bank of new york , aware of problems with libor ? .
recently there has been significant congressional interest in compensation of the federal civilian workforce . the increased interest has been driven at least in part by budgetary pressure and in part by the state of the economy since the recession began in 2007. issues related to the compensation of federal employees often center on the pay differential between federal workers and their private sector counterparts . for several years , the annual president 's pay agent ( ppa ) study has shown a large wage penalty for federal workers compared to private sector workers in similar occupations . a few recent studies , however , which use a different analytical approach and data sources , have partially contradicted the findings of the ppa study by concluding that at least some federal workers enjoy a wage premium over comparable private sector workers . these disparate findings make it difficult to determine how compensation of federal employees compares to workers in the private sector . in evaluating claims about federal pay , there appear to be two basic approaches to comparing compensation in the federal and private - sector workforces — the human capital approach and the jobs analysis approach . the human capital approach attempts to account for as many observable characteristics of individual workers as possible ( e.g . , education , experience ) that are known to affect individual compensation . the jobs analysis approach , on the other hand , focuses on matching comparable jobs in different sectors rather than workers with similar demographic characteristics in those sectors . these two approaches are not mutually exclusive but may be difficult to combine given data limitations . each approach is outlined in this report , followed by an examination of a few recent studies comparing federal and private sector compensation . the studies reviewed were chosen because they are official government studies ( president 's pay agent , congressional budget office ) or have received significant attention in policy debates . results from these studies , which at times arrive at vastly different conclusions , provide some useful information about evaluating competing claims related to the compensation of the federal workforce . in general , the more methodologically rigorous `` human capital '' studies show a pay premium for federal workers with lower levels of educational attainment and a pay penalty for federal workers with higher levels of educational attainment . the range of worker and job characteristics is sufficiently broad across sectors that claims about `` average '' workers conceal much of the variation driving differences in compensation . for purposes of policy , the most informative studies show variation in compensation differentials by some control variables . of the five studies under review , one reports an overall average wage penalty for federal workers ( ppa ) , one reports neither an overall average wage premium nor a penalty for federal workers , and three find overall average wage premia for federal workers compared to private sector workers . only two of the studies — cbo and the american enterprise institute ( aei ) — report earnings differentials by level of educational attainment , however . while the aei report shows a clear wage premium across levels of educational attainment , the more methodologically rigorous cbo study finds a more nuanced outcome . that is , federal workers with less than a bachelor 's degree have on average a wage premium compared to private sector counterparts , while federal workers with post - graduate educational attainment on average experience a wage penalty relative to private sector counterparts .
since fy2007 , the u.s. postal service ( usps ) has lost more than $ 25 billion . were it not for congressional action to reduce and defer statutorily required retiree health benefits , the usps would have lost an additional $ 9.5 billion . as the usps 's finances have deteriorated , its ability to absorb operating losses has been diminished . the usps 's current debt is $ 13 billion , $ 2 billion below its maximum statutory borrowing authority . the agency owes $ 11.1 billion in payments to the retiree health benefits fund by september 20 , 2012 , and it currently has less than $ 1 billion in cash . these deficits are particularly problematic since congress designed the postal service to be self - supporting in 1970 and enacted significant postal reforms in 2006. to help stem its losses , the usps has taken a number of steps . foremost , the postal service has downsized its workforce through attrition . since fy2006 , the number of career postal workers has shrunk 21.9 % , to about 544,000 from 696,138. however , the usps has said it is unable to return to solvency through its own actions , and it has asked congress to enact major reforms . numerous postal reform bills have been introduced in the 112th congress ; house and senate appropriators and president barack h. obama also have advanced postal proposals . among postal authorizing legislation , h.r . 2309 and s. 1789 have progressed the furthest toward enactment . the senate passed s. 1789 , the 21st century postal service act , on april 27 , 2012. the house committee on oversight and government reform reported h.r . 2309 , the postal reform act of 2011 , on january 17 , 2012 , and the house rules committee reported h.r . 2309 on march 29 , 2012. both bills include major reforms , such as reductions in service , expansion of the usps 's authority to provide products and services , and alterations to the postal employees pension and healthcare plans . at present , the usps appears to be suffering from both a short - term liquidity crisis ( i.e . , dwindling cash and borrowing authority ) and a long - term structural deficit ( i.e . , stagnating revenues and rising overhead costs ) . to address both of these financial challenges , the usps would have to ( 1 ) improve its liquidity immediately ; ( 2 ) fortify its long - term revenues ; and ( 3 ) control the growth of its long - term costs , all while ( 4 ) continuing to provide universal postal service to the public . both h.r . 2309 and s. 1789 contain provisions to make progress toward achieving each of these goals , albeit in different ways and to different degrees . h.r . 2309 would aim to reduce the usps 's costs through reducing the number of delivery and postal facilities and enacting a variety of usps compensation reforms . s. 1789 would largely preserve present - day postal services and enact a number of incremental cost - cutting policies , such as reducing the usps workers ' compensation outlays . this report will be updated after any further legislative action .
the capitol visitor center ( cvc ) , which opened to the public on december 2 , 2008 , was designed to enhance the security , educational experience , and comfort of those visiting the u.s. capitol . the decision to build a subterranean facility beneath the east front plaza , largely invisible from an exterior perspective , was made so the structure would not compete with , or detract from , the appearance and historical architectural integrity of the capitol . the project 's designers sought to integrate the new structure with the landscape of the east capitol grounds and ultimately recreate the park - like setting intended by landscape architect frederick law olmsted sr. in his historic 1874 design for the site . estimates for the cost of the center were as high as $ 621 million , although the fy2011 appropriations act subsequently included a $ 14.6 million rescission . the project was financed with appropriated funds and $ 65 million from private donations and revenue generated by the sale of commemorative coins . in march 1999 , the architect of the capitol was authorized $ 2.8 million to coordinate a team of architects , engineers , and consultants to review and revalidate a 1995 study of the site selection and project design . in order to simplify the approval process for the design and construction phases , congress transferred authority for these functions to the united states capitol preservation commission in september 1999. three months later , a revised conceptual design for the center was approved by the commission . a design and engineering obligation plan was approved by the house and senate legislative appropriations subcommittees in november 1999 and january 2000 , respectively . on january 31 , 2000 , design development work began , and in mid - october 2000 , the united states capitol preservation commission approved the final design plan for the center . subsequently , a construction management firm was hired to oversee the project ; an $ 8 million contract was awarded to relocate utility lines ; a $ 99.9 million contract was awarded for sequence 1 ( foundation / structural work ) ; and a $ 144.2 million contract was awarded for sequence 2 ( electrical , mechanical , plumbing , and finishing work ) . additionally , a firm also was retained to oversee the development of the cvc exhibition gallery ; a tree maintenance contractor was hired to help assure the protection of trees on the east capitol grounds ; historic preservation workers temporarily removed historic olmsted landscape features from the grounds for their protection ; and temporary visitor screening facilities and media sites were constructed . throughout the entire construction of the nearly 580,000 square foot underground facility , the project was monitored by congressional committees , which held numerous oversight and appropriations request hearings . for information on the use of the capitol visitor center space for official events , see crs report rl34619 , use of the capitol rotunda , capitol grounds , and emancipation hall : concurrent resolutions , 101st to 112th congress , by matthew eric glassman and [ author name scrubbed ] .
carbon capture and sequestration ( or storage ) — known as ccs — is a physical process that involves capturing manmade carbon dioxide ( co2 ) at its source and storing it before its release to the atmosphere . the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) has pursued research and development ( r & d ) of aspects of the three main steps leading to an integrated ccs system since 1997. congress has appropriated nearly $ 7 billion in total since fy2008 for ccs research , development , and demonstration ( rd & d ) at doe 's office of fossil energy : nearly $ 3.5 billion in total annual appropriations ( including fy2015 ) and $ 3.4 billion from the american recovery and reinvestment act ( recovery act ; p.l . 111-5 ) . the large influx of recovery act funding for industrial - scale ccs projects was intended to accelerate development and deployment of ccs in the united states . since enactment of the recovery act , doe has shifted its rd & d emphasis to the demonstration phase of carbon capture technology . to date , however , there are no commercial ventures in the united states that capture , transport , and inject industrial - scale quantities of co2 solely for the purpose of carbon sequestration . the success of doe ccs demonstration projects likely will influence the outlook for widespread deployment of ccs technologies as a strategy for preventing large quantities of co2 from reaching the atmosphere while u.s. power plants continue to burn fossil fuels , mainly coal . one project , the kemper county facility , has received $ 270 million from doe under its clean coal power initiative ( ccpi ) round 2 program and is slated to begin commercial operation in 2016. the 582 megawatt - capacity facility anticipates capturing 65 % of its co2 emissions , making it equivalent to a new natural gas - fired combined cycle power plant . cost and schedule overruns at the kemper plant , however , have raised questions over the relative value of environmental benefits from ccs technology compared with construction costs of the facility and its effect on ratepayers . in 2014 , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) proposed emission standards for new and existing fossil - fueled electric generating units under section 111 of the clean air act . new natural gas - fired stationary power plants should be able to meet the proposed standard for new plants without additional cost and without the need for add - on control technology . however , the only apparent technical way for new coal - fired plants to meet the standard would be to install ccs technology . the proposed rule has sparked increased scrutiny of the future of ccs as a viable technology for reducing co2 emissions from coal - fired power plants . given the pending epa rule , congressional interest in the future of coal as a domestic energy source appears directly linked to the future of ccs . debate has been mixed as to whether the rule would spur development and deployment of ccs for new coal - fired power plants or have the opposite effect . congressional oversight of the ccs rd & d program could help inform decisions about the level of support for the program and help congress gauge whether it is on track to meet its goals . in the 114th congress , a bill has been introduced ( s. 601 ) that would promote ccs for coal - fired utilities by a combination of loan guarantees , tax credits , and supporting the doe r & d effort in its coal program , among other things . a similar bill was introduced in the 113th congress but was not enacted . one issue is whether congressional oversight is needed of the ccs r & d program , particularly of the results from the demonstration projects as they progress . such a review could help congress evaluate whether doe is on track to meet its goal of allowing for an advanced ccs technology portfolio to be ready by 2020 for large - scale demonstration and deployment in the united states .
dating back to the 1950s , federal sourcing policy generally has focused on the premise that the government should rely on the private sector for the provision of certain goods and services . additionally , it has centered around guidance for conducting public - private competitions to determine whether federal employees , or contractor employees , should be selected to perform certain agency functions . the administration of president george w. bush , in particular , emphasized subjecting eligible agency functions to public - private competitions . branding this policy , and related guidance , as competitive sourcing , the bush administration included it as one component of the president 's management agenda . during the administration of president barack obama , another strain , or facet , of sourcing policy surfaced . labeled multi - sector workforce management by the administration , it posits that federal agencies might be susceptible to overreliance on contractors , which could affect the ability of agencies to maintain control over their missions and operations . omb 's july 2009 memorandum provides guidance to agencies on how to manage their multi - sector workforces . the office of federal procurement policy 's policy letter 11-01 — by providing a single , consistent definition of inherently governmental and guidance for identifying and managing inherently governmental functions , functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions , and critical functions — complements the administration 's multi - sector workforce management policy . this letter was issued in september 2011. congressional interest in sourcing policy , generally , has been evident for some time . for example , in 1998 , the federal activities inventory reform ( fair ) act ( p.l . 105-270 ) was signed into law . it requires certain federal agencies to compile , and submit annually to omb , inventories of their commercial activities , which are activities that may be performed by federal employees or a government contractor . recent signs of interest in sourcing policy include two substantively similar but identically titled bills that were introduced during the 112th congress . h.r . 1474 and s. 785 , the freedom from government competition act , contain provisions that would expand upon existing policies designed to encourage federal government reliance on the private sector for the provision of both goods and services . this report provides an overview of the evolution of federal sourcing policy to date and identifies the major policy issues before congress . it is not a legislation tracking report . this report will be updated as events warrant .
in accordance with united states law , the u.s. government places conditions on the use of defense articles and defense services transferred by it to foreign recipients . violation of these conditions can lead to the suspension of deliveries or termination of the contracts for such defense items , among other things . on occasion , the president has indicated that such violations by foreign countries `` may '' have occurred , raising the prospect that termination of deliveries to or imposition of other penalties on such nations might take place . section 3 ( a ) of the arms export control act ( aeca ) sets the general standards for countries or international organizations to be eligible to receive united states defense articles and defense services provided under this act . it also sets express conditions on the uses to which these defense items may be put . section 4 of the arms export control act states that u.s. defense articles and defense services shall be sold to friendly countries `` solely '' for use in `` internal security , '' for use in `` legitimate self - defense , '' to enable the recipient to participate in `` regional or collective arrangements or measures consistent with the charter of the united nations , '' to enable the recipient to participate in `` collective measures requested by the united nations for the purpose of maintaining or restoring international peace and security , '' and to enable the foreign military forces `` in less developed countries to construct public works and to engage in other activities helpful to the economic and social development of such friendly countries . . section 3 ( c ) ( 2 ) of the arms export control act requires the president to report promptly to the congress upon the receipt of information that a `` substantial violation '' described in section 3 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the aeca `` may have occurred . . this presidential report need not reach any conclusion regarding the possible violation or provide any particular data other than that necessary to illustrate that the president has received information indicating a specific country may have engaged in a `` substantial violation '' of an applicable agreement with the united states that governs the sale of u.s. defense articles or services . should the president determine and report in writing to congress or if congress determines through enactment of a joint resolution pursuant to section 3 ( c ) ( 3 ) ( a ) of the arms export control act that a `` substantial violation '' by a foreign country of an applicable agreement governing an arms sale has occurred , then that country becomes ineligible for further u.s. military sales under the aeca . this action would terminate provision of credits , loan guarantees , cash sales , and deliveries pursuant to previous sales . since the major revision of u.s. arms export law in 1976 , neither the president nor the congress have actually determined that a violation did occur thus necessitating the termination of deliveries or sales or other penalties set out in section 3 of the arms export control act . the united states government has other options under the arms export control act to prevent transfer of defense articles and services for which valid contracts exist short of finding a foreign country in violation of an applicable agreement with the united states . these options include suspension of deliveries of defense items already ordered and refusal to allow new arms orders . the united states has utilized at least one such option against argentina , israel , indonesia , and turkey .
the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act authorizes the president to issue declarations that provide states , tribes , and localities with a range of federal assistance in response to natural and man - made incidents . since 1953 the frequency of declarations has increased . for example , the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 1960 to 1969 was roughly 18.6 per year . in contrast , the average number of major disaster declarations issued from 2000 to 2009 was 57.1 per year . the highest number was declared in 2011 , with 97 major disaster declarations . declarations are of concern to members of congress and state delegations when incidents occur in their states and / or congressional districts . declarations are also of broader congressional interest for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the costs involved with the federal assistance provided by the declarations , and ( 2 ) concerns that declarations may be used as political tools — especially during election years . analysis of stafford act declarations from 1953 to 2016 demonstrates that : most emergency declarations are for winter storms and hurricanes ; most major disaster declarations are for floods , tornados , winter storms , and hurricanes ; the average number of declarations issued per year in presidential election years from 1974 to 2016 is slightly higher than the average number of declarations in other years from 1974 to 2016 , but the number is not significant enough to draw a decisive conclusion regarding their use as a political tool . after providing an overview of each type of declaration , this report discusses factors that may be responsible for the increase in frequency of declarations , including federal policy changes , increases in severe weather incidents , population growth , and development . some may contend that declaration policies should not be changed because they trigger important federal assistance to states and localities . others argue that policies should be implemented to reduce either the number of declarations being issued each year , or the amount of federal assistance that they provide , or both . these policies include amending certain stafford act policies ; changing the per capita threshold formula used to recommend the issuance of a declaration ; implementing a state capacity indicator to assess whether the state is capable of addressing an incident on its own ; substituting federal loans to states for recovery grants ; and adjusting the federal to state cost - share . such changes could reduce declarations and shift a portion of the funding back to the states . on the other hand , reducing declarations could hamper the ability of states and localities to recover from an incident and could create long - term consequences . the selected approach will likely be influenced by how policymakers view the role of the government when a disaster strikes . it is generally agreed that the government should help disaster victims in times of need , but it is debatable whether the fiscal responsibility resides primarily with the federal or the state government . many of the policy options described in this report shift a greater share of disaster - related costs to states and localities . it remains to be seen if reducing declarations and / or limiting the amount of disaster assistance provided to requesting states would severely disrupt the state 's ability to respond and recover from an incident . this report concludes that the upward trend in declarations will likely continue if declaration policies remain unchanged and severe weather patterns , population growth , and development continue to increase . all of these variables appear to play a role in declaration activity . it could be argued that the policy mechanisms used to address the increase in declarations should be shaped in response to the given variable or variables . this may prove to be difficult because it is unclear which of the variables ( or combination of variables ) has had the greatest impact on the increase in disaster declarations over the years . this report will be updated as events warrant .
various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country . in particular , domestic on - shore unconventional oil and gas development , such as hydraulic fracturing , has caused rapid growth in freshwater demand . to accommodate water supply requests in the missouri river basin , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) has proposed the use of surplus water from its garrison dam / lake sakakawea project in north dakota . the corps ' proposal would allow it to enter into five - year contracts to supply surplus water for a fee , which will be set through administrative rulemaking . north dakota and other states have objected to the corps ' proposal as a violation of their constitutional right to water flowing within their borders , arguing that the corps can not require payment for water that the state owns . although the legality of the corps ' charging for surplus water storage at its facilities has not been litigated specifically , the corps ' constitutional authority over operations at its reservoirs is generally very broad . additionally , congress has authorized the corps to charge for surplus storage at federal projects such as the garrison dam / lake sakakawea project . of course , statutory approval of an action that may interfere with state sovereignty does not connote constitutionality . other provisions within the corps ' statutory authorities arguably may indicate that congress did not intend to infringe upon state sovereignty over water rights within its boundaries . while it appears that the corps has broad authority to impound waters owned by the state for the purposes of a particular project without necessarily acquiring water rights under state law , it may be argued that surplus water , which is not used for any of the authorized purposes , is beyond the control of the corps . however , the viability of such an argument is unclear , given the lack of legal precedent on the issue . this report addresses the legal authority of the corps to charge for surplus water stored at its facilities . it analyzes the constitutional and statutory authority of the federal government to operate federal water projects , specifically lake sakakawea , along the missouri river . it also examines the nature of states ' claims of ownership of waters within state boundaries . finally , the report discusses the relationship between federal and state authority , including examples in which congress addressed competing federal and state roles .
over the years , congress has authorized and the federal government has administered programs to provide food to the hungry and to other vulnerable populations in this country . this report offers a brief overview of hunger and food insecurity along with the related network of programs . the report is structured around three main tables that contain information about each program , including its authorizing language , administering agency , eligibility criteria , services provided , participation data , and funding information . in between the tables , contextual information about this policy area and program administration is provided that may assist congress in tracking developments in domestic food assistance . this report provides a bird 's - eye view of domestic food assistance and can be used both to learn about the details of individual programs as well as compare and contrast features across programs . this report includes overview information for the u.s. department of agriculture 's food and nutrition service ( usda - fns ) programs as well as nutrition programs administered by the administration on aging ( aoa ) , within the u.s. department of health and human services ' administration for community living ( hhs - acl ) . usda - fns nutrition programs include those most recently reauthorized by the 2014 farm bill ( the agricultural act of 2014 ; p.l . 113-79 ) . programs included in the farm bill are the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , the emergency food assistance program ( tefap ) , commodity supplemental food program ( csfp ) , fresh fruit and vegetable program ( ffvp ) , and the senior farmers ' market nutrition program ( sfmnp ) . usda - fns also administers programs not contained in the farm bill : the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) and child nutrition programs ( school breakfast program [ sbp ] , national school lunch program [ nslp ] , summer food service program [ sfsp ] , special milk program [ smp ] , and child and adult care food program [ cacfp ] ) . hhs - acl programs are the nutrition programs contained in the older americans act ( oaa ) — congregate nutrition program ; home delivered nutrition program ; grants to native americans : supportive and nutrition services ; and the nutrition services incentive program ( nsip ) .
federal law requires the president to submit an annual budget to congress no later than the first monday in february . the budget informs congress of the president 's overall federal fiscal policy based on proposed spending levels , revenues , and deficit ( or surplus ) levels . the budget request lays out the president 's relative priorities for federal programs , such as how much should be spent on defense , education , health , and other federal programs . the president 's budget may also include legislative proposals for spending and tax policy changes . while the president is not required to propose legislative changes for those parts of the budget that are governed by permanent law , such as medicare benefits , such changes are generally included in the budget . president obama submitted his fy2013 budget to congress on february 13 , 2012. the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) is the division of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) that is responsible for administering medicare , medicaid , and the children 's health insurance program ( chip ) , among other activities . the president 's budget estimates cms 's net mandatory and discretionary outlays will be $ 829.4 billion in fy2013 , which is an increase of $ 72.3 billion , or 9.5 % , over the net outlays for fy2012 . this estimate includes a medicare physician payment adjustment , the estimated impact of the legislative proposals , and the estimated savings from program integrity investments . for budgetary purposes , cms is divided into the following sections : medicare , medicaid , chip , program integrity , state grants and demonstrations , private health insurance protections and programs , the center for medicare and medicaid innovation , and program management . the president 's fy2013 budget contains a number of legislative proposals that would affect the cms budget . some are program expansions , and others are designed to reduce federal spending . this report summarizes the president 's budget estimates for each section of the cms budget . then , for each legislative proposal included in the president 's budget , this report provides a description of current law and the president 's proposal . the explanations of the president 's legislative proposals are grouped by the following program areas : medicare , medicaid , program integrity , and health insurance programs . at the end of each of these sections , there is a table summarizing the estimated costs or savings for each legislative proposal .
a presidential election period is a unique time in america and holds the promise of opportunity , as well as a possible risk to the nation 's security interests . while possible changes in administration during u.s. involvement in national security - related activities are not unique to the 2012-2013 election period , many observers suggest that the current security environment may portend a time of increased risk to the current presidential election period . whether the enemies of the united states choose to undertake action that may harm the nation 's security interests during the 2012-2013 election period , or the existing or new president experiences a relatively peaceful period during the transition , many foreign policy and security challenges will await the administration . collaboration and coordination during the presidential election period between the current administration and that of a potentially new one may have a long - lasting effect on the new president 's ability to effectively safeguard u.s. interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president . this report discusses historical national security - related presidential transition activities , provides a representative sampling of national security issues a new administration may encounter , and offers considerations and options relevant to each of the five phases of the presidential election period . each phase has distinct challenges and opportunities for the incoming administration , the outgoing administration , and congress . this report is intended to provide a framework for national security considerations during the current election period and will be updated to reflect the election outcome .
canadian oil sands and climate change recent congressional interest in u.s. energy policy has focused in part on ways through which the united states could secure more economical and reliable petroleum resources both domestically and internationally . many forecasters identify petroleum products refined from canadian oil sands as one possible solution . increased production from canadian oil sands , however , is not without controversy , as many have expressed concern over the potential environmental impacts . these impacts include emissions of greenhouse gases ( ghg ) during resource extraction and processing . a number of key studies in recent literature have expressed findings that ghg emissions per unit of energy produced from canadian oil sands crudes are higher than those of other crudes imported , refined , and consumed in the united states . the studies identify two main reasons for the difference : ( 1 ) oil sands are heavier and more viscous than lighter crude oil types on average , and thus require more energy - and resource - intensive activities to extract ; and ( 2 ) oil sands are chemically deficient in hydrogen , and have a higher carbon , sulfur , and heavy metal content than lighter crude oil types on average , and thus require more processing to yield consumable fuels by u.s. standards . selected findings from the primary published studies crs surveyed the published literature , including the u.s. state department - commissioned studies for the keystone xl pipeline project in both the 2011 final environmental impact statement and the 2014 final supplementary environmental impact statement . the primary literature reveals the following : canadian oil sands crudes are generally more ghg emission - intensive than other crudes they may displace in u.s. refineries , and emit an estimated 17 % more ghgs on a life - cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the united states ; compared to selected imports , well - to - wheels ghg emissions for canadian oil sands crudes range from 9 % to 19 % more emission - intensive than middle eastern sour , 5 % to 13 % more emission - intensive than mexican maya , and 2 % to 18 % more emission - intensive than various venezuelan crudes ; compared to selected energy - and resource - intensive crudes , well - to - wheels ghg emissions for canadian oil sands crudes are within range of heavier crudes such as venezuelan bachaquero and californian kern river , as well as lighter crudes that are produced from operations that flare associated gas ( e.g . , nigerian bonny light ) ; discounting the final consumption phase of the life - cycle assessment ( which can contribute up to 70 % - 80 % of well - to - wheels emissions ) , well - to - tank ( i.e . , `` production '' ) ghg emissions for canadian oil sands crudes are 9 % - 102 % higher than for selected imports ; the estimated effect of the keystone xl pipeline on global ghg emissions remains uncertain , as some speculate that its construction would encourage an expansion of oil sands investment and development , while others suggest that the project would not substantially influence either the rate or magnitude of oil extraction activities in canada or the overall volume of crude oil transported to and refined in the united states . scope and purpose of this report congressional interest in the ghg emissions attributable to canadian oil sands crudes has encompassed both a broad understanding of the resource as well as a specific assessment of the proposed keystone xl pipeline . this report focuses on the broader resource . it discusses the methodology of life - cycle assessment and compares several of the publicly available studies of ghg emissions data for canadian oil sands crudes against each other and against those of other global reference crudes . for a detailed analysis of the ghg emissions attributable to the proposed keystone xl pipeline , and the findings from the state department 's final environmental impact statement , see crs report r43415 , keystone xl : greenhouse gas emissions assessments in the final environmental impact statement .
title vii of the public health service act ( phsa ) supports health professions education and training through grants to and contractual agreements with institutions , and direct assistance to individuals . institutions may receive title vii support for such activities as residency programs at medical and dental schools , recruitment and retention initiatives in community - based educational settings , and health workforce data collection and analysis within state health departments . individuals typically receive direct assistance through scholarships , loans , loan repayments , or fellowships . title vii authorizes several advisory groups to make recommendations to the secretary of health and human services and congress on various health workforce programs and title vii functions . the health resources and services administration ( hrsa ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , oversees programs authorized in title vii . the health care workforce — the backbone of the health care delivery system — includes physicians , nurses , dentists , therapists , and others who deliver health services to individuals in physicians ' offices , health centers , clinics , and other community - based health care settings . in 2010 , congress reauthorized title vii health workforce programs and activities in the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) . the aca also added several new authorities that aim to build and sustain the health care workforce alongside other provisions for health reform , including health insurance expansion . the 113th congress has held hearings and introduced legislation to address the adequacy of the health care workforce . health policy experts anticipate that aca provisions for health insurance expansion could lead to an increased demand for health service utilization , and they expect that this increased demand for services could prompt increased demand for health providers , including physicians and nurses . other factors causing concern about the adequacy of the health workforce include uneven provider distribution , attrition and retirement , and demands of the aging population . legislative interest or action may focus on the impact of title vii programs on education and training in the health professions . this report describes and summarizes title vii programs . it describes federal support for institutions and individuals in efforts to expand and sustain the pipeline for health professions education and training . appendix a summarizes aca initiatives for health workforce provisions related to title vii .
long - term services and supports ( ltss ) refer to a broad range of health and health - related services and supports needed by individuals who lack the capacity for self - care due to a physical , cognitive , or mental disability or condition . often the individual 's disability or condition results in the need for hands - on assistance or supervision over an extended period of time . medicaid plays a key role in covering ltss to aged and disabled individuals . as the largest single payer of ltss in the united states , federal and state medicaid spending accounted for $ 149.4 billion or 42.5 % of all ltss expenditures in 2015 ( $ 351.8 billion ) . ltss are also a substantial portion of spending within the medicaid program relative to the population served , accounting for 31 % of all medicaid spending in 2015. of the 68.5 million total enrolled medicaid population , an estimated 4.1 million ( or 5.9 % ) received ltss in fy2013 . medicaid funds ltss for eligible beneficiaries in both institutional and home and community - based settings , though the portfolio of services offered differs substantially by state . moreover , states are required to offer certain medicaid institutional services to eligible beneficiaries , while the majority of medicaid home and community - based services ( hcbs ) are optional for states . in recent decades , federal authority has expanded to assist states in increasing and diversifying their medicaid ltss coverage to include hcbs . as a result , the share of medicaid ltss spending for hcbs has nearly tripled , accounting for 18 % of medicaid ltss spending in 1995 to over half ( 53 % ) of total medicaid ltss spending in fy2014 . states now have a broad range of coverage options to select from when designing their ltss programs . in general , medicaid law provides states with two broad authorities , which either cover certain ltss as a benefit under the medicaid state plan or cover home and community - based ltss through a waiver program which permits states to disregard certain medicaid requirements in the provision of these services , subject to approval . the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) established or extended several medicaid state plan options and grant activities to enhance or expand states ' ltss delivery systems . given the range of available coverage options , states continue to enhance or expand their ltss delivery systems to cover additional services or target services to specific populations with a focus on hcbs . in fy2016 and fy2017 , most states reported activities to expand hcbs ( 46 and 47 states , respectively ) , which include expanding section 1915 ( c ) hcbs waiver authority programs or the section 1915 ( i ) hcbs state plan option , among other programmatic changes . this report provides a description of the various statutory authorities that either require or otherwise allow states to cover ltss under medicaid . appendix a provides a brief legislative history of medicaid ltss from medicaid 's enactment and initial coverage requirements for institutional care through the evolution of hcbs options available to states . a discussion of changes to medicaid made by the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) with respect to ltss coverage options is also provided . the tables in appendix b provide state information about coverage of medicaid state plan optional benefits .
the federal budget deficit was the largest it has been since world war ii as a percentage of gdp from 2009 to 2012 , peaking at 10.1 % of gdp . this occurred because spending reached its highest share of gdp since 1945 and revenues reached their lowest share of gdp since 1950. since then , the deficit has declined to a projected 2.8 % of gdp in 2014 , which is still above the 1946 to 2008 average . over the next 25 years , deficits are projected to become very large again under current law . the recent decline in the deficit is partly due to improvements in the economy , the expiration of temporary measures taken in response to the recession , and spending cuts ( mainly to discretionary spending ) . spending was cut by the budget control act of 2011 ( bca ; p.l . 112-25 ) and the reduction in overseas contingency operations ( oco ) , primarily in iraq and afghanistan . since september 2008 , legislative changes to spending have added a cumulative $ 1.12 trillion to deficits and legislative changes to revenues , mainly the extension of expiring tax provisions , have added $ 1.75 trillion to deficits , excluding resulting interest costs . looking forward , several uncertainties are inherent in the baseline that may lead to different outcomes than projected . there have been large errors to budget projections historically , in part because economic forecasting is subject to large errors . the budget has also proven to be highly sensitive to recessions , and cbo does not project a recession in its 10-year projection . budget projections also do not assume any significant changes in spending on future wars or disasters . the baseline projection follows current law , assuming that the `` doc fix '' and tax `` extenders '' will expire as scheduled . if congress temporarily extends either , as it has done regularly in the past , the deficit will be larger than projected . in the long run , legislative changes will be needed to reduce spending or increase taxes to keep the debt on a sustainable path . postponing action requires larger changes to be made in the long run , and limits the ability to phase in changes gradually . economists view the debt as currently unsustainable because it is projected to grow faster than gross domestic product ( gdp ) indefinitely under current policy , causing an ever growing share of national income to be devoted to servicing the debt . the main source of long - term fiscal unsustainability is the growth in elderly entitlement spending . in particular , spending on major health programs , such as medicare and medicaid , is assumed to continue to grow faster than gdp , as it has historically . overall , mandatory spending has grown as a share of gdp , rising from 4.7 % of gdp , when data were first compiled in 1962 , to a projected 12.3 % of gdp in 2014 , and is projected to continue rising . by contrast , discretionary spending has fallen from 12.3 % of gdp in 1962 to a projected 6.8 % of gdp in 2014 , and under the baseline it is projected to decline to its lowest share of gdp ever , primarily because of the bca 's statutory caps . revenues are projected to stay near their historical average over the next 10 years . economic theory predicts that deficits have a stimulative effect on the economy during recessions , but harm economic growth by resulting in an increase in interest rates or the trade deficit during economic booms . thus , the state of the economy is a consideration for the timing of deficit reduction . options for deficit reduction on the spending side are constrained by the fact that social security , medicare , net interest , and defense discretionary spending make up almost two - thirds of total spending . on the revenue side , 80 % of revenue is raised by income and payroll taxes .
the passage of the 1996 telecommunications act ( p.l . 104-104 ) resulted in a major revision of the communications act of 1934 ( 47 u.s.c . 151 et seq . ) . to address the emergence of competition in what were previously considered to be monopolistic markets . since its passage , however , the advancement of broadband technology to supply data , voice , and video ; the growing convergence of the telecommunications and media sectors ; and the growth in demand for usable radio - frequency spectrum has led to a consensus that the laws that govern these sectors have become inadequate to address this rapidly changing environment and have , according to a growing number of policymakers , made it necessary to consider revising the current regulatory framework . this report provides an overview of selected topics that , while far from a definitive list , provide a broad overview of issues that are central to the telecommunications / media convergence debate . the issues covered in this report include broadband deployment , broadband regulation and access , broadcast media ownership rules , funding for the corporation for public broadcasting , emergency communications , legal issues regarding facilities siting , federal communications commission oversight and reform , internet governance and the domain name system , reauthorization of statutory copyright and communications provisions in the satellite television extension and localism act , spectrum policy and wireless broadband deployment , and universal service fund reform . rather than addressing the specific legislative , regulatory , and industry activities , this report provides an overview of these major issues . the crs products listed under `` for further information , '' found at the end of each issue topic , should be used to expand upon the issue , provide an update of relevant events , track congressional activity , and identify crs analysts who are knowledgeable in these issue areas . this report will be updated occasionally .
the agricultural act of 2014 ( 2014 farm bill , p.l . 113-79 ) was enacted on february 7 , 2014. after years of debate and deliberation , the enacted 2014 farm bill included a number of changes to the conservation title ( title ii ) , including program consolidation and reauthorization , amendments to conservation compliance , and a reduction in overall funding . debate on the 2014 farm bill focused on a number of controversial issues . while many did not consider conservation to be controversial , nonetheless , a number of policy issues shaped the final version of the title and ultimately its role in the enacted farm bill . prior to the 2014 farm bill , there were over 20 distinct conservation programs . discussion about simplifying or consolidating conservation programs to reduce overlap and duplication , and to generate savings , has continued for a number of years . the 2014 farm bill contained several program consolidation measures , including the repeal of 12 active and inactive programs , the creation of two new programs , and the merging of two programs into existing ones . overall changes include the following . the act reauthorizes larger conservation programs through fy2018 , including the environmental quality incentives program ( eqip ) , the conservation stewardship program ( csp ) , and the conservation reserve program ( crp ) . it authorizes a new agricultural conservation easement program ( acep ) , which retains most of the program provisions in the repealed easement programs ( wetlands reserve program [ wrp ] , easements under the grasslands reserve program [ grp ] , and farmland protection program [ fpp ] ) . acep establishes two types of easements : agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements . it authorizes a new regional conservation partnership program ( rcpp ) from the repealed partnership programs ( agricultural water enhancement program [ awep ] , cooperative conservation partnership initiative [ ccpi ] , chesapeake bay watershed program [ cbwp ] , and great lakes basin program for soil erosion and sediment control [ glbp ] ) . rcpp creates partnership opportunities to target and leverage federal conservation funding for specific areas and resource concerns . it incorporates other programs , such as the wildlife habitat incentives program ( whip ) and grazing contracts under grp , into larger reauthorized programs — eqip and crp , respectively . one of the most controversial issues in the 2014 farm bill debate was whether federal crop insurance subsidies should be included on the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer were found to be out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands . ultimately the 2014 farm bill did add federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of benefits that could be lost and extended limited protection for native sod in select states . the 2014 farm bill also reduced funding for the conservation title by $ 3.97 billion over 10 years . most farm bill conservation programs are authorized to receive mandatory funding , and the conservation title makes up 6 % of the total farm bill 10-year baseline , or $ 58 billion of the total $ 956 billion in mandatory funding authorized in the 2014 farm bill .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 and p.l . 111-152 ) contains several provisions to encourage employer - sponsored health coverage , particularly among small businesses . the provisions that most directly relate to small businesses are ( 1 ) an employer penalty for not providing health insurance , ( 2 ) a tax credit to increase the affordability of health care for the smallest firms , and ( 3 ) small business health insurance exchanges designed to increase plan options and lower plan costs . several events have altered the aca 's implementation since its enactment in 2010. most notably , the obama administration delayed the implementation of the employer penalty and part of the small business health exchanges from 2014 to 2015 to allow more time for developing these provisions and allowing firms to come into compliance . subsequently , the administration suspended the penalty for employers with fewer than 100 full - time equivalent ( fte ) employees for an additional year ( until 2016 ) . these delays have added to uncertainty over the potential effects of the aca on small businesses . first , this report explains how employer - sponsored insurance can be used to address concerns about health insurance coverage and cost . second , it summarizes the three aca provisions most relevant to small businesses , listed above . next , it analyzes these provisions for their potential effects on small businesses . finally , this report presents several approaches that could address some concerns associated with these provisions ( particularly the employer penalty ) . according to analysis of the most recent employer size and insurance coverage data , the aca 's employer penalty is structured so that it could exempt approximately 96.2 % of employer firms simply because these firms would be too small and thus fall below the employer penalty threshold of 50 fte employees . these exempt firms account for approximately 27.6 % of all workers . after accounting for firms that already provide insurance , less than 1 % of employer firms could be subject to the employer penalty . although 72.4 % of all employees work for firms that are large enough to be potentially subject to the penalty , only about 2.4 % of employees work in firms that do not already offer health insurance . less than 4 % of small businesses that could have been eligible for the small business health care tax credit in 2010 actually claimed it . according to a report by the government accountability office ( gao ) , many business owners felt that ( 1 ) the credit was too small of an incentive to begin offering insurance ; ( 2 ) even if these small employers offered health insurance , some employees declined coverage because they could not afford their share of the premium ; and ( 3 ) the rules were too complex . president obama has proposed simplifying and expanding the credit . small business health exchanges could help to reduce some barriers to accessing relatively affordable health coverage in the small - group market . by pooling risk among multiple businesses and reducing administrative costs , average insurance costs could reduce costs for these firms . firms with relatively healthier employees , however , could see a rise in insurance costs . one issue of concern is the incentive for firms to reduce part - time employee hours below the 30 hours that define full - time employment ( under the aca ) as a means to exclude these employees from coverage . the save american workers act of 2015 ( h.r . 30 , approved by the house on january 8 , 2015 ) would increase the definition of full - time to at least 40 hours per week . this change would reduce the incentive at 30 hours per week , but it also would introduce an incentive to reduce hours among those who work around 40 hours ( a larger share of all workers ) .
the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ( wrrda 2014 , p.l . 113-121 ) became law on june 10 , 2014. the conference report , h.rept . 113-449 , resolved differences between h.r . 3080 , the water resources reform and development act of 2013 ( wrrda 2013 ) , and s. 601 , the water resources development act of 2013 ( wrda 2013 ) . both bills represented omnibus authorization legislation for water resource activities , principally associated with the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) . authorizing and deauthorizing projects . wrrda 2014 authorized 34 construction projects totaling $ 25.65 billion ( $ 15.64 billion federal , $ 10.01 billion nonfederal ) . it established expedited house and senate procedures for bills authorizing construction projects meeting specified criteria . it requires an annual report from the administration identifying proposed new studies , completed feasibility reports , and project modification reports . wrrda 2014 also authorized a process to deauthorize previously authorized projects with federal costs to complete totaling $ 18 billion ; the process will be led by the administration , with opportunities for public input and congressional disapproval . expediting studies , environmental reviews , and permits . the conference report , like h.r . 3080 and s. 601 , aimed to expedite corps studies and compliance with applicable environmental laws , including the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) . it raised the project cost trigger for independent peer review of feasibility studies from $ 45 million to $ 200 million . expanding project delivery and financing opportunities . the conference report , like h.r . 3080 and s. 601 , encouraged nonfederal opportunities in delivering water resources projects . it expanded opportunities for crediting for nonfederal work , financial , and study and project management . like s. 601 , the conference report established a pilot program known as the water infrastructure finance and innovation act ( wifia ) to finance water infrastructure projects . the corps and the u.s. environmental protection agency are responsible for administering the wifia pilot program . investing in navigation . wrrda 2014 encouraged increased spending from the harbor maintenance trust fund ( hmtf ) . it modified prioritization of hmtf funding among different types of harbors but retains similar provisions contained in h.r . 3080 and s. 601 reserving certain portions of funds to harbors with less cargo . the conference report , like h.r . 3080 and s. 601 , did not enact changes to inland waterway revenues in general but increased the threshold for major rehabilitation efforts on inland waterways , authorized changes to waterway project delivery , and altered the cost - share for one project ( olmsted locks and dam ) . these changes may increase the likelihood of inland waterways trust fund ( iwtf ) monies being available for use on other inland waterway construction projects . reducing flood risks . wrrda 2014 authorized establishment of a levee safety initiative — a scaled - down version of s. 601 provisions — expanding corps technical assistance and training to promote levee safety , federal emergency management agency ( fema ) assistance in establishing or improving state and tribal levee safety programs , and corps levee rehabilitation assistance . like h.r . 3080 and s. 601 , wrrda 2014 required the corps to develop national levee safety guidelines and review . restoring and protecting aquatic ecosystems . wrrda 2014 provided congressional direction on various efforts for regional river and coastal restoration ( e.g . , chesapeake bay , north atlantic coastal restoration ) and authorized the construction of projects which have previously been studied in the everglades and coastal louisiana , among other places . it also added to corps authorities for the prevention , control , and eradication of invasive species . addressing other issues . wrrda 2014 included provisions amending the applicability of the scope of the environmental protection agency 's oil spill prevention , control , and countermeasure regulations , by exempting certain farms from the requirements . it also included amendments to certain water infrastructure provisions of the clean water act ( cwa ) . these cwa provisions , while representing the first amendments to cwa title vi since 1987 , did not address many of the more long - standing or controversial cwa issues . wrrda 2014 did not include the ocean - related provisions of h.r . 3080 and s. 601. instead , it authorized the corps studies and limited construction of corps projects to enhance ocean and coastal ecosystem resiliency .
consumer financial card fraud due to data breaches of card information is an ongoing problem in the united states . the majority of breaches are carried out against point - of - sale ( pos ) systems , and are facilitated by what many consider to be the weak link in the u.s. retail sales payment process : the continued use of magnetic stripe cards ( also referred to as stripe - and - signature cards ) . these cards are still what most u.s. consumers think of when referring to financial cards . in much of the rest of the world , cards that provide a much higher level of security for conducting sales transactions have been used for many years : emv cards , named for the coalition of card brands europay , mastercard , and visa ( the emv coalition or emvco ) that developed the specifications for the system in the 1990s . emv cards store card information on an embedded microchip and are more commonly called chip cards . with these cards , instead of swiping and signing to make a payment , the cardholder inserts the card into the pos machine , then either enters a personal identification number ( pin ) or signs to verify the transaction . on october 1 , 2015 , the liability for fraudulent transactions involving magnetic stripe cards shifted to the entity — card issuer ( e.g . , bank , credit union ) or merchant — that had not yet made the transition . the transition makes u.s. - issued cards compatible with pos systems and automated teller machines in much of the rest of the world . on october 1 , 2016 , a new liability shift will occur : automated teller machines ( atm ) that accept mastercard branded cards must be emv operational . atms that accept visa - branded cards have an additional year to be operational . the 114th congress may examine the transition and its effectiveness to determine whether any legislative action is needed , especially if major breaches continue to occur despite the transition .
marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the united states . in 2013 , an estimated 19.8 million individuals in the united states aged 12 or older ( 7.5 % of this population ) had used marijuana in the past month . while reported marijuana use is similar to that in 2012 , it has generally increased since 2007 when 5.8 % of individuals aged 12 or older were current users of marijuana . mirroring this increase in use , marijuana availability in the united states has also increased . this growth has been linked to factors such as rising marijuana production in mexico , and increasing marijuana cultivation in the united states led by criminal networks including mexican drug trafficking organizations . along with the uptick in the availability and use of marijuana in the united states , there has been a general shift in public attitudes toward the substance . in 1969 , 12 % of the surveyed population supported legalizing marijuana ; today , more than half ( 52 % ) of surveyed adults have expressed opinions that marijuana should be legalized . and , 60 % indicate that the federal government should not enforce its marijuana laws in states that allow the use of marijuana . the federal government — through the controlled substances act ( csa ; p.l . 91-513 ; 21 u.s.c . §801 et . seq . ) — prohibits the manufacture , distribution , dispensation , and possession of marijuana . over the last few decades , some states have deviated from an across - the - board prohibition of marijuana . evolving state - level positions on marijuana include decriminalization initiatives , legal exceptions for medical use , and legalization of certain quantities for recreational use . notably , in the november 2012 elections , voters in washington state and colorado voted to legalize , regulate , and tax the recreational use of small amounts of marijuana . in the november 2014 elections , legalization initiatives passed in alaska , oregon , and the district of columbia , further spreading the discrepancy between federal and state marijuana laws in the united states . these latest moves have spurred a number of questions regarding their potential implications for related federal law enforcement activities and for the nation 's drug policies on the whole . among these questions is whether or to what extent state initiatives to decriminalize or legalize the use of marijuana conflict with federal law . in general , federal law enforcement has tailored its efforts to target criminal networks rather than individual criminals ; its stance regarding marijuana offenders appears consistent with this position . while drug - related investigations and prosecutions remain a priority for federal law enforcement , the obama administration has suggested that efforts will be harnessed against large - scale trafficking organizations rather than on recreational users of marijuana . in an august 2013 memorandum , deputy attorney general cole stated that while marijuana remains an illegal substance under the controlled substances act , the department of justice would focus its resources on the `` most significant threats in the most effective , consistent , and rational way . . the memo outlined eight enforcement priorities including preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors and preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law into other states . it is unclear whether or how the department of justice is tracking activity to ensure that federal enforcement priorities are being followed in states that have legalized marijuana . some may question whether state - level laws and regulations regarding marijuana prohibition — in particular those that clash with federal laws — may adversely impact collaborative law enforcement efforts and relationships . currently , there is no evidence to suggest that the operation of these collaborative bodies has been impacted by current state - level marijuana decriminalization or legalization initiatives . data from the u.s. sentencing commission seem to indicate a federal law enforcement focus on trafficking as opposed to possession offenses . of the federal drug cases with marijuana listed as the primary drug type ( 21.6 % of total drug cases sentenced ) , over 98 % involved a sentence for drug trafficking in fy2013 . a number of criminal networks rely heavily on profits generated from the sale of illegal drugs — including marijuana — in the united states . as such , scholars and policy makers have questioned whether or how any changes in state or federal marijuana policy in the united states might impact organized crime proceeds and levels of drug trafficking - related violence , particularly in mexico . in short , there are no definitive answers to these questions ; without clear understanding of ( 1 ) actual proceeds generated by the sale of illicit drugs in the united states , ( 2 ) the proportion of total proceeds attributable to the sale of marijuana , and ( 3 ) the proportion of marijuana sales controlled by criminal organizations and affiliated gangs , any estimates of how marijuana legalization might impact the drug trafficking organizations are purely speculative . given the differences between federal marijuana policies and those of states that have authorized use of marijuana in some capacity , congress may choose to address state legalization initiatives in a number of ways , or choose to take no action . among the host of options , policy makers may choose to amend or affirm federal marijuana policy , exercise oversight over federal law enforcement activities , or incentivize state policies through the provision or denial of certain funds .
social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) provides benefits to nonelderly workers and their eligible dependents if the worker paid social security taxes for a certain number of years and is unable to perform substantial work due to a qualifying impairment . as in old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) — the retirement component of social security — benefits are based on a worker 's past earnings in covered employment . in december 2014 , ssdi provided disability insurance coverage to more than 151 million people and paid benefits to about 9 million disabled workers and 2 million of their spouses and children . benefits and administrative costs for ssdi and oasi are financed primarily by dedicated payroll and self - employment taxes levied on the earnings of covered workers , which are deposited in the federal disability insurance ( di ) trust fund and the federal old - age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) trust fund , respectively . the combined social security tax on earnings is 12.40 % , which is split equally between workers and employers ( 6.20 % each ) . of that amount , 2.37 % is allocated to the di trust fund and 10.03 % is allocated to the oasi trust fund . each trust fund is a legally distinct account in the u.s. treasury , and under current law , the two trust funds may not borrow from one another . over the past few years , congress has grown increasingly concerned with the financial outlook of the di trust fund . cost has exceeded total income since 2009 , causing the balance of the di trust fund to shrink . in their july 2015 report , the social security trustees projected that the di trust fund would be depleted in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016. upon depletion of its asset reserves , the di trust fund was projected to have enough ongoing revenues to pay only about 80 % of scheduled benefits . the trustees projected that the oasi trust fund would be depleted in 2035. the social security act provides no guidance on the payment of benefits once a trust fund 's asset reserves have been depleted and current tax revenues are insufficient to meet current cost . although individuals who meet social security 's eligibility requirements are legally entitled to disability benefits , a provision in the antideficiency act prohibits a federal agency from spending in excess of available funds . because the social security act stipulates that ssdi benefit payments shall be made only from the di trust fund , without a change in the law , monthly cash payments to beneficiaries could be delayed or reduced if the di trust fund were depleted . the decreasing solvency of the di trust fund is the result of an increasing imbalance between the fund 's income and cost . over the past 20 years , tax revenues to the di trust fund have remained relatively flat as a percentage of taxable payroll , whereas cost as a share of taxable payroll has grown markedly . the increase in cost stems largely from the growth in the number of beneficiaries in the program . between 1995 and 2014 , the number of disabled workers and their dependents in receipt of ssdi grew 85 % , from 5.9 million to 10.9 million . because benefit payments account for nearly all program spending , the growth in the ssdi rolls has contributed heavily to the financial difficulties of the di trust fund . on november 2 , 2015 , president barack obama signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ( h.r . 1314 ; p.l . 114-74 ) . among its many provisions , the act authorized a temporary reallocation of the social security payroll tax rate between the oasi and di trust funds to provide di with a larger share for 2016 through 2018. specifically , the di trust fund 's share of the combined tax rate increased by 0.57 percentage point at the beginning of 2016 , from 1.80 % to 2.37 % . because the act did not change the combined payroll tax rate of 12.40 % , the portion of the tax rate allocated to oasi decreased by a corresponding amount . this means that oasi 's share of the combined tax rate declined by 0.57 percentage point at the start of 2016 , from 10.60 % to 10.03 % . for 2019 and later , the shares allocated to the di and oasi trust funds are scheduled to return to their 2015 levels ( i.e . , 1.80 % to the di trust fund and 10.60 % to the oasi trust fund ) . the social security administration 's office of the chief actuary ( oact ) projects that the reallocation will extend the solvency of the di trust fund from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2022. although the reallocation will reduce the solvency of the oasi trust fund slightly , oact estimates that the depletion year for oasi will remain unchanged at 2035 .
the annual energy and water development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the army corps of engineers , the department of the interior 's bureau of reclamation , the department of energy ( doe ) , and several independent agencies . the doe budget includes funding for the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a separately organized agency within doe . nnsa operates three programs : defense nuclear nonproliferation , which secures nuclear materials worldwide , conducts r & d into nonproliferation and verification , and operates the nuclear counterterrorism and incident response program ; naval reactors , which `` is responsible for all u.s. navy nuclear propulsion work '' ; and weapons activities . the latter is the subject of this report . it operates the stockpile stewardship program , which maintains the u.s. nuclear gravity bombs and missile warheads and has science and infrastructure programs that support that mission . ( the department of defense [ dod ] operates the bombers and missiles that would deliver nuclear weapons ; it is funded in the department of defense appropriations bill . ) . the armed services committees authorize funds for dod and nnsa programs . the fy2016 request proposed moving counterterrorism programs from weapons activities to defense nuclear nonproliferation . on a basis comparable to the fy2016 budget structure , the fy2015 consolidated and further continuing appropriations act ( h.r . 83 / p.l . 113-235 ) provided $ 8,007.7 million for weapons activities . the fy2016 request was $ 8,846.9 million , a 10.5 % increase over fy2015 . the house appropriations committee recommended providing $ 8,713.0 million for fy2016 . the house passed h.r . 2028 , energy and water development and related agencies appropriations act , 2016 , by a vote of 240-177 on may 1. the bill as passed by the house made no changes to the weapons activities section of the committee bill . the senate appropriations committee reported the bill on may 21. it recommended providing $ 8,882.4 million . congress provided 8,846.9 million for weapons activities in the omnibus appropriations bill for fy2016 ( h.r . 2029 ) . weapons activities has four main programs , each with a request of over $ 1 billion for fy2016 , as follows . fy2015-enacted amounts included below are comparable to the fy2016 budget structure . directed stockpile work works directly on nuclear weapons . it includes life extension programs , maintenance , and others . the fy2015-enacted amount was $ 2,797.2 million ; the fy2016 request was $ 3,187.3 million , a 13.9 % increase . h.r . 2028 , as passed by the house , provided $ 3,354.3 million . the senate appropriations committee recommended $ 3,039.5 million . the omnibus appropriations bill provided $ 3,387.8 million . research , development , test and evaluation programs , which advances the science , engineering , computation , and manufacturing that support directed stockpile work . the fy2015-enacted amount was $ 1,766.2 million ; the fy2016 request was $ 1,776.6 million , a 0.6 % increase . h.r . 2028 , as passed by the house , provided $ 1,774.2 million . the senate appropriations committee recommended $ 1,766.3 million . the omnibus appropriations bill provided $ 1,818.5 million . infrastructure and safety ( i & s ) , a budget category that nnsa proposed in its fy2016 request , includes operations of facilities , recapitalization , maintenance , safety operations , and other programs . the fy2015-enacted comparable amount was $ 1,386.7 million ; the fy2016 request was $ 1,466.1 million , a 5.7 % increase . the house appropriations committee recommended consolidating i & s into infrastructure and operations . the senate appropriations committee recommended $ 1,466.1 million for i & s . the omnibus appropriations bill accepted the house budget structure and consolidated i & s into infrastructure and operations , as described next . readiness in technical base and facilities ( rtbf ) funds material recycle and recovery , recapitalization of facilities , and construction of facilities . prior to fy2016 , it also funded operations of the nuclear weapons complex . the fy2015-enacted amount was $ 2,033.4 million ; the fy2016 request was $ 1,054.5 million , with the decrease due to transferring funds to i & s . the fy2015 comparable request for rtbf was $ 688.0 million , so on a comparable basis fy2016 rtbf increased by 53.3 % . the house appropriations committee recommended consolidating funding for rtbf , infrastructure and safety , and site stewardship into a new category , infrastructure and operations ( i & o ) , for which it recommended $ 2,228.2 million . h.r . 2028 , as passed by the house , accepted this budget structure . the senate appropriations committee recommended keeping i & s and site stewardship as separately funded categories , and providing $ 1,021.1 million for i & o and $ 36.6 million for site stewardship . the omnibus appropriations bill accepted the consolidated funding structure , and provided $ 2,279.1 million for infrastructure and operations ( i & o ) . weapons activities also includes several smaller programs , all of which are described in this report : secure transportation asset , site stewardship , defense nuclear security , information technology and cybersecurity , and legacy contractor pensions .
high - frequency trading ( hft ) is a broad term without a precise legal or regulatory definition . it is used to describe what many characterize as a subset of algorithmic trading that involves very rapid placement of orders , in the realm of tiny fractions of a second . regulators have been scrutinizing hft practices for years , but public concern about this form of trading intensified following the april 2014 publication of a book by author michael lewis . the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , department of justice ( doj ) , securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , office of the new york attorney general , and massachusetts secretary of commerce have begun hft - related probes . critics of hft have raised several concerns about its impact . one criticism relates to its generation of so - called phantom liquidity , in which market liquidity that appears to be provided by hft may be fleeting and transient due to the posting and then almost immediate cancellation of trading orders . another concern is that hft firms may engage in manipulative strategies that involve the use of quote cancellations . in addition , some observers allege that hft firms are often involved in front - running whereby the firms trade ahead of a large order to buy or sell stocks based on nonpublic market information about an imminent trade . another criticism is that hft has increased the level of potential market systemic risk whereby shocks to a small number of active hft traders could then detrimentally affect the entire market . a related concern is whether hft could exacerbate market volatility . these concerns have percolated since the `` flash crash '' of may 6 , 2010 , when the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) fell by roughly 1,000 points in intraday trading — the largest one - day decline in the history of the djia . the crash was analyzed in an investigative report by the sec and cftc which , among other factors , looked at the role hft may have played . the report determined that hft was not the cause but may have exacerbated the crash . another area of criticism is that hft often involves two - tiered markets in which hft firms pay extra for the right to access data feeds or to collocate their servers within exchanges ' servers — all of which is designed to give some traders an advantage over others . hft 's supporters argue that the increased trading provided by hft adds market liquidity and reduces market volatility . they contend that hft is a technological innovation that is the latest evolutionary stage in a long history of securities market making and assert that hft has reduced the bid - ask spreads in stock trading , thereby lowering trading costs . congressional interest in hft and the flash crash has manifested itself in the 113th congress both legislatively and in the congressional oversight of the sec and cftc . legislatively , s. 410 ( harkin ) , h.r . 880 ( defazio ) , and h.r . 1579 ( ellison ) would levy taxes on various financial trades , including trades conducted by hft traders . h.r . 2292 ( markey ) would require the cftc to provide a regulatory definition of hft in the derivatives markets it oversees and require those who do hft to register with the cftc . in june 2014 , sec chairman mary jo white announced that in response to concerns over `` aggressive , destabilizing trading strategies in vulnerable market conditions , '' the agency was pursuing several hft - related reform proposals , including requiring unregistered hft firms to register with the sec . this report provides an overview of hft in the equities and derivatives markets regulated by the sec and cftc . it also examines the flash crash of 2010 and the role that hft may have played as well as recent regulatory developments .
congress has enacted a series of legislative provisions since 2006 to enable certain iraqi and afghan nationals to become u.s. lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) . these provisions make certain iraqis and afghans who worked as translators or interpreters , or who were employed by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government in iraq or afghanistan , eligible for special immigrant visas ( sivs ) . special immigrants comprise a category of permanent employment - based admissions under the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) . while the special immigrant category is unique , it does bear some similarities to other admission categories that are authorized by other sections of the ina , including refugees and amerasian children . to apply under the siv programs for iraqis or afghans , a prospective special immigrant must submit a petition to the department of homeland security ; be otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa ; and be otherwise admissible to the united states . an iraqi or afghan siv applicant whose petition is approved and who is abroad is required to have an in - person visa interview at a u.s. embassy or consulate abroad to determine visa eligibility . upon admission to the united states , siv recipients are granted lpr status . iraqi and afghan special immigrants are eligible for the same resettlement assistance and federal public benefits as refugees . there are three siv programs for iraqi and afghan nationals . one is a permanent program for certain iraqis and afghans who have worked directly with u.s. armed forces , or under chief of mission authority , as translators or interpreters . this program is currently capped at 50 principal aliens ( excluding spouses and children ) per year . the other two siv programs for iraqis and afghans are temporary . one program is for certain iraqis who were employed in iraq by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government during a specified period . it was capped at 5,000 principal aliens annually for fy2008 through fy2012 and included a provision to carry forward any unused numbers from one fiscal year to the next . it expired at the end of fy2013 , but was subsequently revived . current statutory authority provides for the issuance of no more than 2,500 visas to principal applicants after january 1 , 2014. applications are no longer being accepted for this program because the application deadline has passed . there is a similar siv program for certain afghans who were employed in afghanistan by , or on behalf of , the u.s. government or by the international security assistance force during a specified period . the program was capped at 1,500 principal aliens annually for fy2009 through fy2013 , with a provision to carry forward any unused numbers from one fiscal year to the next . current statutory authority provides for the issuance of no more than 18,500 visas to principal applicants after december 19 , 2014. the application period for this program remains open . through the end of fy2018 , more than 79,000 individuals were granted special immigrant status under the three siv programs for iraqi and afghan nationals . principal applicants accounted for about 26,000 of the total , and dependent spouses and children accounted for the remaining 53,000. the iraqi and afghan siv programs have faced challenges with respect to application processing , security screening , and visa availability . the structure of the siv programs themselves , with statutory timeframes and numerical limitations , introduces additional complication .
on march 3 , 2014 , the environmental protection agency finalized new ( `` tier 3 '' ) emission standards for light duty ( and some larger ) motor vehicles . light duty vehicles include cars , suvs , vans , and most pickup trucks . phase - in of the standards will begin with model year 2017. by the time tier 3 is fully implemented in model year 2025 , the standards for light duty vehicles will require reductions of about 80 % in tailpipe emissions of non - methane organic gases and nitrogen oxides ( both of which contribute to the formation of ground - level ozone ) and of about 70 % in tailpipe emissions of particulates . ozone and particulates are the most widespread air pollutants in the united states . both contribute to respiratory illness and premature mortality . epa estimates that implementation of the standards will reduce premature mortality by 770 to 2,000 persons annually , as well as providing reductions in hospital admissions , lost work days , school absences , and restricted activity days for persons with respiratory illness . assigning monetary values to these benefits , epa estimates the annual benefits at between $ 6.7 billion and $ 19 billion in 2030. like the current `` tier 2 '' standards , which were promulgated in 2000 and phased in between model years 2004 and 2009 , the tier 3 standards treat vehicles and fuels as a system : reductions in vehicle emissions are easier to achieve if the fuel used contains less sulfur . the tier 3 standards will require that gasoline contain no more than 10 parts per million ( ppm ) sulfur on an annual average basis beginning january 1 , 2017 , down from 30 ppm under the tier 2 program . the fuel standards will match limits already attained in california and in much of the world , including the european union , japan , and korea , and proposed for adoption in china . further , the rule extends the required useful life of emission control equipment from 120,000 miles to 150,000 miles , and sets standards for heavier duty gasoline - powered vehicles . the standards will also require about a 50 % reduction in evaporative emissions ( some of which also contribute to ozone formation and / or cause health problems directly ) . epa estimates the cost of the rules at $ 1.1 billion annually in 2017 to $ 1.5 billion annually in 2030. the agency estimates that the rule will add $ 33 to $ 88 to the cost of a new vehicle , and less than one cent to the price of a gallon of gasoline . the effect on gasoline prices has been the most controversial issue : the american petroleum institute contends that the tighter sulfur controls will impose almost $ 10 billion in refinery capital expenditures and increase gasoline manufacturing costs by 6 to 9 cents per gallon . but , in addition to epa , at least two studies by third - party consultants conclude that the costs will be far less than api 's estimate . to address refining industry concerns , the final rule will allow a three - year delay in compliance for small refiners . it also includes averaging , banking , and trading programs that will give the refining industry some flexibility in meeting the standards . the auto industry is generally supportive of the rule — five auto companies , five trade groups , and the united auto workers union have issued statements of support , and a gm executive joined the epa administrator as she announced the standards . the standards facilitate the adoption of new technologies necessary to meet greenhouse gas standards already promulgated by epa . in addition , california and 12 other states have already adopted tailpipe standards similar to tier 3. proponents contend that the harmonization of national standards eliminates the threat of a patchwork of state requirements and decreases compliance costs by preserving a unified national market . many in congress have expressed concern about the potential impacts of the rule . as a result , congress can be expected to continue oversight as the rule is implemented .
patent infringement is the unauthorized making , using , offering for sale , selling , and importing of a patented invention . the patent provides the patent holder with the right to protect against such infringement by suing for relief in the appropriate federal court . litigation of a patent infringement claim begins with the filing of a complaint in federal court . form 18 in the appendix of the federal rules of civil procedure provides a model for a patent infringement complaint . this form requires four statements asserting jurisdiction , patent ownership , patent infringement by the defendant , and demand for relief . commentators , legal practitioners , and patent holders disagree as to whether form 18 requires a sufficient level of detail in the patent infringement complaint to meet the standards outlined in the federal rules of civil procedure and by the u.s. supreme court . despite two recent supreme court rulings concerning the appropriate pleading standard , the level of particularity regarding information in the patent complaint , specifically form 18 , is a frequent issue before the courts . patent infringement litigation has increased over the last decade . commentators have linked the current patent pleading requirements and the minimal level of information required to patent assertion entities ( pae ) , colloquially known as `` patent trolls . . according to `` patent troll '' critics , the minimal information required in a patent infringement complaint encourages paes to initiate frivolous lawsuits that otherwise would not survive the initial pleading stage under a more stringent standard . congress has recently proposed several bills offering patent reform in this area . the recently introduced innovation act , h.r . 3309 , and the patent abuse reduction act , s. 1013 , both offer changes to the patent pleading system . these bills would provide for , among other things , heightened initial pleading requirements demanding more specific information in the complaint than required by form 18 alone . sponsors of the bills intend these more rigorous pleading requirements to deter `` patent trolls '' from filing what they deem as frivolous lawsuits . however , some commentators believe that the heightened pleading requirements would render patent enforcement impractical . additionally , some members of the judicial branch have commented that these proposed changes trigger constitutional issues by potentially violating the separation of powers doctrine .
the state children 's health insurance program ( chip ) is a means - tested program that provides health coverage to targeted low - income children and pregnant women in families that have annual income above medicaid eligibility levels but have no health insurance . chip is jointly financed by the federal government and the states , and the states are responsible for administering chip . the federal government 's share of chip expenditures ( including both services and administration ) is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage ( e - fmap ) rate . the e - fmap varies by state ; statutorily , the e - fmap can range from 65 % to 85 % . the e - fmap is increased by 23 percentage points for fy2016 through fy2019 and by 11.5 percentage points for fy2020 . in fy2021 , the e - fmap is to return to the regular e - fmap rates . the federal appropriation for chip is provided in statute . from this federal appropriation , states receive chip allotments , which are the federal funds allocated to each state and the territories for the federal share of their chip expenditures . in addition , if a state has a shortfall in federal chip funding , there are a few sources of shortfall funding , such as the child enrollment contingency fund , redistribution funds , and medicaid funds . fy2018 began on october 1 , 2017 , without federal chip funding having been appropriated for the fiscal year . the full - year fy2018 appropriation for chip was not provided until january 22 , 2018 , when chip was provided appropriations for fy2018 through fy2023 through the continuing resolution enacted on january 22 , 2018 ( p.l . 115-120 ) . then , on february 9 , 2018 , the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( bba 2018 ; p.l . 115-123 ) provided chip appropriations for fy2024 through fy2027 . this report provides an overview of chip financing , beginning with an explanation of the federal matching rate . it describes various aspects of federal chip funding , such as the federal appropriation , state allotments , the child enrollment contingency fund , redistribution funds , and outreach and enrollment grants . the report ends with a section about the recent legislative activity that has resulted in federal funding for chip being provided through fy2027 .
the general services administration ( gsa ) controls more than 8,700 owned and leased buildings with 422 million square feet of floor space , which represents about 12.6 % of the government 's 3.354 billion total building square footage .sometimes referred to as the `` government 's landlord , '' gsa has the authority to acquire , operate , and dispose of real property on behalf of other federal agencies , including the judiciary . its portfolio includes courthouses , land ports of entry , and federal office space . prior to seeking appropriations , gsa is required to obtain congressional authorization for constructing , purchasing , leasing , or renovating real property . to that end , gsa submits a prospectus to two committees — the senate committee on environment and public works and the house committee on transportation and infrastructure — for each proposal that exceeds $ 2.85 million . the prospectus provides detailed information about the project , including its location and estimated cost . by law , a project that exceeds the $ 2.85 million threshold may not receive appropriations unless both committees pass resolutions approving of the prospectus . while the prospectus process provides congress an opportunity to evaluate gsa real property activities , oversight may be limited by data that are not available to the authorizing committees . gsa 's prospectuses , for example , do not always include a comparison of the costs of leasing versus owning space over time , which means congress is making decisions without knowing whether a proposed project is the most cost effective option . similarly , many lease prospectuses do not include the cost of altering space to meet agency needs , such as upgraded security , which means authorizing committees may not be aware of the full costs of the projects they are considering . in addition , there are instances where gsa fails to submit prospectuses for projects that exceed the threshold . several bills in the 113th congress propose reforms to the real property process , particularly the process for disposing of unneeded buildings . examples include the excess federal building and property disposal act ( h.r . 328 ) , the federal real property asset management reform act ( s. 1398 ) , and the civilian property realignment act ( h.r . 695 and s. 1715 ) . another bill , the public building service savings and reform act of 2013 ( h.r . 2612 ) proposes changing the prospectus approval process . the bill would require gsa to include in its prospectuses a plan to offset any new space acquired by eliminating an equal amount of existing space from its inventory . it would also require gsa to ensure it is obtaining the best possible rental rate for leases that fall below the prospectus threshold . other provisions would require gsa to provide the authorizing committees with an annual report listing all of the leases it entered into during the previous fiscal year ; to notify congress if a project 's costs increased by 5 % or more ; and , when requesting authorization to acquire space , to explain why existing federal space could not be used . h.r . 2612 could mitigate several long - standing weaknesses in the prospectus process . the bill proposes to help control costs by ensuring that the authorizing committees have access to comparative cost data , and by requiring gsa to provide cost estimates of alterations associated with a new lease that are not included in the estimate of rent . in addition , h.r . 2612 might enhance oversight by requiring gsa to provide a more detailed justification for requesting new space , and to notify congress when a project exceeds the cost and size parameters established in the prospectus . this report will be updated as events warrant .
eligibility for social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) benefits are based on a worker 's insured status , and payment levels are associated with the individual 's career earnings under covered employment . monthly payments are calculated using a formula that takes into account the period of employment , a worker 's average earnings over that period , and the application of `` dropout years . . to be insured for ssdi benefits , a claimant must have worked a minimum amount of time in covered employment . first , a worker must be `` fully insured , '' which requires one quarter of coverage for each calendar year after the age of 21 , with a minimum of six quarters and a maximum of 40 quarters . in 2014 , each quarter of coverage requires $ 1,200 in earnings . second , a recency of work test requires 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of a disability ; that is generally five years of work in the last 10 , although fewer quarters are required for younger workers . in calculating the ssdi benefit level , up to five years of a worker 's lowest years of earnings are eliminated or `` dropped '' to minimize the effect of lower years of earnings on monthly payments . an eligible worker who becomes disabled has one year of earnings dropped ( via the disability dropout year provision ) for every five years of earnings , known as the one - for - five rule . a separate childcare dropout year ( cdy ) provision also disregards from benefit calculations up to two years in which a beneficiary received no income during periods when he or she was caring for a young child . the number of cdys applied to a benefit calculation may be offset by the number of disability dropout years applied and vice versa . the cdy provision largely benefits a small subset of ssdi recipients with lower career earnings . this report provides ( 1 ) an overview of the ssdi program and how workers become insured for ssdi benefits , ( 2 ) an explanation of how benefit payments are calculated , and ( 3 ) a description of how the dropout year provisions affect the calculation of disability benefit payments . the report concludes with a brief analysis of the earnings of disabled workers that have been credited with cdys .
the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the army corps of engineers ( corps ) , for the department of the interior 's bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and several independent agencies . fy2013 energy and water development appropriations were considered in the context of the budget control act of 2011 ( bca , p.l . 112-25 ) , which established discretionary spending limits for fy2012-fy2021 . on march 26 , 2013 , the president signed h.r . 933 , the fy2013 defense and military construction / va , full year continuing resolution ( p.l . 113-6 ) . the act funded energy and water development accounts at the fy2012 enacted level for the rest of fy2013 , with some exceptions . however , under bca , an automatic spending reduction process , consisting of a combination of sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps , went into effect march 1 , 2013. for fy2014 , as in previous years , the level of overall spending was a major issue . president obama 's fy2014 budget request for energy and water development was released in april 2013. the request totaled $ 34.4 billion . on june 26 the house appropriations committee reported a bill , h.r . 2609 , with a total of $ 30.4 billion ; the bill passed the house , with amendments , on july 10. the senate appropriations committee reported out a bill , s. 1245 , on june 27 , with a total of $ 34.4 billion . on october 16 , 2013 , congress passed the continuing appropriations act , 2014 , h.r . 2775 , p.l . 113-46 , extending funding for all federal programs , including energy and water development , through january 15 , 2014 , at the fy2013 post - sequestration spending level . on december 26 the president signed h.j.res . 59 ( p.l . 113-67 ) , which contained the bipartisan budget act establishing less stringent spending caps for fy2014 and fy2015 than the bca and easing the way for an appropriations agreement . on january 17 , 2014 , the president signed h.r . 3547 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2014 ( p.l . 113-76 ) , containing appropriations for all 12 fy2014 appropriations bills , including energy and water development programs ( division d ) . in addition to funding levels , issues specific to energy and water development programs included the distribution of appropriations for corps ( title i ) and reclamation ( title ii ) projects that have historically received congressional appropriations above administration requests ; alternatives to the proposed national nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain , nevada , which the administration has abandoned ( title iii : nuclear waste disposal ) ; proposed fy2014 spending levels for energy efficiency and renewable energy ( eere ) programs ( title iii ) that were more than 50 % higher in the administration 's request than the amount appropriated for fy2012 ; and , funding for the nuclear weapons program and other defense activities , which make up half of the total department of energy budget .
the fair labor standards act ( flsa ) , enacted in 1938 , is the federal legislation that establishes the general minimum wage that must be paid to all covered workers . while the flsa mandates broad minimum wage coverage , states have the option of establishing minimum wage rates that are different from those set in it . under the provisions of the flsa , an individual is generally covered by the higher of the state or federal minimum wage . as of 2019 , minimum wage rates are above the federal rate of $ 7.25 per hour in 29 states and the district of columbia , ranging from $ 0.25 to $ 6.75 above the federal rate . another 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate . the remaining 7 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate or do not have a state minimum wage requirement . in the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage , only individuals who are not covered by the flsa are subject to those lower rates . in any given year , the exact number of states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate may vary , depending on the interaction between the federal rate and the mechanisms in place to adjust the state minimum wage . adjusting minimum wage rates is typically done in one of two ways : ( 1 ) legislatively scheduled rate increases that may include one or several increments ; ( 2 ) a measure of inflation to index the value of the minimum wage to the general change in prices . of the 29 states and the district of columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate , 9 currently have no scheduled increases beyond 2019 , 3 states have legislatively scheduled rate increases after 2019 , and 17 states and the district of columbia have scheduled increases through a combination of planned increases and current - or future - year indexation of state minimum wage rates to a measure of inflation . because the federal and state minimum wage rates change at various times and in various increments , the share of the labor force for which the federal rate is the binding wage floor has changed over time . since 1981 , there have been three series of increases in the federal minimum wage rate — 1990-1991 , 1996-1997 , and 2007-2009. during that same period , there have been numerous changes in state minimum wage policies . as a result of those interactions , the share of the u.s. civilian labor force living in states in which the federal minimum wage is the floor has fluctuated but generally declined , and is about 39 % as of 2018 .
in 1978 , the department of the interior ( department ) adopted a final rule setting forth the process by which a group may be recognized ( also acknowledged ) as an indian tribe by the department . prior to that time , the department made decisions on an ad hoc basis . however , in the wake of the treaty fishing rights case united states v. washington and eastern land claims , more groups started seeking recognition as indian tribes , and the department could no longer manage the recognition requests on a case - by - case basis . the acknowledgement process , codified in 25 c.f.r . part 83 , sets forth a uniform process and uniform criteria for acknowledging that groups exist as indian tribes . the key to federal acknowledgment under the current regulations is continuous political existence of an indian group from historical times to the present . the federal acknowledgment process does not create tribes , and it does not give groups sovereignty . rather , it acknowledges a political entity that already exists . to do this , 25 c.f.r . section 83.7 provides seven mandatory criteria that groups must satisfy in order to establish that they exist and have existed as an autonomous political entity . first , in order to be acknowledged , a group must establish that it has been identified as an indian entity from 1900 to the present . second , it must establish that it has existed as a community from historical times to the present . third , it must establish that it has exercised political control over its members from historical times to the present . fourth , the group must provide a copy of its governing document , including membership criteria . fifth , the group must establish that its members descend from a historical indian tribe or historical indian tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity . sixth , the membership must be composed principally of persons who are not members of a federally recognized tribe . finally , the group must establish that it is not the subject of congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the federal - tribal relationship . the current regulations assign responsibility to the assistant secretary — indian affairs ( assistant secretary ) to issue initial proposed findings and then final determinations . the office of federal acknowledgment ( ofa ) makes recommendations to the assistant secretary on the proposed findings and the final determinations . a final determination may be appealed on limited grounds to the interior board of indian appeals . acknowledgment as an indian tribe means that the group becomes a federally recognized tribe with which the united states has a government - to - government relationship . this relationship makes the tribe and its members eligible for certain benefits , as well as subject to certain protections . it also means that the tribe may exercise jurisdiction over its territory and members generally free from state law , subject to limitations of federal law . after years of criticism of the acknowledgment process , the department of the interior has proposed several changes to the acknowledgment regulations . first , the proposed rule would change some of the criteria . second , the proposed rule would assign responsibility for the proposed findings to ofa but keep responsibility for the final determinations with the assistant secretary . in rendering the proposed finding , ofa would consider the criteria in stages . petitioners could appeal a negative proposed finding at any of the stages . the appeal would be heard by a judge within the office of hearings and appeals ( oha ) who would issue a recommended decision for the assistant secretary to consider in issuing the final determination . the assistant secretary 's decision would be final for the department .
in response to the disclosure of various national security agency ( nsa ) surveillance and data collection programs , a number of legislative changes to the government 's intelligence operations authority have been suggested . under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 ( fisa ) , the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) reviews government applications to conduct surveillance and engage in data collection for foreign intelligence purposes , and the fisa court of review reviews rulings of the fisc . most fisa opinions are classified by the executive branch . some have raised concerns that this practice permits the government to rely upon `` secret law '' to justify its activities , and have proposed requiring the public release of legal opinions and orders issued by the fisc and the fisa court of review . however , others might regard these proposals as raising separation of powers questions , including the scope of the executive branch 's control over national security information . fisa opinions and orders , most of which seem to contain at least some sensitive facts pertaining to national security , involve the legal analysis of sensitive national security information . requiring the executive branch to release them implicates article ii of the constitution because it compels the president to disclose potentially sensitive documents , and could override the president 's classification decisions . after briefly reviewing the fisc 's current procedures , this report will examine the article ii implications of requiring the executive branch to disclose fisa opinions . the constitution assigns responsibility for the national defense to both congress and the president . however , the extent to which congress may regulate the president 's discretion over national security matters is a contentious issue . some argue that the president possesses a sphere of authority that exists independent of any congressional delegation of authority . while courts have not precisely determined the scope of any such power , it appears that control over access to national security information is largely shared between the legislative and executive branches , rather than belonging exclusively to one branch . for example , courts have indicated that neither one possesses absolute power over classified information . in addition , an examination of historical practice reveals that congress and the executive branch share power in this area . congress requires consistent disclosure of sensitive national security information to the relevant intelligence and defense committees . congress has also regulated control over access to national security information , passing legislation such as the classified information procedures act ( cipa ) , fisa , and the freedom of information act ( foia ) . pursuant to these statutes , courts have required the executive branch to disclose information to the public and the judiciary . in fact , no statute regulating classified information has been held by courts to improperly intrude upon the president 's power as commander in chief . nevertheless , congress 's power to compel the release of information held by the executive branch might not be absolute . the supreme court has observed that the president enjoys some power as commander in chief to control access to national security information . in addition , courts have crafted common law privileges that protect the executive branch from revealing certain military secrets . consequently , there may be a limited sphere of information that courts will protect from public disclosure .
pursuant to the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca , p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) , a health insurance exchange has been established in each state and the district of columbia ( dc ) . exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can `` shop '' for health insurance coverage . the aca instructed each state to establish its own state - based exchange ( sbe ) . if a state elected not to create an exchange or if the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) determined a state was not prepared to operate an exchange , the law directed hhs to establish a federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) in the state . fourteen states and dc established sbes in 2014 , while the remaining 36 states have ffes . in some states that have ffes , the states carry out certain functions of the exchange ; in other states , the exchange is wholly operated and administered by hhs . the aca provided an indefinite appropriation for hhs grants to states to support the planning and establishment of exchanges . for each fiscal year , the hhs secretary is to determine the total amount that will be made available to each state for exchange grants . no grant may be awarded after january 1 , 2015. there are three different types of exchange grants . first , planning grants were awarded to 49 states and dc . these grants of about $ 1 million each were intended to provide resources to states to help them plan their health insurance exchanges . second , there have been multiple rounds of exchange establishment grants . there are two levels of exchange establishment grants : level one establishment grants are awarded to states that have made some progress using their planning funds , and level two establishment grants are designed to provide funding to states that are farther along in the establishment of an exchange . finally , hhs awarded seven early innovator grants to states ( including one award to a consortium of new england states ) to support the design and implementation of the information technology systems needed to operate the exchanges . to date , hhs has awarded a total of more than $ 4.8 billion to states and dc in planning , establishment , and early innovator grants . under the aca , each exchange is expected to be self - sustaining beginning january 1 , 2015. the law authorizes exchanges to generate funding to sustain their operations , including by assessing fees on participating health insurance issuers . to raise funds for each of the ffes , beginning in 2014 , hhs is assessing a monthly fee on each health insurance issuer that offers plans through an ffe . the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) is incurring significant administrative costs to support ffe operations . according to cms , a total of $ 456 million was used to support exchange operations over the period fy2010-fy2012 . cms spent $ 1,545 million on exchange operations in fy2013 and an estimated $ 1,390 million in fy2014 . the agency has relied on a mix of annual discretionary appropriations and funding from other sources for these expenditures . those sources include expired discretionary funds from the nonrecurring expenses fund , mandatory funding from the health insurance reform implementation fund and the prevention and public health fund , and ffe user fees . cms has budgeted $ 1.8 billion for exchange operations in fy2015 . most of that funding is projected to come from ffe user fees .
social security 's special minimum benefit provision , also known as the special minimum primary insurance amount ( pia ) , is an alternative benefit formula that increases benefits paid to workers who had low earnings for many years , and to their dependents and survivors . the special minimum pia is based on the number of years a person has worked , whereas the standard benefit formula is based on a worker 's average lifetime earnings . the worker receives the higher of the two benefits . however , the special minimum pia has virtually no effect on the benefits paid to today 's new retirees . under current law , it grows with price levels , whereas the standard benefit is linked to wages . because wages generally grow faster than prices , the special minimum pia affects fewer beneficiaries every year . in 2017 , about 39,347 of the 62 million social security recipients qualified for the minimum benefit . beneficiaries who received higher benefits due to the provision had an average increase to monthly benefits of about $ 46 in june 2013. the social security administration ( ssa ) estimates that the provision will have no effect on workers turning 62 in 2019 or later . some recent proposals would redesign the minimum benefit . this renewed interest has been sparked by social security proposals that would reduce the regular benefit and by concern over poverty rates among beneficiaries who had low wages throughout their careers . however , some have suggested to allow the minimum benefit to phase out , arguing that the provision does not accurately target the working poor , and that there are other programs that are more appropriate for supplementing the incomes of low - income , low - asset people . increases in social security benefits targeted at lifetime low earners could be implemented in various ways . for example , a new minimum benefit provision could be introduced , the standard benefit could be increased for people who worked for many years at low earnings , or a fixed - dollar benefit could be introduced . similar provisions could also be introduced through other programs , such as supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
recent high - profile military - related cases involving sexual assaults by u.s. servicemembers have resulted in increased public and congressional interest in military discipline and the military justice system . questions have been raised regarding how allegations of sexual assault are addressed by the chain of command , the authority and process to convene a court - martial , and the ability of the convening authority to provide clemency to a servicemember convicted of an offense . under article i , section 8 of the u.s. constitution , congress has the power to raise and support armies ; provide and maintain a navy ; and provide for organizing and disciplining them . under this authority , congress has enacted the uniform code of military justice ( ucmj ) , which is the code of military criminal laws applicable to all u.s. military members worldwide . the president implemented the ucmj through the manual for courts - martial ( mcm ) . the manual for courts - martial contains the rules for courts - martial ( rcm ) , the military rules of evidence ( mre ) , and the ucmj . members of the armed forces are subjected to rules , orders , proceedings , and consequences different from the rights and obligations of their civilian counterparts , and the ucmj establishes this unique legal framework . the ucmj authorizes three types of courts - martial : ( 1 ) summary court - martial , ( 2 ) special court - martial , and ( 3 ) general court - martial . depending on the severity of the alleged offense , the accused 's commanding officer enjoys great discretion with respect to the type of court - martial to convene . generally , each of the courts - martial provides fundamental constitutional and procedural rights to the accused , including , but not limited to , the right to a personal representative or counsel , the opportunity to confront evidence and witnesses , and the right to have a decision reviewed by a lawyer or a court of appeals . in the 113th congress , there have been no fewer than 10 separate bills introduced addressing the issue of sexual assault in the military . the bills have proposed various provisions that include , but are not limited to prohibiting enlistment in the armed forces of individuals previously convicted of sexual offenses , eliminating the statute of limitations on prosecution of sexual offenses under the ucmj , and barring commanders from overturning convictions obtained at court - martial . in recent months , congress has included many provisions addressing sexual assault , including those mentioned above , in the house and senate versions of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2014 ( fy2014 ndaa ) . additionally , secretary of defense chuck hagel recently announced that the department of defense would implement a series of new initiatives designed to address sexual assaults in the military . due to the sheer breadth of the various provisions contained in the house and senate versions of the fy2014 ndaa , this report will address selected legislative proposals including requiring special victims ' counsel , changes to disposition and clemency authorities , creation of a mandatory minimum punishment , authority to transfer the accused , and protections for recruits and trainees .
the senate `` hold '' is an informal practice whereby senators communicate to senate leaders , often in the form of a letter , their policy views and scheduling preferences regarding measures and matters available for floor consideration . unique to the upper chamber , holds can be understood as information - sharing devices predicated on the unanimous consent nature of senate decision - making . senators place holds to accomplish a variety of purposes — to receive notification of upcoming legislative proceedings , for instance , or to express objections to a particular proposal or executive nomination — but ultimately the decision to honor a hold request , and for how long , rests with the majority leader . scheduling senate business is the fundamental prerogative of the majority leader , and this responsibility is typically carried out in consultation with the minority leader . the influence that holds exert in chamber deliberations is based primarily upon the significant parliamentary prerogatives individual senators are afforded in the rules , procedures , and precedents of the chamber . more often than not , senate leaders honor a hold request because not doing so could trigger a range of parliamentary responses from the holding senator ( s ) , such as a filibuster , that could expend significant amounts of scarce floor time . as such , efforts to regulate holds are inextricably linked with the chamber 's use of unanimous consent agreements to structure the process of calling up measures and matters for floor debate and amendment . in recent years the senate has considered a variety of proposals that address the senate hold , two of which the chamber adopted . both sought to eliminate the secrecy of holds . prior to these rules changes , hold letters were written with the expectation that their source and contents would remain private , even to other senators . in 2007 , the senate adopted new procedures to make hold requests public in certain circumstances . under section 512 of the honest leadership and open government act ( p.l . 110-81 ) , if objection was raised to a unanimous consent request to proceed to or pass a measure or matter on behalf of another senator , then the senator who originated the hold was expected to deliver for publication in the congressional record , within six session days of the objection , a `` notice of intent to object '' identifying the senator as the source of the hold and the measure or matter to which it pertained . a process for removing a hold was also created , and a new `` notice of intent to object '' section was added to both senate calendars to take account of objection notices that remained outstanding . an examination of objection notices published since 2007 suggests that many hold requests are likely to have fallen outside the scope of section 512 regulation . in an effort to make public a greater share of hold requests , the senate adjusted its notification requirements by way of a standing order ( s.res . 28 ) adopted at the outset of the 112th congress ( 2011-2012 ) . instead of the six session day reporting window specified in section 512 , s.res . 28 provides two days of session during which senators are expected to deliver their objection notices for publication . the action that triggers the reporting requirement also shifted : from an objection on the basis of a colleague 's hold request ( under section 512 ) to the initial transmission of a written objection notice to the party leader ( under s.res . 28 ) . in the event that a senator neglects to deliver an objection notice for publication and a party leader nevertheless raises objection on the basis of that hold , s.res . 28 requires that the name of the objecting party leader be identified as the source of the hold in the `` notice of intent to object '' section of the appropriate senate calendar .
the number of children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian is raising a host of policy questions . while much of the congressional interest initially focused directly on immigration policy , the implications for other areas , including education , are now arising as well . under federal law , states and leas are required to provide all children with equal access to a public elementary and secondary education , regardless of their immigration status . upon arrival in the united states , unaccompanied alien children generally are served initially through programs operated by the department of health and human services ' ( hhs 's ) office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) . while in these programs , children are provided with basic education services and activities and are not enrolled in local school systems . however , once an unaccompanied alien child is released to an appropriate sponsor ( e.g . , parent , other family member , or other adult ) , the child has the right to enroll in a local school , just like any other child living in that area , even while awaiting immigration proceedings . while several federal education programs administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) provide funds that may be used by schools , local educational agencies ( leas ) , and states to serve unaccompanied alien children , this report focuses on three ed programs that may be particularly helpful in providing support for these children : ( 1 ) title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , ( 2 ) english language acquisition grants ( title iii - a ) authorized by the esea , and ( 3 ) part b grants to states authorized by the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) . in addition to current federal education programs that may be useful in assisting local education systems in meeting the needs of recent immigrant students , there are other federal education programs previously administered by ed that are no longer funded that either focused on immigrant students ( emergency immigrant education act ) or have been used in the past to assist schools and leas experiencing an unexpected influx of students in elementary and secondary school ( temporary emergency impact aid for displaced students ) . in addition to these ed programs , orr administers the refugee school impact aid program administered by orr , which funds activities aimed at the effective integration and education of refugee children . one of the principal challenges of providing federal funds to leas and schools that are absorbing newly arriving unaccompanied children is the lack of local area data . the best available data from orr are county - level totals that do not indicate the age of the child . a discussion of these data and their limitations is included at the end of this report .
the adult education and family literacy act ( aefla ) is the primary federal legislation that supports basic education for out - of - school adults . commonly called `` adult education , '' the programs and activities funded by aefla typically support educational services at the secondary level and below , as well as english language training . actual educational services are typically provided by local entities . aefla was created by title ii of the workforce investment act of 1998 ( wia ; p.l . 105-220 ) . the authorization of appropriations under wia lapsed after fy2003 , though the program continued to be funded through the appropriations process . in 2014 , aefla was reauthorized by title ii of the workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2014 ( wioa , p.l . 113-128 ) . this report will discuss aefla as amended by wioa . wioa made a number of changes to the authorizing law but maintained the program 's primary function of authorizing federal grants to state agencies for adult education activities . state agencies may use a portion of federal funds for statewide activities , but the bulk of their grants must be subgranted to local providers . eligible local providers include local educational agencies , institutions of higher education , community - based organizations , and other qualified entities . under wioa , federal aefla grants are allotted to states via two formula grants : 88 % of state grant funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state 's relative share of adults who do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and who are not enrolled in school . these funds may support basic education services , coursework toward a secondary school diploma or equivalent , english language training or other adult education services . 12 % of funds are allotted to the states based on a formula that considers each state 's relative share of immigrants who were admitted for legal permanent residence in past years . these funds support `` integrated english literacy and civics education '' for english language learners . wioa requires that state agency grantees submit and have an approved unified state plan that aligns adult education with other core wioa programs to meet local labor force needs . state grantees must also report on program performance using a set of metrics that applies across core wioa programs , including adult education . while the large majority of annual appropriations support grants to state agencies , statute reserves 2 % of annual aefla appropriations for national leadership activities . these national activities include technical support for state agencies and assistance in meeting the performance accountability requirements of wioa . congress appropriated $ 578 million for aefla - authorized activities in fy2014 . wioa authorizes the same appropriation level for fy2015 . between fy2015 and fy2020 , wioa authorizes annual increases in aefla appropriations , with an authorization level of $ 679 million in fy2020 .
recent reports that certain entities continued to receive federal government contracts after reincorporating overseas have prompted questions about current and proposed restrictions on contracting with `` inverted domestic corporations . . these questions are shaped , in part , by the broader debate over whether such corporations are to be seen as `` deserters , '' who change their corporate citizenship to avoid paying u.s. taxes , or as evidencing systemic problems in the u.s. tax code . however , they also reflect long - standing debate over whether and to what degree the federal procurement process should be used to promote socioeconomic goals that some assert are tangential to the primary purpose of the procurement process ( i.e . , acquiring the supplies and services that best meet the government 's needs at the lowest price ) . congress has sought to discourage corporate inversions by barring certain contracts with inverted domestic corporations ever since it enacted the homeland security act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-296 , â§835 ) . as amended , this act prohibits the department of homeland security from awarding a contract to an inverted domestic corporation , or a subsidiary thereof , unless the secretary of homeland security determines that a waiver is necessary in the interest of national security . the act also establishes its own definition of inverted domestic corporation , which is different from that in the internal revenue code . subsequent legislation imposed similar prohibitions upon other agencies , although only as to funds appropriated or otherwise made available under specific acts of congress . however , some commentators have argued that inverted domestic corporations have continued to receive federal contracts because of `` loopholes '' or `` gaps '' in these measures . thus , some members of the 114 th congress have proposed legislation ( h.r . 1809 , s. 975 ) to reduce or remove opportunities for inverted domestic corporations to receive government contracts . similar legislation was introduced in the 113 th congress . there have also been calls by members of both the 113 th and 114 th congresses for the executive to take action to further restrict agencies ' ability to contract with inverted domestic corporations . this report provides the answers to 14 frequently asked questions regarding the current restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations , proposed amendments thereto , and the relationship between the prohibitions upon contracting with inverted domestic corporations and other provisions of law that restrict dealings with `` foreign '' contractors .
after decades of activities in space , earth 's orbit is littered with man - made objects that no longer serve a useful purpose . this includes roughly 22,000 objects larger than the size of a softball and hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments . this population of space debris potentially threatens u.s. national security interests in space , both governmental ( military , intelligence , and civil ) and commercial . congress has broadly supported the full range of these national security interests and has a vested concern in ensuring a strong and continued u.s. presence in space . two events in recent years dramatically increased the amount of fragmentation debris in orbit . one was the 2007 chinese anti - satellite test and , in 2009 , an active u.s. commercial satellite accidentally collided with a defunct russian satellite . although the 2013 movie gravity exaggerated the issue and took certain artistic liberties , the film graphically depicted and drew the public 's attention to the potential destruction of operational satellites and other platforms in space from collisions with orbital debris . some experts maintain the population growth of debris in space will be primarily driven by catastrophic collisions that are likely to occur every five to nine years . for decades , the united states has worked to minimize the amount of orbital debris left from its space launches and inactive satellites . many space - faring nations have adopted similar mitigation measures , and additional voluntary international codes of conduct are being pursued . many experts now believe that mitigation efforts alone are insufficient to prevent the continual increase of space debris . a growing view among experts holds that some level of active removal of debris from the space environment is necessary . nevertheless , such efforts are technologically immature and face significant budgetary and legal obstacles . congress has an opportunity to explore these issues through hearings , for instance with major stakeholders in the u.s. national security and civil space communities , and the commercial sector . efforts to find international agreement on mitigation may involve congressional prerogatives on advice and consent , and any program to pursue remediation will likely entail appropriations support from congress .
the sheer number of central american children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and who lack proper immigration documents is raising complex and competing sets of humanitarian concerns and immigration control issues . adults and families from the same three countries — el salvador , guatemala , and honduras — have also been coming in increasing numbers over the same period . current law provides that unaccompanied alien children ( also referred to as unaccompanied children ) are treated differently than adults or children with their parents who come to the united states without proper immigration documents . this report focuses on how unaccompanied alien children are treated in comparison to unauthorized adults and families with children in the specific contexts of asylum and expedited removal . foreign nationals apprehended along the border or arriving at a u.s. port who lack proper immigration documents or who engage in fraud or misrepresentation are placed in expedited removal ; however , if they express a fear of persecution , they receive a `` credible fear '' hearing with a u.s. citizenship and immigration services bureau ( uscis ) asylum officer and — if found credible — are referred to an executive office for immigration review ( eoir ) immigration judge for a hearing . to ultimately receive asylum in the united states , foreign nationals must demonstrate a well - founded fear that if returned home , they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics : race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act ( tvpra ) of 2008 revised the procedures and policies for those unaccompanied alien children who file for asylum , most notably requiring that unaccompanied children from contiguous countries ( i.e . , canada and mexico ) be screened for possible trafficking risks and asylum claims . subsequently , the administration opted to screen all unaccompanied children for possible asylum claims . in addition , the tvpra gives uscis asylum officers `` initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by '' an unaccompanied alien child . only a small portion of the unaccompanied children apprehended by customs and border protection ( cbp ) have requested asylum with uscis thus far . while the numbers requesting asylum have increased , they have not increased at as fast a rate as the overall increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied children . through the third quarter of fy2014 , uscis reports that they have adjudicated 167 cases and granted asylum to 108 unaccompanied children . only two of these approved cases were for unaccompanied children apprehended in fy2014 . all of the other approved cases were for unaccompanied children apprehended in prior years . this report builds on a set of crs reports on issues surrounding unaccompanied alien children : crs report r43599 , unaccompanied alien children : an overview , by [ author name scrubbed ] , [ author name scrubbed ] , and [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report in10107 , unaccompanied alien children : a processing flow chart , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report r43628 , unaccompanied alien children : potential factors contributing to recent immigration , coordinated by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report r43623 , unaccompanied alien children — legal issues : answers to frequently asked questions , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report r41731 , central america regional security initiative : background and policy issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] .
on june 15 , 2012 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) announced that certain individuals who were brought to the united states as children and meet other criteria would be considered for relief from removal for two years , subject to renewal , under an initiative known as deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca . among the eligibility requirements , an individual must have been under age 16 at the time of his or her entry into the united states ; must have been continuously resident in the united states since june 15 , 2007 ; and must not have been in lawful immigration status on june 15 , 2012. to request consideration of daca , an individual must file specified forms with dhs 's u.s. citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) and pay associated fees . uscis 's decision on a daca request is discretionary . the agency makes determinations on a case - by - case basis . individuals granted daca may receive employment authorization . daca recipients are not granted a lawful immigration status and are not put on a pathway to a lawful immigration status . uscis began accepting daca requests on august 15 , 2012 , and issued its first approvals in september 2012. prior to that , from june 15 , 2012 , to august 15 , 2012 , dhs 's immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) granted deferred action under the daca process in some cases . cumulatively , through june 2014 , more than 580,000 daca requests have been approved . the period of deferred action under the daca program expires after two years unless it is renewed . individuals granted deferred action under the daca initiative may request renewal of their deferral for another two years , in accordance with uscis procedures . to be considered for a renewal , a daca recipient must satisfy certain requirements concerning continuous u.s. residence , departures from the country , and criminal history . to request a renewal , an individual must file specified forms with uscis and pay associated fees . the agency advises individuals to request a daca renewal 120 days before the expiration date of their current period of deferred action . uscis 's decision on a daca renewal request , like on an initial daca request , is discretionary . for a discussion of related legislation , commonly referred to as the dream act , that seeks to enable certain unauthorized aliens who entered the united states as children to obtain legal immigration status , see crs report rl33863 , unauthorized alien students : issues and `` dream act '' legislation .
representative duffy introduced h.r . 5278 , the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act ( promesa ) , on may 18 , 2016. this bill is a revised version of h.r . 4900 , introduced by representative duffy on april 12 , 2016. the house committee on natural resources marked up h.r . 5278 on may 25 , 2016. amendments include technical corrections and extensions of certain studies on the puerto rico government and economy . the major provisions of the bill were unaffected . the house passed an amended version of h.r . 5278 , which is organized into seven titles , on june 9 , 2016 , ( 297-127 ) . the senate approved the measure ( s. 2328 ) on june 29 , 2016 ( 68-30 ) . on june 30 , 2016 , president obama signed the bill into law . the puerto rico oversight , management , and economic stability act ( promesa ; h.r . 5278 ) would create a structure for exercising federal oversight over the fiscal affairs of territories . promesa would establish an oversight board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over puerto rico . promesa also would create procedures for adjusting debts accumulated by the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and potentially for debts of other territories . finally , promesa would expedite approvals of key energy projects and other `` critical projects '' in puerto rico . the current version of promesa ( h.r . 5278 ) differs from the previous version ( h.r . 4900 ) in several ways , although most sections are similar or identical . many changes clarified or modified existing provisions , although some provisions were added or altered and others were dropped . for instance , h.r . 4900 would have allowed other territories , through normal political processes , to request setup of an oversight board . the structure and appointment process for the board was modified to allow the president to select one board member at his sole discretion . the process by which congressional leaders would submit lists of potential board members was specified in more detail . h.r . 5278 also specifies that the board could only begin to establish bylaws and take other major actions once all members were appointed . in h.r . 4900 , by contrast , the board could act in certain ways , such as setting a schedule for formulation of fiscal plans , once four members were appointed . the powers of the board were also modified in some ways and the independence of the board was strengthened . other changes include a new provision that empowers the chief justice of the u.s. supreme court to appoint a presiding judge for title iii debt adjustment cases in which the territory is a party , while the chief judge of the applicable court of appeals would appoint the presiding judge for cases involving only the instrumentalities of the territory . the relationship between title vi collective action procedures to reach debt modification agreements and the title iii debt adjustment process was also modified . a provision to allow a transfer of certain federally controlled parts of vieques island to commonwealth control was dropped . the time period that the puerto rico governor could propose , subject to board approval , to set a training wage below the usual federal minimum wage but above a $ 4.25 / hour floor was shortened from five to four years , or when the oversight board terminates , if sooner . a public comment period provision was added to the title v expedited approval process . mandates for reports from a congressional task force and the government accountability office ( gao ) were also added . the report presents a brief description of puerto rico , its relationship with the federal government , and its fiscal challenges . a short overview of the bill , along with a comparison with previous legislation involving control boards , follows . the body of the report provides a section - by - section description of h.r . 5278. appendix a gives a background on puerto rico 's fiscal situation and aspects relevant to h.r . 4900. appendix b contains a summary of provisions of the federal bankruptcy code cited in h.r . 5278 .
this report describes how current patent litigation reform legislation would change existing patent law to address the perceived problems caused by entities that engage in patent litigation tactics that have been criticized as abusive or deceptive . the bills introduced in the 114th congress include the innovation act ( h.r . 9 ) , protecting american talent and entrepreneurship act ( patent ) act ( s. 1137 ) , demand letter transparency act of 2015 ( h.r . 1896 ) , targeting rogue and opaque letters ( trol ) act ( h.r . 2045 ) , and the support technology and research for our nation 's growth ( strong ) patents act of 2015 ( s. 632 ) . the legislation includes the following changes to the patent system : heightened pleading requirements : the innovation act and the patent act would require parties alleging patent infringement in a civil action to include in the court pleadings specified details concerning each claim of each patent infringed , and the acts of the alleged infringer . limits on discovery : the innovation act ( as reported by the house judiciary committee ) and the patent act propose limitations on discovery pending the resolution of certain motions , including motions to dismiss , transfer venue , and drop parties . transparency of patent ownership : the innovation act and the patent act would require plaintiffs in patent cases to disclose to the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , the court , and all adverse parties information relating to entities that own or have a financial interest in the patent . customer - suit exception : the innovation act and the patent act would allow a court to stay litigation against a customer of a product that contains allegedly infringing technologies , if the manufacturer of the product is a party to the same or other action on the same patent and other requirements are satisfied . shifting of attorney fees : the innovation act would require a district court to award attorney fees to a prevailing party in patent cases , unless the court finds that the nonprevailing party 's position and conduct `` were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special circumstances ... make an award unjust . . the patent act would require the prevailing party to make a motion to the court to determine whether the nonprevailing party 's position and conduct were `` objectively reasonable '' ; if they were not , then the court must award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party unless there are special circumstances that would make an award unjust . fee recovery : the innovation act and the patent act contain provisions that address the situation when the nonprevailing party alleging infringement is unable to pay the fee award and other expenses . the innovation act ( as reported ) and the patent act would allow a defendant to submit a statement early in the litigation claiming that the plaintiff 's primary business is the assertion and enforcement of patents ; the plaintiff would then need to certify that it has sufficient funds to satisfy any potential award of attorney fees that may be assessed , and to identify ( and provide notice to ) any `` interested parties '' that could be held accountable for the award if the plaintiffs are unable to pay it . demand letters : several bills propose various approaches to address demand letters . the strong patents act and the trol act would impose specific enforcement and content requirements for demand letters . the innovation act expresses the sense of congress that purposely evasive demand letters are abusing the patent system in a manner contrary to public policy . the demand letter transparency act proposes both disclosure and content requirements directed towards `` abusive '' demand letter practices , and the patent act focuses on pre - suit notifications . post - grant review reforms : the innovation act , patent act ( as reported by the senate judiciary committee ) , and the strong patents act would mandate that the patent trial and appeal board ( ptab ) , in inter partes review ( ipr ) and post - grant review ( pgr ) proceedings , follow the same claim construction standard used by district courts . the innovation act and the patent act ( as reported ) would require the ptab to consider prior claim construction by a court in a civil action in which the patent owner was a party . in addition , the innovation act and the patent act would narrow the estoppel effect arising from a pgr . the innovation act ( as reported ) and the strong patents act would heighten the standing requirements for persons wanting to initiate a pgr or ipr . the strong patents act would also require the ipr / pgr petitioner to prove unpatentability of a patent claim by `` clear and convincing evidence . . elimination of uspto fee diversion : the strong patents act would permit the uspto to spend all fee revenue that it collects without further appropriation action or fiscal year limitation . venue : the innovation act ( as reported ) would impose limitations on the judicial districts in which a civil action may be brought for patent infringement or for a declaratory judgment that a patent is invalid or not infringed . assistance for small businesses : the innovation act , strong patents act , and the patent act contain provisions designed to help small businesses that participate in the patent system either as patent owners or as defendants .
this report is part of a suite of reports that discuss appropriations for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) for fy2016 . it specifically discusses appropriations for the components of dhs included in the third title of the homeland security appropriations bill — the national protection and programs directorate ( nppd ) , the office of health affairs ( oha ) , and the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) . collectively , congress has labeled these components in the appropriations act in recent years as `` protection , preparedness , response , and recovery . . the report provides an overview of the administration 's fy2016 request for protection , preparedness , response , and recovery , and the appropriations proposed by congress in response , and those enacted thus far . rather than limiting the scope of its review to the third title , the report includes information on provisions throughout the proposed bill and report that directly affect these functions . protection , preparedness , response , and recovery is the second largest of the four titles that carry the bulk of the funding in the bill . the administration requested $ 6,222 million for these components in fy2016 , $ 267 million more than was provided for fy2015 . these three components made up 15.0 % of the administration 's $ 41.4 billion request for the department in net discretionary budget authority , and the proposed additional funding was 15.5 % of the total net increase requested . most of the proposed net discretionary increase was for nppd ( $ 157 million , or 10.5 % more than last year ) and its work in cybersecurity and communications . the administration also requested an additional $ 6.7 billion not reflected above for the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) in disaster relief funding , as defined by the budget control act ( bca , p.l . 112-25 ) . senate - reported s. 1619 would have provided the components included in this title $ 6,291 million in net discretionary budget authority . this would have been $ 69 million ( 1.1 % ) more than requested , and $ 336 million ( 5.6 % ) more than was provided in fy2015 . the senate - reported bill also included the requested disaster relief funding . house - reported h.r . 3128 would have provided the components included in this title $ 6,122 million in net discretionary budget authority . this would have been $ 100 million ( 1.6 % ) less than requested , and $ 167 million ( 2.8 % ) more than was provided in fy2015 . like the senate - reported bill , the house - reported bill also included the requested disaster relief funding . on december 18 , 2015 , the president signed into law p.l . 114-113 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2016 , division f of which was the department of homeland security appropriations act , 2016. the act included $ 6,353 million for these components in fy2016 , $ 398 million ( 6.8 % ) more that was provided for fy2015 , and $ 131 million ( 2.1 % ) more than was requested . additional information on the broader subject of fy2016 funding for the department can be found in crs report r44053 , department of homeland security appropriations : fy2016 , as well as links to analytical overviews and details regarding appropriations for other components . this report will be updated if supplemental appropriations are provided for any of these components throughout the fy2016 appropriations process .
the purpose of this report is to provide an analysis of the fy2016 continuing appropriations in h.r . 719. none of the fy2016 regular appropriations bills were enacted by the start of the fiscal year ( october 1 , 2015 ) . on september 30 , 2015 , h.r . 719 , a continuing resolution ( cr ) for fy2016 , was signed into law by the president ( p.l . 114-53 ) . the cr for fy2016 covers all 12 regular appropriations bills by providing continuing budget authority for projects and activities funded in fy2015 by that fiscal year 's regular appropriations acts , with some exceptions . it includes both budget authority that is subject to the statutory discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense spending and also budget authority that is effectively exempt from those limits , such as that designated as for `` overseas contingency operations / global war on terrorism . . funding under the terms of the cr is effective october 1 , 2015 , through december 11 , 2015 — roughly the first 10 weeks of the fiscal year . the cr generally provides budget authority for fy2015 projects and activities at the rate they were funded during that fiscal year . most projects and activities funded in the cr are subject to an across - the - board decrease of less than 1 % ( 0.2108 % ) . according to the congressional budget office ( cbo ) , the total amount of annualized budget authority for regular appropriations in the fy2016 cr that is subject to the statutory discretionary spending limits is $ 1,016.582 billion . when spending is included in the cbo estimate that is effectively not subject to those limits , the total amount of annualized budget authority in the cr is $ 1,099.962 billion . in addition to the general provisions that establish the coverage , duration , and rate , crs usually include provisions that are specific to certain agencies , accounts , or programs . these include provisions that designate exceptions to the formula and purpose for which any referenced funding is extended ( referred to as `` anomalies '' ) and provisions that have the effect of creating new law or changing existing law ( often used to renew expiring provisions of law ) . the cr includes a number of such provisions , each of which is briefly summarized in this report . crs appropriations process experts for each of these provisions are listed in table 1. for general information on the content of crs and historical data on crs enacted between fy1977 and fy2015 , see crs report r42647 , continuing resolutions : overview of components and recent practices , by [ author name scrubbed ] . for information on the fy2016 appropriations process , see crs report r44062 , congressional action on fy2016 appropriations measures , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
the united states - hong kong policy act of 1992 ( p.l . 102-383 ) declares that , `` support for democratization is a fundamental principle of u.s. foreign policy . as such , it naturally applies to united states policy toward hong kong . . china 's law establishing the hong kong special administration region ( hksar ) , commonly referred to as the `` basic law , '' declares that `` the ultimate aim '' is the selection of hong kong 's chief executive ( ce ) and legislative council ( legco ) by universal suffrage . the year 2015 may be a pivotal year for making progress toward the objectives of both of these laws . it could also be a year in which the democratic aspirations of many hong kong residents remain unfulfilled . hong kong 's current chief executive , leung chun - ying , initiated a six - step process in july 2014 whereby hong kong 's basic law could be amended to allow the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017. on august 31 , 2014 , china 's national people 's congress standing committee ( npcsc ) completed the second step of the reform process when it issued a decision setting comparatively strict conditions on the adoption of universal suffrage for the 2017 ce elections that seemingly preclude the nomination of a pro - democracy candidate . the third step of the process , the ce submitting legislation to legco to amend the basic law , came on june 17. on june 18 , legco defeated the proposed election reforms by a vote of 28 against and 8 in favor of the legislation , completing the fourth step and terminating one path to universal suffrage . public opinion in hong kong over the proposed ce election reforms is split , with opinion surveys showing a sharp division of opinion on accepting the npcsc 's conditions . in the autumn of 2014 , anger in hong kong over the npcsc 's august 2014 decision precipitated the occupation of several major hong kong roads by thousands of hong kong residents . these occupations were ended in december 2014 by the deployment of thousands of police officers , but scattered protests continue . the democratization of hong kong not only has implications for u.s. relations with hong kong , but also for u.s. relations with china and the political development of taiwan and cross - strait relations . in response to the pro - democracy protests in hong kong , members of the 113th congress introduced the hong kong human rights and democracy act ( h.r . 5696 and s. 2922 ) , to amend the united states - hong kong policy act of 1992. the senate version of the legislation was amended by the senate foreign relations committee and placed on the senate legislative calendar on december 11 , 2014 , but did not receive consideration by the full senate . the hong kong human rights and democracy act has been reintroduced in the 114th congress in the house of representatives ( h.r . 1159 ) with some changes , but not in the senate . in addition , the 114th congress may consider continuing appropriations for existing programs to promote the democratization of hong kong . because the process of possibly reforming hong kong 's election laws is underway , this report will be updated as circumstances or conditions in hong kong significantly change . this update reflects legco 's defeat of the proposed resolution and possible next steps in election reforms .
congress has played an active role in u.s. policy toward sudan for more than three decades . efforts to support an end to the country 's myriad conflicts and human rights abuses have dominated the agenda , as have counterterrorism concerns . when unified ( 1956-2011 ) , sudan was africa 's largest nation by area , bordering nine countries and stretching from the northern borders of kenya and uganda to the southern borders of egypt and libya . strategically located along the nile river and the red sea , sudan was historically described as a crossroads between the arab world and africa . domestic and international efforts to unite the country 's ethnically , racially , religiously , and culturally diverse population under a common national identity fell short , however , and in 2011 , after decades of civil war and a six - year transitional period , sudan split in two . mistrust between the two sudans — sudan and south sudan — lingers , and unresolved disputes and related security issues still threaten to pull the two countries back to war . the north - south split did not resolve other simmering sudanese conflicts , notably in darfur , blue nile , and southern kordofan . roughly 3.7 million people are displaced , internally or as refugees , by violence in these areas . like the rest of the sahel , sudan is susceptible to drought and food insecurity , despite significant agricultural potential in some areas . civilians in conflict zones are particularly vulnerable . instability and government restrictions limit relief agencies ' access to conflict - affected populations . logistical challenges , particularly during seasonal rains , also constrain access to those who have fled to remote refugee camps in south sudan . the internal conflict that unfolded in south sudan in late 2013 further threatens access to those refugees , and has led more than 146,000 south sudanese to flee into sudan . harassment of aid workers is a problem in both countries , further hindering aid responses . the peaceful separation of sudan and south sudan was seen by some as an opportunity to repair relations between sudan 's islamist government and the united states . those ties have long been strained over khartoum 's human rights violations and history of relations with terrorist groups . among the arguments in favor of normalizing relations has been the notion that the united states , given robust sanctions already in place , has few additional unilateral `` sticks '' to apply . advocates have argued that certain `` carrots , '' such as easing sanctions or elevating the level of diplomatic engagement , might advance u.s. policy goals . efforts by the obama administration to improve relations , given sudan 's reported counterterrorism cooperation and acceptance of south sudan 's separation , have been impeded by reports of ongoing abuses , including allegations that sudan continues to commit war crimes against civilians . diplomatic relations are also complicated by the fact that several sudanese officials , notably president omar al bashir , stand accused of war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide at the international criminal court . in 2014 , under domestic and international pressure to address calls for reform and to resolve ongoing conflicts , president bashir announced a national dialogue , under which the government would engage opposition and civil society groups on the development of a new constitution . the african union , the united nations , the obama administration and other international actors expressed cautious support for the initiative , although the extent of the government 's commitment to major political reforms remains unclear , and efforts to facilitate the participation of armed opposition groups in the process have been , to date , unsuccessful . major opposition parties boycotted elections held in april 2015 ; president bashir was reelected with 94 % of the vote . this report provides an overview of political , economic , and humanitarian conditions , examines conflict dynamics in the country , and outlines u.s. policy and congressional engagement .
the u.s. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly - pathogenic avian influenza ( hpai ) . the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) animal and plant health inspection service ( aphis ) has reported 223 cases of hpai in domestic flocks in 15 states . with the start of summer , the finding of new cases slowed . the last reported new case was in iowa on june 17 , 2015. more than 48 million chickens , turkeys , and other poultry have been euthanized to stem the spread of the disease . cases have been caused by several highly pathogenic h5 avian influenza ( ai ) strains that result in substantial mortality in domestic poultry . turkey and egg - laying hen farms in minnesota and iowa have been hardest hit . commercial broiler farms have not been affected to date . according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , no infections in humans have been associated with the hpai outbreak , and the public health risk is low . under the animal health protection act ( ahpa ; 7 u.s.c . §8301 et seq . ) , aphis , in cooperation with state and local animal health officials , has the authority to take extraordinary measures , such as seizing , restricting movement , or euthanizing animals to protect the health of animals . during the current outbreak , aphis has paid to euthanize poultry , clean and disinfect poultry premises and equipment , and then test for the ai virus to ensure poultry farms can be safely repopulated . usda has indemnified poultry owners for euthanized poultry . usda has received approval to use nearly $ 700 million in additional funds from the commodity credit corporation ( ccc ) to address hpai . as of july 7 , 2015 , aphis has committed over $ 500 million of the $ 700 million to help producers control the spread of hpai , including $ 190 million for indemnity payments . the agency is committed to covering cleaning and disinfecting costs on affected farms . the cost of the hpai outbreak to the poultry industry is high . the value of turkey and laying hen losses is estimated at nearly $ 1.6 billion . economy - wide losses are estimated at $ 3.3 billion . since the hpai outbreak in december 2014 , 18 u.s. trading partners have imposed bans on all shipments of u.s. poultry and products , and 38 trading partners have imposed partial , or regional , bans on shipments from states or parts of states with hpai cases . china , russia , and south korea , 3 of the top 10 destinations for u.s. poultry meat in 2014 , have banned all imports of u.s. poultry . it is believed that an hpai outbreak is likely to occur again in the fall when wild birds begin their migrations through the four flyways . this may result in more spread of ai , possibly in the poultry - producing eastern and southeastern regions untouched by the current outbreak . aphis and the poultry industry are taking lessons from the current outbreak to prepare for the fall . usda is developing a vaccine to be available for manufacture if the agency decides to adopt a vaccination policy to manage any future outbreak . aphis and the poultry industry are reassessing biosecurity , indemnity payment formulas , and other measures that aim to improve the containment and elimination process .
geographic proximity has forged strong linkages between the united states and the nations of latin america and the caribbean , with u.s. interests encompassing economic , political , and security concerns . u.s. policymakers have emphasized different strategic interests in the region at different times , from combating soviet influence during the cold war to advancing democracy and open markets since the 1990s . during the obama administration , u.s. policy toward the region chiefly sought to strengthen democratic governance , defend human rights , improve citizen security , enhance social inclusion and economic prosperity , and foster clean energy development and resiliency to climate change . the united states has provided foreign assistance to the region to advance those priorities . assistance trends since 1946 , the united states has provided nearly $ 165 billion of assistance to the region in constant 2014 dollars ( or more than $ 79 billion in historical , non - inflation - adjusted dollars ) . funding levels have fluctuated over time , however , according to regional trends and u.s. policy initiatives . u.s. assistance spiked during the 1960s under president john f. kennedy 's alliance for progress and then declined in the 1970s before spiking again during the central american conflicts of the 1980s . after another decline during the 1990s , assistance remained on a generally upward trajectory through the first decade of this century . aid appropriations for the region declined in each of the four fiscal years between fy2011 and fy2014 before increasing slightly in fy2015 and fy2016 . fy2017 request the obama administration 's fy2017 foreign aid budget request included $ 1.7 billion to be provided to latin america and the caribbean through the state department and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) . under the request , the amount of aid provided to the region would remain relatively flat compared to fy2016 , but the allocation of assistance within the region would change in several ways . the request would provide additional assistance to central american nations to address the root causes of emigration from the subregion and additional assistance to colombia to help end its five - decade internal armed conflict . conversely , the request would reduce funding for u.s. security initiatives in mexico , central america , and the caribbean . legislative developments on december 10 , 2016 , president obama signed into law a continuing resolution ( p.l . 114-254 ) that funds most foreign aid programs at the fy2016 level , minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.1901 % , until april 28 , 2017. the measure replaced a previous continuing resolution ( p.l . 114-223 ) that funded most foreign aid programs at the fy2016 level , minus an across - the - board reduction of 0.496 % , between october 1 , 2016 , and december 9 , 2016. p.l . 114-223 also included $ 145.5 million in supplemental fy2016 appropriations for global health assistance to address the zika virus outbreak in latin america and the caribbean . the 115th congress will need to complete action on fy2017 appropriations for the balance of the fiscal year . it may draw from the fy2017 department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations measures , s. 3117 and h.r . 5912 , which were reported out of the senate and house appropriations committees during the second session of the 114th congress but never received floor consideration .
some tax proposals have focused on broadening the tax base and lowering the rates of both individual and corporate income taxes . in some cases , these proposals have advanced a revenue - neutral tax reform . in other instances , they have proposed revenue increases . an example of a broad - based revenue - neutral income tax reform is h.r . 1 introduced in the 113th congress by then ways and means chairman dave camp . the bill proposed lowering both individual and corporate rates , while increasing the tax base through revising both business - related tax benefits ( such as accelerated depreciation ) and individual benefits ( such as itemized deductions ) . given the challenges of adopting a broad income tax reform , some proposals have focused on business - only tax reform . the obama administration has proposed such a reform , which would be revenue neutral and include cutting the corporate rate , reducing business - related tax expenditures , reducing taxes on manufacturing , simplifying taxes for small business , and reforming the international tax system . a challenge to confining tax reform to businesses is that provisions that expand the tax base may affect pass - through businesses , such as partnerships , proprietorships , and small business ( subchapter s ) corporations . unlike income in regular corporations , which is subject to the corporate income tax rate , income in pass - through businesses passes through to the individual owners and is taxed at the individual income tax rate . the effects on pass - throughs of broadening the tax base most likely could not be offset by generally lowering individual tax rates because the vast majority of those individual rates apply to labor or passive income . the cost of lowering the individual rates on this labor or passive income would probably be prohibitive . as a result , a revenue - neutral tax reform composed solely of corporate rate reductions and base - broadening provisions would likely increase the tax burden on pass - through businesses in the absence of other revisions . noncorporate business income is large relative to that of the corporate sector , but small relative to total individual income . noncorporate business and rental income is estimated to be 45 % of total business income but only 9.2 % of income reported on individual income taxes . unincorporated businesses are estimated to own around 40 % of the business capital stock . broadening the tax base could be achieved by eliminating various tax expenditures , such as exemptions , credits , or deductions . of the major corporate tax expenditures and other provisions that might be considered for base - broadening , the largest is the deferral of tax on foreign source income , which accounts for about 40 % of corporate tax expenditures and is almost entirely corporate . this provision , however , may not be available for corporate rate reduction , based on international tax reform proposals that have been advanced . of the other tax expenditures , some have limited overlap with unincorporated businesses whereas others significantly affect pass - through businesses . the next two largest tax corporate tax expenditures , accelerated depreciation for equipment and the production activities deduction , also benefit pass - through businesses . increasing the tax burden on pass - through businesses to finance corporate rate reductions could lead to efficiency gains because corporate income currently is taxed more heavily than noncorporate income . moreover , any tax reform will produce winners and losers ( for example , creditors will also experience higher effective tax rates and industries will be affected differentially ) . other options for business only tax reform are to target base - broadening provisions that are primarily corporate , limit changes in provisions to corporations , introduce or expand provisions that benefit small business , allow a deduction or alternative rate structure for pass - through income , or limit corporate reform to international tax changes .

long - standing u.s. policy has treated the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency . when the united states is involved in an extended military conflict overseas , 90 % or more of military cargoes are typically carried by ship . to support the u.s. merchant marine , congress has required that `` government - impelled '' cargo sent overseas be carried on u.s. - flag ships . government - impelled cargo ( a.k.a . `` preference cargo '' ) is government - owned cargo , such as military supplies and food aid , and any cargo that is somehow financed by the federal government , such as by the export - import bank . while export shipments account for the vast bulk of government - impelled cargo , in 2008 congress extended the law to require that state and local governments and private entities importing goods with federal financial assistance ship at least 50 % of such cargo in u.s. - flag vessels . regulations to implement that requirement have not been issued . historically , cargo preference law has been used to assure that a large proportion of government - impelled cargoes is shipped in privately owned u.s. - flag ships rather than in government - owned vessels such as those now controlled by the military sealift command ( msc ) . military cargo then , and more so now , accounts for the overwhelming bulk of preference cargoes . since 1954 , an agreement between u.s. government cabinet departments has restricted the size of the military - owned fleet and has required the military to turn first to the private fleet before using its own ships . the cost of employing u.s. citizens aboard u.s. - flag commercial vessels appears to be higher than the costs of employing the federal civilian mariners that crew government - owned ships . it appears preference cargo now accounts for almost all of the revenues of the u.s. - flag international fleet . u.s. - flag ships do not appear competitive with foreign - flag ships in carrying the overwhelming bulk of exports and imports transacted in the private sector . however , congress has directed that the u.s. government pay the additional cost of u.s. - flag shipping in order to maintain the u.s. - flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary to be available in times of war or national emergency . this cost may be influenced by the level of competition among u.s. - flag carriers bidding for preference cargoes and the procedures for determining `` fair and reasonable rates . . the needs of the commercial market increasingly have diverged from those of the military , as the trend toward highly specialized and larger ships in the commercial sector appears inconsistent with the military 's shipping requirements . however , the knowledge and skills of the mariners aboard u.s. - flag commercial ships are transferrable to manning a military reserve fleet of ships . in the 114th congress , several disparate bills would have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the volume of preference cargo significantly . the bills involve the future of food - aid policy , the existence of the export - import bank , and the level of operating subsidy provided to u.s. - flag carriers . the boom in domestic oil and gas production also has led to discussions in congress about whether u.s. - flag tankers should be guaranteed a portion of the cargo if these products are exported . these issues are arising at a time when u.s. - flag operators face a potential decline in the amount of preference cargo due to overseas troop withdrawals and changes in food - aid policy .
in 1987 , congress enacted what is commonly known as the farm program payments integrity act ( omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 , p.l . 100-203 , §§1301-1307 ) , which requires that an individual or legal entity be `` actively engaged in farming '' ( aef ) to be eligible for federal commodity revenue support programs . aef requirements apply equally to u.s. citizens , resident aliens , and foreign entities . designing a transparent and comprehensive aef definition has proven difficult and has evolved over the years . the current set of laws and rules governing farm program eligibility — for both family and nonfamily members on farm operations — remain subject to considerable scrutiny and criticism from both rural and farm advocacy groups as well as certain members of congress . in particular , critics contend that current u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) eligibility criteria — especially for providing active personal management — remain broad and subjective and may represent a low threshold to qualify for payments , thus facilitating the creation of new farm operation members simply to expand an operation 's farm payment receipts . three major categories of legal entities are subject to aef requirement for program payment eligibility : an individual , a partnership , and a corporation . an individual must meet three specific aef criteria . first , independently and separately from other individuals with an interest in the farm business , the person makes a significant contribution to the operation of : ( a ) capital , equipment , or land ; and ( b ) active personal labor and / or active personal management . second , the person 's share of profits or losses is commensurate with his / her contribution to the farming operation . third , the person shares in the risk of loss from the farming operation . an individual that meets the aef criteria is eligible for farm program payments but subject to annual payment limits . if a married person meets the aef requirements , any spouse will also be considered to have met the aef requirements , thus effectively doubling the individual payment limit . also , every family member 18 years or older who receives income based on the farm 's operating results is deemed to meet the aef requirements and is eligible for a separate payment limit . another exception to aef requirements is made for landowners provided they receive income based on the farm 's operating results . a general partnership is an association of multiple persons whereby each member is treated separately and individually for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits . a partnership 's potential payment limit is equal to the limit for a single person times the number of persons or legal entities that comprise the operation 's ownership and meet the aef requirements . thus , adding a new member can potentially provide an additional payment limit . a corporation is an association of joint owners that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits , provided that the entity meets the aef and other eligibility criteria . adding a new member generally does not affect a corporation 's payment limit but only increases the number of members that can share a single payment limit . in accordance with a provision in the 2014 farm bill ( p.l . 113-79 ; §1604 ) , usda added more specificity to the role that a nonfamily member of a partnership or joint venture must play to qualify for farm program benefits . however , considerable issues remain that may be of interest to congress . long - standing concerns remain that some farm operations are organized to overcome program payment limits and maximize the amount of their farm program payments . in particular , some advocacy groups suggest that usda 's new rule did not go far enough in tightening aef criteria and that it continues to allow for a high number of farm managers and associated payment limits for both family and nonfamily farm operations .
the phrase `` glass - steagall '' generally refers to the separation of commercial banking from investment banking . congress effected a separation of commercial and investment banking through four sections of the banking act of 1933 — sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32. these four statutory provisions are commonly referred to as the glass - steagall act . key takeaways of this report the glass - steagall debate is not centered on prohibiting risky financial services ; rather , the debate is about whether to permit inherently risky commercial and investment banking activities to be conducted within a single firm — specifically within firms holding federally insured deposits . over the course of the nearly 70-year - long glass - steagall era , the clear - cut separation of traditional commercial banking and securities activities gradually eroded . this erosion was the result of a confluence of matters , including market changes , statutory changes , and regulatory and judicial interpretations . the glass - steagall era formally ended in 1999 when the gramm - leach - bliley act ( glba ) repealed the glass - steagall act 's restrictions on affiliations between commercial and investment banks . less than a decade after glba , the united states suffered its worst financial crisis since the great depression . some have argued that the partial repeal either was a cause of the financial crisis that resulted in the so - called great recession or that it fueled and worsened the crisis 's deleterious effect . on the other hand , some policymakers argue that glass - steagall issues were not significant causes of the crisis , and that the glass - steagall act would have made responding to the crisis more difficult if it had remained in place . the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ; p.l . 111-203 ) was congress 's primary legislative prescription to prevent a similar financial crisis in the future . the dodd - frank act neither reinstated the sections of the glass - steagall act that were repealed by glba nor substantially modified the ability of banking firms to affiliate with securities firms . it did , however , include some arguably glass - steagall - like provisions , which were designed to promote financial stability going forward , reduce various speculative activities of commercial banks , and reduce the likelihood that the u.s. government would have to provide taxpayer support to avert or minimize a future financial crisis . some believe that a more effective way of accomplishing these policy objectives would be to fully reinstate the glass - steagall act . in fact , multiple bills have been introduced in the 114th congress with that stated purpose . these bills include : s. 1709 / h.r . 3054 , the 21st century glass - steagall act of 2015 , and h.r . 381 , the return to prudent banking act of 2015. on the other side of the policy discussion , some argue that the glass - steagall act is ill - suited for the current financial system and that the recent financial crisis would have occurred even if glba had never partially repealed the glass - steagall act . even if the dodd - frank act had completely re - enacted the repealed provisions of the glass - steagall act , the financial history of the glass - steagall era shows that regulatory walls could be difficult to maintain or enforce .
federal policymakers have long been interested in the potential of carbon capture and sequestration ( ccs ) as a mitigation strategy for lowering global emissions of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . congress has appropriated more than $ 7 billion since fy2008 to ccs activities at the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) . the obama administration has promulgated rules on co2 emissions from fossil fuel - burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit co2 emissions . congress remains divided over those executive branch decisions . doe , however , has continued to embrace ccs as part of the administration 's strategy to reduce co2 emissions from power plants . several bills introduced in the 114th congress address ccs directly or indirectly ( e.g . , s. 601 , s. 1283 , h.r . 3392 , and others ) . the american recovery and reinvestment act ( recovery act ; p.l . 111-5 ) provided $ 3.4 billion for ccs projects and activities at doe . the large infusion of funding was intended to help develop technologies that would allow for commercial - scale demonstration of ccs in both new and retrofitted power plants and industrial facilities by 2020. nine individual projects garnered approximately $ 2.65 billion of the $ 3.4 billion — about 78 % . each of the nine projects was awarded more than $ 100 million , and these projects illustrate that doe prioritized large - scale demonstration projects with recovery act funding . the lion 's share of funding went to doe 's flagship ccs project futuregen , which was awarded nearly $ 1 billion from the recovery act . authority to spend recovery act funds expired on september 30 , 2015. of $ 3.4 billion allocated for ccs activities , approximately $ 1.4 billion went unspent as of the spending deadline . the largest portion of the unspent funds , $ 795 million , was intended for futuregen , which doe suspended in february 2015. futuregen faced various impediments that led to its cancellation , including delays in receiving required injection well permits from the environmental protection agency , court challenges to its plan to sell electricity , and a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy group . several other large ccs demonstration projects also were canceled , suspended , or failed to spend all of their recovery act funding before the 2015 deadline . some stakeholders argue that doe 's ccs programs have been inadequately funded , providing less incentive than they should for deploying ccs . one study concluded that even the financial boost from the recovery act was insufficient . to be sure , large - scale ccs projects are complex endeavors , requiring substantial capital investment and multiyear planning and construction schedules . however , the conclusion that more federal funding by itself would be sufficient to support development and commercialization of ccs technology may be overly simplistic . doe acknowledges that many of the recovery act - funded projects were technologically difficult and challenging , but it does not consider the relinquishment of unspent funds to signify project failure . doe notes that due to its spending on ccs and its partnerships with industry , the costs of capturing co2 have dropped significantly and its projects have stored more than 10 million metric tons of co2 . the u.s. environmental protection agency 's ( epa 's ) final rule for reducing co2 emissions from new fossil fuel power plants , part of the administration 's clean power plan , found plants incorporating partial ccs to be the best system of emission reduction ( bser ) . epa asserts that ccs is technically feasible . technical feasibility , however , is just one factor of many that determine whether a project successfully reaches its goal of producing electricity and capturing co2 at commercial scale . epa states that implementing partial ccs in the rule is likely to boost future research and development in ccs technologies and to make ccs implementation more efficacious and cost - effective . that may be the case ; however , other issues also affect ccs implementation . these issues , as well as the outcomes from promulgation of epa 's final rule , will likely continue to shape the outlook for ccs commercialization and deployment .
tax expenditures — revenue losses associated with targeted provisions that move the income tax away from a `` theoretical normal '' tax system — are a long - standing feature of the u.s. tax code . in some ways , tax expenditures resemble direct spending programs . they both have similar budgetary effects and provide incentives that alter the allocation of resources . hence , tax expenditures , like direct spending , are one of the ways that the federal government plays a role in shaping the economy . tax expenditures , however , do not regularly receive the same level of scrutiny as direct spending programs . also , unlike direct spending programs , the revenue loss associated with most tax expenditures is only limited by eligibility — much like mandatory spending programs . a consequence of the limited oversight placed on tax expenditures is that activities may be supported by tax expenditures that have insufficient political support for funding through a direct spending program . during the last 40 years , the level of tax expenditures has varied both as a function of taxes collected and as a share of the economy . one possible explanation for this variability is that tax reform historically reduces the scope of tax expenditures , which otherwise grow . growth in tax expenditures has exceeded that of discretionary spending , but not mandatory spending , over the same time period . the revenue loss from tax expenditures is concentrated among a limited number of provisions , with 66 % of the revenue loss attributed to the top 10 tax expenditures against the individual income tax . in addition , the benefits of tax expenditures against the individual income tax are concentrated among upper - income taxpayers . a recent congressional budget office ( cbo ) analysis of selected tax expenditures found that 51 % of the benefits went to the top 20 % of taxpayers . tax expenditures are a common target when base - broadening tax reform is pursued — like with the tax reform act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-514 ) . this may be the result of tax expenditures being defined as being outside the normal tax code — making them a clear source for base - broadening . however , there are impediments to base broadening by eliminating or reducing tax expenditures , as some may serve important purposes , others are important for distributional reasons , and many are technically difficult to change or are broadly used by the public and quite popular .
authoring and introducing legislation is fundamental to the task of representing voters as a u.s. senator . part of what makes the american political process unique is that it affords all senators an ability to propose their own ideas for chamber consideration . by comparison , most other democratic governments around the world rely on an executive official , often called a premier , chancellor , or prime minister , to originate and submit policy proposals for discussion and enactment by the legislature . legislators serving in other countries generally lack the power to initiate legislative proposals of their own . in the american political system , ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources . any number of individuals , groups , or entities may participate in drafting bills and resolutions , but only senators may formally introduce legislation in the senate , and they may do so for any reason . when a senator has determined that a bill or resolution is ready for introduction , it can be delivered to the bill clerk 's desk on the chamber floor when the senate is in session . the sponsor must sign the measure and attach the names of any original cosponsors on a separate form . cosponsors do not sign the bill . there is no senate rule that introduced bills and resolutions must be prepared by the senate office of the legislative counsel , but the office plays an important role by providing senators and staff , at their request , with drafts of legislation . use of the office by senators and staff is nearly universal . once introduced , the senate parliamentarian , acting on behalf of the presiding officer , refers legislation to committee based primarily on how its contents align with the subject matter jurisdictions of committees established in senate rule xxv . multiple referral is rare in the senate due to senate rule xvii , which states that a measure is referred to the committee with `` jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates in such proposed legislation . . this report is intended to assist senators and staff in preparing legislation for introduction . its contents address essential elements of the process , including bill drafting , the mechanics of introduction , and the roles played by key senate offices involved in the drafting , submission , and referral of legislation . statistics on introduced bills and resolutions are presented in the final section to illustrate patterns of introduction in recent congresses .
communications between congressional committees and constituents and stakeholder groups have changed with the development of social networking services . many committees now use email , official websites , blogs , youtube channels , twitter , facebook , and other services — technologies that were either nonexistent or not widely available until recently — to communicate with members of congress , constituents , and stakeholder groups . social networking services have arguably served to enhance the ability of congressional committees to reach members of congress , constituents , and stakeholder groups and to widely disseminate committee actions and announcements . in addition , electronic communication technology has reduced the marginal cost of communication ; unlike postal letters , social media can reach a large audience for a fixed cost . these advances are altering how members organize and manage their personal and committee offices and impacting the ability of members to gather support for political and policy goals . perhaps most importantly , they may transform the very nature of representation in the united states . this report examines committee adoption and use of two social networking services : twitter and facebook . the report analyzes data on committee use of twitter and facebook collected by an academic institution in collaboration with the congressional research service during a 4½ - month period between june and october 2013. this report analyzes the following questions related to committee use of twitter and facebook : how many committees have adopted twitter and facebook ? . how widely are committee social media accounts followed ? . how much are committees using twitter and facebook ? . what are committees tweeting and posting about ? . are committees interacting with other users on twitter and facebook ? . this report provides a snapshot of a dynamic process . as with any new technology , the number of committees using twitter and facebook , and the patterns of use , may change rapidly in short periods of time . as a result , the conclusions drawn from these data can not be easily generalized or used to predict future behavior . finally , the report examines the possible implications of committees using twitter and facebook . the analysis focuses on interaction between committees and the public , real - time communications and changes in constituent feedback , and outreach to the public through social media .
tanzania is an east african country comprising a union of tanganyika , the mainland territory , and the semiautonomous zanzibar archipelago . the united states has long considered tanzania a partner in economic development and , increasingly , in regional security efforts . with nearly 54 million people , tanzania is one of the largest countries in africa by population and is endowed with substantial natural resource wealth and agricultural potential . over the past decade , it has experienced robust economic growth based largely on favorably high gold prices and tourism ; growth has averaged nearly 7 % annually . the ongoing development of large reserves of offshore natural gas discovered in 2010 has raised the prospect of substantial foreign investment inflows and export revenue . nevertheless , corruption and poor service delivery have hindered efforts to curb widespread poverty , and extensive development challenges remain . since 1977 , tanzanian politics have been dominated by the ruling chama cha mapinduzi ( ccm , party of the revolution ) , created through the merger that year of the single parties that had controlled the mainland and zanzibar since 1964. opposition parties face periodic harassment and de facto restrictions on their activities . president john magufuli , who leads the ccm , was elected in late october 2015 and is serving his first five - year term in office . his predecessor , jakaya kikwete , also of the ccm , assumed power in 2005 and won reelection in 2010 , but was constitutionally barred from running for a third term . the 2015 polls featured a close contest between the ccm and a coalition of the leading opposition parties . tanzania is generally stable and peaceful , despite periodic threats to public safety . these include sporadic attacks on tourists in zanzibar , several unattributed armed attacks on police , and occasional bombings of christian churches and other targets . tanzania has occasionally arrested suspected islamic extremists , as in april 2015 , when a group of 10 alleged members of the somali al qaeda - linked terrorist group al shabaab were taken into custody . u.s. - tanzanian relations are cordial , but have suffered tensions over the contentious 2015 / 2016 election in zanzibar , restrictions on civil liberties , and other issues . president kikwete was the first african head of state to meet with former president obama after the latter took office , and president obama stated that a `` shared commitment to the development and the dignity of the people of tanzania '' underpins bilateral ties . tanzania also maintains close economic and political ties with china . under the obama administration , aid cooperation was generally robust . how ties and assistance cooperation may proceed under the administration of president donald trump and during the 115th congress has yet to be determined . u.s. aid for tanzania has focused primarily on health , food security , agricultural development , and infrastructure , largely under multiple major presidential initiatives . u.s. assistance has also supported tanzania 's hosting of large numbers of refugees from the region . tanzania is eligible for african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ) trade benefits and in 2013 completed a $ 698 million millennium challenge corporation ( mcc ) compact focused on poverty reduction and economic growth . the mcc has since suspended activity in support of a possible second compact , citing governance concerns . u.s. security assistance increased after the 1998 al qaeda bombing of the u.s. embassy in dar es salaam . tanzania was one of six initial participants in the obama administration 's african peacekeeping rapid response partnership ( aprrp ) , which aims to build the peacekeeping capacity of african militaries . tanzania is a troop contributor to united nations ( u.n. ) peacekeeping operations in multiple african countries and lebanon .
enacted on august 2 , 2011 , the budget control act of 2011 as amended ( p.l . 112-25 , p.l . 112-240 , p.l . 113-67 , p.l . 114-74 , and p.l . 115-123 ) sets limits on defense and nondefense spending . as part of an agreement to increase the statutory limit on public debt , the bca aimed to reduce annual federal budget deficits by a total of at least $ 2.1 trillion from fy2012 through fy2021 , with approximately half of the savings to come from defense . the spending limits ( or caps ) apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority . budget authority is authority provided by law to a federal agency to obligate money for goods and services . the caps are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration . sequestration automatically cancels previously enacted appropriations ( a form of budget authority ) by an amount necessary to reach prespecified levels . the defense spending limits apply to national defense ( budget function 050 ) but not to funding designated for overseas contingency operations ( oco ) or emergencies . some defense policymakers and officials argue the spending restrictions impede the department of defense 's ( dod 's ) ability to adequately prepare military personnel and equipment for operations and other national security requirements . others argue the limits are necessary to curb rising deficits and debt . after lawmakers did not reach a deficit - reduction deal and triggered steeper reductions to the initial bca caps , congress repeatedly amended the legislation to raise the spending limits . most recently , president donald trump on february 9 , 2018 , signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) . the bill amended the bca to increase discretionary defense spending caps by the largest amounts to date — by $ 80 billion to $ 629 billion in fy2018 and by $ 85 billion to $ 647 billion in fy2019 . it did not change the spending limits for fy2020 and fy2021 . the annual federal budget deficit decreased from $ 1.1 trillion ( 6.8 % of gross domestic product ) in fy2012 to $ 665 billion ( 3.5 % of gdp ) in fy2017 , but is projected to increase to $ 1.1 trillion ( 4.9 % of gdp ) in fy2021 . meanwhile , federal debt held by the public has increased from $ 11.3 trillion ( 70.4 % of gdp ) in fy2012 to $ 14.7 trillion ( 76.5 % of gdp ) in fy2017 , and is projected to further increase to $ 19 trillion ( 83.1 % of gdp ) in fy2021 .
ongoing trade negotiations among the united states and several pacific rim countries regarding the proposed trans pacific partnership ( tpp ) agreement and between the united states and the european union with respect to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) agreement have rekindled debate over the value of including investor - state dispute settlement ( isds ) provisions in bilateral investment treaties ( bit ) and trade agreements . congress plays an important role in the approval and implementation of u.s. international investment agreements ( iia ) , and , therefore , in the approval of isds provisions within those agreements . isds provisions in iias enable an aggrieved investor , with an investment in the territory of a foreign host government , to bring a claim against that government for breach of an investment agreement before an international arbitration panel . the united states has negotiated a number of bits and free trade agreements ( fta ) that contain isds arbitration procedures for resolving investors ' claims that a host country has violated substantive obligations intended to protect foreign investors and investments from discriminatory , unfair , or arbitrary treatment by the host government . under u.s. iias , the investor and respondent country may agree that the tribunal will conduct the proceedings according to certain procedural rules , such as the international centre for settlement of investment disputes ( icsid ) rules of procedure for arbitration proceedings ; the united nations commission on international trade law ( uncitral ) arbitration rules ; or the icsid additional facility rules for disputes in which either the investor 's home country or the host country , but not both , is a member of icsid . this report focuses on the legal implications of isds provisions in u.s. iias . among other things , it discusses who may bring a claim under an iia ; how arbitrators conduct such proceedings ; the remedies available to the disputing parties ; and how tribunals have interpreted certain substantive obligations contained in u.s. iias . furthermore , the report will discuss the interplay between iias containing isds provisions , investment arbitration decisions , and domestic law within the united states , as well as the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards against countries in u.s. courts . notably , the isds provisions within one iia may differ from the isds provisions in other agreements . this report will focus on the provisions contained in the investment chapter of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) because nearly all isds cases brought by investors against the united states have been brought under that agreement . it will also focus on the investment provisions contained in the united states ' 2012 model bit , which is the document that u.s. officials use to negotiate u.s. bits , and the korea - u.s. free trade agreement ( korus ) , which has the most recent congressionally approved fta investment chapter , to show the types of provisions u.s. diplomats may seek to include in the tpp and t - tip . table 1 of this report contains summaries of isds cases brought against the united states . table 2 includes summaries of several isds cases under various iias that may be of interest to congress .
the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) was created in 1958 by the national aeronautics and space act ( p.l . 85-568 ) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities . it has four mission directorates . the science mission directorate manages robotic science missions , such as the hubble space telescope , the mars rover curiosity , and satellites for earth science research . the aeronautics research mission directorate conducts research and development on aircraft and aviation systems . the space technology mission directorate develops technologies for use in future space missions , such as advanced propulsion and laser communications . the human exploration and operations mission directorate is responsible for human spaceflight activities , including the international space station and development efforts for future crewed spacecraft . in addition , nasa 's office of education manages formal and informal education programs for school children , college and university students , and the general public . while congress is generally supportive of most nasa programs , government - wide fiscal constraints make funding decisions challenging . the administration has requested $ 19.025 billion for nasa in fy2017 . this amount is 1.3 % less than the fy2016 appropriation of $ 19.285 billion . unusually , the fy2017 request includes $ 763 million in mandatory funds . the house bill ( h.r . 5393 ) would provide $ 19.508 billion . the senate bill ( s. 2837 ) would provide $ 19.306 billion . neither bill includes mandatory funding . the fy2017 request for the science mission directorate is $ 5.601 billion , an increase of 0.2 % from fy2016 . within this total , funding for earth science , astrophysics , and heliophysics would increase , while funding for planetary science and the james webb space telescope would decrease . the house bill would provide $ 5.597 billion for science , while the senate bill would provide $ 5.395 billion . within these totals , the bills differ considerably in their allocation of funding between earth science and planetary science . the fy2017 request for the aeronautics research mission directorate is $ 790 million , an increase of 23.5 % from fy2016 . the request includes new aviation horizons ( nah ) , a new initiative of experimental aircraft and systems demonstrations . the house and senate bills would provide $ 712 million and $ 601 million , respectively , for aeronautics . the fy2017 request for the space technology mission directorate is $ 827 million , an increase of 20.4 % from fy2016 . the house and senate bills would provide $ 739 million and $ 687 million . for the human exploration and operations mission directorate , the fy2017 request for exploration is $ 3.337 billion , a decrease of 17.2 % from fy2016 , while the request for space operations is $ 5.076 billion , an increase of 0.9 % . the exploration request includes $ 1.263 billion , a decrease of 35.2 % , for space launch system launch vehicle development . funding for the commercial crew program ( formerly requested in exploration ) is combined with funding for operational cargo and crew transport to the international space station in a new space transportation item within space operations . the house bill would provide $ 4.183 billion for exploration , including $ 2.000 billion for sls development , and $ 4.890 billion for space operations . the senate bill would provide $ 4.330 billion for exploration , including $ 2.150 billion for the sls , and $ 4.951 billion for space operations . the fy2017 request for the office of education is $ 100 million , a decrease of 13.0 % from fy2016 . the house and senate bills would provide $ 115 million and $ 108 million , respectively . the request would reduce funding for the national space grant college and fellowship program , the experimental program to stimulate competitive research , and the minority university research education program . both bills would fund these programs at their fy2016 levels .
the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) was comprehensively reauthorized by the every student succeeds act ( essa ; p.l . 114-95 ) on december 10 , 2015. the title i - a program is the largest grant program authorized under the esea and is funded at $ 14.9 billion for fy2016 . it is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low - achieving and other students attending pre - kindergarten through grade 12 schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low - income families . under current law , the u.s. department of education ( ed ) determines title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) based on four separate funding formulas : basic grants , concentration grants , targeted grants , and education finance incentive grants ( efig ) . annual appropriations bills specify portions of each year 's title i - a appropriation to be allocated to leas and states under each of these formulas . for each formula , a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a `` formula child count , '' consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school - age children in poor families , by an `` expenditure factor '' based on state average per pupil expenditures for public k - 12 education . in some formulas , additional factors are multiplied by the formula child count and expenditure factor . these maximum grants are then reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula , taking into account a variety of state and lea minimum grant and `` hold harmless '' provisions . in general , leas must have a minimum number of formula children and / or a minimum formula child rate to be eligible to receive a grant under a specific title i - a formula . some leas may qualify for a grant under only one formula , while other leas may be eligible to receive grants under multiple formulas . this report provides a general overview of the key components of each of the formulas .
the importance of children 's early learning experiences to their development and later success in school and the workforce has become a subject of increasing interest to the public , members of congress , and the administration . during recent congresses many bills have been introduced that would provide funding to states aiming to facilitate improvements in the quality of , and access to , early childhood education ( ece ) programs . this report focuses on two early childhood initiatives — race to the top - early learning challenge ( rtt - elc ) grants for fy2011-fy2013 and preschool development grants ( pdg ) for fy2014-fy2016 . both programs have been administered jointly by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) . in addition to background and information on these programs , the report provides data on states that received grants under one or both of these programs . through the rtt - elc program , ed and hhs awarded three rounds of rtt - elc grants in december 2011 ( $ 500 million ) , 2012 ( $ 133 million ) , and 2013 ( $ 370 million ) . nine states received rtt - elc grants in 2011 ( phase 1 ) , five states in 2012 ( phase 2 ) , and six states in 2013 ( phase 3 ) . these grants were broadly focused on building comprehensive statewide systems to support high - quality preschool , as well as increasing access to preschool for high - need children . the obama administration 's proposed pdg program was intended to build on the rtt - elc grants program to accomplish similar goals . for fy2014-fy2016 , the pdg program focused specifically on expanding access to high - quality preschool for four - year - olds from low - income families . the administration requested $ 750 million in fy2014 and fy2016 , and $ 500 million in fy2015 for the pdg program ; the program received $ 250 million in each of the three years . according to the administration 's fy2016 budget request to congress , higher funding for the pdg program would help lay the groundwork for the administration 's larger preschool for all initiative — which was intended to provide high - quality preschool to all low - and moderate - income children . separately , the every student succeeds act ( p.l . 114-95 ) , enacted in december 2015 , established a standalone authorization for a new pdg program . this new program has not yet been funded ; fy2017 is the first year for which funding is authorized . this report is focused on the initial programs , as administered through fy2016 . the new pdg program is generally beyond the scope of this report , though some additional information on it can be found in appendix c. on december 10 , 2014 , ed and hhs awarded pdg grants to 18 states from fy2014 funding . fy2015 and fy2016 funding allowed existing grantees to receive continuation awards but did not fund any new grantees . pgd grants were divided into two separate funding streams . states with fewer than 10 % of their four - year - olds in state - funded preschool that had not received an rtt - elc grant were eligible for pdg - preschool development grants . five states received these grants . states with more than 10 % of their four - year - olds in state - funded preschool or that had received an rtt - elc grant were eligible to apply for pdg - preschool expansion grants . thirteen states received these grants .
the agriculture appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) , except for the forest service . it also funds the food and drug administration ( fda ) and — in even - numbered fiscal years — the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) . ( for cftc , the agriculture appropriations subcommittee has jurisdiction in the house but not in the senate . ) . agriculture appropriations include both mandatory and discretionary spending . discretionary amounts , though , are the primary focus during the bill 's development , since mandatory amounts are generally set by authorizing laws such as the farm bill . the largest discretionary spending items are the special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants , and children ( wic ) ; agricultural research ; fda ; rural development ; foreign food aid and trade ; farm assistance programs ; food safety inspection ; conservation ; and animal and plant health programs . the main mandatory spending items are the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , child nutrition , crop insurance , and the farm commodity and conservation programs paid by the commodity credit corporation . the fy2017 appropriation for agriculture and related agencies was enacted on may 5 , 2017 , as part of the consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 115-31 , division a ) . the fiscal year started on october 1 , 2016 , under continuing resolutions ( crs ) that continued fy2016 funding with a few exceptions . the house and the senate appropriations committees reported their fy2017 agriculture appropriations bills ( h.r . 5054 , s. 2956 ) in april and may 2016. the discretionary total of the enacted appropriation is $ 20.877 billion , which is $ 623 million less than enacted in fy2016 ( - 2.9 % ) . it achieves this primarily by increasing budgetary offsets over the fy2016 level through greater rescissions of prior appropriations and greater scorekeeping adjustments . however , the budget authority for fy2017 provided to agencies in the major titles of the bill actually increases by $ 462 million compared to fy2016 . increases primarily include $ 163 million more for discretionary conservation programs than in fy2016 , $ 119 million more for rural development , $ 65 million more for discretionary domestic nutrition programs , $ 52 million more for animal and plant health programs , $ 51 million more for agricultural research programs , $ 42 million more for the food and drug administration , $ 29 million more for the farm service agency , $ 20 million more for usda administrative facilities , and $ 17 million more for food safety inspections . reductions primarily come from a rescission of unused domestic nutrition assistance funding ( $ 850 million rescission ) , supplemental funding for international food aid ( $ 116 million less than in fy2016 ) , agricultural research facilities ( $ 112 million less ) , greater use of a disaster designation that does not count against budget caps ( $ 76 million extra offset ) , and disaster assistance ( $ 38 million less ) . the appropriation also carries mandatory spending that totaled about $ 132.5 billion . the overall total of the fy2017 agricultural appropriation therefore exceeded $ 153 billion .
china could potentially be a much larger producer and consumer of natural gas than it is now . despite china 's pollution problems and international environmental commitments , the role of natural gas in china 's energy mix remains relatively low , particularly compared to the united states . china has announced big plans for its natural gas development and use , but the changes will require significant investment in exploration , production , infrastructure , and consumption . with a slowing economy , china may not be in a position in the short - term to undertake these investments . china 's natural gas plans have implications for a number of issues in which congress has expressed a strong interest . those issues include the prospects for u.s. hydrocarbon exports to china , prospects for u.s. energy companies ' investments in china , chinese investment in the u.s. energy sector , china 's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change , and china 's plans for disputed waters in the south china sea , which may contain hydrocarbon resources , among other topics . in the 114th congress , members have expressed interest in chinese policy related to natural gas in hearings , such as the senate committee on energy and natural resources ' january 2015 hearing on s. 33 , the lng permitting certainty and transparency act , and the same committee 's february 2015 hearing on the fiscal year 2016 budget request for the u.s. department of energy . china 's energy sector , including its natural gas industry , is controlled by the government via the national development and reform commission 's national energy administration and other regulatory and planning bodies . there are three main national energy companies — china national petroleum corporation ( cnpc ) , china petrochemical corporation ( sinopec ) , and china national offshore oil company ( cnooc ) . the first two are among the world 's largest energy companies . these companies are the primary actors domestically and internationally . china has made significant strides in diversifying its natural gas supplies . domestic production rose 164 % from 2004 to 2014 , to 135 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) . natural gas imports , which did not begin until 2006 , grew from one bcm that year to over 58 bcm in 2014. with its imports split almost evenly between pipeline and liquefied natural gas ( lng ) , china is the fourth largest natural gas importer in the world , with turkmenistan supplying just under half of its imports . growth in china 's demand for natural gas has slowed in recent years . state media reported that annual consumption in 2015 was 191 bcm , up 3.7 % from 2014. this represented the lowest rate of annual growth in a decade . china 's government expects its overall energy consumption to grow in 2016 , and for natural gas to rise to 6.2 % of primary energy needs , from 6 % in 2014. part of the slowdown in consumption growth is attributed to the slowing economy . in november 2015 , china cut natural gas prices to spur demand .
in 2013 , 32,000 americans were killed in crashes involving motor vehicles . motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for americans overall , and the number one cause of death for teenagers . millions of people are injured in crashes annually , and motor vehicle crashes are estimated to have cost some $ 242 billion in 2010 in lost productivity , medical costs , legal costs , property damage , and time lost in congestion caused by crashes . the number of people killed in crashes has declined significantly over the past decade . the reasons for this sharp decline are not entirely clear . while traffic safety agencies have attributed it , at least in part , to their safety efforts , it is in line with a general trend : as measured by the number of miles people are driving , the rate at which people are killed in traffic crashes has been declining steadily since records began to be kept in 1929. congress has played a role in improving highway safety . making road travel safer was one of the responsibilities congress gave to the federal department of transportation ( dot ) when it created the department in 1966. congress has directed dot to improve the safety of automobile design and of road design , as well as to support programs to improve driver behavior . an oft - cited statistic in traffic safety is that as many as 90 % of road deaths are due at least in part to driver error or misbehavior ( such as driving too fast for conditions or driving while drunk or distracted ) . driver behavior is a state , not federal , matter ; in an effort to address it , congress has enacted programs that encourage states to pass laws to promote safer driving . the role of driver behavior versus road design and traffic management is a subject of debate . some analysts note that road designs and traffic management arrangements often allow , or even encourage , driver error and misbehavior , and so play a larger role in crashes than is often recognized . one of the core highway capital improvement programs congress has authorized is intended to fund safety improvements to highway infrastructure . a federal study estimated that half of the improvement in highway fatality rates since 1960 was attributable to improvements in vehicle safety technologies , with social and demographic changes , driver behavior interventions , and improvements in road design playing smaller roles . most of the vehicle safety technologies analyzed in the study increased the likelihood that vehicle occupants would survive a crash . more recently , technological development has focused on preventing crashes . while some crash - prevention technologies , such as automatic braking and lane departure warnings , are available now , others , such as vehicle - to - vehicle communication and vehicles that can operate without human intervention , are not yet on the market . given that most vehicles remain in use for many years , it may be a decade or more before the majority of cars on the road incorporate those new technologies . there is opportunity for further improvement : crash and injury rates are no longer declining , and preliminary estimates indicate the fatality rate increased significantly in the first nine months of 2015. several other nations have significantly improved their highway safety rates in the past few decades , surpassing the u.s. rates . policy options that might further reduce traffic crashes , injuries , and fatalities include encouraging states to adopt stronger laws regarding use of seat belts and motorcycle helmets , encouraging the use of automated traffic enforcement to reduce speeding and failure to stop at red lights and stop signs , and accelerating the deployment of new vehicle safety technologies . motorcycle helmet laws and automated traffic enforcement have encountered public opposition .
a former trading and military outpost of the british empire , the tiny republic of singapore has transformed itself into a modern asian nation and a major player in the global economy , though it still substantially restricts political freedoms in the name of maintaining social stability and economic growth . singapore 's heavy dependence on international trade makes regional stability and the free flow of goods and services essential to its existence . as a result , the island nation is a firm supporter of the u.s. security role in asia , but it also maintains close relations with china . the obama administration 's strategy of rebalancing u.s. foreign policy priorities to the asia pacific enhances singapore 's role as a key u.s. partner in the region . a formal strategic partnership agreement between the united states and singapore outlines access to military facilities , cooperation in counterterrorism and counter - proliferation , joint military exercises , policy dialogues , and shared defense technology . singapore also supports u.s. international trade policy . singapore and the united states are among the 12 countries on both sides of the pacific involved in the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) , which is the centerpiece of the obama administration 's economic rebalance to asia . in 2015 , singapore was the 17th - largest u.s. trading partner with $ 47 billion in total two - way goods trade , and the country remains a substantial destination for u.s. foreign direct investment . the u.s. - singapore free trade agreement ( fta ) went into effect in january 2004 , and since then trade has burgeoned between the two countries . singapore 's people 's action party ( pap ) has won every general election since the end of the colonial era in 1959 , aided by a fragmented opposition , singapore 's economic success , and electoral procedures that strongly favor the ruling party . some point to changes in the political and social environment that may herald more political pluralism , including generational changes and an increasingly international outlook among singaporeans . however , the pap maintains a dominant political position . in september 2015 , it won nearly 70 % of the popular vote in nationwide parliamentary elections that left it with 83 of the 89 seats in parliament . in march 2015 , lee kuan yew , who was singapore 's prime minister from 1959 to 1990 , passed away . he was — and still is — considered the founder of modern singapore , and he is credited with transforming singapore from an english colony into one of the world 's wealthiest and least corrupt countries . his son , lee hsien loong , is singapore 's current prime minister .
several high - profile police shootings and other law enforcement - related deaths in the united states have sparked intense protests throughout the country and a fierce debate in congress concerning the appropriate level of force police officers should wield in a society that equally values public safety and the lives of each of its citizens under law . these incidents have been the subject of several congressional hearings , have prompted the introduction of various legislative measures , and have catalyzed a new civil rights movement in the united states aimed at reforming the criminal justice system . reformers claim that police work too closely with local prosecutors resulting in insufficient oversight and have called for greater involvement by the federal government . the law enforcement community and its supporters have countered that these recent deaths are anomalous in otherwise exemplary police conduct , and that placing the federal government in direct regulation of state and local police would present an unwarranted intrusion into state and local affairs . to provide legal context for this debate , this report will address three overarching questions : ( 1 ) what are the constitutional rules governing an officer 's use of force ; ( 2 ) what role has congress played in providing a remedy for a violation of these rules ; and ( 3 ) what are the potential reforms to these rules and remedies ? . rules . in a line of cases beginning in the mid - 1980s , the supreme court ruled that all claims of excessive force occurring during an arrest or investigatory stop — deadly or otherwise — are governed by the fourth amendment 's prohibition against unreasonable seizures . under prevailing judicial precedent , all uses of force must be `` objectively reasonable '' based on the totality of the circumstances viewed through the lens of the officer in the field . this requires a fact - intensive inquiry that is not easily reduced to categorical rules , but some general trends can be discerned from the case law . for instance , the courts have been deferential to officers in the field who are required to make split - second decisions in dangerous situations . also , officers need not use the least intrusive means to effectuate a seizure so long as their actions are reasonable . remedies . in an effort to provide teeth to federal constitutional restraints , congress has enacted three federal statutes that accord various remedies for police use of excessive force . first is the federal criminal statute , 18 u.s.c . section 242 , which prohibits officers from willfully depriving another of a constitutional right while acting under color of law . enacted shortly after the civil war , many have argued that section 242 's specific intent mens rea requirement is too high a threshold to provide an adequate deterrence to excessive force . moreover , the federal circuit courts are split on how to apply this test , with some requiring a strict form of intent and others permitting a reckless disregard jury instruction . second is the federal civil rights statute , 42 u.s.c . section 1983 , which provides a civil cause of action for deprivations of one 's constitutional rights . while generally viewed as successful in providing monetary damages to those injured by officers in the field , the doctrine of qualified immunity has frequently shielded officers from liability when the law was not `` clearly established '' at the time . third is the more recently enacted `` pattern or practice '' statute , 42 u.s.c . section 14141 , which authorizes the attorney general to sue local municipalities whose police forces have engaged in a pattern of excessive force under the fourth amendment . reforms . various reform bills have been introduced in the 114th congress to provide additional restraints on police use of force , including the excessive use of force prevention act of 2015 ( h.r . 2052 ) , which would criminalize the use of chokeholds , and the police accountability act of 2015 ( h.r . 1102 ) , which would create a new federal crime for certain homicides committed by law enforcement officers . additionally , several bills would place requirements on states to report use of force statistics to the federal government .
after five years of drought , rain and snowstorms in northern and central california in the winter of 2016-2017 significantly improved water supply conditions in the state in 2017. according to the u.s. drought monitor , as of late april 2017 , less than 1 % of the state was in severe drought conditions . this represents an improvement from one year prior to that date , when 73 % of the state was in severe drought conditions , and two years prior , when 92 % fell under this designation . stress on water supplies due to drought resulted in cutbacks in water deliveries to districts receiving water from federal and state facilities , in particular the federal central valley project ( cvp , operated by the bureau of reclamation ) and the state water project ( swp , operated by the state of california ) . in 2015 , california mandated a 25 % reduction in water use for nonagricultural water users , and overall swp deliveries were limited to 20 % of contractor requests . some of these restrictions have since been relaxed . reclamation estimated its initial water allocations for cvp contractors for the 2017 water year in a series of announcements in february , march , and april 2017. for the first time in years , initial water allocations for most cvp water contractors were 100 % . contractors south of the sacramento and san joaquin rivers ' delta ( bay delta ) initially received lower allocations in march 2017 ( 65 % for agricultural contractors and 90 % for municipal and industrial contractors , respectively ) , but reclamation subsequently revised these allocations upward to 100 % in april . the allocations represented a drastic change from recent years , in which no supplies were made available to many of these contractors , who farm some of the most valuable irrigated agricultural land in the country . most expect that the historically wet conditions of 2016-2017 will not continue in future years and that future water years will continue to see deliveries limited to some extent . previous cutbacks to cvp deliveries ( in particular during periods of increased precipitation ) have caused some to criticize reclamation 's management of the cvp and question the extent to which factors beyond limited water supplies ( e.g . , restrictions to protect endangered species and water quality ) influence water management and the quantity of water delivered to contractors . they argue that congressionally directed changes in the operation of the cvp that would result in increases to water allocations are needed . other stakeholders argue that some of these changes could undercut environmental regulations , harm fish and wildlife , and potentially lower water quality . they also worry that legislative proposals that would alter the implementation of the endangered species act could harm species in the region and set a precedent that could be used to affect other listed species in the future . legislation enacted in the 114th congress ( subtitle j of s. 612 , the water infrastructure improvements for the nation [ wiin ] act ) incorporated provisions from multiple california drought - related bills that had been considered dating to the 112th congress . among other things , these provisions directed pumping to `` maximize '' water supplies for the cvp ( in accordance with applicable biological opinions ) , allowed for increased pumping during certain high water events , and authorized expedited reviews of water transfers . similar to recent congresses , the 115th congress is considering legislation that proposes additional changes to cvp operations . h.r . 23 , the gaining responsibility on water act ( grow act ) incorporates a number of provisions that were included in previous legislation but were not in the final version of the wiin act . congress may consider this and similar legislation , as well as oversight of cvp operations and implementation of wiin act cvp provisions . this report provides an abbreviated background on the cvp and swp . it also provides a summary of recent hydrologic conditions in california and their effect on water deliveries .
executive permission in the form of a presidential permit has long been required for the construction , connection , operation , and maintenance of certain facilities that cross the united states borders with canada and mexico . the constitutional basis for the president 's cross - border permitting authority has been addressed by the courts , but questions remain about the manner in which this authority is exercised among the agencies to which it has been delegated . in particular , some members of congress and affected stakeholders seek greater clarity about how presidential permit applications are reviewed for various kinds of cross - border energy projects . agency authorities and decisionmaking congress has shown particular interest in the presidential permit review processes for cross - border energy infrastructure as implemented by the department of state for pipelines that transport petroleum , petroleum products , and other hazardous liquids ; the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) for natural gas pipelines ; and the department of energy ( doe ) for electricity transmission lines . the state department makes its permitting decisions primarily in accordance with directives in executive order 11423 ( e.o . ) , as amended by e.o . 13337. ferc and doe make permitting decisions in accordance with e.o . 10485 , as amended by e.o . 12038. broadly speaking , each executive order requires the respective agency to gather necessary project - specific information from the applicant ; seek input from specific outside federal agencies ; and decide whether to seek input from additional local , state , tribal , or federal agencies or from members of the public . under the applicable executive order , each agency is required to issue a presidential permit if , after evaluating all relevant project information , the agency determines that the project would `` serve the national interest '' ( pursuant to e.o . 13337 ) or be `` consistent with the public interest '' ( pursuant to e.o . 10485 ) . for the most part , agencies gather , evaluate , and consider project - related information within the framework of conducting an environmental review . such reviews are generally conducted in accordance with each agency 's process for complying with the national environmental policy act ( nepa ) . in documenting compliance with nepa , each agency evaluates the direct and indirect effects , including any cumulative impacts , of issuing the permit . to do so , each agency generally looks at the effect of constructing the entire project , not just the portions that would cross the border ( i.e . , the action for which the presidential permit is required ) . historically , evaluating impacts of the entire project would not necessarily involve a complex or particularly time - consuming review . with few exceptions , past applications for presidential permits have been for pipelines or transmission lines that extend a relatively short distance into a u.s. border state . recently , however , several pipeline projects — enbridge energy 's alberta clipper and transcanada 's keystone and keystone xl pipeline — have involved projects that are hundreds of miles long and cross multiple states . it was the larger scope of such projects that , in part , resulted in increased national attention to the most recent proposal , the keystone xl pipeline . in 2015 , the state department under president obama denied transcanada 's application for a presidential permit for the project , finding that it did not serve the national interest . however , a new permit application was approved on march 23 , 2017 , when the state department , under the trump administration , found that the project did serve the national interest . issues for congress from 2011 through 2015 , as the state department considered permit applications for the keystone xl pipeline project , congress proposed a number of bills intended to affect the state department 's decisionmaking process . although a permit has been issued for that project , congress may again consider legislative options to expedite agency decisions on future permit applications . congress may choose to address issues that arose during the keystone xl permitting process . for example , during the review , some stakeholders questioned the scope of the nepa review — some were concerned that it was too broad , others that it was too narrow . some also argued there was uncertainty over criteria the state department used to determine whether the project would serve the national interest . congress could potentially clarify these issues through legislation aimed at defining federal agency roles in authorizing cross - border projects .
the military selective service act ( mssa ) , first enacted as the selective service act of 1948 , provides the statutory authority for the federal government to maintain a selective service system ( sss ) as an independent federal agency responsible for delivering appropriately qualified civilian men for induction into the armed forces of the united states as authorized by congress . the annual budget for the agency is just under $ 23 million . one of the sss 's main functions is to maintain a database of registrants in case of a draft . the agency stores approximately 78 million records in order to verify registration status and eligibility for certain benefits that require certification of registration for eligibility . the sss has a staff of about 124 full - time employees , complemented by a corps of volunteers and military reservists . the mssa requires most males between the ages of 18 and 26 who are citizens or residents of the united states to register with selective service . women in the united states have never been required to register for the draft . men who fail to register may be subject to criminal penalties , loss of eligibility for certain federal or state employment opportunities and education benefits , and denial of security clearances . documented or undocumented immigrants who fail to register may not be able to obtain united states citizenship . registration compliance rates were 92 % in calendar year 2016. while individuals may still register at u.s. post offices , the sss attributes high compliance rates to a system of automatic electronic registration supported by state legislation and interagency cooperation . the mssa does not currently authorize the use of a draft for induction into the armed forces . when the draft has been implemented , it has met some public resistance . such resistance to the draft drives much of the opposition toward maintaining the sss and the registration requirement . even some who are not opposed to the government 's use of conscription in a time of national need are opposed to maintaining the current sss agency infrastructure . they argue that a stand - alone agency is unnecessary and expensive and that there are a number of alternatives that could more effectively and efficiently enable the country to reestablish conscription , if necessary . others counter that , at the cost of $ 23 million annually , maintaining the sss is a relatively inexpensive insurance policy should the draft need to be quickly reinstated . they also argue that maintaining the sss sends a signal to potential adversaries that the united states is willing to draw on its full national resources for armed conflict if necessary . some are concerned that the registration requirements are inequitable , arguing that it is unfair to men that women can voluntarily serve in all military occupations but are exempt from the registration requirement and the prospect of being drafted . in addition , some have raised concerns about the statutory penalties for failing to register and whether these penalties are more likely to be levied on vulnerable groups . some contend that congress should amend mssa and associated statute to remove penalties for failing to register . others argue that weakening or removing penalties would cause registration compliance rates to fall to unacceptably low levels . in response to these issues , congress has established a national commission on military , national , and public service to provide research support and recommendations on the future of the sss .
the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) requires health insurance exchanges to be established in every state . exchanges are marketplaces in which consumers and small businesses can shop for and purchase private health insurance coverage . in general , states must have two types of exchanges : an individual exchange and a small business health options program ( shop ) exchange . exchanges may be established either by the state itself as a state - based exchange ( sbe ) or by the secretary of health and human services ( hhs ) as a federally facilitated exchange ( ffe ) . some states have sbe - fps : they have sbes but use the federal information technology platform , including the federal exchange website www.healthcare.gov . in states with ffes , the exchange may be operated by the federal government alone or in conjunction with the state . states may have different structures for their individual and shop exchanges . consumers who obtain coverage through the individual exchange may be eligible for financial assistance from the federal government . financial assistance in the individual exchanges is available in two forms : premium tax credits and cost - sharing reductions . small businesses that use the shop exchange may be eligible for small business health insurance tax credits . the tax credits assist small businesses with the cost of providing health insurance coverage to employees . the aca generally requires that health insurance plans offered through an exchange are qualified health plans ( qhps ) . to be a certified as a qhp , a plan must be offered by a state - licensed issuer and must meet specified requirements , including covering the essential health benefits ( ehb ) . qhps sold in the individual and shop exchanges must comply with the same state and federal requirements that apply to qhps and other health plans offered outside of the exchanges in the individual and small - group markets , respectively . exchanges also may offer variations of qhps , such as child - only or catastrophic plans , and non - qhp dental - only plans . this report provides an overview of the various components of the health insurance exchanges . it begins with summary information about how exchanges are structured and then discusses both individual and shop exchanges in terms of eligibility and enrollment , financial assistance for certain exchange consumers and small businesses , and enrollment assistance entities . the report also describes exchanges ' role in certifying plans as qualified to be sold in their marketplaces and outlines the range of plans offered through exchanges . finally , the report briefly addresses funding for the exchanges . where applicable , the report references other crs reports that have more information on various topics .
the state of the nation 's water infrastructure and the challenges many communities face in addressing infrastructure needs continue to receive congressional attention . in 1996 , congress authorized the drinking water state revolving fund ( dwsrf ) program under the safe drinking water act ( sdwa ) to help public water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations and to meet the act 's health protection objectives . under this program , states receive annual capitalization grants from the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to provide financial assistance ( primarily subsidized loans ) to water systems for drinking water projects and related activities . through fy2018 , congress has appropriated a total of $ 20.41 billion for the program . from fy1997 through fy2017 , states provided $ 35.38 billion in dwsrf assistance to water systems for 14,090 projects . epa 's latest survey of capital improvement needs indicates that public water systems need to invest $ 472.6 billion on infrastructure improvements over 20 years to ensure the provision of safe drinking water . epa reports that , while all of the projects identified in the survey would promote sdwa health protection objectives , $ 57.6 billion ( 12 % ) of reported needs are attributable to sdwa compliance . an american water works association study estimates that restoring aging infrastructure and expanding water systems to keep up with population growth would require a nationwide investment of at least $ 1 trillion through 2035. program issues include ( 1 ) the gap between estimated needs and funding ; ( 2 ) the growing cost of complying with sdwa standards ; ( 3 ) the ability of small or disadvantaged communities to afford dwsrf or other financing ; and ( 4 ) the broader need for cities to maintain , upgrade , and expand infrastructure unrelated to sdwa compliance . several overarching policy questions are under debate , including the appropriate federal role in providing financial assistance for local water infrastructure projects and potential funding mechanisms that could supplement or replace a program reliant on annual appropriations . enacted in 2014 , the water infrastructure finance and innovation act ( wifia ; p.l . 113-121 , title v ) authorized a five - year pilot loan guarantee program to promote increased development of , and private investment in , primarily large water infrastructure projects . congress noted that wifia was intended to complement , not replace , the dwsrf program and the similar clean water act state revolving fund ( cwsrf ) program for wastewater infrastructure . for fy2017 , congress provided $ 30.0 million for wifia ( $ 25 million for epa to provide loan guarantees for water infrastructure projects and $ 5 million for administrative costs ) . the water infrastructure improvements for the nation act ( wiin act ; p.l . 114-322 ) made several revisions to the dwsrf program and authorized $ 100 million in dwsrf appropriations to michigan to assist the city of flint in repairing its water system . in p.l . 114-254 , congress appropriated the dwsrf funding authorized in the wiin act . the consolidated appropriations act , 2017 ( p.l . 115-31 ) , included $ 863.23 million in dwsrf program . for fy2018 , the president requested $ 863 million for the dwsrf program and $ 20 million for wifia . the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) , included $ 1.16 billion for the dwsrf program and $ 63 million for wifia . numerous bills in the 115th congress would expand dwsrf eligibilities , increase funding authority , and authorize new programs to assist water systems and improve infrastructure . two such bills have been reported : ( 1 ) the drinking water system improvement act of 2017 ( h.r . 3387 ) , a sdwa reauthorization bill with provisions intended to improve water systems , sdwa compliance , infrastructure resilience , consumer confidence , and source water protection , among others ; and ( 2 ) america 's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( s. 2800 ) , an omnibus water resources development act ( wrda ) and infrastructure bill that includes sdwa , the clean water act ( cwa ) and wifia srf provisions . on september 13 , 2018 , the house passed ( amended and renamed ) s. 3021 , america 's water infrastructure act of 2018 ( awia ) , which includes elements of s. 2800 and h.r . 8 , the house - passed wrda 2018 bill . title ii of awai closely parallels h.r . 3387 and includes other drinking water - related provisions . title iv contains wifia srf , cwsrf , and other cwa amendments .
a `` lame duck '' session of congress occurs whenever one congress meets after its successor is elected but before the end of its own constitutional term . under present conditions , any meeting of congress between election day in november and the following january 3 is a lame duck session . prior to 1933 , when the twentieth amendment changed the dates of the congressional term , the last regular session of congress was always a lame duck session . today , however , the expression is primarily used for any portion of a regular session that falls after an election . congress has held 21 lame duck sessions since the implementation of the twentieth amendment . from the first modern lame duck session in 1941 to 1998 , the sessions occurred sporadically . beginning in 2000 , both houses of congress have held a lame duck session following every election . in this report , the data presentation is separate for the sporadic period ( 76th - 105th congresses ) and the consistent period ( 106th - present ) in order to identify past and emerging trends . lame duck sessions can occur in several ways . either chamber or both chambers may ( 1 ) provide for an existing session to resume after a recess spanning the election ; ( 2 ) continue meeting in intermittent , or pro forma , sessions during the period spanning the election ; or ( 3 ) reconvene after an election pursuant to contingent authority granted to the leadership in a recess or adjournment resolution . two other possibilities have not occurred : ( 4 ) congress could set a statutory date for a new session to convene after the election , then adjourn its existing session sine die ; and ( 5 ) while congress is in recess or sine die adjournment , the president could call it into extraordinary session at a date after the election . during both the sporadic and the consistent periods , election breaks have usually begun by mid - october and spanned between one and two months . congress has most often reconvened in mid - november and adjourned before christmas so that the lame duck session lasted about a month . however , in four out the past five congresses , lame duck sessions have continued into january , producing later adjournments , longer sessions , and more days convened in daily sessions . lame duck sessions have been held for a variety of reasons . their primary purpose is to complete action on legislation . however , they have also been used to prevent recess appointments and pocket vetoes , to consider motions of censure or impeachment , or to keep congress assembled on a standby basis . in recent years , most lame duck sessions have focused on program authorizations , trade agreements , appropriations , and the budget . this report will be updated after any additional lame duck session occurs .
on june 6 , 2018 , the john s. mccain iii , daniel k. akaka , and samuel r. johnson va maintaining internal systems and strengthening integrated outside networks act of 2018 , or the va mission act of 2018 ( s. 2372 ; p.l . 115-182 ; h.rept . 115-671 ) , was signed into law . the department of veterans affairs expiring authorities act of 2018 ( s. 3479 ; p.l . 115-251 ) , enacted on september 29 , 2018 , made some changes and technical amendments to the va mission act . this act , as amended , broadly addresses four major areas . first , it establishes a new permanent veterans community care program ( vccp ) , replacing the current veterans choice program ( vcp ) . the va mission act stipulates that the new program must be operational when regulations are published by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) no later than one year after the date of enactment ( june 6 , 2018 ) , or when the va determines that 75 % of the amounts deposited in the veterans choice fund ( vcf ) have been exhausted . second , it expands the current program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers , in two phases , to all eligible veterans who served prior to september 11 , 2001. third , it establishes an asset and infrastructure review process by establishing an asset and infrastructure review commission . the purpose of the commission is to examine the va 's assets and to make recommendations for modernizing and realigning medical facilities . fourth , it provides various statutory authorities to the veterans health administration ( vha ) of the va to recruit and retain health care providers . veterans community care program ( vccp ) the va mission act establishes a new permanent discretionary community care program known as vccp . the act provides conditions under which the va is required to provide care in the community once the program is established . generally , all veterans enrolled in the va health care system would be able to qualify when ( 1 ) the va does not offer the care or service required by the veteran ; or ( 2 ) the veteran resides in a state without a full - service va medical facility ; or ( 3 ) the veteran previously qualified under the 40-mile criterion of the vcp ; or ( 4 ) the va can not provide the veteran with care and services that comply with designated access and quality standards ; or ( 5 ) the veteran and the veteran 's primary care provider agree that it is in the best interest of the veteran to receive care in the community . in addition , the va is required to enter into contracts to build a network of private community providers . expansion of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers the va mission act expands the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers to pre - 9 / 11 veterans in two phases . under the first phase , veterans with serious service - connected injuries incurred on or before may 7 , 1975 , would qualify for benefits over a two - year period beginning on the date when the va certifies to congress that it has fully implemented the information technology system required for this program . under the second phase , those with serious service - connected injuries incurred between may 7 , 1975 , and september 11 , 2001 , would qualify for the comprehensive assistance for family caregivers program two years after implementation of the first phase . capital asset review the va mission act establishes a process for realigning and modernizing facilities of the vha . under this process , the va will develop criteria for selecting vha facilities to dispose of , modernize , or acquire , so as to better meet the health care needs of veterans . va must then create a list of recommendations based on those criteria and submit it to a newly created asset infrastructure review ( air ) commission . the air commission shall review the va 's recommendations but may not alter them , unless it determines that one or more recommendations are inconsistent with the criteria . the commission shall submit the list of recommendations to the president , who shall either approve the list in its entirety or send it back to the air commission . the air commission may change the recommendations and resubmit a revised list to the president for reconsideration . the president may approve or disapprove of the revised list . if the president approves of the original or revised list , then va must begin implementation of the recommendations within three years , unless congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval , in which case the asset review process terminates . recruiting and retaining health care providers in the vha the va mission act authorizes or expands several programs , with the intention of recruiting and retaining health care providers in the vha . among other things , the act increases the maximum amount of student loan debt that may be reduced under va 's education debt reduction program ( edrp ) ; authorizes designated scholarships for physicians and dentists under the va health professional scholarship program ( hpsp ) ; establishes the va specialty education loan repayment program to incentivize vha employees to pursue education and training in medical specialties for which va determines there is a shortage ; establishes a pilot veterans healing veterans medical access and scholarship program ; and extends eligibility for va 's edrp to clinical staff working at vet centers . the act also requires the vha to establish a program to deploy mobile health teams to serve in underserved va medical facilities . lastly , the va mission act authorizes and appropriates $ 5.2 billion in mandatory funding for the vcp until the vccp is operational .
india is the world 's second - most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people and is the birthplace of four major world religions : hinduism , buddhism , sikhism , and jainism . it is also home to about 180 million muslims — only indonesia and pakistan have more . a small christian minority includes about 30 million people . an officially secular nation with thousands of ethnic groups and 22 official languages , independent india has a long tradition of religious tolerance ( with periodic and sometimes serious lapses ) . religious freedom is explicitly protected under its constitution . hindus account for a vast majority ( nearly four - fifths ) of the country 's populace . hindu nationalism has been a rising political force in recent decades , by many accounts eroding india 's secular nature and leading to new assaults on the country 's religious freedoms . the 2014 national election victory of the bharatiya janata party ( indian peoples ' party or bjp ) brought newly acute attention to the issue of religious freedom in india . tracing its origins to a political party created in 1951 in collaboration with the hindu nationalist rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ( national volunteer organization or rss ) , the bjp has since gone on to win control of numerous state governments , including in uttar pradesh , the country 's most populous state with more than 200 million residents , one - fifth of them muslim . the bjp 's leader , prime minister narendra modi , is a self - avowed hindu nationalist and lifelong rss member with a controversial past : in 2002 , during his 13-year tenure as chief minister of the gujarat state , large - scale anti - muslim rioting there left more than 1,000 people dead , and modi faced accusations of complicity and / or inaction ( he was later formally exculpated ) . in 2005 , modi was denied a u.s. visa under a rarely - used law barring entry for foreign government officials found to be complicit in severe violations of religious freedom , and he had no official contacts with the u.s. government until 2013. many in the u.s. congress were critical of modi 's role in the 2002 violence , and some continue to call attention to signs that religious freedom abuses are increasing under his and his party 's rule , as documented by the u.s. state department and independent human rights groups . this report provides an overview of religious freedom issues in india , beginning with a brief review of u.s. - india relations and india 's human rights setting broadly , then discussing the country 's religious demographics , religious freedom protections , and conceptions of hindu nationalism and its key institutional proponents in indian society . it then moves to specific areas of religiously - motivated repression and violence , including state - level anti - conversion laws , cow protection vigilantism , and perceived assaults on freedoms of expression and operations by nongovernmental organizations that are seen as harmful to india 's secular traditions and the u.s - promoted goal of interfaith tolerance .
venezuela remains in a deep political crisis under the authoritarian rule of president nicolás maduro of the united socialist party of venezuela ( psuv ) . maduro , narrowly elected in 2013 after the death of hugo chávez ( 1999-2013 ) , is unpopular . nevertheless , he has used the courts , security forces , and electoral council to repress the opposition . on january 10 , 2019 , maduro began a second term after winning reelection on may 20 , 2018 , in an unfair contest deemed illegitimate by the opposition - controlled national assembly and most of the international community . the united states , the european union , the group of seven , and most western hemisphere countries do not recognize the legitimacy of his mandate . they view the national assembly as venezuela 's only democratic institution . maduro 's inauguration capped his efforts to consolidate power . in 2017 , protesters called for maduro to release political prisoners and respect the opposition - led national assembly . security forces quashed protests , with more than 130 killed and thousands injured . maduro then orchestrated the controversial july 2017 election of a national constituent assembly ; this assembly has usurped most legislative functions . during 2018 , maduro 's government arrested dissident military officers and others suspected of plotting against him . efforts to silence dissent may increase , as the national assembly ( under its new president , juan guaidó ) , the united states , and the international community push for a transition to a new government . venezuela also is experiencing a serious economic crisis , and rapid contraction of the economy , hyperinflation , and severe shortages of food and medicine have created a humanitarian crisis . president maduro has blamed u.s. sanctions for these problems , while conditioning receipt of food assistance on support for his government and increasing military control over the economy . he maintains that venezuela will seek to restructure its debts , although that appears unlikely . the government and state oil company petróleos de venezuela , s. a . ( pdvsa ) defaulted on bond payments in 2017. lawsuits over nonpayment and seizures of pdvsa assets are likely . u.s. policy the united states historically had close relations with venezuela , a major u.s. oil supplier , but relations have deteriorated under the chávez and maduro governments . u.s. policymakers have expressed concerns about the deterioration of human rights and democracy in venezuela and the country 's lack of cooperation on counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts . u.s. democracy and human rights funding , totaling $ 15 million in fy2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) , has aimed to support civil society . the trump administration has employed targeted sanctions against venezuelan officials responsible for human rights violations , undermining democracy , and corruption , as well as on individuals and entities engaged in drug trafficking . since 2017 , the administration has imposed a series of broader sanctions restricting venezuelan government access to u.s. financial markets and prohibiting transactions involving the venezuelan government 's issuance of digital currency and venezuelan debt . the administration provided almost $ 97 million in humanitarian assistance to neighboring countries sheltering more than 3 million venezuelans . congressional action the 115th congress took several actions in response to the situation in venezuela . in february 2017 , the senate agreed to s.res . 35 ( cardin ) , which supported targeted sanctions . in december 2017 , the house passed h.r . 2658 ( engel ) , which would have authorized humanitarian assistance for venezuela , and h.res . 259 ( desantis ) , which urged the venezuelan government to accept humanitarian aid . for fy2019 , the administration requested $ 9 million in democracy and human rights funds for venezuela . the 115th congress did not complete action on the fy2019 foreign assistance appropriations measure . the house version of the fy2019 foreign aid appropriations bill , h.r . 6385 , would have provided $ 15 million for programs in venezuela ; the senate version , s. 3108 , would have provided $ 20 million . the 116th congress likely will fund foreign assistance to venezuela and neighboring countries sheltering venezuelans . congress may consider additional steps to influence the venezuelan government 's behavior in promoting a return to democracy and to relieve the humanitarian crisis . also see crs in focus if10230 , venezuela : political and economic crisis and u.s. policy ; crs in focus if10715 , venezuela : overview of u.s. sanctions ; and crs in focus if11029 , the venezuela regional migration crisis .
funding authorization for the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , included in the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 ( p.l . 114-190 ) , expired at the end of fy2017 . a subsequent six - month extension ( p.l . 115-63 ) is set to expire at the end of march 2018. long - term faa reauthorization measures ( h.r . 2997 and s. 1405 ) are currently under consideration . in addition to setting spending levels , faa authorization acts typically set policy on a wide range of issues related to civil aviation . this report considers prominent topics in the 115th congress reauthorization debate . most faa programs are financed through the airport and airway trust fund ( aatf ) , which is funded by a variety of taxes and fees on air transportation . the financial health of the aatf is generally good . however , airlines ' unbundling of ancillary fees from airfares is adversely affecting aatf revenue , as only base airfares are subject to the ticket tax that is the largest source of revenue for the trust fund . reductions in aatf revenue would leave faa more reliant on appropriations from the general fund . other major issues likely to arise during the reauthorization debate include the following : air traffic control privatization . many commissions over the years have recommended moving responsibility for air traffic control from faa , a government agency , to either an independent government - owned corporation or a private entity controlled by aviation stakeholders . delays in implementing the satellite - based nextgen air traffic control system have renewed interest in this possibility , although congress chose not to enact such proposals in 2016. unmanned aerial vehicles . large numbers of drones have come into use , and the numerous reports of near - collisions between drones and manned aircraft raise safety concerns . additionally , congress has not addressed privacy concerns related to government - operated , commercial , and recreational drones . essential airline service ( eas ) . congress has repeatedly attempted to limit the number of localities eligible to participate in this program to subsidize flights to communities that would otherwise lose all commercial airline service , as well as to limit the amount of subsidies per passenger . few communities have been dropped from the program , and costs continue to rise . foreign airlines . some u.s. airlines and airline labor unions seek reconsideration of the recent u.s. approval of a foreign carrier permit for norwegian air international , an ireland - based discount air carrier , to fly across the atlantic . some u.s. carriers also have called for renegotiation of u.s. air service agreements with persian gulf states amid claims that three fast - growing airlines based in that region are posing unfair competition to u.s. air carriers . certification reform . faa relies heavily on aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers to provide technical expertise in the certification process . faa oversight has been found to be inconsistent , raising questions regarding safety and efficiency . equipment manufacturers have raised concerns that faa 's certification process makes it difficult to bring new products to market in a timely fashion and threatens their international competitiveness . this report does not attempt to be comprehensive . many issues debated prior to passage of the faa extension , safety , and security act of 2016 are not discussed unless further congressional consideration appears probable . additional issues , not discussed in this report , may arise as congress moves forward with reauthorization .
the interior , environment , and related agencies appropriations bill contains funding for more than 30 agencies and entities . they include most of the department of the interior ( doi ) as well as agencies within other departments , such as the forest service within the department of agriculture and the indian health service within the department of health and human services . the bill also provides funding for the environmental protection agency ( epa ) , arts and cultural agencies , and other organizations and entities . issues for congress included determining the amount , terms , and conditions of funding for agencies and programs . for fy2019 , the enacted appropriation for interior , environment , and related agencies was $ 35.61 billion . this total was composed of $ 13.02 billion for doi agencies in title i , $ 8.06 billion for epa in title ii , $ 13.74 billion for the 23 `` related agencies '' in title iii , and $ 791.0 million in title iv for certain epa activities . the fy2019 appropriation was $ 300.0 million ( 0.8 % ) more than the fy2018 regular appropriation of $ 35.31 billion ( in p.l . 115-141 ) , but $ 975.4 million ( 2.7 % ) less than the fy2018 total appropriation of $ 36.59 billion , including $ 1.28 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief ( in p.l . 115-72 and p.l . 115-123 ) . the fy2019 appropriation was $ 7.28 billion ( 25.7 % ) more than the president 's request ( $ 28.34 billion ) , $ 305.5 million ( 0.9 % ) more than the house - passed level ( $ 35.31 billion ) , and $ 301.0 million ( 0.8 % ) less than the senate - passed amount ( $ 35.91 billion ) . because the fy2019 appropriation was not enacted until february 15 , 2019 , agencies received continuing appropriations for certain periods before that date . specifically , from october 1 , 2018 , through december 21 , 2018 , and again from january 25 , 2019 , through february 15 , 2019 , appropriations were provided under a continuing resolution ( cr ) at the fy2018 level ( in division g of p.l . 115-141 ) . due to a lapse in funds after december 21 , 2018 , until january 25 , 2019 , a partial government shutdown went into effect . agencies in the interior bill generally operated under `` contingency '' plans that summarize activities that would cease and activities that would continue during a lapse in appropriations . in earlier action , president trump 's request of $ 28.34 billion for fy2019 for interior , environment , and related agencies included $ 10.59 billion for doi agencies , $ 6.19 billion for epa , and $ 11.56 billion for related agencies . the versions of h.r . 6147 ( 115th congress ) passed by the house on july 19 , 2018 , and by the senate on august 1 , 2018 , contained higher fy2019 appropriations overall , and for each title of the bill , than requested . the president 's request also contained a legislative proposal for a $ 1.52 billion cap adjustment to the discretionary spending limits in law for certain wildland fire suppression activities . this cap adjustment was not approved by the chambers or enacted for fy2019 . however , congress enacted a similar proposal ( in p.l . 115-141 ) , under which the adjustment becomes available in fy2020 . the president , house , and senate each proposed less funding for fy2019 relative to the fy2018 total of $ 36.59 billion ( including emergency supplemental appropriations ) , proposing 22.5 % , 3.5 % , and 1.8 % less , respectively . in contrast , relative to the regular fy2018 appropriation of $ 35.31 billion , the president would have reduced funding ( 19.8 % ) , the house would have provided nearly level appropriations ( < 0.1 % decrease ) , and the senate would have increased funding ( 1.7 % ) for fy2019 . for individual agencies and programs in the bill , there are many differences among the funding levels enacted for fy2019 and those supported by the president , house , and senate for fy2019 and enacted for fy2018 . this report highlights funding for selected agencies and programs that have been among the many of interest to congress , stakeholders , and the public .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) provides a range of benefits and services to veterans and eligible dependents who meet certain criteria as authorized by law . these benefits include medical care , disability compensation and pensions , education , vocational rehabilitation and employment services , assistance to homeless veterans , home loan guarantees , administration of life insurance and traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers , and death benefits that cover burial expenses . the va is funded through the military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies ( milcon - va ) appropriations bill . on may 23 , 2017 , the president submitted his budget request to congress for fy2018 and for the advance appropriations accounts for fy2019 . the president 's fy2018 budget request for the va is $ 182.66 billion . compared with the fy2017-enacted amount of $ 176.94 billion , this would be a 3.23 % ( or $ 5.72 billion ) increase . the fy2018-requested amount includes $ 103.95 billion in mandatory budget authority and $ 78.71 billion in discretionary budget authority . for the veterans benefits administration ( vba ) , the president 's budget request includes $ 106.97 billion for fy2018 . for the veterans health administration ( vha ) the president 's budget request includes $ 69.67 billion for fy2018 , without collections . compared with the fy2017-enacted amount of $ 65.32 billion , this would be a 6.66 % increase , and the amount includes additional funding of $ 2.65 billion over the fy2018 advance appropriations of $ 66.39 billion provided in p.l . 114-223. although the veterans choice program ( vcp ) is not part of the annual appropriations for the va health care programs , the president is requesting $ 2.9 billion in mandatory funding for fy2018 and $ 3.5 billion for fy2019 to continue the program . in the meantime , p.l . 115-46 provided $ 2.1 billion in mandatory appropriations in 2017 for the veterans choice fund ( which funds vcp ) , and in 2018 , p.l . 115-96 provided another $ 2.1 billion in mandatory appropriations . in total , congress has provided $ 14.2 billion in mandatory appropriations for vcp since the program was established on august 7 , 2014 , including the initial $ 10 billion in mandatory funding provided through 2017 in p.l . 113-146 , as amended . on september 14 , 2017 , the house passed its version of the fy2018 milcon - va appropriations bill ( division k — military construction , veterans affairs , and related agencies appropriations , bill , 2018 in h.r . 3354 ) . the house - passed measure ( h.r . 3354 ) provides $ 182.28 billion for the va. this amount includes $ 103.95 billion in mandatory funding and $ 78.33 billion in discretionary funding . for the vba , the house - passed measure provides $ 107.03 billion . a majority of this funding is for mandatory benefits such as disability compensation , readjustment benefits , and veterans insurance programs . for vha , the house - passed bill provides $ 69.74 billion ( without collections ) for fy2018 . this amount includes $ 66.39 billion provided as advance appropriations in p.l . 114-223 for fy2018 for the four accounts — medical services , medical community care , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities — and $ 2.65 billion in additional funding for fy2018 for those same four accounts . the total vha amount also includes $ 698.23 million for the medical and prosthetic research account . on july 13 , 2017 , the senate appropriations committee reported its version of the fy2018 milcon - va appropriations bill ( s. 1557 ; s.rept . 115-130 ) . the committee - reported version would provide $ 182.37 billion for the va for fy2018 . this amount includes $ 103.95 billion in mandatory funding and $ 78.42 billion in discretionary funding . for the vba , the senate - reported bill recommends $ 107.04 billion for fy2018 . for vha , the committee recommends $ 70.09 billion ( without collections ) for fy2018 . this amount includes $ 66.39 billion provided as advance appropriations in p.l . 114-223 for fy2018 for the four accounts — medical services , medical community care , medical support and compliance , and medical facilities — and $ 2.98 billion in additional funding for fy2018 for those same four accounts . the total vha amount also includes $ 722.26 million for the medical and prosthetic research account . since none of the 12 regular appropriations bills were enacted prior to the start of fy2018 ( october 1 , 2017 ) , congress passed and the president signed into law several continuing resolutions ( crs ) ( p.l . 115-56 , p.l . 115-90 , p.l . 115-96 , and p.l . 115-120 ) . the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) funds some va accounts for fy2018 through march 23 , 2018 , at the fy2017 level and provides $ 93.5 million in supplemental appropriations for the va for expenses related to the consequences of hurricanes harvey , irma , and maria , among other things .
the chesapeake bay ( the bay ) is the largest estuary in the united states . it is recognized as a `` wetlands of international importance '' by the ramsar convention , a 1971 treaty about the increasing loss and degradation of wetland habitat for migratory waterbirds . the chesapeake bay estuary resides in a more than 64,000-square - mile watershed that extends across parts of delaware , maryland , new york , pennsylvania , virginia , west virginia , and the district of columbia . the bay 's watershed is home to more than 18 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals . a combination of factors has caused the ecosystem functions and natural habitat of the chesapeake bay and its watershed to deteriorate over time . these factors include centuries of land - use changes , increased sediment loads and nutrient pollution , overfishing and overharvesting , the introduction of invasive species , and the spread of toxic contaminants . in response , the bay has experienced reductions in economically important fisheries , such as oysters and crabs ; the loss of habitat , such as underwater vegetation and sea grass ; annual dead zones , as nutrient - driven algal blooms die and decompose ; and potential impacts to tourism , recreation , and real estate values . congress began to address ecosystem degradation in the chesapeake bay in 1965 , when it authorized the first wide - scale study of water resources of the bay . since then , federal restoration activities , conducted by multiple agencies , have focused on reducing pollution entering the chesapeake bay , restoring habitat , managing fisheries , protecting sub - watersheds within the larger bay watershed , and fostering public access and stewardship of the bay . congress has authorized various programs and activities to restore the chesapeake bay , including the chesapeake bay program ( cbp ) , created in 1983. the cbp implements the chesapeake bay agreement , a periodically renewed agreement between executives in the watershed states , a joint bay state legislative body , and select federal agencies that aims to coordinate bay restoration efforts . the most recent agreement was signed in 2014 ( known as the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement ) and set a series of restoration goals and actions to be completed by 2025. the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement , like others in the past , is not binding . other restoration plans — including the 2010 chesapeake bay strategy for protecting and restoring the chesapeake bay watershed ( pursuant to president obama 's 2009 executive order 13508 ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency 's 2010 chesapeake bay total maximum daily load , and a draft comprehensive plan from the u.s. army corps of engineers — harmonize with the goals of the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement and contain objectives for federal agencies and states . as work continues toward the 2025 restoration goals set by state and federal plans , congress may consider what role the federal government plays in chesapeake bay restoration , if any . in considering the federal role in chesapeake bay restoration , congress may weigh issues related to coordination of federal activities and federal agency authority , funding and total cost of activities , and the rate of progress toward restoration .
for more than 70 years , the technological superiority of the united states military has offset the size and geographic advantages of potential adversaries . the department of defense ( dod ) , due in large part to the magnitude of its investments in research and development ( r & d ) , has driven the global r & d and technology landscape . however , dod and the federal government more broadly are no longer overriding funders of r & d , and this shift in support for r & d has substantial implications for how dod obtains advanced technology and maintains the battlefield overmatch that technology has historically provided . in 1960 , the united states accounted for 69 % of global r & d , with u.s. defense - related r & d alone accounting for more than one - third of global r & d ( 36 % ) . additionally , the federal government funded approximately twice as much r & d as u.s. business . however , from 1960 to 2016 , the u.s. share of global r & d fell to 28 % , and the federal government 's share of total u.s. r & d fell from 65 % to 24 % , while business 's share more than doubled from 33 % to 67 % . as a result of these global , national , and federal trends , federal defense r & d 's share of total global r & d fell to 3.7 % in 2016. this decline resulted primarily from more rapid increases in the r & d of other nations ( public and private ) and partially from increases in u.s. business r & d and federal nondefense r & d . some defense experts and policymakers have recognized the shift in the global r & d landscape and the need for dod to rely increasingly on technologies developed by commercial companies for commercial markets . among the challenges dod faces in acquiring new , innovative technologies and maintaining u.s. military technical superiority are developing / modifying organizations and business models to access this technology ; adapting the dod business culture to seek and embrace technologies developed outside of dod , the united states , and its traditional contractor base ; and finding ways to adapt and leverage commercial technologies for defense applications . congress plays a central role in how dod creates and acquires leading - edge technologies , including establishing and refining the organizational structure of dod r & d activities , providing policy direction , establishing acquisition policies and authorities , and appropriating funds for r & d and innovation - related activities . congress and the administration have undertaken a number of actions to address the perceived decline in technical superiority , including establishing the position of the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to coordinate dod 's research enterprise , drive the development of key technologies , and create a more agile and innovative department ; increasing dod collaboration and engagement with industry and academia . for example , dod has increased its presence in u.s. commercial technology hubs through the defense innovation unit , established partnership intermediary agreements with various organizations , and co - located dod research and development personnel at partner institutions across the country ; and working to alter the culture of dod to increase the speed technologies are developed , adapted , and acquired , including through the use of other transaction authority . as dod implements these reform efforts congressional oversight may include monitoring how effectively dod is addressing congressional directives and intent to create a more risk tolerant and innovative dod .
electricity generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the united states . the u.s. electric power grid comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems that bring power to end - use customers . the u.s. electric grid has operated historically with a high level of reliability ; however , the various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural , operational , or manmade events . the bulk power system faces new and evolving cybersecurity threats . cyber threats can come from direct attacks aimed at electric grid or other critical infrastructure that could impact the operations or security of the grid . arguably , the greatest cyber threats to the grid have been intrusions focused on manipulating industrial control system ( ics ) networks . cyber intrusions on the electric grid have resulted in malware on ics networks with the capability of causing damage or taking over certain aspects of system control or functionality . recent concerns have extended to internet of things ( iot ) devices connected to networks . iot devices have been increasingly targeted by botnet malware ( whereby the hacker takes over the operation of a large number of infected devices ) to launch denial - of - service or other cyber attacks . if such iot cyber attacks were able to access electric utility ics networks , they could potentially impair these systems or cause electric power networks to operate based on manipulated conditions or false information . congress gave the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) authority to oversee the reliability of the bulk power system under the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ; epact05 ) . ferc can approve or remand back reliability standards proposed by the electric reliability organization ( ero ) , which bulk - power system owners and operators must follow to help ensure the reliable operation of the grid . the north american electric reliability corporation serves currently as the ero , and proposes mandatory and enforceable reliability standards for critical infrastructure protection ( which include physical and cybersecurity ) . there have been increasing reports about foreign hackers targeting the u.s. electric power system and other critical infrastructure . while these intrusions have not been reported as having resulted in significant disruptions , concerns have increased over the potential of the intrusions for potentially damaging cyber attacks . in 2017 , the president issued executive order ( eo ) 13800 on `` strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure '' because the risks of cyber threats to critical infrastructure are perceived as a national security imperative . eo 13800 called for an assessment of a prolonged electric power outage resulting from a cyber attack , and an evaluation of the `` readiness and gaps in the united states ' ability to manage and mitigate consequences of a cyber incident against the electricity subsector . . the cyber supply chain and public - private cybersecurity information sharing were listed among a number of major cybersecurity concerns . electricity is a subsector of the energy critical infrastructure ( ci ) sector . given that the grid relies on several of the other ci sectors ( for example , water and fuel transportation ) , the question of whether these other sectors should also have similar mandatory standards focused on support of the electric power sector may be an issue for congress to consider . the electric power system in the united states is evolving , but not consistently across sectors and regions of the country . while some may say such inconsistencies may add a level of complexity that may make a nationwide cyber event more unlikely , the consistent development of a modern electric power system would likely add to the prospects of u.s. economic health and competitiveness . policy options designed to ensure that the developing electric power system is as secure as possible , will likely be a major consideration for congress .
the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) , was signed into law on february 15 , 2019. the act included a total of $ 647.0 million in funding for three trade - related agencies under the commerce , justice , science and related agencies ( cjs ) account — the international trade administration ( ita ) , the u.s. international trade commission ( usitc ) , and the office of the united states trade representative ( ustr ) . this represents a 0.2 % decrease from fy2018 appropriations . for fy2019 , the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 , included $ 484.0 million in direct appropriations for ita ( a 0.4 % increase from the fy2018 appropriation ) , $ 95.0 million in funding for usitc ( a 1.4 % increase ) , and a total of $ 68.0 million for ustr ( a 0.2 % decrease ) . the administration 's request on february 12 , 2018 , the trump administration submitted its fy2019 budget request to congress . the fy2019 proposal included a total of $ 590.8 million for the three cjs trade - related agencies , an 8.9 % decrease from fy2018 total appropriated amounts for these agencies . the administration requested reducing funding for all three trade - related agencies . for fy2019 , the request included $ 440.1 million in direct funding for ita ( an 8.7 % decrease from the fy2018 appropriation ) , $ 87.6 million for usitc ( a 6.5 % decrease ) , and $ 63.0 million for ustr ( a 13.2 % decrease ) . congressional actions in the spring of 2018 , the house and senate reported fy2019 cjs appropriations bills , which included proposed funding for ita , usitc , and ustr . the reported bills did not adopt many of the administration 's budget reductions , and instead proposed funding levels that were more similar to the fy2018-enacted amounts . the house committee on appropriations reported h.r . 5952 on may 17 , 2018. the house proposal recommended a total of $ 647.6 million for the three cjs trade - related agencies . this proposal was $ 56.8 million more ( 9.6 % ) than the administration 's request , and $ 0.7 million less ( - 0.1 % ) than the fy2018-enacted legislation . the house committee proposed $ 480.0 million in direct funding for ita , $ 95.0 million for ustic , and a total of $ 72.6 million for ustr , comprised of $ 57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $ 15.0 million from the trade enforcement trust fund for trade enforcement activities as authorized by the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act of 2015 ( p.l . 114-125 ) . the senate committee on appropriations reported s. 3072 on june 14 , 2018. the senate committee - reported proposal recommended a total of $ 655.6 million for the three cjs trade - related agencies . this is $ 64.8 million ( 11.0 % ) more than the administration 's request and $ 7.3 million ( 1.1 % ) more than the fy2018-enacted appropriations . the senate committee proposed $ 488.0 million in direct funding for ita , $ 95 million for usitc , and a total of $ 72.6 million for ustr , comprised of $ 57.6 million for salaries and expenses and an additional $ 15.0 million from the trade enforcement trust fund for trade enforcement activities . after three continuing resolutions and a three - week lapse in funding , congress passed the consolidated appropriations act . 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) , which was signed into law on february 15 , 2019. the act included a total of $ 647.0 million in funding for the three trade - related agencies , which represented a 0.2 % decrease from fy2018 funding levels .
india will soon be the world 's most populous country , home to about one of every six people . many factors combine to infuse india 's government and people with `` great power '' aspirations : the asian giant 's rich civilization and history , expanding strategic horizons , energetic global and international engagement , critical geography ( with more than 9,000 total miles of land borders , many of them disputed ) astride vital sea and energy lanes , major economy ( at times the world 's fastest growing ) with a rising middle class and an attendant boost in defense and power projection capabilities ( replete with a nuclear weapons arsenal and triad of delivery systems ) , and vigorous science and technology sectors , among others . in recognition of india 's increasingly central role and ability to influence world affairs — and with a widely - held assumption that a stronger and more prosperous democratic india is good for the united states in and of itself — the u.s. congress and two successive u.s. administrations have acted both to broaden and deepen america 's engagement with new delhi . such engagement is unprecedented after decades of cold war - era estrangement and today takes place `` across the spectrum of human endeavor for a better world , '' as described in a 2015 u.s. - india declaration of friendship . washington and new delhi launched a `` strategic partnership '' in 2005 , along with a framework for long - term defense cooperation that now includes large - scale joint military exercises and significant defense trade . bilateral trade and investment have increased while a relatively wealthy indian - american community is exercising newfound domestic political influence , and indian nationals account for a large proportion of foreign students on american college campuses and foreign workers in the information technology sector . yet more engagement has meant more areas of friction in the partnership , many of which attract congressional attention . india 's economy , while slowly reforming , continues to be a relatively closed one , with barriers to trade and investment deterring foreign business interests . differences over u.s. immigration law , especially in the area of nonimmigrant work visas , remain unresolved ; new delhi views these as trade disputes . india 's intellectual property protection regime comes under regular criticism from u.s. officials and firms . the june 2017 announcement of u.s. withdrawal from the paris agreement on climate change dismayed many in india and brought into question significant ongoing bilateral collaboration in the energy field . other stumbling blocks — on localization barriers and civil nuclear commerce , among others — add to sometimes argumentative associations . meanwhile , cooperation in the fields of defense trade , intelligence , and counterterrorism , although vastly superior to that of only a decade ago , runs up against the obstacles variously posed by india 's bureaucracy , limited governmental capacity , difficult procurement process , seemingly incompatible federal institutions , and a lingering shortage of trust , not least due to america 's ongoing security relationship with and aid to india 's key rival , pakistan . finally , members of congress take notice of human rights abuses in india , perhaps especially those related to religious freedom . despite these many areas of sometimes serious discord , the u.s. congress has remained broadly positive in its posture toward the u.s. - india strategic and commercial partnership . meanwhile , the trump administration has thus far issued amicable rhetoric overall ( with some lapses ) that suggests an intention to maintain the general outlines of recent u.s. - india ties . this report reviews the major facets of current u.s. - india relations , particularly in the context of congressional interest . it discusses areas in which perceived u.s. and indian national interests converge and areas in which they diverge ; other leading indian foreign relations that relate to u.s. interests ; the outlines of bilateral engagement in defense , trade , and investment relations , as well as important issues involving energy , climate change ; and human rights concerns . this report will be updated .
arbitration is a method of legal dispute resolution in which a neutral , private third party , rather than a judge or jury , renders a decision on a particular matter . under a growing number of consumer and employment agreements , companies have come to require arbitration to resolve disputes . while arbitration is often viewed as an expeditious and economical alternative to litigation , consumer advocates and others contend that mandatory arbitration agreements create one - sided arrangements that deny consumers and employees advantages afforded by a judicial proceeding . the federal arbitration act ( faa ) was enacted in 1925 to ensure the validity and enforcement of arbitration agreements in any `` maritime transaction or ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce [ . ] . the u.s. supreme court ( court ) has recognized the faa as evidencing `` a national policy favoring arbitration . . the application of the faa , however , particularly in light of various state law requirements and the use of different types of arbitration agreements , has raised numerous legal questions and been the subject of several cases before the court . the question of whether the faa preempts a state law or judicial rule is a subject of frequent litigation . in these cases , the court has routinely held that the faa supersedes state requirements that restrain the enforceability of mandatory arbitration agreements . this report examines the faa and reviews the court 's decisions involving the statute 's preemption of state law requirements . the report also explores the court 's decisions involving mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit a consumer or employee from maintaining a class or collective action . in its october 2017 term , the court will consider three consolidated cases that challenge such agreements on the grounds that they violate the right to engage in `` other concerted activities '' under the national labor relations act ( nlra ) . finally , concern over a perceived lack of `` meaningful choice '' to decide whether to submit a claim to arbitration has prompted regulatory activity , as well as legislation that would amend the faa to render certain types of pre - dispute arbitration agreements unenforceable . the report discusses some recent examples of federal regulatory action that aim to restrict the use of mandatory arbitration in the consumer arena , and reviews bills like the arbitration fairness act of 2017 ( h.r . 1374 / s . 537 ) , which would prohibit the enforcement of an arbitration agreement that requires arbitration for an employment , consumer , antitrust , or civil rights dispute if the agreement was executed prior to the dispute 's occurrence .
the term `` patentable subject matter '' refers to the requirement of section 101 of the patent act of 1952 that an invention must consist of a `` process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter '' in order to be patented . the leahy - smith america invents act ( aia ) of 2011 , p.l . 112-29 , additionally stipulated that `` no patent may issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism . . the aia also limited the availability of patents claiming tax avoidance strategies . the courts and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) have generally construed the language of section 101 broadly . as a result , inventions from many different fields of human endeavor may be patented , so long as other statutory requirements such as novelty and nonobviousness are met . however , the courts recognize several implicit exceptions to the four statutory categories of patentable subject matter . in particular , laws of nature , natural phenomena , and abstract ideas have been held to be unpatentable . for many years , section 101 was arguably used only infrequently to invalidate an issued patent or reject an application pending at the uspto . this situation changed over the past decade due in large part to four decisions issued by the supreme court of the united states since 2010 addressing patentable subject matter . in each instance the court concluded that the invention before it was unpatentable . the four cases were bilski v. kappos , pertaining to a business method ; mayo collaborative services v. prometheus laboratories , considering a method of medical diagnosis ; association for molecular pathology v. myriad genetics , addressing human genes ; and alice corp. v. cls bank , relating to computer software . these decisions collectively hold that an invention is unpatentable if ( 1 ) it consists of a law of nature , natural phenomenon , or abstract idea ; and ( 2 ) does not include additional , inventive elements that indicate the claim applies one of the three excluded subject matters , rather than being a fundamental concept per se . with regard to this second step , the court analyzes a patent claim to determine if it covers every practical application of a fundamental concept . claims with this preemptive scope can not be patented under section 101. in addition , the court does not consider a claim 's recitation of routine , nominal hardware — such as a general - purpose computer — to ameliorate concerns over section 101 eligibility . since the supreme court issued these decisions , section 101 has been more frequently invoked to invalidate issued patents in the courts and in certain administrative patent revocation proceedings , and also to reject pending patent applications at the uspto . further , numerous patents granted by the uspto under earlier standards would likely be held invalid if they were subject to scrutiny today . if the current situation is deemed acceptable , then no action need be taken . however , several stakeholder groups have recommended legislative reforms to section 101. in general , these proposals assert that an invention should be deemed patentable subject matter unless it exists in nature independently of human activity or it can be performed solely in the human mind . these proposals also state that whether an invention is implemented through conventional means is irrelevant to whether it is patentable subject matter or not . as of the date of publication of this report , legislation has yet to be introduced before congress addressing reform of the law of patentable subject matter .
the growth of the international insurance market and trade in insurance products and services has created opportunities and new policy issues for u.s. insurers , congress , and the u.s. financial system . insurance regulation is centered on the states , with the federal government having a limited role . while the risks of loss and the regulation may be local , the business of insurance , as with many financial services , has an increasingly substantial international component as companies and investors look to grow and diversify . the 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the 2010 dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank ; p.l . 111-203 ) enhanced the federal role in insurance markets through several provisions , including the financial stability oversight council 's ( fsoc 's ) ability to designate insurers as systemically important financial institutions ( sifis ) ; federal reserve oversight of sifis and insurers with depository affiliates ; and the creation of a federal insurance office ( fio ) inside the department of the treasury . alongside fio , dodd - frank defined a new class of international insurance agreements called covered agreements for recognition of prudential measures which the fio and the united states trade representative ( ustr ) may negotiate with foreign entities . although not a regulator , fio has the authority to monitor the insurance industry and limited power to preempt state laws in conjunction with covered agreements . dodd - frank requires congressional consultations and a 90-day layover period for covered agreements , but such agreements do not require congressional approval . international insurance stakeholders and concerns the international response to the financial crisis included the creation of a financial stability board ( fsb ) , largely made up of various countries ' financial regulators , and increasing the focus of the international association of insurance supervisors ( iais ) on creating regulatory standards , especially relating to insurer capital levels . the federal reserve and the fio have assumed roles in the iais , whereas previously the individual states and the u.s. national association of insurance commissioners ( naic ) had been the only u.s. members . any agreements reached under the fsb or iais would have no legal impact in the united states until adopted in regulation by federal or state regulators or enacted into federal or state statute . congress has little direct role in international regulatory cooperation agreements such as those reached at the fsb or iais . the federal involvement in insurance issues has created friction both among the federal entities and between the states and the federal entities , and it has been a subject of congressional hearings and legislation . the first covered agreement , between the united states and the european union ( eu ) , went into effect on september 22 , 2017. the agreement was largely rejected by the states and the naic , with the insurance industry split in its support , or lack thereof , for the agreement . treasury and ustr announced a second covered agreement , with the united kingdom ( uk ) , on december 11 , 2018 , which is currently in the layover period before congress . issues for congress the 115th congress enacted legislation addressing international insurance issues in p.l . 115-174 , with additional proposals included in h.r . 4573 , s. 488 , s. 1360 , h.r . 3861 , and h.r . 3762. congressional interest in international insurance issues focused on ( 1 ) the covered agreement addressing the eu and uk treatment of u.s. insurers and the u.s. state requirements for reinsurance collateral and ( 2 ) the potential impact of international organizations and standards on the united states .
the federal election commission ( fec ) is the nation 's civil campaign finance regulator . the agency ensures that campaign fundraising and spending is publicly reported ; that those regulated by the federal election campaign act ( feca ) and by commission regulations comply and have access to guidance ; and that publicly financed presidential campaigns receive funding . feca requires that at least four of six commissioners agree to undertake many of the agency 's key policymaking duties . as of this writing , the fec is operating with four commissioners instead of six . others reportedly are considering leaving the agency . one nomination to the fec has been resubmitted during the 115th congress ; no committee or floor action has been taken on it to date . it is entirely possible that the fec will retain at least four commissioners and that the agency will remain able to carry out all its duties . if , however , the fec loses its policymaking quorum — as happened for six months in 2008 — the agency would be unable to hold hearings , issue rules , and enforce campaign finance law and regulation . this crs report briefly explains the kinds of actions that feca would preclude if the commission lost its policymaking quorum . this report will be updated in the event of significant changes in the agency 's policymaking quorum or the status of agency nominations .
the constitution vests congress with the legislative power , which includes authority to establish federal agencies and conduct oversight of those entities . criminal investigations and prosecutions , however , are generally regarded as core executive functions assigned to the executive branch . because of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise when the executive branch investigates itself , there have often been calls for criminal investigations by prosecutors with independence from the executive branch . in response , congress and the u.s. department of justice ( doj ) have used both statutory and regulatory mechanisms to establish a process for such inquiries . these frameworks have aimed to balance the competing goals of independence and accountability with respect to inquiries of executive branch officials . under the ethics in government act of 1978 , for example , congress authorized the appointment of `` special prosecutors , '' who later were known as `` independent counsels . . under this statutory scheme , the attorney general could request that a specially appointed three - judge panel appoint an outside individual to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of criminal law . these individuals were vested with `` full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the department of justice '' with respect to matters within their jurisdiction . ultimately , debate over the scope , cost , and effect of the investigations ( perhaps most notably the iran - contra and the whitewater investigations ) resulted in the law 's expiration and nonrenewal in 1999. following the lapse of these statutory provisions , doj promulgated regulations authorizing the attorney general ( or , if the attorney general is recused from a matter , the acting attorney general ) to appoint a `` special counsel '' from outside the federal government to conduct specific investigations or prosecutions that may be deemed to present a conflict of interest if pursued under the normal procedures of the agency . special counsels are not subject to `` day - to - day supervision '' by any official and are vested `` within the scope of his or her jurisdiction , the full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any united states attorney . . the independent nature of these investigations has raised constitutional questions about the propriety of the appointment and removal mechanisms provided for the officials leading the inquiries . these concerns were addressed by the supreme court in the 1988 case of morrison v. olson , which upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel statute . the reasoning of that opinion has been challenged , however , and the court 's subsequent analysis of related issues in the 1997 case of edmond v. united states and the 2010 case free enterprise fund v. public accounting oversight board did not apply the standard enunciated in morrison . the constitutional status of a statutory framework similar to the independent counsel statute is thus subject to debate . several bills introduced in the 116th congress ( including s. 71 and h.r . 197 , which merge aspects of two preceding bills introduced in the 115th congress , s. 1735 and s. 1741 ) would statutorily insulate a special counsel from removal , echoing aspects of the independent counsel statute 's provisions . whether such proposals would withstand constitutional challenge today might ultimately turn on the continued vitality of the analysis applied in morrison .
the length of time a congressional staff member spends employed in a particular position in congress — or congressional staff tenure — is a source of recurring interest to members , staff , and the public . a congressional office , for example , may seek this information to assess its human resources capabilities , or for guidance in how frequently staffing changes might be expected for various positions . congressional staff may seek this type of information to evaluate and approach their own individual career trajectories . this report presents a number of statistical measures regarding the length of time senate office staff stay in particular job positions . it is designed to facilitate the consideration of tenure from a number of perspectives . this report provides tenure data for a selection of 18 staff position titles that are typically used in senators ' offices , and information on how to use those data for different purposes . the positions include administrative director , casework supervisor , caseworker , chief counsel , chief of staff , communications director , counsel , executive assistant , field representative , legislative assistant , legislative correspondent , legislative director , office manager , press secretary , regional representative , scheduler , staff assistant , and state director . senators ' staff tenure data were calculated as of march 31 , for each year between 2006 and 2016 , for all staff in each position . an overview table provides staff tenure for selected positions for 2016 , including summary statistics and information on whether the time staff stayed in a position increased , was unchanged , or decreased between 2006 and 2016. other tables provide detailed tenure data and visualizations for each position title . between 2006 and 2016 , staff tenure appears to have increased by six months or more for staff in 10 position titles in senators ' offices , based on the trend of the median number of years in the position . for eight positions , the median tenure trend was unchanged . these findings may be consistent with overall workforce trends in the united states . pay may be one of many factors that affect an individual 's decision to remain in or leave a particular job . senate office staff holding positions that are generally lower - paid typically remained in those roles for shorter periods of time than those in generally higher - paying positions . lower - paying positions may also be considered entry - level roles ; if so , tenure for senators ' office employees in these roles appears to follow national trends for other entry - level jobs , which individuals hold for a relatively short period of time . those in more senior positions , where a particular level of congressional or other professional experience is often required , typically remained in those roles comparatively longer , similar to those in more senior positions in the general workforce . generalizations about staff tenure are limited in some ways , because each senator 's office serves as its own hiring authority . variations from office to office , which might include differences in job duties , work schedules , office emphases , and other factors , may limit the extent to which data provided here might match tenure in another office . direct comparisons of congressional employment to the general labor market may have similar limitations . an employing senator 's retirement or electoral loss , for example , may cause staff tenure periods to end abruptly and unexpectedly . this report is one of a number of crs products on congressional staff . others include crs report r43946 , senate staff levels in member , committee , leadership , and other offices , 1977-2016 , and crs report r44324 , staff pay levels for selected positions in senators ' offices , fy2001-fy2014 .
according to the centers for disease control and prevention , the annual number of drug overdose deaths involving prescription opioids ( such as hydrocodone , oxycodone , and methadone ) and illicit opioids ( such as heroin and nonpharmaceutical fentanyl ) has more than quadrupled since 1999. a november 2017 report issued by the president 's commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis also observed that `` [ t ] he crisis in opioid overdose deaths has reached epidemic proportions in the united states ... and currently exceeds all other drug - related deaths or traffic fatalities . . how the current opioid epidemic happened , and who may be responsible for fueling it , are complicated questions , though reports suggest that several parties likely played contributing roles , including pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors , doctors , health insurance companies , rogue pharmacies , and drug dealers and addicts . many federal departments and agencies are involved in efforts to combat opioid abuse and addiction , including a law enforcement agency within the u.s. department of justice , the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) , which is the focus of this report . the primary federal law governing the manufacture , distribution , and use of prescription and illicit opioids is the controlled substances act ( csa ) , a statute that the dea is principally responsible for administering and enforcing . the csa and dea regulations promulgated thereunder establish a framework through which the federal government regulates the manufacture , distribution , importation , exportation , and use of certain substances which have the potential for abuse or psychological or physical dependence , including opioids . congress enacted the csa in 1970 to facilitate the availability of controlled substances for authorized medical , scientific , research , and industrial purposes , while also preventing these substances from being diverted out of legitimate channels for illegal purposes such as drug abuse and drug trafficking activities . the csa aims to protect the public 's health and safety from dangers posed by highly addictive or dangerous controlled substances that are diverted into the illicit market , while also ensuring that patients have access to pharmaceutical controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes such as the treatment of pain . this report describes the current federal legal regime governing opioids and other controlled substances under the csa and its implementing regulations , including ( 1 ) the classification of various plants , drugs , and chemicals into one of five schedules based on the substance 's medical use , potential for abuse , and safety or dependence liability ; ( 2 ) who must register with the dea in order to receive authorization to handle the substances ( such as drug manufacturers , wholesale distributors , doctors , hospitals , pharmacies , and scientific researchers ) ; ( 3 ) what obligations registrants must satisfy in order to maintain a valid registration ( such as keeping records of drug inventories and transactions , submitting reports to the dea , and providing security measures to safeguard controlled substances ) ; and ( 4 ) the dea 's administrative , civil , and criminal authorities for enforcing regulatory compliance with the csa ( such as suspending or revoking a registrant 's legal authority to handle controlled substances if the dea administrator finds that the registrant has `` committed such acts as would render his registration ... inconsistent with the public interest . '' ) . the report then examines dea initiatives and actions taken , pursuant to its legal authorities under the csa , which specifically target the abuse of opioids . the report concludes by describing the legislative response to the opioid epidemic , including a summary of the amendments to the csa made by legislation enacted by the 115th congress , the substance use - disorder prevention that promotes opioid recovery and treatment for patients and communities act ( p.l . 115-271 ) .

the agriculture appropriations bill funds the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) except for the forest service . the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 115-141 , division a ) , and the fy2019 consolidated appropriations act ( p.l . 116-6 , division b ) include funding for conservation programs and activities at usda . congress passed the fy2018 consolidated appropriations act on march 23 , 2018. fy2019 began with seven appropriations bills , including usda , unfinished . the house and senate appropriations committees reported agriculture appropriations bills for fy2019 ( h.r . 5961 , s. 2976 ) , with the senate having amended and passed its version as division c of a four - bill minibus ( h.r . 6147 ) . congress and the president approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through december 21 , 2018 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . 115-245 ) . after december 21 , 2018 , a partial shutdown of the government , including many agencies within usda , occurred . one of the few exceptions was the natural resources conservation service ( nrcs ) , which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown . on january 25 , 2019 , an agreement was reached to continue funding for usda and other appropriations that had lapsed through february 15 , at the fy2018 level ( p.l . 116-5 ) . the fy2019 consolidated appropriations act was signed into law on february 15 , 2019 , funding usda through the end of the fiscal year ( division b , p.l . 116-6 ) . agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending . most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills . other conservation programs — mostly technical assistance — are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations . the largest discretionary program is the conservation operations ( co ) account , which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country . the enacted fy2018 appropriation provided $ 874 million for co , an increase from the fy2017 enacted amount ( $ 864 million ) . the enacted fy2019 appropriation decreases funding for co below fy2018 levels to $ 819 million and redirects funding to the new farm production and conservation business center . other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs . the largest — watershed and flood prevention operations ( wfpo ) — was funded at $ 150 million annually in fy2018 and fy2019 . most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation . however , congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending ( chimps ) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since fy2003 . the enacted fy2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since fy2002 that did not include chimps to mandatory conservation programs . the enacted fy2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs , as most programs ' authorizations expired on september 30 , 2018 , making these programs ineligible for reduction . the 2018 farm bill ( agricultural improvement act of 2018 , p.l . 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs . while this is infrequent , the agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs . the fy2018 agriculture appropriations act included two such amendments — one to wfpo and one to farm bill conservation program reporting requirements . the wfpo amendment increased the size threshold required for congressional approval . under the amended language , the senate and house agriculture committees must approve wfpo projects that include an estimated federal contribution of more than $ 25 million for construction , an increase from the previous $ 5 million threshold . additionally , the fy2018 appropriations act exempted farm bill conservation programs from select federal reporting requirements , including obtaining a data universal numbering system ( duns ) number and system for award management ( sam ) registration . agriculture appropriations bills may also include policy - related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriation . the fy2018 and fy2019 appropriations acts both include policy provisions for conservation programs that range from reports to congress to suggested natural resource priorities .
on january 25 , 2017 , president donald j. trump issued executive order ( eo ) 13768 , `` enhancing public safety in the interior of the united states . . among other things , the eo raises questions regarding whether , and to what extent , federal agencies will withhold federal grant funds that would have otherwise been awarded to a designated `` sanctuary jurisdiction . . under the eo , the secretary of homeland security ( secretary ) is directed to designate a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction at his discretion , and to the extent consistent with law , for those jurisdictions found to have willfully refused to comply with 8 u.s.c . 1373 , `` communication between government agencies and the immigration and naturalization service . . among other things , the eo raises questions regarding potential restrictions of federal grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions . this report discusses several questions that might be raised regarding the implementation of the executive order by federal grant - making agencies ( also known as `` federal awarding agencies '' ) and the impact on federal grant funding for designated sanctuary jurisdictions . because of the complexity of implementing a centralized policy such as the eo through the decentralized structure of federal grants administration practices , there is uncertainty in determining the impact of the eo on federal grant funding for sanctuary jurisdictions . this could be affected by the discretion exercised by the attorney general and the secretary in defining a `` federal grant , '' determining which programs are exempted because of providing necessary funding for law enforcement purposes , and determining what constitutes a `` sanctuary jurisdiction . . the impact of the eo on federal grant funding could also be affected by how federal grant awarding agencies utilize discretion in administering the grant programs , including review of eligibility and conditioning federal grant awards .
the electrical grid in the united states comprises all of the power plants generating electricity , together with the transmission and distribution lines and systems that bring power to end - use customers . the `` grid '' also connects the many publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies in different states and regions of the united states . however , with changes in federal law , regulatory changes , and the aging of the electric power infrastructure as drivers , the grid is changing from a largely patchwork system built to serve the needs of individual electric utility companies to essentially a national interconnected system , accommodating massive transfers of electrical energy among regions of the united states . the modernization of the grid to accommodate today 's more complex power flows , serve reliability needs , and meet future projected uses is leading to the incorporation of electronic intelligence capabilities for power control purposes and operations monitoring . the `` smart grid '' is the name given to this evolving intelligent electric power network . the u.s. department of energy ( doe ) describes the smart grid as `` an intelligent electricity grid — one that uses digital communications technology , information systems , and automation to detect and react to local changes in usage , improve system operating efficiency , and , in turn , reduce operating costs while maintaining high system reliability . . in 2007 , congress passed the energy independence and security act ( p.l . 110-140 ) . title xiii of the act described characteristics of the smart grid and directed doe to establish a smart grid investment matching grant ( sgig ) program to help support the modernization of the nation 's electricity system . in 2014 , doe concluded that the adoption of smart grid technologies was accelerating but at varying rates `` depending largely on decision - making at utility , state , and local levels . . doe noted that the nation 's electricity system is in the midst of `` potentially transformative change , '' with challenges for smart grid deployment remaining with respect to grid - connected renewable and distributed energy sources and adaptability to current and future consumer - oriented applications . costs of deploying the smart grid remains an issue , and study estimates vary . while some doe programs have supported grid modernization , congress has not explicitly appropriated funding for deployment of the smart grid since the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( p.l . 111-5 ) . in its 2014 study , doe estimated historical and forecast investment in the smart grid as approximately $ 32.5 billion between 2008 and 2017 , averaging $ 3.61 billion annually in the period . if this level of investment remains constant , it would put spending well below levels the electric power research institute ( in 2011 ) and the brattle group ( in 2008 ) estimated were needed to fully build the smart grid by approximately 2030. from 2010 to 2015 , $ 3.4 billion in sgig grants supported 99 projects resulting in $ 8 billion in grid modernization . congress could provide funding to help bridge the funding gap if it chooses to accelerate adoption of the smart grid . a number of near - term trends — including electric vehicles , environmental concerns , and the ability of customers to take advantage of real - time pricing programs to reduce consumer cost and energy demand — would benefit from investments in smart grid enabled technologies . while concerns such as cybersecurity and privacy exist , most electric utilities appear to view smart grid systems positively . costs could be reduced and system resiliency improved by further integration of automated switches and sensors , even considering the cost of a more cybersecure environment . but with the potentially high costs of a formal transition , some see the deployment of the smart grid continuing much the same as it has , with a gradual modernization of the system as older components are replaced .
on january 5 , 2011 , the house of representatives adopted an amendment to house rule xii to require that members state the constitutional basis for congress 's power to enact the proposed legislation when introducing a bill or joint resolution . ( the amendment does not pertain to concurrent or simple resolutions ) . this constitutional authority statement ( cas ) rule , found at house rule xii , clause 7 ( c ) , was subsequently adopted by every subsequent congress . understanding the cas rule first requires an understanding of both the powers provided to the congress under the constitution and congress 's role in interpreting the founding document . article i 's vesting clause creates a congress of specified or `` enumerated '' powers , and every law congress enacts must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the constitution . the constitution creates two central types of limitations on congress 's powers : ( 1 ) internal limits and ( 2 ) external limits . internal limits are the restrictions inherent in the constitutional grants of power themselves , such as the limits on the scope of congress 's powers under the commerce clause . external limits , on the other hand , are the constraints contained in affirmative prohibitions found elsewhere in the text or structure of the document , such as the first amendment 's prohibition on congress abridging the freedom of speech . while the court 's 1803 decision in marbury v. madison firmly cemented the judicial branch 's role in interpreting the constitution by recognizing the power of the court to strike down legislation as unconstitutional , the early history of the nation is replete with examples of all three government branches playing a substantial role in constitutional interpretation . by the mid - 20th century , however , the supreme court began articulating a theory of judicial supremacy that became widely accepted , wherein the federal judiciary is the final and exclusive arbiter of the constitution 's meaning . nonetheless , in recent decades , a number of legal scholars and government officials have criticized this theory , instead promoting the view that the political branches of government possess the independent and coordinate authority to interpret the constitution . in support of this view , some point to ( 1 ) the constitution itself requiring all members of congress to be bound by an oath to support the constitution ; ( 2 ) the presumption of constitutionality that courts afford legislation enacted by congress ; and ( 3 ) the wide range of questions the constitution requires congress to resolve . a cas is fundamentally a congressional interpretation of the constitution , in that house rule xii requires each member introducing a piece of legislation to attach a statement that cites the power ( s ) that allows congress to enact the legislation . the submitted cas appears in the congressional record and is published on congress.gov . the house rules committee has indicated that members have significant discretion in determining whether particular cass comply with the rule . the cas rule is enforced only insofar as `` the house clerk ... acts to verify that each bill has a justification '' and `` not [ in judging ] the adequacy of the justification itself . . the most common means of complying with the rule is to cite to a specific clause in article i , section 8 , such as the taxing and spending clause . the cas rule has itself been subject to much debate , with proponents arguing that the rule promotes constitutional dialogue in the house , while critics contend that the rule provides minimal benefits and is administratively costly .
the impact aid program , administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) and authorized by title vii of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , was originally established in 1950 by p.l . 81-815 and p.l . 81-874 , 15 years prior to the enactment of the esea . impact aid compensates local educational agencies ( leas ) for a `` substantial and continuing financial burden '' resulting from federal activities . these activities include federal ownership of certain lands , as well as the enrollments in leas of children whose parents work or live on federal property and children living on indian lands . the federal government provides compensation because leas are unable to collect property or other taxes from these individuals ( e.g . , members of the uniformed services living on military bases ) or their employers , even though the leas are obligated to provide free public education to their children . thus , impact aid is intended to compensate leas , in part , for the resulting loss of tax revenue . the impact aid program authorizes several types of payments , as detailed in the table below . overall , the impact aid program received about $ 1.4 billion in fy2019 . the largest impact aid payment is basic support payments ( bsps ) for federally connected children ( section 7003 ( b ) ) , accounting for nearly 90 % of the total appropriation . federally connected children are those who reside with a parent who is a member of the uniformed services living on or off federal property , with a parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on or off federal property , on indian lands , in low - rent public housing , or with a parent who is a civilian working or living on federal property . bsps are allocated directly to leas based on a formula that uses weights assigned to different categories of federally connected children , cost factors to determine maximum payment amounts , and provisions to determine payment amounts when appropriations are insufficient to provide maximum payments . in addition to the impact aid programs administered by ed , a smaller set of programs administered by the department of defense ( dod ) are often referred to as the `` dod impact aid '' programs . these two programs include one that provides supplemental aid to leas serving military children , and one that provides assistance to leas serving military children with severe disabilities . for fy2018 , total appropriations for these programs were $ 35 million ( $ 30 million for the first program and $ 5 million for the second ) .
the 115th congress and the trump administration are reviewing existing u.s. policies and programs in sub - saharan africa ( henceforth , `` africa '' ) as they establish their budgetary and policy priorities toward the region while also responding to emerging crises . africa - specific policy questions did not feature prominently in the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign , and the views of the trump administration on many u.s. - africa policy issues remain unspecified . the obama administration 's strategy toward sub - saharan africa identified its policy priorities as strengthening democratic institutions ; spurring economic growth , trade , and investment ; advancing peace and security ; and promoting opportunity and development . analysts continue to debate whether that strategy reflected an appropriate mix and ranking of priorities , as well as the degree to which the obama administration 's actions reflected its stated goals . congressional action on trade and electrification projects in africa in the 114th congress suggested some shared priorities with the obama administration . the obama administration 's efforts to promote greater private sector engagement and youth leadership in africa won praise from various quarters . at the same time , analysts have probed whether the obama administration 's emphasis on building democratic institutions in africa was matched with appropriate resource allocations , and whether president obama 's stated support for democratic accountability was undermined by close u.s. partnerships with authoritarian - leaning states in east africa and by a growing emphasis on security relationships . africa is a top destination of u.s. foreign aid . following significant increases during the george w. bush administration in the 2000s , civilian - administered aid levels allocated for african countries remained largely flat during the obama administration , reflecting overarching budgetary constraints among other considerations . the areas of emphasis nonetheless shifted in some ways , with new presidential development initiatives focusing on electrification , trade , agricultural development , and health system strengthening . u.s. military cooperation and defense department - administered security assistance spending in africa also increased substantially , in line with new congressionally enacted authorities for defense spending as well as administration - led peacekeeping and counterterrorism initiatives . the united states has long been a top bilateral donor of emergency humanitarian and disaster assistance in africa , as well as the top financial contributor to u.n. peacekeeping operations , the majority of which are in africa . the 114th congress enacted several pieces of legislation that shaped u.s. - africa policy and programs . these included the reauthorization of the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa , p.l . 114-27 ) , the electrify africa act ( p.l . 114-121 ) , the global food security act ( p.l . 114-195 ) , the eliminate , neutralize , and disrupt wildlife trafficking act ( p.l . 114-231 ) , annual national defense authorization acts ( most recently , p.l . 114-328 ) , and foreign aid and defense appropriations measures . congress has also influenced u.s. - africa policy through its oversight activities , and through member statements and communications with the executive branch and african leaders . to inform further congressional consideration of u.s. - africa policy issues and challenges , this report provides background on the following : sub - saharan africa 's development and economic challenges ; u.s. - africa trade , investment , and economic cooperation ; governance , democracy , and human rights issues ; peace and security issues ; and u.s. aid to africa and other selected u.s. responses to policy challenges .
the federal communications commission ( fcc ) aims , with its broadcast media ownership rules , to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a geographic market and , in the case of broadcast television stations , nationwide . in addition , the fcc seeks to encourage diversity , including ( 1 ) the diversity of viewpoints , as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives ; ( 2 ) diversity of programming , as indicated by a variety of formats and content ; ( 3 ) outlet diversity , to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market ; and ( 4 ) minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets . two fcc media ownership rules have proven particularly controversial . its national media ownership rule prohibits any entity from owning commercial television stations that reach more than 39 % of u.s. households nationwide . its `` uhf discount '' rule discounts by half the reach of a station broadcasting in the ultra - high frequency ( uhf ) band for the purpose of applying the national media ownership rule . in december 2017 , the commission opened a rulemaking proceeding , seeking comments about whether it should modify or repeal the two rules . if the fcc retains the uhf discount , even if it maintains the 39 % cap , a single entity could potentially reach 78 % of u.s. households through its ownership of broadcast television stations . an important issue with respect to the national ownership cap , which the fcc has not addressed in a rulemaking , is how the agency treats a situation in which a broadcaster manages , operates , or sells advertising for a television station owned by another . in some cases , the fcc has articulated its policy on an ad hoc basis in the context of merger reviews , while in other instances it has effectively consented to such arrangements through its silence . thus , a single entity could comply with the national ownership cap while still influencing broadcast television stations it does not own , reaching more viewers than permitted under the cap . for example , in reviewing the now - cancelled proposed merger between sinclair broadcast group and tribune media company in 2018 , fcc commissioners raised concerns that sinclair 's proposed sale of tribune 's chicago station wgn - tv in order to comply with the national ownership cap could effectively be a `` sham '' transaction due to sinclair 's relationships with the proposed buyer . nevertheless , neither sinclair 's application nor the fcc 's order for a designated hearing addressed whether sinclair 's intention to operate four television stations owned by others within the wilkes - barre - scranton - hazleton , pa , television market might cause it to breach the national ownership cap . in november 2017 , acting in response to petitions from broadcast station licensees , the fcc repealed or relaxed several local media ownership rules . the repealed rules limited common ownership of broadcast television and radio stations within the same market , and of television stations and newspapers within the same market . the fcc also relaxed rules limiting common ownership of two top - four television stations ( generally , abc , cbs , fox , and nbc stations ) within the same market . in august 2018 , the fcc issued rules governing a new `` incubator '' program designed to enhance ownership diversity . parties , including the prometheus radio project , have appealed these orders . the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the legal challenges to all of the fcc 's recent broadcast media ownership rule changes . the fcc plans to launch its next quadrennial media ownership review later this year . these regulatory changes are occurring against the background of significant changes in media consumption patterns . based on surveys conducted by pew research center , the percentage of adults citing local broadcast television as a news source declined from 65 % in 1996 to 37 % in 2016. as broadcast stations face competition for viewers ' attention from other media outlets , and thereby financial pressures , some station owners have sought to strengthen their positions by consolidating . the extent to which such media consolidation can occur is directly related to the fcc media ownership and attribution rules in place at the time .
the bipartisan budget act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-123 ) , signed into law on february 9 , 2018 , created a joint select committee of the house and senate . the joint select committee on budget and appropriations process reform was to be made up of 16 members from the house and senate — 4 chosen by each of the chambers ' party leaders . the act charged the joint select committee with formulating recommendations and legislative language to `` significantly reform the budget and appropriations process . . the law directed the committee to make a report no later than november 30 , 2018 , to be submitted , along with legislative language , to the president , the speaker of the house , and the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate . the act included procedures intended to allow the senate to reach a timely vote on the question of whether or not to consider any legislation embodying the recommendations of the joint select committee . under the terms of the act , the senate would be able to vote on a motion to proceed to consider any reported joint committee bill before the conclusion of the 115th congress ( 2017-2018 ) . consideration of the motion to proceed ( and all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith ) was to be limited to 10 hours , equally divided and controlled by the majority and minority leaders ( or their designees ) with support of at least three - fifths of the senate ( 60 votes if there is no more than one vacancy ) necessary to approve the motion . the act did not specify any procedures governing consideration of the bill once the senate had agreed to take it up . there were also no provisions in the act concerning the consideration of the recommendations of the joint select committee in the house nor any provisions concerning resolving any differences between the house and senate . such actions would have occurred under the regular procedures of each chamber . during its lifespan , the joint select committee held five days of hearings , taking testimony from 12 outside witnesses and 27 members , including then - speaker of the house paul ryan and then - house minority leader nancy pelosi . formal and informal discussions among committee members resulted in draft legislation to be considered in a markup that concluded on november 29 , 2018. the chief recommendation in the draft provided for the budget resolution to be adopted for a two - year cycle rather than the current annual cycle . by unanimous consent , the committee members applied a voting rule for the adoption of amendments consistent with the rule required by the act for final adoption of any recommendations requiring separate majorities of the appointees from each party . the final vote on reporting the bill as amended was not agreed to by a roll - call vote of one aye and seven noes of the members appointed by the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader and seven ayes and zero noes of the members appointed by the house minority leader and the senate minority leader .
uruguay is a small nation of 3.4 million people located on the atlantic coast of south america between brazil and argentina . the country stands out in latin america for its strong democratic institutions ; high per capita income ; and low levels of corruption , poverty , and inequality . as a result of its domestic success and commitment to international engagement , uruguay plays a more influential role in regional and international affairs than its size might suggest . uruguay has drawn increased congressional attention in recent years as a result of several high - profile and controversial decisions . some members of congress are tracking the implementation of uruguay 's cannabis - legalization measure as they consider the implications of marijuana - legalization initiatives in a growing number of u.s. states . uruguay 's decision to grant refugee status to six individuals who had been detained at the u.s. naval station at guantanamo bay , cuba , in 2014 also has drawn congressional scrutiny . some members contend that the obama administration failed to ensure that the uruguayan government would take steps to `` substantially mitigate the risk '' of the transferred individuals engaging in activities that threaten the united states as required by the national defense authorization act for fy2014 ( p.l . 113-66 ) . the administration disputes that assertion . domestic situation the center - left broad front ( frente amplio ) coalition has governed uruguay since 2005 , having won the presidency and legislative majorities in three consecutive elections . since taking office , the coalition has pursued a social democratic policy mix that has combined market - oriented economic policies with progressive taxation , an expansion of the social welfare system , and union - empowering labor reforms . the broad front also has enacted several far - reaching social policy changes , legalizing abortion ; expanding rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) individuals ; and legalizing and regulating uruguay 's marijuana market . president tabaré vázquez , who began his second nonconsecutive five - year term in march 2015 , has spent much of his time in office dealing with uruguay 's deteriorating economic situation . after nearly a decade of strong growth , the uruguayan economy has slowed dramatically as a result of softening global commodity prices and economic turbulence in argentina and brazil — uruguay 's main trading partners and fellow members of the mercosur customs union . this economic weakness has depressed tax collection and contributed to growing fiscal deficits but has not brought down uruguay 's persistently high inflation . vázquez has sought to address these economic challenges by reducing expenditures , increasing taxes , holding down wage increases , and investing in infrastructure through public - private partnerships . as economic growth has continued to slow in 2016 to an estimated 0.1 % , the vázquez administration 's approval rating has fallen to 33 % and its disapproval rating has risen to 45 % . u.s. - uruguayan relations u.s. - uruguayan relations have strengthened over the past decade despite initial expectations by some analysts that ties would deteriorate following the broad front 's assumption of power . the united states and uruguay signed a bilateral investment treaty in 2005 and a trade and investment framework agreement in 2007. in 2015 , the stock of u.s. foreign direct investment in uruguay reached $ 1.6 billion and bilateral merchandise trade amounted to $ 1.9 billion . the united states and uruguay also collaborate on efforts to address international security concerns . uruguay is serving alongside the united states on the u.n. security council for the 2016-2017 term and is one of the largest per capita contributors globally to u.n. peacekeeping missions . the united states has provided more than $ 14.6 million in assistance to uruguay over the past four years to bolster the country 's peacekeeping capabilities .
the u.s. constitution grants authority to congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations . congress exercises this authority in numerous ways , including through oversight of trade policy and consideration of legislation to implement trade agreements and authorize trade programs . policy issues cover areas such as u.s. trade negotiations , u.s. trade and economic relations with specific regions and countries , international institutions focused on trade , tariff and nontariff barriers , worker dislocation due to trade liberalization , enforcement of trade laws and trade agreement commitments , import and export policies , international investment , economic sanctions , and other trade - related functions of the federal government . congress also has authority over u.s. financial commitments to international financial institutions and oversight responsibilities for trade - and finance - related agencies of the u.s. government . issues in the 115th congress during the 2016 presidential campaign , u.s. trade policy and trade agreements received significant attention , particularly regarding the impact of trade agreements on the u.s. economy and workers . among the more potentially prominent international trade and finance issues the 115th congress is considering , or may consider , are : the status of trade promotion authority ( tpa ) , which is authorized through 2021 , provided the president requests an extension and congress does not enact an extension disapproval resolution before july 2018 ; the administration 's renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) and efforts to modify the u.s. - south korea ( korus ) free trade agreement ( fta ) ; u.s. - china trade relations , including investment issues , intellectual property rights ( ipr ) protection , forced technology transfer , currency issues , and market access liberalization ; proposals to launch new bilateral ftas , such as with the united kingdom , japan , or possibly with countries in africa ; the future of u.s. - asia trade and economic relations , given president trump 's withdrawal of the united states from the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) and china 's expanding belt and road initiative ; the future status of trade negotiations launched under the obama administration , including for the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( t - tip ) fta with the european union ( eu ) and the trade in services agreement ( tisa ) ; oversight of world trade organization ( wto ) agreements and negotiations , including the completed trade facilitation agreement ( tfa ) and expansion of the information technology agreement ( ita ) , as well as potential agreements on environmental goods and the wto 's future overall direction ; the administration 's enforcement of u.s. trade laws ; the effects of trade on the u.s. economy , jobs , and manufacturing , as well as policies that support u.s. workers and industries adversely affected by trade agreements ; international finance and investment issues , including u.s. funding for and oversight of international financial institutions ( ifis ) , the creation of development and infrastructure banks by emerging economies , and u.s. negotiations on new bilateral investment treaties ( bits ) , notably with china and india ; and oversight of international trade and finance policies to support development and / or foreign policy goals , including trade preferences for sub - sahara africa and sanctions on iran , north korea , russia , and other countries .
the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) provides that individual aliens outside the united states are `` inadmissible '' — or barred from admission to the country — on health , criminal , security , and other grounds set forth in the ina . however , the ina also grants the executive several broader authorities that could be used to exclude certain individual aliens or classes of aliens for reasons that are not specifically prescribed in the ina . section 212 ( f ) of the ina is arguably the broadest and best known of these authorities . it provides , in relevant part , that whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states , he may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate . over the years , presidents have relied upon section 212 ( f ) to suspend or otherwise restrict the entry of individual aliens and classes of aliens , often ( although not always ) in conjunction with the imposition of financial sanctions upon these aliens . among those so excluded have been aliens whose actions `` threaten the peace , security , or stability of libya '' ; officials of the north korean government ; and aliens responsible for `` serious human rights violations . . neither the text of section 212 ( f ) nor the case law to date suggests any firm legal limits upon the president 's exercise of his authority to exclude aliens under this provision . the central statutory constraint imposed on section 212 ( f ) 's exclusionary power is that the president must have found that the entry of any alien or class of aliens would be `` detrimental to the interests of the united states . . the statute does not address ( 1 ) what factors should be considered in determining whether aliens ' entry is `` detrimental '' to u.s. interests ; ( 2 ) when and how proclamations suspending or restricting entry should be issued ; ( 3 ) what factors are to be considered in determining whether particular restrictions are `` appropriate '' ; or ( 4 ) how long any restrictions should last . the limited case law addressing exercises of presidential authority under section 212 ( f ) also supports the view that this provision confers broad authority to bar or impose conditions upon the entry of aliens . key among these cases is the supreme court 's 1993 decision in sale v. haitian centers council , inc. , which held that the u.s. practice of interdicting persons fleeing haiti outside u.s. territorial waters and returning them to their home country without allowing them to raise claims for asylum or withholding of removal did not violate the ina or the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees . the u.s. practice had been established by executive order 12807 , which was issued , in part , under the authority of section 212 ( f ) and `` suspend [ ed ] the entry of aliens coming by sea to the united states without necessary documentation . . however , depending on their scope , future executive actions under section 212 ( f ) could potentially be seen to raise legal issues that have not been prompted by the executive 's prior exercises of this authority . beyond section 212 ( f ) , other provisions of the ina can also be seen to authorize the executive to restrict aliens ' entry to the united states . most notably , section 214 ( a ) ( 1 ) prescribes that the `` admission of any alien to the united states as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as [ the executive ] may by regulations prescribe . . section 215 ( a ) ( 1 ) similarly provides that `` it shall be unlawful for any alien '' to enter or depart the united states `` except under such reasonable rules , regulations , and orders , and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the president may prescribe . . for example , president carter cited section 215 ( a ) — rather than section 212 ( f ) — when authorizing the revocation of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas issued to iranian citizens during the iran hostage crisis .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the formula for distributing federal highway funds , focusing on the : relevancy of the data used for the formula ; major funding objectives implicit in the formula ; and implications of alternative formula factors for achieving these objectives . gao found that : the federal highway funding formula is complex and cumbersome ; the underlying data and factors used in the formula are to a large extent irrelevant , since funding outcomes are essentially predetermined ; annual combined funding for the four largest highway programs is fixed throughout the 6-year life of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( istea ) ; some of the factors used in formula calculations are based on outdated information , are unresponsive to changing conditions , and often do not reflect the highway system 's utilization ; equity adjustments increase many states ' final funding levels ; funding for demonstration projects is not determined by formula ; istea objectives include maintaining and improving the highway infrastructure , returning highway trust funds to the states where the revenue was generated , advancing selected goals , and safeguarding the states ' historical funding shares ; and a combination of objectives based on states ' needs and resources could form the basis for a new formula , but any new formula is likely to change the states ' highway funding levels .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao reviewed the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program , focusing on : whether the quality of research proposals has kept pace with the program 's expansion ; the implementation of a provision for technical assistance to agencies ; and the duplicate funding of similar research projects . gao found that : the quality of research proposals has kept pace with the program 's expansion ; it is too early to make a conclusive judgment about the long - term quality of research proposals because major increases in program funding have not yet occurred ; none of the five major agencies taking part in the sbir program have implemented the discretionary provision for technical assistance to agencies and future implementation remains uncertain ; these agencies have taken steps to provide assistance with the commercialization of research results ; duplicate funding of similar research projects has become a problem due to the increasing numbers of research proposals submitted to the sbir program ; a few companies received funding for the same proposals on more than one occasion before the agencies became aware of the duplication ; and duplicate funding occurs due to the evasion of certification procedures , lack of consensus on what constitutes a duplicate proposal , and the general lack of current information on recent sbir awards .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao examined the deregulation of the airline industry , focusing on : airfares and the quantity , quality , and safety of air service since deregulation . gao noted that : the average fare per passenger mile is 9 percent lower at small - community airports , 11 percent lower at medium - sized airports , and 8 percent lower at large - community airports ; the largest increase in fares occurred in the southeast and appalachian regions , and the largest decrease occurred in the west and southwestern regions ; this geographic disparity exists because of the intense competition between low - cost , new carriers in the west and dominant , high - maintenance carriers in the southeast ; the overall quantity of air service at airports has increased , but large communities have experienced the largest increase ; air service quality is difficult to measure and depends on the number of destinations served by nonstop flights and one - stop connections , and the type of aircraft used ; air service quality since deregulation has been mixed largely due to the airlines hub networks and greater use of turboprop aircraft ; and the overall accident rate since deregulation has dropped , but there are no statistically significant differences in air safety trends for any of the airport groups .
in 1994 , congress passed and president clinton signed the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 ( p.l . 103-322 ) , which , among other things , made prisoners ineligible for pell grants . however , concerns about the financial and social costs of the growing prison population combined with concerns about the recidivism rate of released prisoners have led some policymakers to reconsider whether prisoners should be allowed to use pell grants to help cover the cost of postsecondary coursework . pell grants are intended to assist in making the benefits of postsecondary education available to eligible students who demonstrate financial need . under department of education ( ed ) regulations , any student who is `` serving a criminal sentence in a federal or state penitentiary , prison , jail , reformatory , work farm , or other similar correctional institution '' is not eligible to receive a pell grant . however , in 2015 ed used its authority under the higher education act ( hea ) to create the second chance pell experiment to determine if access to pell grants would increase the enrollment of incarcerated individuals in high - quality postsecondary correctional education programs . under the experiment , participating institutions of higher education , in partnership with federal and / or state correctional institutions , award pell grants to students who are otherwise pell - eligible except for being incarcerated in a federal or state institution . the experiment is expected to conclude in 2020. there are several issues policymakers might consider if congress chooses to take up legislation to reinstate prisoners ' eligibility for pell grants , including the following : the pell grant program is a need based program that provides funds to all that qualify . thus , restoring pell grant eligibility to all federal and state prisoners will increase pell grant program costs . should tax dollars be used to educate convicted offenders before they are released from prison ? . there are some prisoners who have been sentenced to death , whose sentences exceed their life expectancy , or who might be civilly committed indefinitely under sexually dangerous persons statutes after they have served their prison sentences . should these prisoners be eligible to receive pell grants ? . educational attainment is lower among incarcerated adults than non - incarcerated adults and even prisoners with high school diplomas or general education development ( ged ) certificates might need additional assistance to help them prepare for the rigors of postsecondary education . is there a need for additional investment in remedial education or adult basic education for prisoners to help them prepare for postsecondary education classes ? . under current law and regulation , to be eligible for a pell grant males who are subject to registration with the selective service system ( sss ) must register or prove they were either not required by sss to register or failed to register for an ed - qualifying reason . there is a higher incidence of not registering among men who have been incarcerated during some or all of the period between ages 18 to 25. should this requirement be retained for incarcerated men , or should the process for proving exceptions be modified to facilitate pell grant eligibility for incarcerated men ? . there is a lack of rigorous evaluations that have isolated the effects postsecondary education has on recidivism , and little research on the best way to deliver postsecondary education in prisons . should congress take steps to promote data collection on the availability of , and participation in , postsecondary education to advance research on the effects of postsecondary education on recidivism ? . there can be barriers to providing educational programming in a correctional environment ( e.g . , lack of classroom space and trained instructors , limitations on internet access ) regardless of pell grant receipt . are there steps congress could take to mitigate these barriers ? . a criminal history can be a barrier to securing employment in a variety of fields , either because some convicted offenders are prohibited from working in certain jobs due to a provision in law or regulation , or because employers are wary of hiring someone with a criminal history . is there interest in undertaking any efforts to reduce the collateral consequences of a criminal history on post - release employment to allow the incarcerated student to fully realize the benefits of postsecondary education ? .
gao reviewed the extent of foodborne illnesses caused by microbal contamination , focusing on : the frequency , health consequences , and economic impacts of these illnesses ; and the extent of information available to develop effective control strategies . gao found that : between 6.5 million and 81 million cases of foodborne illness and as many as 9,100 related deaths occur each year ; the risk of foodborne illness is increasing due to changes in food supply and consumption , recognition of new causes of foodborne illnesses , new modes of transmission , increased resistance to long - standing food - processing and storage techniques , and emerging virulent strains of well - known bacteria ; while foodborne illnesses are most often brief and do not require medical care , a small percentage cause long - term disability or even death ; foodborne illness may cost billions of dollars every year in medical costs and lost productivity ; the current voluntary reporting system does not provide sufficient data on the prevalence and sources of foodborne illnesses ; efforts are under way to collect more and better data on the prevalence and sources of foodborne illnesses ; and more uniform and comprehensive data on the number and causes of foodborne illnesses could lead to more effective control strategies .
the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking . addressing a federal budget deficit that is unsustainable over the long run involves choices . fundamentally , the issues require deciding what government goods , services , and transfers are worth paying taxes for . most people would agree that the country benefits from a wide range of government services — air traffic controllers , border security , courts and corrections , and so forth — provided by the federal government . yet federal government provision of goods and services comprises only a modest portion of the federal budget . transfers , including interest payments , accounted for around 75 % of the federal budget . central findings of this analysis include the following : a comparatively small share of federal spending is for the direct provision of domestic government goods and services . transfers and payments to persons and to state and local governments constitute most of federal spending , about 75 % of all federal spending . defense spending , accounting for about 15 % of federal spending , has declined as a share of output over the past 35 years , but it also tends to vary depending , in part , on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts . the problem with the debt lies not in the past but in the future , as growth in spending for health and social security is projected to continue faster than the economy as a whole . the increase in deficits and debt , in turn , leads to a significant increase in interest payments . because much of the pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in social security and medicare part a ( hospital insurance ) trust funds , keeping these funds and their sources of financing intact is a concern that could constrain choices . preserving entitlements would likely require significant increases in taxes , such as raising rates , reducing tax expenditures , increasing other taxes , or introducing new revenue sources . reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level , so limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending , including entitlement programs such as social security , medicare , and medicaid . because the federal government provides about one - fifth of the revenue for state and local governments , cutbacks in transfers to these governments may , in part , shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services .
the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid - 19 ) , first in china , and then globally , including in the united states , is drawing attention to the ways in which the u.s. economy depends on manufacturing and supply chains based in china . this report aims to assess current developments and identify immediate and longer range china trade issues for congress . an area of particular concern to congress is u.s. shortages in medical suppliesâincluding personal protective equipment ( ppe ) and pharmaceuticalsâas the united states steps up efforts to contain covid - 19 with limited domestic stockpiles and insufficient u.s. industrial capacity . because of china 's role as a global supplier of ppe , medical devices , antibiotics , and active pharmaceutical ingredients , reduced export from china have led to shortages of critical medical supplies in the united states . exacerbating the situation , in early february 2020 , the chinese government nationalized control of the production and distribution of medical supplies in chinaâdirecting all production for domestic useâand directed the bureaucracy and chinese industry to secure supplies from the global market . now apparently past the peak of its covid - 19 outbreak , the chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery , with designated countries selected , according to political calculations . congress has enacted legislation to better understand and address u.s. medical supply chain dependencies , including p.l . 116-136 , the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act , that includes several provisions to expand drug shortage reporting requirements ; require certain drug manufacturers to draw up risk management plans ; require the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) to maintain a public list of medical devices that are determined to be in shortage ; and direct the national academies of science , engineering , and medicine to conduct a study of pharmaceutical supply chain security . other potential considerations for congress include whether and how to incentivize additional production of health supplies , diversify production , address other supply chain dependencies ( e.g . , microelectronics ) , fill information and data gaps , and promote u.s. leadership on global health and trade issues . the crisis that has emerged for the u.s. economy is defined , in large part , by a collapse of critical supply , as well as a sharp downturn in demand , first in china and now in the united states and globally . as china 's manufacturing sector recovers , while the united states and other major global markets are grappling with covid - 19 , some fear china could overwhelm overseas markets , as it ramps up export - led growth to compensate for the sharp downturn of exports in the first quarter of 2020 , secure hard currency , and boost economic growth . china may also seek to make gains in strategic sectorsâsuch as telecommunications , microelectronics , and semiconductorsâin which the government undertook extraordinary measures to sustain research and development and manufacturing during the covid - 19 outbreak in china .
the administration 's fy2020 ndaa request would have authorized $ 568.1 billion designated as base budget funds to cover the routine , recurring costs to man , train , and operate u.s. forces . the request would have authorized an additional $ 173.8 billion designated as overseas contingency operations ( oco ) funds , of which $ 97.9 billion was requested for base programs . as enacted , the fy2020 ndaa authorizes a total of $ 729.9 billion for national defense - related activities , which is $ 12.0 billion ( 1.6 % ) less than the administration requested .
the 116th congress may conduct oversight and deliberate on authorization and funding of water resource development , management , and protection . congress engages in authorization and appropriations for water resource projects and activities of the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) and the bureau of reclamation ( reclamation ) . usace constructs projects nationwide , primarily to improve navigation , reduce flood damage , and restore aquatic ecosystems . reclamation constructs projects in the 17 arid states west of the mississippi river ; these projects primarily provide water supply benefits , often to agricultural irrigation users . the 116th congress , like earlier congresses , also may consider indian water rights settlements and may evaluate the focus of and funding for the water resource science activities of the u.s. geological survey ( usgs ) . development pressures , droughts and floods , and concerns about changing hydrology from land - use change and climate change have engendered nonfederal interest in federal financial and technical assistance for water resource science and projects . stakeholders are interested in a range of water resource issues , including new water resource infrastructure ( e.g . , storm surge gates , water storage ) and new kinds of projects ( e.g . , groundwater recharge , nature - based flood risk reduction ) ; reinvestment in aging water resource infrastructure and use of water science and real - time monitoring and forecasting to improve infrastructure operations ; funding and financing of projects , and whether and how to shift from federally led projects to federal partnerships with state and / or local entities ; and activities to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems and enhance flood resilience ( including the use of nature - based approaches ) . some topics arise within the context of specific agencies . usace - related topics for the 116th congress may include funding and financing issues , such as use of the harbor maintenance trust fund ; the status of investments in projects to deepen coastal harbors ; usace budgeting priorities ; and oversight of usace efforts to implement public - private partnerships and develop alternative financing opportunities . some reclamation - related water project and management issues during the 116th congress may include the status of proposed new and augmented water storage projects , as well as efforts to address the agency 's aging infrastructure and transition certain qualifying projects to nonfederal ownership . congress also may address reclamation drought mitigation activities in the colorado river basin and other areas . in addition , congress may explore ongoing issues associated with reclamation 's project operations in california and other areas . it may address how these issues affect water deliveries to irrigation districts and municipalities and threatened and endangered species , among others . some topics are international in character . regarding freshwater bodies shared with canada , potential topics for the 116th congress include federal funding for activities supporting great lakes restoration and negotiations ( and any resulting agreements ) with canada to modify the columbia river treaty . potential topics related to mexico include oversight of a binational agreement on water sharing during dry conditions in the colorado river basin and mexico 's deliveries to the united states in the rio grande basin . crosscutting topics ( i.e . , topics relevant to multiple agencies and programs ) also are part of congressional water resource deliberations . for example , the 116th congress may consider the status and priority of new and ongoing federal efforts to restore large - scale aquatic ecosystems that have been altered or impaired by changes to their natural conditions ( e.g . , florida everglades , chesapeake bay ) . congress may explore the funding and performance of existing restoration efforts , including what changes ( if any ) may be necessary to improve project delivery and evaluation . the 116th congress may consider its guidance to multiple federal agencies on how to respond to flood hazards , including efforts related to enhancing the resilience of infrastructure and communities to flooding . there is interest in developing and evaluating approaches that protect natural elements that reduce flood risk ( e.g . , natural dunes ) or are `` nature - based '' in comprehensive flood risk management ( e.g . , constructed dunes ) . congress also may consider legislation and oversight on usace supplemental appropriations for response to and recovery from floods .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the department of energy 's ( doe ) nuclear weapons stockpile surveillance program , focusing on doe efforts to get the testing program on schedule . gao found that : doe is behind schedule in conducting flight tests , nonnuclear system laboratory tests , and nuclear and nonnuclear component laboratory tests ; these schedule slippages are a result of unapproved safety studies , suspended testing at certain nuclear facilities , and inappropriate transfer of testing functions ; doe has reduced its plan for testing the air force 's intercontinental ballistic missiles from three tests per year to two tests per year ; flight testing of w88 warheads is suspended until a safety study plan is approved ; doe has taken actions to increase the number of stockpile surveillance tests , but doe does not have formal contingency plans for continuous stockpile testing ; one doe facility is unable to conduct surveillance tests due to procedural safety problems ; doe uses the stockpile management preferred alternative report to determine alternative locations for weapons testing depending on the nature of the problem at the original testing facility , length and time of the outage , and particular weapon involved ; and doe prefers to develop a specific plan of action after testing problems occur to confront the wide range of problems and variables involved in the surveillance testing process .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the farm service agency 's ( fsa ) efforts to conduct farm programs in an equitable manner , focusing on : fsa efforts to treat minority farmers in the same way as nonminority farmers in delivering program services ; minority representation in county office staffing and on county committees in the counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers ; and the disposition of minority and nonminority farmers ' applications for participation in the agricultural conservation program ( acp ) and the direct loan program at the national level and in five county and five district loan offices . gao found that : fsa 's civil rights and small business development staff oversees the agency 's efforts to achieve equitable treatment for minority farmers ; in fiscal years 1995 and 1996 , the staff closed 28 complaints of discrimination against farmers on the basis of race or national origin , and found discriminatory practices in 2 of the 28 cases ; in addition , as part of its routine assessments of fsa 's overall operations in 13 states , the staff assessed the performance of the agency 's employees in treating all farmers equitably , but none of the evaluations found that minority farmers were being treated unfairly ; the staff has also trained about one - half of fsa 's employees in equal employment opportunity and civil rights matters and expects to finish training all of the employees by the end of 1997 ; in july 1996 , fsa created an outreach office to increase minority farmers ' participation in , and knowledge of , the department 's agricultural programs ; at the time of gao 's review , 32 percent of fsa 's employees serving the 101 counties with the highest numbers of minority farmers were members of a minority group ; about 90 percent of these employees were county executive directors or program assistants involved in conducting and managing fsa programs ; minority farmers make up about 17 percent of the farmer population in these counties ; at the national level , fsa data show that applications for the acp in fiscal year 1995 and for the direct loan program from october 1994 through march 1996 were disapproved at a higher rate for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers ; three of the five county offices gao visited had higher disapproval rates for minority farmers than for nonminority farmers applying to the acp , and three of the five district loan offices gao visited had higher disapproval rates for minority farmers than for other farmers applying for the direct loan program ; and gao 's review of the information in the application files in these offices showed that decisions to approve or disapprove applications were supported by information in the files and that decision - making criteria appeared to be applied to minority and nonminority applicants in a similar fashion .
recent acts of terrorism and hate crimes have prompted a renewed focus on the possible links between internet content and offline violence . while some have focused on the role that social media companies play in moderating user - generated content , others have called for congress to pass laws regulating online content promoting terrorism or violence . proposals related to government action of this nature raise significant free speech questions , including ( 1 ) the reach of the first amendment 's protections when it comes to foreign nationals posting online content from abroad ; ( 2 ) the scope of so - called `` unprotected '' categories of speech developed long before the advent of the internet ; and ( 3 ) the judicial standards that limit how the government can craft or enforce laws to preserve national security and prevent violence . at the outset , it is not clear that a foreign national ( i.e . , a non - u.s. citizen or resident ) could invoke the protections of the first amendment in a specific u.s. prosecution or litigation involving online speech that the foreign national posted from abroad . the supreme court has never directly opined on this question . however , its decisions regarding the extraterritorial application of other constitutional protections to foreign nationals and lower court decisions involving speech made by foreign nationals while outside of the united states suggest that the first amendment may not apply in that scenario . in contrast , free speech considerations are likely to be highly relevant in evaluating the legality of ( 1 ) proposals for the u.s. government to regulate what internet users in the united states can post , or ( 2 ) the enforcement of existing u.s. laws where the government seeks to hold u.s. persons liable for their online speech . although the government typically can regulate conduct without running afoul of the first amendment , regulations that restrict or burden expression often do implicate free speech protections . in such circumstances , courts generally distinguish between laws that regulate speech on the basis of its content ( i.e . , the topic discussed or the message expressed ) and those that do not , subjecting the former to more stringent review . a law that expressly restricts online communications or media promoting violence or terrorism is likely to be deemed a content - based restriction on speech ; whereas a law that primarily regulates conduct could be subject to a less stringent standard of review , unless its application to speech turns on the message expressed . whether such laws would survive first amendment scrutiny depends on a number of factors . over the past 50 years , the supreme court has generally extended the first amendment 's free speech protections to speech that advocates violence in the abstract while allowing the government to restrict or punish speech that threatens or facilitates violence in a more specific or immediate way . the subtle distinctions that have developed over time are reflected in the categories of speech that the court has deemed unprotected , meaning that the government generally can prohibit speech in these areas because of its content . these include incitement to imminent lawless action , true threats , and speech integral to criminal conduct . although judicial decisions have helped to define the scope of some of these categories , open questions remain as to how they apply in the context of online speech . for instance , legal scholars have questioned what it means for speech to incite `` imminent '' violence when posted to social media . they have also asked how threats should be perceived when made in the context of online forums where hyperbolic speech about violence is common . the extent to which the government can regulate speech promoting violence or terrorism also depends on whether its law or action satisfies the applicable level of scrutiny that the court has developed to evaluate measures that restrict or burden speech . in general , laws that regulate protected speech on political or ideological matters are subject to strict scrutiny , a test that requires the government to demonstrate that its law is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest . nevertheless , in some cases , courts have concluded that the government 's national security interests justify restrictions on protected speech , such as in 2010 when the supreme court upheld certain applications of a federal statute prohibiting providing material support to u.s. - designated foreign terrorist organizations .
the fy2020 defense appropriations act , enacted as division a of h.r . 1158 , the consolidated appropriations act for fy2020 , provides a total of $ 687.8 billion in discretionary budget authority , all to fund activities of the department of defense ( dod ) , except for $ 1.1 billion for certain activities of the intelligence community . as enacted , the bill provides 99.6 % of the funding requested by president trump requested for programs falling within the scope of this bill . to comply with the fy2020 cap on dod base budget funding that was in effect at the time the fy2020 budget request was submitted , the administration included in its request $ 97.9 billion intended for dod base budget activities , but which was designated as part of the overseas contingency operations ( oco ) request and thus was exempt from the cap for all practical purposes . the appropriations committees of the house and senate treated these funds as part of the base budget request . activities funded by the annual defense appropriations act accounted for more than 90 % of the budget authority included in the trump administration 's $ 761.8 billion budget request for national defense - related activities in fy2020 . the balance of the request consisted of activities funded by other appropriations bills ( e.g . , dod 's military construction program and defense - related nuclear energy work of the energy department ) and certain amounts appropriated automatically as a result of permanent law .
cannabidiol ( cbd ) , a compound in the cannabis sativa plant , has been promoted as a treatment for a range of conditions , including epileptic seizures , post - traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , inflammation , and sleeplessness . however , limited scientific evidence is available to substantiate or disprove the efficacy of cbd in treating these conditions . in the united states , cbd is marketed in food and beverages , dietary supplements , cosmetics , and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ends ) âproducts that are primarily regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) under the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca , 21 u.s.c . â§â§301 et seq . ) . cbd is also the active ingredient in epidiolex , an fda - approved pharmaceutical drug . the regulation of marijuana and hemp cbd is derived from the cannabis sativa plant ( commonly referred to as cannabis ) , which includes both hemp and marijuana . marijuana is a schedule i controlled substance under the controlled substances act ( csa , 21 u.s.c . â§â§802 et seq . ) . and is regulated by the drug enforcement administration ( dea ) . schedule i substances are subject to the most severe csa restrictions and penalties . except for purposes of federally approved research , it is a federal crime to grow , sell , or possess marijuana . until december 2018 , hemp was included in the csa definition of marijuana and was thus subject to the same restrictions . legislative changes enacted as part of the 2018 farm bill ( agriculture improvement act of 2018 , p.l . 115-334 ) removed longstanding federal restrictions on the cultivation of hemp . no longer subject to regulation and oversight as a controlled substance by dea , hemp production is now subject to regulation and oversight as an agricultural commodity by the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) . the 2018 farm bill expanded the statutory definition of what constitutes hemp to include `` all derivatives , extracts , cannabinoids , isomers , acids , salts , and salts of isomers , '' as long as it contains no more than a 0.3 % concentration of delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ; 7 u.s.c . â§1639o ) . all non - hemp cannabis and cannabis derivativesâincluding marijuana - derived cbdâare considered to be marijuana under the csa and remain regulated by dea . production and marketing of hemp products legislative changes related to hemp enacted as part of the 2018 farm bill were widely expected to generate additional market opportunities for the u.s. hemp market . however , the farm bill explicitly preserved fda 's authority under the ffdca and section 351 of the public health service act ( phsa , 42 u.s.c . â§262 ) , including for hemp - derived products . following enactment of the farm bill , in a december 2018 statement , fda stated that it is `` unlawful under the [ ffdca ] to introduce food containing added cbd or thc into interstate commerce , or to market cbd or thc products as , or in , dietary supplements , regardless of whether the substances are hemp - derived . . the agency has maintained this view in subsequent communications . despite fda 's determination , cbd continues to be widely marketed and sold in both food and dietary supplements in the united states . to date , fda has generally prioritized enforcement against companies and products that pose the greatest risk to consumersâfor example , cbd products claiming to treat alzheimer 's or stop cancer cell growth . in 2014 , total u.s. cbd sales were a reported $ 108 million . in 2018 , more than 1,000 companies produced and marketed cbd for the u.s. market , and u.s. cbd sales were estimated at $ 534 million , according to the hemp business journal . that dollar amount is projected to exceed $ 1 billion in 2020 and to reach nearly $ 2 billion in 2022. this amount includes sales from hemp - derived cbd , marijuana - derived cbd ( currently a schedule i controlled substance ) , and pharmaceutical cbd ( currently only epidiolex ) . congressional interest congress has expressed concern about the proliferation of cbd products marketed in violation of federal law and has called on fda to provide guidance on lawful pathways for marketing hemp - derived cbd in food and dietary supplements . in absence of a regulatory framework for hemp - derived cbd , in the explanatory statement accompanying the fy2020 enacted appropriation , congress directed fda to issue a policy of enforcement discretion with respect to cbd products that meet the statutory definition of hemp . in addition to the activities directed in the explanatory statement , congress could also take further legislative action in the future , such as requiring fda to issue a regulation , under its ffdca authorities , expressly permitting cbd that meets the definition of hemp to be used as a food additive or dietary supplement . congress also could amend the ffdca provisions that fda has identified as restricting marketing of cbd in food and dietary supplements . in determining whether a legislative approach is appropriate , congress may consider the potential for adverse health effects and other unintended consequences .
the united states provides foreign assistance to latin american and caribbean nations to support development and other u.s. objectives . u.s. policymakers have emphasized different strategic interests in the region at different times , from combating soviet influence during the cold war to promoting democracy and open markets since the 1990s . the trump administration has sought to reduce foreign aid significantly and refocus u.s. assistance efforts in the region to address u.s. domestic concerns , such as irregular migration and transnational crime . fy2019 budget request for fy2019 , the trump administration requested $ 1.1 billion for latin america and the caribbean through foreign assistance accounts managed by the state department and the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) . that amount would have been $ 581 million , or 34 % , less than the estimated $ 1.7 billion of u.s. assistance the region received in fy2018 . the proposal would have cut funding for every type of assistance and nearly every latin american and caribbean nation . the trump administration also proposed eliminating the inter - american foundation — a small , independent u.s. foreign assistance agency that promotes grassroots development in the region — and consolidating its programs into usaid . the administration 's efforts to scale back u.s. assistance could have significant implications for u.s. policy in latin america and the caribbean . faced with potential cuts , u.s. agencies could accelerate efforts to transition countries in the region away from traditional development assistance toward other forms of bilateral engagement . reductions in state department - managed security assistance could lead to the department of defense taking on a larger role in u.s. security cooperation . moreover , many argue that reductions in foreign aid , combined with other policy shifts , could contribute to a relative decline in u.s. influence in the region . legislative developments president trump signed into law the consolidated appropriations act , 2019 ( p.l . 116-6 ) , on february 15 , 2019. division f of the act — the department of state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations act , 2019 — includes funding for foreign assistance programs in latin america and the caribbean . the measure was preceded by three short - term continuing resolutions ( p.l . 115-245 , p.l . 115-298 , and p.l . 116-5 ) , which funded foreign assistance programs at the fy2018 level , and a 35-day lapse in appropriations from december 22 , 2018 , to january 25 , 2019. although the house and senate appropriations committees had approved their fy2019 foreign assistance appropriations measures ( h.r . 6385 and s. 3108 , respectively ) in june 2018 , neither bill received floor consideration prior to the end of the 115th congress . p.l . 116-6 and the accompanying joint explanatory statement do not specify appropriations levels for every latin american and caribbean nation . nevertheless , the amounts designated for key u.s. initiatives in central america , colombia , and mexico significantly exceed the administration 's request . the act provides $ 527.6 million to continue implementation of the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america , which is $ 92 million more than the administration requested but $ 99 million less than congress appropriated for the initiative in fy2018 . at least $ 418.3 million to support the peace process and security and development efforts in colombia , which is $ 153 million more than the administration requested and $ 27 million more than congress appropriated for colombia in fy2018 . $ 162.7 million to support security and rule - of - law efforts in mexico , which is $ 84 million more than the administration requested and $ 10 million more than congress appropriated for mexico in fy2018 .
the jones act , which refers to section 27 of the merchant marine act of 1920 ( p.l . 66-261 ) , requires that vessels transporting cargo from one u.s. point to another u.s. point be u.s. - built , and owned and crewed by u.s. citizens . the act provides a significant degree of protection for u.s. shipyards , domestic carriers , and american merchant sailors . it is a subject of debate because some experts point out that it leads to high domestic ocean shipping costs and constrains the availability of ships for domestic use . the jones act has come into prominence amid debates over puerto rico 's economic challenges and recovery from hurricane maria in 2017 ; in the investigation into the sinking of the ship el faro with 33 fatalities during a hurricane in 2015 ; and in discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas . the law 's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been the subject of attention in conjunction with a congressional directive that the administration develop a national maritime strategy , including strategies to increase the use of short sea shipping and enhance u.s. shipbuilding capability . the jones act of 1920 was not the first law requiring that vessels transporting cargo domestically be u.s. - built , owned , and crewed . it restated a long - standing restriction that was temporarily suspended during world war i. since 1920 , congress has enacted provisions that could be said to tighten jones act requirements as well as provisions that exempt certain maritime activity from the requirements . in 1935 , congress forbade jones act - qualified vessels that were sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign flag to subsequently requalify as jones act - eligible ( p.l . 74-191 ) . this provides additional protection from competition for jones act carriers if coastal shipping demand increases , because it can take around two years to construct a new ship . in 1940 , congress expanded the jones act to include towing and salvage vessels ( p.l . 76-599 ) . in 1988 , congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material required use of a jones act - qualified vessel , such that transport of dredge spoil or municipal waste would fall under the law ( p.l . 100-329 ) . generally , dredging and towing vessels , as well as great lakes ships , have occasioned less debate about the jones act than oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels . congress has enacted numerous exemptions or exceptions to the jones act . in some cases , congress has enacted an exemption if there are no jones act - qualified carriers interested in providing service in a particular market ( for example , passenger travel to and from puerto rico ) . congress has allowed waivers of the jones act for national defense reasons , which most often have been executed to speed fuel deliveries to a region after a natural disaster disrupted normal supply lines . regulatory interpretations of the jones act have been significant in defining what constitutes a `` u.s. - built '' vessel , what constitutes `` transportation '' between two u.s. points , and what are `` u.s . points . . the coast guard has determined that a u.s. - built vessel can be assembled with major foreign components such as engines , propellers , and stern and bow sections . this interpretation has been consistent from the late 1800s . customs and border protection ( cbp ) has determined that cruise ship voyages that involve visits to foreign ports in addition to a domestic port are not domestic transportation and therefore not subject to the jones act . this interpretation also dates to the late 1800s . cbp 's interpretations of what constitutes domestic transportation and u.s. points are significant to the offshore oil industry , as some of the vessels supporting that industry must be jones act - compliant while others need not be . by long - standing agreement , the military is to utilize u.s. - flag commercial ships for sealift before it utilizes government - owned vessels in its reserve fleet . jones act mariners are expected to crew sealift ships when needed , and thus the decades - long shrinkage of the oceangoing jones act fleet and mariner pool has been raised as a concern . the department of defense is planning to buy more used foreign - built ships for sealift rather than building them in the united states for cost reasons . it also has found that repairing its current fleet in u.s. shipyards is three times more expensive and has taken twice as long as estimated . much of the commercial fleet is relatively old , raising safety concerns . some useful types of ships are missing from the jones act - qualified fleet , such as heavy - lift vessels , liquefied natural gas ( lng ) tankers , and deepwater offshore construction vessels . both situations appear to some observers to be contrary to the policy goal of the jones act , which is to `` have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in times of war or national emergency . .
the violence against women act ( vawa ; title iv of p.l . 103-322 ) was originally enacted in 1994. it addressed congressional concerns about violent crime , and violence against women in particular , in several ways . it allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders ; mandated restitution to victims of specified federal sex offenses ; and authorized grants to state , local , and tribal law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women , among other things . vawa has been reauthorized three times since its original enactment . most recently , congress passed and president obama signed the violence against women reauthorization act of 2013 ( p.l . 113-4 ) , which reauthorized most vawa programs through fy2018 , among other things . the fundamental goals of vawa are to prevent violent crime ; respond to the needs of crime victims ; learn more about crime ; and change public attitudes through a collaborative effort by the criminal justice system , social service agencies , research organizations , schools , public health organizations , and private organizations . the federal government tries to achieve these goals primarily through federal grant programs that provide funding to state , tribal , territorial , and local governments ; nonprofit organizations ; and universities . vawa programs generally address domestic violence , sexual assault , dating violence , and stalking — crimes for which the risk of victimization is highest for women — although some vawa programs address additional crimes . vawa grant programs largely address the criminal justice system and community response to these crimes , but certain programs address prevention as well . the office on violence against women ( ovw ) administers the majority of vawa - authorized programs , while other federal agencies , including the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and the office of justice programs ( ojp ) , also manage vawa programs . since its creation in 1995 through fy2018 , ovw has awarded more than $ 8 billion in grants and cooperative agreements to state , tribal , and local governments , nonprofit organizations , and universities . in fy2019 , approximately $ 559 million was appropriated for vawa - authorized programs administered by ovw , ojp , and cdc . while several extensions of authorization for vawa were provided through fy2019 continuing appropriations , authorizations for appropriations for all vawa programs have since expired . however , all vawa programs funded in fy2018 have been funded in fy2019 ( select programs at slightly higher levels ) , and thus far it appears that the expiration of authorizations has not impacted the continuing operation of vawa programs . the administration has requested fy2020 funding for all vawa - authorized programs funded in fy2019 . there are several issues that congress may consider in efforts to reauthorize vawa . these include , but are not limited to , improvements to data collection on domestic violence and stalking or the rape kit backlog ; assessing the implementation and future direction of tribal jurisdiction over non - tribal members , including potentially adding new crimes under vawa ; new approaches for law enforcement in assisting victims ; and enforcement of the federal prohibition on firearms for those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and those who are subject to a domestic violence protective order . congress may also consider further changes to vawa programs . in the 116th congress , the house passed the violence against women reauthorization act of 2019 ( h.r . 1585 ) . among other things , it would reauthorize funding for vawa programs and authorize new programs ; amend and add definitions used for vawa programs ; amend federal criminal law relating to firearms , custodial rape , and stalking ; and expand tribal jurisdiction over certain crimes committed on tribal lands .
recent litigation involving the president has raised legal issues concerning formerly obscure constitutional provisions that prohibit the acceptance or receipt of `` emoluments '' in certain circumstances . first , the foreign emoluments clause ( article i , section 9 , clause 8 of the constitution ) prohibits any person `` holding any office of profit or trust under '' the united states from accepting `` any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever '' from a foreign government unless congress consents . second , the domestic emoluments clause ( article ii , section 1 , clause 7 ) prohibits the president from receiving `` any other emolument [ beyond a fixed salary ] from the united states , or any of them . . these two provisions ( collectively , the emoluments clauses ) have distinct , but related , purposes . the purpose of the foreign emoluments clause is to prevent corruption and limit foreign influence on federal officers . the clause grew out of the framers ' experience with the european custom of gift - giving to foreign diplomats , which the articles of confederation prohibited . the purpose of the domestic emoluments clause is to preserve the president 's independence by preventing the legislature and the states from exerting influence over him `` by appealing to his avarice . . an important threshold issue in examining the emoluments clauses is determining who is subject to their terms . the scope of the domestic emoluments clause is clear : it applies to `` [ t ] he president . . the scope of the foreign emoluments clause is less clear . by its terms , the clause applies to any person holding an `` office of profit or trust under '' the united states . the prevailing view is that this language reaches only federal , and not state , officeholders . according to the department of justice 's office of legal counsel ( olc ) , which has a developed body of opinions on the foreign emoluments clause , offices `` of profit '' include those that receive a salary , while offices `` of trust '' require discretion , experience , and skill . there is some disagreement over whether elected federal officers , such as the president , are subject to the foreign emoluments clause . some legal scholars have argued that , as a matter of original public meaning , the foreign emoluments clause reaches only appointed officers ( and not elected officials ) . other legal scholars dispute that argument , however , and olc has presumed that the foreign emoluments clause applies to the president . a recent district court opinion on this issue came to the same conclusion . another key disputed issue over the scope of the emoluments clauses is what constitutes an `` emolument . . this question has divided legal scholars , and federal courts have only recently addressed the issue . debate has largely centered on whether the emoluments clauses restrict private , arm 's - length market transactions between covered officials and governments , or whether the clauses are limited to office - or employment - based compensation . for its part , olc has at times appeared to adopt a fact - specific , functional view of the clauses , focusing on the purpose and potential effect of the specific payments or benefits at issue as they relate to the clauses ' goals of limiting influence on the president and federal officers . the only two courts to decide the issue adopted a broad definition of `` emolument '' as reaching any benefit , gain , or advantage of more than de minimis value , but those decisions are not final . courts are divided over whether the emoluments clauses may be enforced through civil litigation . among other things , the doctrine of standing may present a significant limitation on the ability of public officials or private parties to seek judicial enforcement of the emoluments clauses . standing , grounded in article iii of the constitution , requires a plaintiff to identify a personal injury ( known as an `` injury - in - fact '' ) that is actual or imminent , concrete , and particularized . the injury must also be `` fairly traceable '' to allegedly unlawful conduct of the defendant and `` likely to be redressed by the requested relief . . different plaintiffs in ongoing emoluments clause cases have relied on various theories to support standing , with mixed results . states and private parties , including business competitors to an office holder , have asserted injuries in the form of increased competition and loss of business from the alleged constitutional violations . some members of congress have relied on the alleged deprivation of their opportunity to vote on the acceptance of emoluments under the foreign emoluments clause to support their standing to sue . the lower courts have reached different conclusions on these standing issues , and the supreme court has yet to weigh in on the matter . if the courts lack jurisdiction to enforce the emoluments clauses , the political process would be the remaining avenue to enforce the provisions , such as through legislation or political pressure . the adequacy of those options is , however , disputed .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed proposed legislation to redevelop abandoned , urban industrial sites , focusing on : the number of potential sites nationwide ; impediments to redeveloping sites posed by the superfund program ; and whether proposed loans to local governments are sufficient for conducting site assessments . gao found that : researchers estimate that about 150,000 acres of abandoned or underused industrial land exists nationwide ; lenders , property buyers , and property owners are reluctant to redevelop these sites because federal and state environmental laws may require expensive cleanups of latent industrial wastes before property improvements can be made ; federal law limits the liability of a party that holds ownership in a property but does not manage the property ; proposed legislation would limit the amount lenders would have to pay in the event they are liable , limit the liability of property buyers who assess a site for contamination before buying it , and provide assistance for state programs that encourage voluntary cleanup of industrial waste sites ; even if the liability of lenders and property buyers is limited , abandoned industrial sites might continue to be viewed as risky investments due to the possibility of contamination ; and proposed legislation would provide interest - free loans to localities to conduct site assessments to determine the extent of contamination .
individuals may be subject to certain restrictions when leaving the government for private employment or joining the government from the private sector . these restrictions were enacted in response to what is often referred to as the revolving door . generally , the revolving door is described as the movement of individuals between the public and private sector . individuals may move because they possess policy and procedural knowledge and have relationships with former colleagues that are useful to prospective employers . laws attempting to restrict the movement of individuals between the government and the private sector have existed since at least the late 1800s . today 's revolving door laws focus on restricting former government employees ' representational activities that attempt to influence federal officials with whom they used to work . found at 18 u.s.c . â§207 , revolving door laws for executive branch officials include ( 1 ) a lifetime ban on `` switching sides '' ( e.g . , representing a private party on the same `` particular matter '' involving identified parties on which the former executive branch employee had worked while in government ) ; ( 2 ) a two - year ban on `` switching sides '' on a broader range of issues ; ( 3 ) a one - year restriction on assisting others on certain trade and treaty negotiations ; ( 4 ) a one - year `` cooling off '' period for certain senior officials on lobbying ; ( 5 ) two - year `` cooling off '' periods for very senior officials from lobbying ; and ( 6 ) a one - year ban on certain former officials from representing a foreign government or foreign political party . in addition to laws , executive orders have been used to place further restrictions on executive branch officials , including officials entering government . for example , president trump issued an executive order ( e.o . 13770 ) to lengthen `` cooling off '' periods for certain executive branch appointees both entering and exiting government . to date , much of the empirical work concerning the revolving door has focused on former members of congress or congressional staff leaving capitol hill , especially those who become lobbyists in their postcongressional careers . this report provides some empirical data about a different aspect of the revolving doorâthe movement into and out of government by executive branch personnel . using research conducted by the bush school of government and public service at texas a & m university 's capstone class over the 2017-2018 academic year , this report presents data about the revolving door in the executive branch through the lens of president george w. bush 's and president barack obama 's administrations . the analysis includes cabinet department officials who were listed , for either administration , in the united states government policy and supporting positions ( the plum book ) . through an examination of appointees in president bush 's and president obama 's administrations , several findings emerge . first , approximately 92 % of executive branch officials in the examined dataset were never registered lobbyists , while 8 % were registered lobbyists at some point before or after their government service . second , cabinet departments differed greatly in the number of officials who were registered lobbyists either before or after their federal service . although every cabinet department surveyed had some percentage of officials registered as lobbyists either before or after their government service , the percentage of officials included in the dataset who registered as lobbyists before their government service , after their government service , or both ranged from a high of 18 % ( department of commerce ) to a low of 1 % ( department of justice ) . third , the data also show that for lobbyists entering government , the percentage of officials in the dataset who had been lobbyists before government serving in the bush and obama administrations ranged from 10 % in the department of labor to 61 % in the department of veterans affairs . the analogous percentages for government employees in the dataset leaving to become lobbyists ranged from 39 % in the department of veterans affairs to 82 % in the department of transportation . finally , the report identifies several areas for potential congressional consideration . in recent years , several bills have been introduced in congress to address many of these potential areas . these include options to amend existing `` cooling off '' periods and evaluate the administration and enforcement of revolving door regulations . alternatively , congress may choose to maintain current `` cooling off '' periods , administration , and enforcement practices .
economic sanctions imposed by the united statesâthrough enacted legislation and executive actionâon iran , russia , and venezuela aim to pressure the ruling governments to change their behavior and policies . currently , these sanctions aim to either eliminate ( iran ) or restrict ( venezuela ) crude oil trade of as much as 3.3 million to 4.0 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , roughly 3 % - 4 % of global petroleum supply . estimated oil production volumes affected to date have been approximately 1.7 million bpd from iran . venezuela oil production has also likely been affected , although accurately quantifying volumes is difficult due to monthly oil production declines over a period of years prior to u.s. sanctions affecting oil trade in january 2019. sanctions imposed on russia 's oil sector generally target longer - term oil production and to date have not reduced russian oil supply or trade . oil production in russia has increased since oil - sector sanctions began in 2014 , although the country has arguably incurred economic costs in order to incentivize and support oil output levels . sanctions targeting iran 's oil sector date back to the 1980s and affect virtually every element of iran 's oil sector ( e.g . , investment , shipping , insurance , and exports ) . legislation enacted in 2011 ( p.l . 112-81 ) and 2013 ( p.l . 112-239 ) , along with subsequent executive orders ( e.o.s ) , created a sanctions framework designed to discourage oil importersâby sanctioning banks that transact with iran or facilitate oil transactions , as well as entities that buy iranian oilâfrom purchasing crude oil and other petroleum and petrochemical products from iran . iran oil export sanctions include design elements ( e.g . , significant reduction exceptions , requirements to certify oil markets are adequately supplied , and coordination with oil - producing countries ) intended to minimize oil price escalation that could result from sanctions - related oil supply reductions . iran oil export sanctions have been applied , waived , and reapplied since 2011. as of november 2019 , the trump administration 's stated goal has been to reduce iran 's oil exports to zero . trade data indicate that observed iranian crude oil exports declined by approximately 80 % between april 2018 and october 2019. should sanctions affecting iran 's oil exports be relieved or terminated , the reentry of 1 million to 2 million bpd of crude oil could , depending on market conditions and oil - producing country decisions , contribute to oil market oversupply that could lower oil prices . while u.s. petroleum product consumers may welcome such an outcome , severe and persistently low prices could have adverse effects on u.s. oil producers . oil sector sanctions imposed on russia via e.o . since 2014 , and codified ( p.l . 115-44 ) in 2017 , apply to certain russian oil companies and target two activities : ( 1 ) accessing debt finance , and ( 2 ) accessing oil exploration and production technology for deepwater , arctic offshore , and shale projects . near - term russian oil supply does not appear to have been affected by these sanctions to date ; oil production has increased since 2014. alternative financing , currency devaluation , and russia 's oil tax and export duty policies have provided russian companies with capital and incentives to increase oil production and exports . over the long term , russian oil output could be affected by oil production technology sanctions , as some european and u.s. companies have terminated participation in certain oil exploration and development projects . economic sanctions affecting venezuela 's oil trade are the product of e.o.s and u.s. department of the treasury designations in 2019 prohibiting transactions with petroleo s de venezuela s.a. ( pdvsa ) . petroleum trade between the united states and venezuela has been eliminated . as a result , venezuela has sought alternative buyers of crude oil previously destined for the united states and alternative suppliers of petroleum products previously sourced from u.s. exporters . although u.s. economic sanctions do not explicitly prohibit non - u.s. entities from trading oil and petroleum products with pdvsa , treasury has discretion to take action against foreign entities that provide material support to pdvsa . this sanctions framework element could make it difficult for pdvsa to secure alternative buyers and suppliers . rosneft , a russian - controlled oil company , has reportedly facilitated venezuelan crude oil trade with independent oil refiners in china and has provided venezuela with petroleum products previously sourced from u.s. suppliers . enacted legislation in the 116 th congress ( p.l . 116-94 ) requires the administration to coordinate venezuela sanctions with international partners and expresses concerns about certain pdvsa transactions with rosneft . sanctions - related oil supply constraints have affected oil production and trade . oil market characteristicsâgenerally inelastic supply and demand in the short termâcould contribute to market conditions that could result in volatile price movements ( both up and down ) when supply and demand are imbalanced by as little as 1 % to 2 % for a brief or sustained period . to date , persistently high crude oil prices have been moderated by several factors , including increasing u.s. oil production and exports , trade flow adjustments , expectations of slowing demand growth rates , and sanctions design elements . however , oil trade sanctions have affected price differentials for certain crude oil types ( e.g . , light vs. heavy ) .
congress gathers much of the information necessary to oversee the implementation of existing laws or to evaluate whether new laws are necessary from the executive branch . while executive branch officials comply with most congressional requests for information , there are times when the executive branch chooses to resist disclosure . when congress finds an inquiry blocked by the withholding of information by the executive branch , or where the traditional process of negotiation and accommodation is inappropriate or unavailing , a subpoena — either for testimony or documents — may be used to compel compliance with congressional demands . the recipient of a duly issued and valid congressional subpoena has a legal obligation to comply , absent a valid and overriding privilege or other legal justification . but the subpoena is only as effective as the means by which it may be enforced . without a process by which congress can coerce compliance or deter non - compliance , the subpoena would be reduced to a formalized request rather than a constitutionally based demand for information . congress currently employs an ad hoc combination of methods to combat non - compliance with subpoenas . the two predominant methods rely on the authority and participation of another branch of government . first , the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena . once the contempt citation is received , any prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch . second , congress may try to enforce a subpoena by seeking a civil judgment declaring that the recipient is legally obligated to comply . this process of civil enforcement relies on the help of the courts to enforce congressional demands . but these mechanisms do not always ensure congressional access to requested information . recent controversies could be interpreted to suggest that the existing mechanisms are at times inadequate — particularly in the instance that enforcement is necessary to respond to a current or former executive branch official who has refused to comply with a subpoena . there would appear to be several ways in which congress could alter its approach to enforcing committee subpoenas issued to executive branch officials . these alternatives include the enactment of laws that would expedite judicial consideration of subpoena - enforcement lawsuits filed by either house of congress ; the establishment of an independent office charged with enforcing the criminal contempt of congress statute ; or the creation of an automatic consequence , such as a withholding of appropriated funds , triggered by the approval of a contempt citation . in addition , either the house or senate could consider acting on internal rules of procedure to revive the long - dormant inherent contempt power as a way to enforce subpoenas issued to executive branch officials . yet , because of the institutional prerogatives that are often implicated in inter - branch oversight disputes , some of these proposals may raise constitutional concerns .
congress established the national wild and scenic rivers system ( nwsrs ) in 1968 through the wild and scenic rivers act ( wsra ; p.l . 90-542 ) to preserve free - flowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations and to complement the then - current national policy of constructing dams and other river structures that altered flow . designated rivers usually are referred to as wild and scenic rivers ( wsrs ) . the wsra established three classes of wsrsâwild , scenic , and recreationalâreflecting the characteristics of the rivers at the time of designation and affecting the type and amount of subsequently allowable development . the system now includes 226 river units comprising over 13,400 miles in 41 states and the commonwealth of puerto rico . wsrs may come into the nwsrs either by congressional designation or by state nomination to the secretary of the interior . wsrs may be located on federal lands , nonfederal lands , or a combination of both . some wsrs on nonfederal land are referred to as partnership wild and scenic rivers ( or partnership wsrs ) . the wsra does not define this term ; it is an umbrella term used to describe wsrs with generally similar characteristics , such as nonfederal management and land ownership , but partnership wsrs can vary . wsrs on nonfederal land also may be added to the nwsrs through an administrative process , wherein states may apply to the secretary of the interior for inclusion of a state - protected river . rivers added to the system through state nomination , or rivers designated by congress that run through both federal and nonfederal lands , generally are not referred to as partnership wsrs . in the case of congressionally designated rivers , congress may first direct in legislation that a study be conducted to determine whether the river area is suitable for wild and scenic designation . congress generally specifies in the designating legislation that either the secretary of agriculture or the secretary of the interior administer the wsr . if the designated wsr contains federal land , the secretary then manages the river through the federal land management agency of jurisdictionâthe bureau of land management , the national park service ( nps ) , or the fish and wildlife service within the department of the interior or the forest service within the u.s. department of agriculture . the relevant local jurisdiction manages partnership wsrs and state - nominated wsrs , with certain administrative functions carried out at the federal level . wsrs are administered to protect and enhance the values for which the rivers were included in the system and to preserve the rivers ' free - flowing condition . the agency , or the relevant local jurisdiction for wsrs on nonfederal land , prepares a comprehensive resource management plan ( crmp ) to guide management . the wsra prohibits federally licensed or assisted water resources projects that would have a `` direct and adverse '' effect on the values for which a river was established and prohibits the federal energy regulatory commission from licensing projects on or directly affecting a designated river segment . the agency of jurisdiction enforces this provision ; on partnership wsrs and state - nominated wsrs , nps enforces this provision . in addition to the provisions of the wsra , management of wsrs on federal lands differs based on the statutory management criteria for each agency 's lands . each federal land management agency specifies policies regarding river management at varying levels of detail . agencies typically provide the most protection to wild rivers . for congressionally designated rivers on federal lands , congress provides funds for operations and maintenance through annual appropriations for the relevant agencies . agencies sometimes provide funding separately for individual rivers or provide funding through broader budget activities , not specific to an individual river . rivers added to the nwsrs through state nomination typically do not receive federal funding . however , partnership wsrs receive funding through nps . the wsra authorizes federal agencies to provide technical assistance to states and their political subdivisions ( such as counties , townships , and others ) , landowners , organizations , or individuals in planning , protecting , and managing wsrs . designation of wild and scenic rivers has been controversial in some cases , especially for wsrs containing nonfederal lands . initially following enactment of the wsra , congress designated rivers primarily on federal land . over the past 20 years , congress has designated or authorized for study an increasing number of partnership wsrs . opinions regarding the balance of federal and local control over partnership wsrs have varied . some have observed that congress intended the state nomination authority to be the primary means for rivers on nonfederal lands to be included in the system , but this designation method has not been used in recent years . congress may consider whether it is preferable to encourage use of the state - nominated process , which includes a set of fixed provisions , or to continue to establish partnership wsrs through individual designating statutes , whose provisions vary .
although the united states is currently experiencing its longest economic expansion , history has shown that economic expansions inevitably give way to economic slowdowns . if the next slowdown is significant , the economy could enter a recession , which is typically characterized by falling output and rising unemployment . short - term forecasts are predicting continued economic expansion , but predicting when the economy may transition from expansion to recession is notoriously difficult , as the ebb and flow of the economy is determined by many different factors , including a number that lie outside the country 's borders . this report identifies and summarizes options congress may consider in response to a possible recession . recognizing that the economy has the potential to return to full employment without intervention , one policy option is simply to allow the economy to correct on its own with the support of certain `` automatic stabilizers '' already in place . automatic stabilizers work without congressional action to lower taxes and increase spending as the economy weakens . examples include the progressive structure of the income tax system and unemployment compensation ( uc ) benefits , among others . congress also has a range of other options it could consider when designing a stimulus package should a recession occur and automatic stabilizers are not sufficient to counteract it . the options presented in this report are drawn from the congressional budget office ( cbo ) and moody 's analytics , both of which estimated the impact of specific policies or approaches in response to the great recession . while a general approach to stimulating a weakened economy with reduced taxes and increased spending is often advocated , specific policies have different impacts on the economy and differing administrative complexities . cbo 's and moody 's estimates provide insight into which specific policy options may be most worthwhile to implement during the next downturn . the policy options presentedâor variations of themâare ones commonly considered when designing a fiscal stimulus package and are not unique to either cbo or moody 's . the united states ' recent budget deficits and the country 's long - run budget outlook could influence the size of any stimulus package . large and persistent budget deficits can hamper economic growth by lowering the rate of capital formation via reduced national saving , and can potentially offset short - term economic stimulus . at the same time , high levels of debt relative to gross domestic product can constrain a country 's borrowing capacity . there are no signs that federal borrowing capacity will be exhausted in the short term . however , the consequences of exhausted fiscal space may be worth considering in designing the next stimulus package since it would increase both deficits and the debt .
since bitcoin was introduced a decade ago , about 2,100 cryptocurrencies have been developed . cryptocurrencies are digital representations of value that have no status as legal tender and are administered using distributed ledger technology , running on a network of independent , peer - to - peer computers . cryptocurrencies are controversial . some think they will revolutionize the international payments system for the better ; others are skeptical of the business model , calling it a scam . the interest and debate surrounding cryptocurrencies has led some central banks to examine whether the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could be used to create digital versions of fiat currencies , which would have legal status in their jurisdiction of issue . governments around the world are taking different approaches to cryptocurrencies and digital fiat currencies , an area of increasing focus for international organizations and forums underpinning the global economy . as congress considers issues related to digital currencies , including whether to regulate further the cryptocurrency industry , the approaches taken by other governments and international bodies may be of interest . national approaches to cryptocurrencies cryptocurrencies span borders and are international in nature , but governments around the world have responded differently to the proliferation of cryptocurrencies . three types of responses have generally taken shape . first , some governments , such as malta , singapore , and switzerland , are active cryptocurrency hubs ; they have been attracting and developing cryptocurrency industries in their countries . second , some governments , such as china , india , and south korea , have banned the use of cryptocurrencies or specific activities associated with cryptocurrencies . third , some governments , including many european countries and the united states , are seeking balance between financial innovation and risk - management through regulation of cryptocurrencies . national approaches to digital fiat currencies to date , one country , venezuela , which is mired in a serious economic crisis , has issued a digital fiat currency , and there are serious questions about the new currency 's success and operational viability . a few small countries are in the process of launching digital fiat currencies . some countries , including china and sweden , are researching the costs and benefits of these currencies , and iran and russia are considering them as a way to evade u.s. sanctions . many central banks in major economies , including in the united states and the eurozone , have argued against issuing a digital fiat currency at this time . international bodies ' engagement on digital currencies many international organizations and forums are examining the implications of cryptocurrencies and , in some cases , are starting to make policy recommendations . they have examined a range of issues , including the utility of digital currencies for improving the international payments systems , the possible threats digital currencies may or may not pose to international financial stability , the divergence of national - level cryptocurrency regulations and whether international regulatory coordination is desirable , how cryptocurrencies should be treated in bank prudential regulation , and how to adapt international recommendations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing in light of cryptocurrencies . possible questions for congress in november 2018 , the department of the treasury announced it is developing a report on cryptocurrency regulation , including a legislative framework for congress to consider in 2019. how do u.s. current regulations , and the proposed regulations when they are released , compare to other countries ' regulations ? . some governments are actively developing cryptocurrency industries . should the united states follow suit , or risk losing market share in the industry ? . alternatively , some governments are tightly restricting , or even banning , cryptocurrency activities to protect consumers . in the united states , do consumers have adequate protections in terms of cryptocurrencies ? . has the federal reserve adequately assessed the potential benefits and costs of developing a digital u.s. dollar relying on distributed ledger technology ? . how does the u.s. position on digital fiat currencies compare to other countries ' calculations ? . what are the potential future impacts on the role of the dollar as a reserve currency ? . what types of digital currency policies is the trump administration advocating at various international organizations ? . how do international recommendations and standards fit with u.s. regulations ? .
rule xvii , clause 4 , of the standing rules of the house of representatives describes a parliamentary mechanism whereby a member may call another member to order for the use of disorderly language . disorderly , or unparliamentary , remarks are a violation of house rules of decorum . this mechanism , which is referred to as `` words taken down , '' may be invoked during debate on the house floor , in the committee of the whole , or in the standing and select committees of the house . to call a member to order for allegedly disorderly remarks , a member would state the following : `` i demand that the gentleman 's / gentlewoman 's words be taken down . . this call to order is to occur immediately after the words are spoken . if the demand comes after additional debate or business , the presiding officer may rule that it is untimely . ( the presiding officer 's decision on timeliness , however , may be appealed . ) . the phrase taken down refers to the writing down of the words objected to so they may be read out loud by the house clerk . following the reading , the presiding officer will rule on whether the remarks are in order . in the moments between the formal demand that words be taken down and the clerk 's reading of the words , the member who made the allegedly disorderly remarks may seek unanimous consent to have them stricken from the congressional record . if the unanimous consent request is granted , the house may resume its business without the reading of the words or a ruling thereon . alternatively , the member who demanded that the words be taken down can withdraw the request . if neither occurs , then the clerk will read the words and the speaker or committee chair will rule on whether the words are in order , which is subject to an appeal . ( if the demand for words taken down occurs in the committee of the whole , the committee will rise and report the words back to the house , so the speaker can rule on the words . ) . when determining whether the words are unparliamentary , the speaker will consider the words themselves , as well as the context in which they were used , and base the ruling on house rules and precedents . rule xvii , clause 1 ( b ) , of the standing rules of the house prohibits members from engaging in `` personalities '' in debate , but the text of the rule does not state explicitly what language is unparliamentary . rather , house precedents include examples of words and phrases that were previously determined to be in order and those that were ruled out of order . on the house floor , the parliamentarian advises the speaker based on these precedents . the office of the parliamentarian is not responsible for providing procedural assistance during committee meetings , although the chair could attempt to consult with the parliamentarian in advance of or during such meetings . if the member 's words are ruled out of order , the words may be stricken from the congressional record by unanimous consent on the initiative of the presiding officer . the words may also be stricken by a motion , which means the house will vote on whether to strike the remarks . in addition , members whose words are determined to be unparliamentary may not be recognized to speak for the rest of the day ( even on yielded time ) unless the member is allowed to proceed in order by unanimous consent or a motion . they may , however , vote and demand the yeas and the nays . the demand for words to be taken down was invoked 170 times on the house floor or committee of the whole between january 1 , 1971 , and july 24 , 2019. in practice , when this demand occurs , the member being called to order is usually permitted to revise the words or to strike them from the congressional record before the clerk reads the words back to the house . therefore , the speaker does not rule on whether the remarks violate the rules of decorum . when there is a ruling , the speaker often states that the basis for the ruling is whether the words include a personal criticism of an identifiable person ( usually a member or the president ) .
for at least four decades , congress has been concerned about the coast guard 's ability to maintain an adequate staff of experienced marine safety personnel to ensure that vessels meet federal safety standards . the 2015 sinking of the u.s. - flag cargo ship el faro during a hurricane near the bahamas with the loss of 33 lives renewed attention to the coast guard 's persistent difficulty with hiring and training a marine safety workforce with technical knowledge of vessel construction and accident investigation , as the safety inspections of the vessel were found to have been inadequate . in the hamm alert maritime safety act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-265 ) , congress directed the coast guard to brief congressional committees of jurisdiction on its efforts to enhance its marine inspections staff . in the frank lobiondo coast guard authorization act of 2018 ( p.l . 115-282 ) , congress requested a report from the coast guard detailing the courses and other training a marine inspector must complete to be considered qualified , including any courses that have been dropped from the training curriculum in recent years . congress 's concern about the coast guard 's inspection staff comes at a time when the agency 's vessel inspection workload is increasing by about 50 % because towing vessels have been added to its responsibilities . additionally , congress has been increasing the agency 's role in fishing vessel safety . adding to the coast guard 's safety responsibilities is the construction of several liquefied natural gas ( lng ) export terminals as well as the increasing use of lng as ship fuel . vessel safety inspections are especially critical for the u.s. - flag fleet , like the el faro , because a majority of it is much older than the 15 to 20 years of age at which ships in the foreign - flag worldwide oceangoing fleet are typically scrapped . over half of the u.s. - flag commercial fleet is over 20 years old ; the el faro had been in service for 40 years . vessels that transport cargo or passengers domestically ( from one u.s. point to another u.s. point ) must be built in the united states , as required by the jones act . the comparatively high cost of domestic ship construction encourages ship owners to keep jones act vessels in service well beyond their normal retirement age . in general , older vessels are believed to have a higher risk of structural defects and to require more intensive inspection . currently , the coast guard 's marine inspection staff consists of 533 military and 138 civilian personnel , while its accident investigation staff consists of 120 military staff and 38 civilians . as a military organization , the coast guard frequently rotates its staff among various duty stations , so personnel may not develop the knowledge and experience required of a proficient marine inspector or investigator . a common perception inside the agency that marine safety is an area that retards promotion also may be thwarting efforts to boost this mission 's workforce . the coast guard recently has stated its intention to improve the quality of its inspection workforce and to make marine safety an attractive long - term career path by extending promotion potential . however , its recent statements are similar to statements made 10 years ago , when some members of congress advocated transferring the marine safety function to a civilian agency . it is unclear what the agency has accomplished over the last decade regarding its inspection workforce . government audits dating to 1979 have been consistently critical of the proficiency level of coast guard inspectors and accident investigators . reorganizing the marine safety function under a civilian agency , perhaps as an element of a larger reorganization of navigation functions in the federal government , might improve the quality of safety inspections and investigations , but other federal agencies with transportation - related safety inspection workforces have had similar issues with retaining experienced personnel .
under the u.s. constitution , the house of representatives has the power to formally charge a federal officer with wrongdoing , a process known as impeachment . the house impeaches an individual when a majority agrees to a house resolution containing explanations of the charges . the explanations in the resolution are referred to as `` articles of impeachment . . after the house agrees to impeach an officer , the role of the senate is to conduct a trial to determine whether the charged individual should be removed from office . removal requires a two - thirds vote in the senate . the house impeachment process generally proceeds in three phases : ( 1 ) initiation of the impeachment process ; ( 2 ) judiciary committee investigation , hearings , and markup of articles of impeachment ; and ( 3 ) full house consideration of the articles of impeachment . impeachment proceedings are usually initiated in the house when a member submits a resolution through the hopper ( in the same way that all house resolutions are submitted ) . a resolution calling for the impeachment of an officer will be referred to the judiciary committee ; a resolution simply authorizing an investigation of an officer will be referred to the rules committee . in either case , the committee could then report a privileged resolution authorizing the investigation . in the past , house committees , under their general investigatory authority , have sometimes sought information and researched charges against officers prior to the adoption of a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation . impeachment proceedings could also be initiated by a member on the floor . a member can offer an impeachment resolution as a `` question of the privileges of the house . . the house , when it considers a resolution called up this way , might immediately vote to refer it to the judiciary committee , leaving the resolution in the same status as if it had been submitted through the hopper . alternatively , the house might vote to table the impeachment resolution . the house could also vote directly on the resolution , but in modern practice , it has not chosen to approve articles of impeachment called up in this fashion . instead , the house has relied on the judiciary committee to first conduct an investigation , hold hearings , and report recommendations to the full house . committee consideration is therefore typically the second stage of the impeachment process . in recent decades , it has been more common than not that the judiciary committee used information provided from another outside investigation . the committee might create a task force or a subcommittee to review this material and collect any other information through subpoenas , depositions , and public hearings . impeachment investigations are governed by the standing rules of the house that govern all committee investigations , the terms of the resolution authorizing the investigation , and perhaps additional rules adopted by the committee specifically for the inquiry . if the committee determines that impeachment is warranted , it will mark up articles of impeachment using the same procedures followed for the markup of other legislation . if the judiciary committee reports a resolution impeaching a federal officer , that resolution qualifies for privileged consideration on the house floor ; its consideration is the third stage of the impeachment process . the resolution can be called up at the direction of the committee and considered immediately under the hour rule in the house . if called up this way , amendments could be precluded if a majority voted to order the previous question . a motion to recommit , with or without instructions , is in order but is not subject to debate . alternatively , the house might alter these procedures by unanimous consent to , for example , set a longer time for debate or to allow brief debate on a motion to recommit . a resolution reported from the rules committee could also be used to structure floor debate . if the house approves the impeachment resolution , it will appoint managers to present and argue its case against the federal officer in front of the senate .
over the years , the u.s. military has become reliant on precision - guided munitions ( pgms ) to execute military operations . pgms are used in ground , air , and naval operations . defined by the department of defense ( dod ) as `` [ a ] guided weapon intended to destroy a point target and minimize collateral damage , '' pgms can include air - and ship - launched missiles , multiple launched rockets , and guided bombs . these munitions typically use radio signals from the global positioning system ( gps ) , laser guidance , and inertial navigation systems ( ins ) âusing gyroscopesâto improve a weapon 's accuracy to reportedly less than 3 meters ( approximately 10 feet ) . precision munitions were introduced to military operations during world war ii ; however , they first demonstrated their utility operationally during the vietnam war and gained prominence in operation desert storm in 1991. since the 1990s , due in part to their ability to minimize collateral damage , pgms have become critical components in u.s. operations , particularly in afghanistan , iraq , and syria . the proliferation of anti - access / area denial ( a2 / ad ) systems is likely to increase the operational utility of pgms . in particular , peer competitors like china and russia have developed sophisticated air defenses and anti - ship missiles that increase the risk to u.s. forces entering and operating in these regions . using advanced guidance systems , pgms can be launched at long ranges to attack an enemy without risking u.s. forces . as a result , dod has argued it requires longer range munitions to meet these new threats . the air force , army , navy , and marine corps all use pgms . in fy2021 , the department of defense ( dod ) requested approximately $ 4.1 billion for more than 41,337 weapons in 15 munitions programs . dod projects requesting approximately $ 3.3 billion for 20,456 weapons in fy2022 , $ 3.9 billion for 23,306 weapons in fy2023 , $ 3.9 billion for 18,376 weapons in fy2024 , and $ 3.6 billion for 16,325 weapons in fy2025 . previously dod obligated $ 1.96 billion for 13,985 weapons in fy2015 , $ 2.98 billion for 35,067 weapons in fy2016 , $ 3.63 billion for 44,446 weapons in fy2017 , $ 5.05 billion for 68,988 weapons in fy2018 , and $ 4.3 billion in fy2019 for 60,62 munitions . in fy2020 , congress authorized $ 5.30 billion for 56,067 weapons . current pgm programs can be categorized as air - launched , ground - launched , or naval - launched . air - launched : paveway laser guided bomb , joint direct attack munition ( jdam ) , small diameter bomb , small diameter bomb ii , hellfire missile , joint air - to - ground missile , joint air - to - surface strike missile ( jassm ) , long range anti - ship missile ( lrasm ) , and advanced anti - radiation guided missile . ground - launched : guided multiple launch rocket system ( gmlrs ) , army tactical missile system ( atacms ) , and precision strike missile ( prsm ) ; naval pgms : tomahawk cruise missile , standard missile - 6 ( sm - 6 ) , and naval strike missile . congress may consider several issues regarding pgms , including planned procurement quantities and stockpile assessments , defense industrial base production capacity , development timelines , supply chain security , affordability and cost - effectiveness , and emerging factors that may affect pgm programs .
kosovo , a country in the western balkans with a predominantly albanian - speaking population , declared independence from serbia in 2008 , less than a decade after a brief but lethal war . it has since been recognized by about 100 countries . the united states and most european union ( eu ) member states recognize kosovo . serbia , russia , china , and various other countries ( including some eu member states ) do not . key issues for kosovo include the following : resuming talks with serbia . an eu - facilitated dialogue between kosovo and serbia , aimed at normalization of relations , stalled in 2018 when kosovo imposed tariffs on serbian goods in response to serbia 's efforts to undermine kosovo 's international legitimacy . despite u.s. and eu pressure , the parties have not resumed talks . on april 1 , 2020 , acting prime minister albin kurti conditionally lifted tariffs against serbian imports ; this step was praised by eu officials but drew u.s. criticism because of the government 's simultaneous pledge to gradually introduce measures to match serbian barriers to the movement of goods and people . government collapse . the governing coalition led by albin kurti of the self - determination party ( vetã « vendosje ) lost a vote of confidence in march 2020 , less than two months after it had formed . the outgoing government comprises two parties formerly in opposition , both of which had campaigned on an anti - corruption platform . among other factors , the collapse was attributed to divisions over managing relations with serbia amid u.s. pressure on the government to immediately lift tariffs against serbian imports , as well as to domestic political infighting . kosovo 's leaders disagree over how to proceed from the current political crisis . strengthening the rule of law . the victory of kurti 's vetã « vendosje in the october 2019 election partly reflected widespread voter dissatisfaction with corruption . weakness in the rule of law contributes to kosovo 's difficulties in attracting foreign investment and complicates the country 's efforts to combat transnational threats . relations with the united states . kosovo regards the united states as a key ally and security guarantor . kosovo receives the largest share of u.s. foreign assistance to the balkans , and the two countries cooperate on numerous security issues . the united states is the largest contributor of troops to the nato - led kosovo force ( kfor ) , which has contributed to security in kosovo since 1999. in 2019 , the trump administration appointed a special representative for the western balkans and a special presidential envoy for serbia and kosovo peace negotiations . these appointments are considered to reflect the administration 's interest in securing a comprehensive settlement between kosovo and serbia and may signal a potentially greater u.s. role in a process that the eu has largely facilitated to date . leaders in kosovo generally have welcomed greater u.s. engagement , but some observers expressed concern over reported u.s. pressure on the kurti government to lift tariffs on serbian goodsâincluding pausing some u.s. assistance to kosovoâand over perceived u.s. support for the no - confidence session that resulted in the march 2020 government collapse . u.s. officials maintain that the united states is committed to working with any government formed in compliance with constitutional processes . transatlantic cooperation . since the kosovo war ended in 1999 , the united states , the eu , and key eu member states have largely coordinated their efforts to promote regional stability in the western balkans , including efforts to normalize relations between kosovo and serbia . more recently , however , some observers have expressed concern that transatlantic coordination has weakened on some issues relating to the kosovo - serbia dialogue and to kosovo 's current political impasse . congress was actively involved in debates over the u.s. response to a 1998-1999 conflict in kosovo and subsequently supported kosovo 's declaration of independence . today , many members of congress continue to support kosovo through country - or region - specific hearings , congressional visits , and foreign assistance funding levels averaging around $ 50 million per year since 2015 .
the k - 12 teacher workforce is relatively largeâeach year , about 4 million teachers are employed in u.s. elementary and secondary schools . turnover in these schools is high relative to earlier periodsâabout 1 in 10 teachers left his or her job in 2018. this figure follows federal statistical trends that show a sizable growth in teacher attrition since the 1980s . teacher shortages and high turnover raise a number of recruitment and retention issues that may be of interest to policymakers . one of the more difficult issues involves a debate between observers who are concerned about an overall teacher shortage , and others who see it largely as a distributional problem where some schools have a relative surplus of teachers while other schools struggle with a persistent , unmet demand for qualified teachers . those in the former camp focus on policies that aim to improve the recruitment and retention in the teaching profession in general , while those in the latter camp focus on policies that target education funding to fill positions for certain hard - to - staff schools and / or subject areas . current federal policy addresses recruitment and retention . the higher education act ( hea ) authorizes grant support to institutions that prepare k - 12 teachers as well as financial aid to students interested in the teaching profession . title ii of the hea authorizes grants for improving teacher education programs , strengthening teacher recruitment efforts , and providing training for prospective teachers . title iv of the hea authorizes teacher education assistance for college and higher education ( teach ) grants to encourage students to prepare for a career in teaching and student loan forgiveness for teachers that remain in the classroom over a number of years . the hea was last comprehensively amended in 2008 by the higher education opportunity act ( heoa , p.l . 110-315 ) . congressional consideration of potentially reauthorizing the hea is ongoing , including the introduction of numerous bills to amend the portions of current law that address teacher recruitment and retention . issues that may arise as the reauthorization process unfolds include modifying the title ii grant partnership structure , targeting support to specific teacher shortage areas or non - instructional staff , expanding teacher preparation program accountability , reforming administration of the teach grant program , and expanding or consolidating teacher loan forgiveness programs .
the september 11 th victim compensation fund ( vcf ) provides cash benefits to certain persons whose health may have been affected by exposure to debris or toxic substances in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center , and the terrorist - related aircraft crash at shanksville , pa. congress created the original vcf shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks to provide compensation to persons injured and the families of persons killed in the attacks and their immediate aftermath . the original vcf closed in 2003. in 2011 , congress reopened the vcf to provide benefits to persons who responded to the terrorist attack sites , were involved in the cleanup of these sites , or lived in lower manhattan during the attacks . the reopened vcf was authorized through october 3 , 2016. however , the vcf was reauthorized in december 2015 ( p.l . 114-113 ) and july 2019 ( p.l . 116-34 ) . all vcf claims must be filed by october 1 , 2090. since its reopening , the vcf has awarded more than $ 5.5 billion to more than 23,000 claimants . there is no cap on the total vcf award amount , but there are limits on the amounts of individual awards for economic and noneconomic losses claimants suffered . the 2019 reauthorization legislation provides all necessary appropriations for vcf awards and administrative expenses through the end of fy2092 .
from the washington administration to the present , congress and the president have enacted 11 separate formal declarations of war against foreign nations in five different wars . each declaration has been preceded by a presidential request either in writing or in person before a joint session of congress . the reasons cited in justification for the requests have included armed attacks on united states territory or its citizens and threats to united states rights or interests as a sovereign nation . congress and the president have also enacted authorizations for the use of force rather than formal declarations of war . such measures have generally authorized the use of force against either a named country or unnamed hostile nations in a given region . in most cases , the president has requested the authority , but congress has sometimes given the president less than what he asked for . not all authorizations for the use of force have resulted in actual combat . both declarations and authorizations require the signature of the president in order to become law . in contrast to an authorization , a declaration of war in itself creates a state of war under international law and legitimates the killing of enemy combatants , the seizure of enemy property , and the apprehension of enemy aliens . while a formal declaration was once deemed a necessary legal prerequisite to war and was thought to terminate diplomatic and commercial relations and most treaties between the combatants , declarations have fallen into disuse since world war ii . the laws of war , such as the hague and geneva conventions , apply to circumstances of armed conflict whether or not a formal declaration or authorization was issued . with respect to domestic law , a declaration of war automatically triggers many standby statutory authorities conferring special powers on the president with respect to the military , foreign trade , transportation , communications , manufacturing , alien enemies , etc . in contrast , no standby authorities appear to be triggered automatically by an authorization for the use of force , although the executive branch has argued , with varying success , that the authorization to use force in response to the terrorist attacks of 2001 provided a statutory exception to certain statutory prohibitions . most statutory standby authorities do not expressly require a declaration of war to be actualized but can be triggered by a declaration of national emergency or simply by the existence of a state of war ; however , courts have sometimes construed the word `` war '' in a statute as implying a formal declaration , leading congress to enact clarifying amendments in two cases . declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force waive the time limitations otherwise applicable to the use of force imposed by the war powers resolution . this report provides historical background on the enactment of declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force and analyzes their legal effects under international and domestic law . it also sets forth their texts in two appendices . the report includes an extensive listing and summary of statutes that are triggered by a declaration of war , a declaration of national emergency , and / or the existence of a state of war . the report concludes with a summary of the congressional procedures applicable to the enactment of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of force and to measures under the war powers resolution . the report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed various issues concerning the role of certain power marketing administrations ( pma ) and other federal agencies in restructuring electricity markets , focusing on : whether the government operates them and the related electric power assets in a businesslike manner ; and options that congress and other policymakers can pursue to address concerns about the pmas ' role in restructuring markets and about their management . gao noted that : although federal laws and regulations generally require that the pmas recover the full costs of building , operating , and maintaining the federal power plants and transmission assets , in some cases federal statues and the department of energy 's rules are ambiguous about or prohibit the recovery of certain costs ; as gao reported in september 1997 , for fiscal years 1992 through 1996 , the federal government incurred a net cost of $ 1.5 billion from its involvement in the electricity - related activities of the southeastern , southwestern , and western area power administrations ; the $ 1.5 billion was the amount by which the full costs of providing electric power exceeded the revenues from the sale of power ; the availability of federal power plants to generate electricity is below that of nonfederal plants because the federal plants are aging and because the federal planning and budgeting processes , as implemented , do not always ensure that funds are available to make repairs when needed ; the resulting declines in performance decrease the marketability of federal power ; to mitigate these funding delays , the bureau of reclamation , army corps of engineers , pmas and their preference customers have negotiated or are negotiating agreements whereby customers pay for needed repairs in advance ; the net cost to the treasury and the decreased generating availability of the federal power plants -- when combined with the competitive pressures on all electricity suppliers to decrease their rates and the need to recoup some federal hydropower projects ' environmental costs -- create varying degrees of risk that some of the federal investment in certain hydropower plants and facilities will not be repaid ; although the recovery of most of the federal investment in southeastern 's , southwestern 's , and western 's hydropower - related facilities is relatively secure , up to $ 1.4 billion out of about $ 7.2 billion of the federal investment in the electricity - related assets of these pmas is at some risk of nonrecovery ; and three general options are available for the bureau , the corps , southeastern , southwestern , and western to address their roles in emerging restructured electricity markets : the bureau and the corps could continue generating and the pmas could continue marketing power as in the past ; the current ownership structure could be maintained while improving how the federal assets are managed and operated ; and the federal government could divest the pmas ; the pmas and the generating assets ; or the pmas , the generating assets , and the dam reservoirs .
in international trade , the term most - favored - nation ( mfn ) treatment has a meaning atvariance with what it appears to mean : the expression means equal -- rather than exclusivelyfavorable -- treatment and is often used interchangeably with `` nondiscriminatory . . to make thisdistinction clearer and avoid a possibly misleading interpretation of the most - favored - nation term , legislation was enacted in 1998 to replace it in u.s. law with the term `` normal trade relations , '' orntr . in this report , both terms are used interchangeably with `` nondiscriminatory . . the unitedstates accords general mfn treatment as a matter of international obligation as well statutory policyto all trading partners ; however , mfn tariff treatment of several countries has been suspended underspecific legislation . virtually all such suspensions , initially applied to 21 countries or politicalentities , took place under the mandate of the trade agreements extension act of 1951 , and twomore under country - specific legislation . mfn tariff treatment of countries suspended under the 1951law can be restored and maintained in effect for one - year periods by using the procedure providedunder title iv of the trade act of 1974 for such restoration to `` nonmarket economy '' ( nme ) countries . under this procedure , an nme country needs to conclude with the united states a tradeagreement containing a reciprocal mfn clause , and be in compliance with the criteria of thejackson - vanik ( j - v ) freedom - of - emigration provision of that act . the two countries whose mfnstatus was suspended by country - specific legislation could -- and did -- have it restored bypresidential action under conditions specified in the suspending law . trade agreements with nme countries must be approved by joint resolution , and aretriennially self - renewable , but their renewal is also subject to presidential confirmation . to maintainin force the compliance with the j - v criteria ( and the mfn status ) , such compliance must be eitherdetermined semiannually , or waived annually , by the secretary of state , and such determinations orwaivers are annually subject to possible disapproval by joint resolution . repeated past legislativeaction to disapprove some waivers , particularly those for china , has been unsuccessful and ntrtreatment contingent on a waiver has invariably remained in effect . permanent restoration of ntrstatus of any country generally requires specific legislation . of the 29 countries , today 's successors of countries or areas originally subject to the 1951suspension , 15 had their permanent ntr status restored by specific legislation ( five directly and tenafter a period of conditional restoration under the jackson - vanik amendment ) , one ( poland ) by thepresident under then existing statutory authority , and one ( east germany ) administratively throughunification with west germany . the status of seven of them is still temporary , subject to thedetermination of full - compliance with the jackson - vanik amendment , and of three of them underthe jackson - vanik waiver provision . two countries ( cuba , and north korea ) are denied ntr statusaltogether . the ntr status of two countries , suspended by individual legislation , has been restoredpermanently by presidential action as authorized by the suspending legislation . this report will be updated as warranted .
the pacific salmon treaty ( pst ) of 1985 requires the united states and canada to develop periodic bilateral agreements to implement the pst 's conservation and harvest - sharing principles . beginning in 1993 , long - standing disputes prevented such an agreement from being concluded . on june 30 , 1999 , after many years of heated diplomatic struggles , u.s. and canadian officials reached a new comprehensive agreement . the 1999 agreement ( 1 ) established abundance - based fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst ; ( 2 ) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation , improve fishery management , and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts ; and ( 3 ) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation , improve the scientific basis for salmon management , and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission ( psc ) . annex iv to the 1999 agreement outlines , in detail , the fishery regimes to be followed by canada and the united states in cooperatively managing the six species of anadromous pacific salmon and trout . before it expired at the end of 2008 , the terms of annex iv were renegotiated . the 1999 conservation and harvest - sharing agreement was of interest to congress for several reasons . most notably , a congressional appropriation of $ 140 million was required to establish the agreement 's two regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds . provisions of the 1999 agreement were implemented thorough additional authorizing language and amendment of the pacific salmon treaty act ( 16 u.s.c . §§3631 , et seq . ) . the 1999 agreement under the pst regime has been implemented in accordance with existing u.s. laws pertaining to salmon conservation ( e.g . , magnuson - stevens fishery conservation and management act ; endangered species act ) . in addition , the agreement 's implementation determines the quantity of fish available for commercial , recreational , and subsistence fisheries as well as indian treaty allocations . many complex issues continue to challenge the psc and the parties ; several of these were addressed in the 2008 renegotiation of the annex iv fisheries regimes . some of the issues associated with the renegotiation included the fishery regime for chinook salmon found in chapter 3 of annex iv . the problems arising from the status ( e.g . , u.s. endangered and threatened species listing ) of certain runs of chinook salmon in washington , oregon , idaho , and perhaps british columbia posed particular challenges for the negotiators . additional concerns arose from canada over increasing bycatch of chinook salmon by the u.s. pollock fishery in the bering sea , as many of these fish are bound for the yukon river , including canadian tributaries . this report provides historical background about the pst , discusses issues that created difficulties in the regime , summarizes the 1999 accord , and analyzes issues considered during the renegotiation of annex iv . the 111th congress may conduct oversight of the renegotiated agreement and its implications for u.s. salmon management .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the environmental protection agency 's ( epa ) progress in closing completed grants and contracts , focusing on : epa 's efforts to close out inactive grants and contracts ; the progress that epa has made in reducing the number of inactive grants and contracts , the number of remaining inactive grants and contracts , and the dates by which they are expected to be closed out ; and the amount of unliquidated obligations for inactive grants and contracts . gao noted that : over the last 8 years , epa has taken several initiatives to reduce the backlogs of inactive grants and contracts needing closeout ; in 1992 , epa developed a policy specifying procedures for closing out nonconstruction grants , and in 1998 , the agency developed a strategy for eliminating the existing backlog of inactive nonconstruction grants and preventing a future backlog ; however , closeout procedures and strategies for nonconstruction grants were not consistently followed , and strategies at the regional level frequently did not include specific actions for implementation ; epa also developed automated systems to improve the monitoring of the nonconstruction grant closeout process ; in 1990 and 1997 , epa developed strategies to reduce the backlog of wastewater treatment construction grants ; in fiscal year ( fy ) 1994 , epa established goals for closing out a specific number of inactive contracts ; epa has made significant progress in closing out inactive grants and contracts , but a considerable number remain to be closed ; in 1996 , the agency had a backlog of nearly 18,000 nonconstruction grants , but by june 1998 , the backlog was reduced to approximately 4,100 ; epa estimated in 1996 that the backlog of nonconstruction grants would be eliminated by july 2000 ; with closeouts progressing at the current rate , it is likely that this goal will be attained ; the number of inactive wastewater treatment construction grants needing closeout was about 500 as of march 1998- - reduced from about 5,900 at the end of fy 1990 ; while the construction grant backlog was initially projected to be eliminated by the end of fy 1997 , this goal was not attained , and in december 1996 , epa revised its projection to eliminate the backlog by 2002 ; recent estimates from epa 's offices implementing the closeout strategy for construction grants indicate that this goal is unlikely to be attained ; in march 1993 , epa had approximately 2,000 inactive contracts needing closeout , and by august 1998 , that number had been reduced to 1,028 ; significant amounts of unliquidated obligations remain for inactive grants and contracts and could potentially be allocated for other epa projects and programs ; the unliquidated obligations for construction and nonconstruction grants totalled about $ 612.1 million , and for about $ 423.8 million of this total amount , there are no statutory time restrictions on the use of funds ; and therefore , a large portion of these funds is potentially available for recovery and could be used for other approved projects .
this report tracks action by the 106th congress on fy2001 appropriations for the departments of commerce , justice , andstate , the judiciary , and other related agencies ( often referred to as cjs appropriations ) . p.l . 106-113 appropriated $ 39.6 billion for these agencies for fy2000 . president clinton 's fy2001 budget requested $ 39.6billion forthese agencies . on june 14 , 2000 , the house appropriations committee approved its version of the cjsappropriations bill ( h.r . 4690 ) it recommended funding totaling $ 37.4 billion - $ 2.2 billion below the president 's request and $ 2.2 billion below the fy2000 appropriation . the house - passed bill on june 26 , approved the same overall fundingtotalrecommended by the committee . on july 18 , 2000 , the senate appropriations committee approved total fundingof $ 36.7billion - about $ 700 million below the house version and $ 2.9 billion below both the president 's request and theactualfy2000 appropriation . on october 27 , 2000 , congress approved total funding of $ 40.0 billion - about $ 400 millionaboveboth president 's request and the total enacted for fy2000 ( h.r . 5548 ) . the measure was signed into law bythe president on december 21 , 2000 ( p.l . 106-553 ) . the major cjs appropriations issues and concerns that received attention in both the senate and the house include thefollowing . department of justice : building more prisons ; extending the 1994 crime act fundingauthorization beyondseptember 30 , 2000 ; increasing funding for drug - related efforts among the department of justice ( doj ) agencies ; increasing funding for community law enforcement ; combating cybercrime ; changing the focus and levels ofappropriationsfor doj 's office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ; providing funding for programs that would reducegunand youth violence ; funding of doj 's legal action against the tobacco industry ; reducing pending caseloads inimmigration - related claims , particularly green card and naturalization applications ; meeting the statutory mandatethat theborder patrol be increased by 1,000 agents in fy2001 , and accounting for the shortfall in hiring in fy1999 ; determiningthe level of detention capacity necessary to comply with the statutory mandate that certain criminal aliens bedetained untildeported ; and restructuring ins internally as proposed by the administration or dismantling or restructuring theagency bylegislation . department of commerce : the progress made in streamlining and downsizing departmentprograms ; implementation of the decennial census including followup operations ; federal financial support of industrialtechnologydevelopment programs ; monitoring foreign compliance with trade agreements and u.s. trade laws ; andimplementing newwhite house environmental initiatives at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . departmentof state : improving embassy security through a doubling of funding as well as a request for an advance appropriationto cover theperiod fy2002 to fy2005 . the judiciary : whether the salaries of judges and justices should receivea cost - of - livingincrease and whether a statutory ban on judges receiving honoraria should be lifted . other related agencies : adequacy offunding levels for the legal services corporation , small business administration , and the equal employmentopportunity commission . key policy staff division abbreviations : a = american law ; g & f = government and finance ; rsi = resources ; science , and industrydivision , dsp = domestic social policy division ; ftd = foreign affairs , defense , and trade .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the department of energy 's ( doe ) progress in implementing performance - based contracting at its national laboratories , focusing on : the status of performance - based contracting in doe 's national laboratory contracts ; and doe 's efforts to determine the impact of performance - based contracting . gao noted that : doe 's use of performance - based contracting for its laboratories is in a state of transition ; while all laboratory contracts gao examined had some performance - based features , gao found wide variance in the number of performance measures and the types of fees negotiated ; about half of the 18 laboratory contracts have performance fees to encourage superior performance -- a major goal of performance - based contracting ; most of the remaining laboratory contracts are still based on doe 's traditional fixed - fee arrangement in which the fees are paid regardless of performance ; doe has not evaluated the impact of performance - based contracting on its laboratory contractors and , as a result , does not know if this new form of contracting is achieving the intended results of improved performance and lower costs ; specifically , doe has not determined whether giving higher fees to encourage superior performance by its laboratory contractors is advantageous to the government , although gao recommended in 1994 that doe develop criteria for measuring the costs and benefits to the government of using higher fees ; fees for the laboratories totalled over $ 100 million for fiscal year 1998 ; while the contractors were unable to cite measurable benefits achieved by switching to performance - based contracting , they support its goals ; and the main benefits from performance - based contracting cited by laboratory contractors was that it has helped doe clarify what it expects from the contractors and that it has improved communication .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the minerals management service 's ( mms ) efforts to revise its regulations for valuing oil from federal leases , focusing on : the information used by mms to justify the need for revising its oil valuation regulations ; how mms has addressed concerns expressed by the oil industry and states in developing these regulations ; and the feasibility of the federal government 's taking its oil and gas royalties in kind , as indicated by existing studies and programs . gao noted that : in justifying the need to revise its oil valuation regulations , mms relied heavily on the findings and recommendations of an interagency task force -- composed of representatives from mms and the departments of commerce , energy , justice , and the interior -- assembled in 1994 by interior to study the value of oil produced from federal leases in california ; the task force concluded that the major oil companies ' use of posted prices in california to calculate federal royalties was inappropriate and recommended that the federal oil valuation regulations be revised ; mms subsequently determined that in other parts of the country as well , posted prices should not be used as the basis to calculate royalties on oil from federal leases ; beginning in 1995 , mms solicited public comments on the proposed regulations in five federal register notices ; it solicited comments in each notice and revised its proposed regulations three times in response to the comments received ; however , the agency did not agree with all the comments it received and in these cases provided reasons for not incorporating the suggested changes , noting that it planned to seek input on this issue through other means ; in total , the agency asked for comments on 39 major issues and received 183 letters from states , representatives of the oil industry , and other parties ; on its most recent revision of the proposed regulations , the agency received 34 comments but has not yet publicly addressed them ; information from studies of royalties in kind , as well as specific royalty - in - kind programs operated by various entities , indicates that it would not be feasible for the federal government to take its oil and gas royalties in kind except under certain conditions ; these conditions include having relatively easy access to pipelines to transport the oil and gas , leases that produce relatively large volumes of oil and gas , competitive arrangements for processing gas , and expertise in marketing oil and gas ; however , these conditions are currently lacking for the federal government and for most federal leases ; and specifically , the federal government does not have relatively easy access to pipelines , has thousands of leases that produce relatively low volumes , has many gas leases for which competitive processing arrangements do not exist , and has limited experience in oil and gas marketing .
data mining has become one of the key features of many homeland security initiatives . often used as a means for detecting fraud , assessing risk , and product retailing , data mining involves the use of data analysis tools to discover previously unknown , valid patterns and relationships in large data sets . in the context of homeland security , data mining can be a potential means to identify terrorist activities , such as money transfers and communications , and to identify and track individual terrorists themselves , such as through travel and immigration records . while data mining represents a significant advance in the type of analytical tools currently available , there are limitations to its capability . one limitation is that although data mining can help reveal patterns and relationships , it does not tell the user the value or significance of these patterns . these types of determinations must be made by the user . a second limitation is that while data mining can identify connections between behaviors and / or variables , it does not necessarily identify a causal relationship . successful data mining still requires skilled technical and analytical specialists who can structure the analysis and interpret the output . data mining is becoming increasingly common in both the private and public sectors . industries such as banking , insurance , medicine , and retailing commonly use data mining to reduce costs , enhance research , and increase sales . in the public sector , data mining applications initially were used as a means to detect fraud and waste , but have grown to also be used for purposes such as measuring and improving program performance . however , some of the homeland security data mining applications represent a significant expansion in the quantity and scope of data to be analyzed . some efforts that have attracted a higher level of congressional interest include the terrorism information awareness ( tia ) project ( now - discontinued ) and the computer - assisted passenger prescreening system ii ( capps ii ) project ( now - canceled and replaced by secure flight ) . other initiatives that have been the subject of congressional interest include the multi - state anti - terrorism information exchange ( matrix ) , the able danger program , the automated targeting system ( ats ) , and data collection and analysis projects being conducted by the national security agency ( nsa ) . as with other aspects of data mining , while technological capabilities are important , there are other implementation and oversight issues that can influence the success of a project 's outcome . one issue is data quality , which refers to the accuracy and completeness of the data being analyzed . a second issue is the interoperability of the data mining software and databases being used by different agencies . a third issue is mission creep , or the use of data for purposes other than for which the data were originally collected . a fourth issue is privacy . questions that may be considered include the degree to which government agencies should use and mix commercial data with government data , whether data sources are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed , and possible application of the privacy act to these initiatives . it is anticipated that congressional oversight of data mining projects will grow as data mining efforts continue to evolve . this report will be updated as events warrant .
on june 27 , the administration submitted an amended fiscal year 2002 defense budget request to congress . the request totaled $ 343.5 billion in funding for the national defense budget function , $ 32.9 billion above the amount originally enacted for fy2001 , an 11 % increase . the total includedfunding for the department of defense and for defense - related activities of the department of energyand other agencies . both house and senate versions of the dod appropriations bill provided thetotal for national defense that the administration requested . to accommodate that level , congressadjusted limitations in the 1997 balanced budget act and set aside provisions in this year'sconcurrent budget resolution that were designed to protect the social security surplus . with the onset of a recession last spring , along with higher defense spending and additional federal spending in response to the terrorist attacks , and lower revenues due to the tax cut , thegovernment is expected to run a deficit as well as use all of the surplus generated by social securityrevenues . with the destruction of the world trade center and the extensive damage to the pentagonby terrorists on september 11th , congressional concerns shifted from whether the overall federalbudget could accommodate higher defense expenditures without spending the budget surplus toadding funding for defense programs that combat terrorism . funding to aid the victims and provide for recovery from the attacks , for the ongoing conflict in afghanistan , and for other programs to combat terrorism , was approved in the $ 40 billionemergency terrorism response supplemental appropriations act ( p.l . 107-38 ) that passed congressseptember 14 , 2001. of that total , dod receives $ 17.5 billion of the total funding in the emergencyterrorism response supplemental , about 44 % of the total ( see p.l . 107-117 and h.rept . 107-350 ) with about 56 % going to other agencies . allocation of half of the $ 40 billion was included in p.l.107-117 / h.r . 3338 , the fy2002 dod appropriations act , which was signed by thepresident on january 10 , 2002. although there had been broad bipartisan support for adding funds for recovery and response to the september 11 terrorism attacks , sharp differences emerged about whether the total amountwas sufficient and whether the allocations matched the most critical priorities , particularly for newyork and other homeland security needs . the president , however , threatened to veto any spendingmeasure this year that went beyond the $ 40 billion . faced with this threat , both the house and thesenate rejected proposals to add more emergency funding to h.r . 3338 when theypassed the bill . instead , within the $ 20 billion total that was acceptable to the president , theconference bill shifts $ 3.4 billion of the $ 7.3 billion funds allocated to defense by the administrationto homeland security and recovery of new york . the conference version of the national defense authorization act for fy2002 was passed by the house and the senate on december 13 , 2001 , and signed by the president on december 28 , 2001 ( p.l . 107-107 / s. 1438 , h.rept . 107-333 ) . the act provides $ 343.3 billion as requestedby the administration and authorizes another round of base closures but delays the date to 2005 , settling the chief issue in contention . key policy staff abbreviations : fdt = foreign affairs , defense , and trade division g & f = government and finance division rsi = resources , science , and industry divisio .
gao reviewed the results of federal and state inspections of mexican trucks entering the united states in 1996 , focusing on : actions by the federal government and border states to increase truck safety enforcement at the border ; and the federal enforcement strategy to ensure that trucks from mexico comply with safety standards when entering the united states . gao noted that : from january through december 1996 , federal and state officials conducted more than 25,000 inspections of trucks from mexico ; on average each month , about 45 percent of the vehicles were placed out of service for serious safety violations , such as for having substandard tires or for being loaded unsafely ; this rate compares unfavorably to the 28 percent out - of - service rate for u.s. trucks inspected across the united states in fiscal year 1995 ; however , because inspectors target for inspection those vehicles and drivers that appear to have safety deficiencies , their selections are not random ; as a result , the out - of - service rates may not necessarily reflect the general condition of all vehicles ; although border inspection officials believe that trucks from mexico are safer than they were in late 1995 , the monthly out - of - service rates for trucks from mexico in 1996 ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent , with no consistent trend ; the border states of arizona , california , and texas have increased their capability to inspect trucks at major border locations ; collectively , the three states had 93 state truck inspectors assigned to border crossing locations as of january 1997 ; in addition , the u.s. department of transportation ( dot ) approved 13 new temporary positions ( 2-year appointments ) to place federal safety inspectors at major border crossing locations ; california , with about 24 percent of the truck traffic from mexico , opened two large permanent inspection facilities ; it has the most rigorous inspection program , with the goal of inspecting , at least once every 90 days , every truck entering the state from mexico ; while both texas and arizona , collectively with more than three - quarters of the truck traffic from mexico , have more than doubled the number of inspectors at border crossing locations , their efforts are less comprehensive ; under a broad strategy to help create a `` compliance mind - set '' for mexican trucks crossing into u.s. commercial zones , dot has undertaken a number of activities to promote truck safety ; in february 1997 , dot announced that its program that provides grants for statewide safety enforcement activities will incorporate performance - based goals to increase truck and driver safety ; and also , in march 1997 , dot submitted a legislative proposal to the congress as part of the reauthorization of the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act that would incorporate this initiative .
this report provides an overview of global foreign direct investment in the people 's republic of china , examines its effects on the chinese economy , surveys u.s. fdi in china , and includes adiscussion of policy implications for the united states . china , by far , is the largest recipient of fdiamong emerging economies with an inflow of $ 52.7 billion in 2002 and 424,196 foreign - affiliatedfirms operating in china representing paid - in foreign investment of $ 448.0 billion . these firmsaccount for about half of china 's exports and imports . nearly 1,500 u.s. companies from 41 stateshave direct investments of $ 10 to $ 34 billion in china . for the u.s. congress , foreign direct investment in china entails both oversight and regulatory issues . some questions with respect to this investment are : ( 1 ) the extent to which fdi iscontributing to china 's economic growth and technology development , ( 2 ) the extent to which u.s.fdi in china is contributing to the u.s. trade deficit , ( 3 ) whether fdi inflows into china come atthe expense of flows into other countries , ( 4 ) how fdi is affecting security concerns , and ( 5 ) whetherfdi affects the export of sensitive technology to china . foreign direct investment has contributed about 13 % to china 's economic growth , and most of china 's modern technology , particularly in electronics , has been imported . with respect to trade , there is little doubt that the large surplus in china 's trade has been generated largely by the surge inits exports of foreign brand - name manufactures often made in foreign - affiliated factories . as muchas 80 to 90 % of certain high technology exports originate from foreign affiliated firms there . interms of the u.s. trade deficit with china , american companies there do export some of their outputback to the american market , but most is sold in china . china has been attracting some fdi flowsthat otherwise could have gone to other developing countries . in essence , china 's gain may be theirloss . in terms of security , the $ 20 to $ 34 billion in u.s. fdi in china combined with $ 68 billion from taiwan , and some $ 300 billion from elsewhere is changing the calculus for hostilities and creatinggroups with a strong interest in stability both within china and between china and the united states , taiwan , and other potential adversaries . foreign direct investment in china affects securityprimarily through three avenues : its contribution to economic power , economic interests , and technology transfers . the more china grows , the more funds it is able to provide to its military andattain big - power status in the world . with respect to economic interests , foreign companies in chinacan serve both as hostages for beijing and important pressure groups that can pursue their interestsin maintaining stability with both beijing and their home governments . with respect to sensitivetechnologies , in the u.s. case , it does not appear that prohibited u.s. technologies have beentransferred through foreign affiliated companies , although the technologies in the electronics andaviation industries that have been transferred do have dual civilian and military uses . such transfersare controlled by export control regimes . the highly publicized cases of satellite technology beingallegedly illegally transferred to china involved direct transfers from u.s. corporations to chinesecompanies . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the south florida ecosystem restoration initiative , focusing on : how much and for what purposes federal funding was provided for the restoration of the south florida ecosystem from fiscal year ( fy ) 1993 through fy 1999 ; and how well the restoration effort is being coordinated and managed . gao noted that : on the basis of the data gao obtained from the 5 primary federal departments and agencies participating in the initiative , gao estimates that over $ 1.2 billion in federal funds was provided from fy 1993 through fy 1999 ; the key restoration activities undertaken by the federal agencies were : land acquisition ; the management of federally - owned facilities or natural resources , and a national marine sanctuary ; infrastructure projects ; and science - related activities ; over 75 percent of the federal expenditures during this 6-year period have been made by agencies within the department of the interior and by the u.s. army corps of engineers ; the federal funding provided to date represents only a down payment ; while no official cost projection for the total restoration effort has been made , a major component , the implementation of the central and southern florida project comprehensive review study , referred to as the restudy , is estimated to cost an additional $ 7.8 billion ; the restudy is designed to substantially increase the amount of water that is delivered to natural areas while enhancing agricultural and urban water supplies ; according to the south florida ecosystem restoration task force 's executive director , at least $ 2 billion beyond the $ 7.8 billion will be needed to complete the restoration effort ; this money will be used to acquire additional lands , construct other infrastructure projects , and eradicate exotic plant species ; the task force is responsible for coordinating the participating entities ' implementation of the initiative ; however , a strategic plan that clearly lays out how the initiative will be accomplished and includes quantifiable goals and performance measures has not yet been developed ; the task force is a coordinating body , not a decisionmaking body , and thus is limited in its ability to manage and make decisions for the overall restoration effort ; as gao 's review of two projects integral to the restoration effort indicates , even with coordination , the federal and state agencies involved are unable to agree on components of these projects ; their inability to agree has contributed to delays and cost overruns ; and given the scope and complexity of the initiative and the difficulties that have already been encountered , additional delays and cost overruns are likely to occur , and the participants ' ability to accomplish the initiative 's overall goals is at risk .
pursuant to a legislative requirement , gao provided a final report on aspects of the small business innovation research ( sbir ) program , focusing on : agencies ' adherence to statutory funding requirements ; agencies ' audits of extramural ( external ) research and development ( r & d ) budgets ; the effect of the application review process and funding cycles on award recipients ; the extent of companies ' project activity after receiving sbir funding and agencies ' techniques to foster commercialization ; the number of multiple - award recipients and the extent of their project - related activity after receiving sbir funding ; the occurrence of funding for single - proposal awards ; participation by women - owned businesses and socially and economically disadvantaged businesses ; sbir 's promotion of the critical technologies ; the extent to which foreign firms benefit from the results of sbir ; and the geographical distribution of sbir awards . gao noted that : the agencies ' sbir officials reported that they have adhered to the requirements that preclude them from using sbir finds to pay for the administrative costs of the program ; the program officials also believe that they are adhering to statutory funding levels for the program ; however , some said that they are uncertain whether the agencies are correctly adhering to the requirements for establishing their extramural research budgets ; only two of the five agencies that gao reviewed have conducted audits of their extramural research budgets ; in 1997 , the office of inspector general at the national science foundation audited the agency 's extramural budget and found that it contained over $ 100 million of unallowable costs ; while most of the sbir officials gao interviewed said that neither the application review process nor current funding cycles have had an adverse effect on award recipients ' financial status or ability to commercialize their ideas , some recipients have said that any interruption in funding awards , for whatever reason , affects them negatively ; the companies responding to gao 's and the department of defense 's ( dod ) surveys reported that approximately 50 percent of their projects had sales of products or services related to the research or received additional developmental funding after receiving sbir funding ; the number of companies receiving multiple awards , defined here as those phase i award recipients that also received 15 or more phase ii awards in the preceding 5 years , grew from 10 companies in 1989 to 17 in 1996 ; gao found that the funding of single - proposal awards was rare ; all of the agencies gao examined reported that they engaged in activities to foster the participation of women - owned businesses or socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses ; all of the agencies ' sbir officials gao interviewed felt that the listings of critical technologies are used in developing their respective research topics or that the research being conducted falls within one of the two lists ; gao found little evidence of foreign firms , or u.s. firms with substantial foreign ownership interests , benefiting from technology or products developed as a direct result of sbir - funded research ; sbir awards are concentrated in the states of california and massachusetts ; however , every state received at least two awards ; and previous studies have linked the concentration of awards to local characteristics , such as the prevalence of small high - tech firms .
the interior and related agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies and programs in four separate federal departments as well as numerous smaller agencies and diverseprograms . the bill includes funding for the interior department except the bureau of reclamation , but only segments of the funding of the other three departments , agriculture , energy , and health andhuman services . on february 1 , 1999 , president clinton submitted his fy2000 budget to congress . the fy2000 request for interior and related agencies totaled $ 15.266 billion compared to the $ 14.298billion enacted for fy1999 ( p.l . 105-277 ) , an increase of almost $ 1 billion . the administration alsoproposed $ 579 million for department of interior agencies as part of the $ 1 billion lands legacyinitiative . the senate appropriations committee reported the fy2000 interior appropriations bill ( s. 1292 , s.rept . 106-99 ) on june 28 , 1999 , and the house appropriations committeereported its version of the bill ( h.r . 2466 , h.rept . 106-222 ) on july 2 , 1999. thecommittee - approved levels were $ 14.058 billion in the senate and $ 14.105 billion in the house , adifference of $ 46.7 million . on july 15 , 1999 , the house passed h.r . 2466 by a voteof 377-47 , providing $ 13.935 billion in fy2000 funding . on september 23 , 1999 , the senate passedits version of h.r . 2466 by a vote of 89-10 , providing $ 14.056 billion for fy2000 . the conference report ( h.r . 2466 , h.rept . 106-406 ) was agreed to by both the house and senate on october 21 , 1999. it provided a total of $ 14.534 billion ; after scorekeepingadjustments , the amount was $ 14.565 billion ( including $ 57.4 million in mandatory funding ) . thetotals included $ 68 million of emergency funding for the united mine workers of americacombined benefit fund . however , this conference agreement was not sent to the president . instead , following renegotiations , the house and senate incorporated the five remaining appropriations measures into a single measure ( h.r . 3194 , h.rept . 106-479 ) , whichinitially provided funding only for the district of columbia . the omnibus measure passed the houseon november 18 , 1999 , and the senate on november 19 , 1999. the `` consolidated appropriationsact for fy2000 '' was enacted into law on november 29 , 1999 ( p.l . 106-113 ) . the interiorappropriations portion of the consolidated measure also was introduced as a separate bill ( h.r . 3423 ) , which the consolidated measure enacted by cross - reference . theconsolidated measure contained a total interior appropriation of $ 14.928 billion ; after scorekeepingadjustments , the total was $ 14.959 . these amounts , and others in this report , do not reflect thegovernment - wide cut of 0.38 % in discretionary appropriations for fy2000 that was required by theomnibus appropriations measure . before the consolidated appropriations measure was signed intolaw , a total of seven measures providing continuing appropriations for interior ( and otherappropriations measures ) had been enacted . these continuing resolutions covered october 1 , 1999 , through december 2 , 1999. key policy staff division abbreviations : dsp = domestic social policy ; g & f = government and finance ; rsi =resources , science , and industry .
expensing is the most accelerated form of depreciation . section 179 of the internal revenue code allows a taxpayer to expense ( or deduct as a current rather than a capital expense ) up to $ 1 million of the total cost of new and used qualified depreciable assets it buys and places in service in 2018 , within certain limits . firms unable to claim this allowance may recover the cost of qualified assets over longer periods , using the depreciation schedules from sections 167 or 168. while the section 179 expensing allowance is not expressly targeted at smaller firms , the limits on its use effectively tend to confine its benefits to such firms . section 168 ( k ) allows taxpayers to expense 100 % of the cost of qualified assets bought and placed in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022. there is considerable overlap between the property eligible for the section 179 and section 168 ( k ) expensing allowances . since 2002 , the two allowances have been used primarily as tax incentives for stimulating the u.s. economy . several studies have assessed the economic effects of the 30 % and 50 % bonus depreciation allowances from 2002 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2010. their findings suggested that accelerated depreciation did affect investment in qualified assets , but that it was a relatively ineffective tool for stimulating the u.s. economy during periods of weak or negative growth . available evidence also suggests that the expensing allowances have a moderate effect at best on the level and composition of business investment and its allocation among industries , the distribution of the federal tax burden among different income groups , and the cost of tax compliance for smaller firms . the allowances of course have advantages and disadvantages . on the one hand , an expensing allowance simplifies tax accounting , and a temporary allowance has the potential to stimulate increased business investment in favored assets in the short run by reducing the user cost of capital , increasing the cash flow of investing firms , and giving firms an incentive to make qualifying investments before the incentive expires . on the other hand , an expensing allowance is likely to interfere with an efficient allocation of capital among investment opportunities by diverting capital away from more productive uses with relatively low after - tax returns . in december 2017 , the house and the senate agreed on a measure ( h.r . 1 , p.l . 115-97 ) to revise key parts of the federal tax code . the new tax law made significant changes to both section 179 and section 168 ( k ) . in the case of the section 179 expensing allowance , p.l . 115-97 permanently raised the maximum allowance to $ 1 million , and the phaseout threshold for the allowance to $ 2.5 million , beginning in 2018 ; it also indexed both amounts for inflation starting in 2019. the act also expanded the definition of qualified property to include qualified improvement property , specified improvements ( e.g . , new roofs and heating systems ) to nonresidential real property , and property used in connection with lodging . in another change , the $ 25,000 expensing limit for heavy - duty sport utility vehicles imposed in 2003 was indexed for inflation starting in 2019. in the case of the bonus depreciation allowance , p.l . 115-97 increased it to 100 % for qualified property acquired and placed in service between september 28 , 2017 , and december 31 , 2022 ; the allowance is scheduled to phase out to 0 % starting in 2027. in addition , the placed - in - service deadlines for property with relatively long production periods and for noncommercial aircraft were set one year longer . the wording of the final bill led to the unintended result that qualified improvement property became ineligible for bonus depreciation , as it no longer had a 15-year recovery period . as things now stand , such property is treated as 39-year nonresidential real property , unless congress alters the language .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the status of states ' motor vehicle inspection programs , focusing on the : progress made by the 23 states that are required to implement enhanced inspection and maintenance ( i & m ) programs , including the difficulties that the states have encountered ; and impact that delays in implementing enhanced i & m programs may have on the states ' ability to comply with the national air quality standard for ozone . gao noted that : two of the 23 states had begun testing vehicles by the january 1995 deadline that the environmental protection agency ( epa ) set for implementing enhanced i & m programs , and 12 had begun testing vehicles as of april 1998 ; a number of factors have contributed to delays in implementing programs ; opposition to epa 's enhanced i & m regulation -- including the reluctance of some state legislatures to provide the legislative authority and funding needed to implement these programs -- caused most of the 23 states to delay implementation ; in addition , the states had difficulty in obtaining new testing equipment and software support from vendors ; the delays in implementing enhanced i & m programs have jeopardized the states ' ability to meet the deadlines for attaining the national ozone standard ; epa has allowed the states to claim credit for future reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds ( voc ) from their enhanced i & m programs , provided they demonstrate that they will achieve the required reductions as soon as practical after november 1996 ; if states can not demonstrate that reductions in voc can be obtained from the mandatory enhanced inspection and maintenance programs , they may have to look to other mobile sources as well as stationary sources to meet their goals for reducing these emissions ; and however , achieving further reductions from other sources will be costly and take longer than achieving the reductions from enhanced inspection i & m programs .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao reviewed the performance of federal agencies in handling their investigation into elevated dioxin levels in poultry samples , focusing on : the basis for the agencies ' decisions to require producers to demonstrate their food products did not contain levels of dioxin above one part per trillion ; their effectiveness in working together to make decisions to address the problem of dioxin ; and the impact of the food safety system on the handling of this dioxin incident . gao noted that : the food safety and inspection service ( fsis ) and the food and drug administration ( fda ) requested the producers and processors to halt the distribution of food products with dioxin levels above one part per trillion because of their concern about the potential risk to human health that these products might present ; while scientists have not yet determined the level of dioxin that poses a danger to human health , fda and fsis believed that one part per trillion was an appropriate level to use for halting the distribution of these products ; fda chose the one - part - per - trillion level to distinguish food products with elevated dioxin levels from those products with background dioxin levels ; the federal agencies worked cooperatively to identify the source of the dioxin contamination and to decide on the actions that might be necessary to address any health risks the contaminated food products posed to consumers ; however , their guidance to the affected producers and processors was sometimes unclear and impractical , which left the affected producers confused about the actions they needed to take ; for example , fda , which is responsible for fish products , told producers they had to test their products , but the agency did not tell them how to collect their samples for testing ; in addition , the producers expressed concern that the agencies did not provide them with adequate time to comply with the agencies ' testing requirements ; in some instances , the testing process took longer than the time allowed under the deadline ; although these regulatory actions delayed some food products from reaching the market , industry officials told gao that fda 's and fsis 's actions did not result in the widespread destruction of affected food products ; in addressing the dioxin incident , the agencies involved had to overcome the inherent inefficiencies associated with the current food safety system , which divides responsibility for ensuring food safety among several agencies ; and as gao has reported on numerous occasions , this fragmented food safety system necessitates extensive coordination efforts to minimize wasteful duplication of effort , prevent gaps in regulatory coverage , and avoid conflicting actions .
the congressional budget act of 1974 ( titles i - ix of p.l . 93-344 , as amended ; 2 u.s.c . 601-688 ) provides for the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget each year . the congressional budget resolution represents a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years . as a concurrent resolution , it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law . instead , when adopted by congress , the budget resolution serves as an agreement between the house and senate on a congressional budget plan . as such , it provides the framework for subsequent legislative action on budget matters during each congressional session . in 32 of the 41 years under the budget act , congress adopted at least one budget resolution for the fiscal year beginning in such year . congress did not complete action on a budget resolution for nine fiscal years , most recently for fy2015 . a second budget resolution for a fiscal year was adopted in each of the first seven years , and a third budget resolution was adopted in one year ( for fy1977 ) . since 1982 , congress has considered only one budget resolution for each fiscal year . congress initially was required to cover only the upcoming fiscal year in the budget resolution , but over the years congress has expanded this time frame . currently , the budget resolution must include at least five fiscal years . the budget resolution may include budget reconciliation directives instructing one or more committees to recommend legislative changes to meet the direct spending and revenue levels included in the budget resolution . in the past 41 years , congress included budget reconciliation directives in 22 budget resolutions . such directives have resulted in 24 budget reconciliation measures and the enactment of 20 of them . ( four budget reconciliation measures have been vetoed . ) . the house has considered and adopted fewer amendments to the budget resolution than the senate . for the last three decades , the house has considered the budget resolutions under special rules that generally have made in order only amendments in the nature of a substitute . since 1983 , the house typically has considered between three and seven such amendments to the budget resolution each year , rejecting all but two of these . in contrast , during the period between 1975 and 2015 , the senate considered an average of almost 54 amendments per budget resolution , agreeing to an average of about 31 of these . the budget act sets april 15 as a target date for completing action on the annual budget resolution . ( prior to 1986 , the date was may 15 . ) . during the past 41 years , when congress has completed action on a budget resolution , congress adopted the budget resolution by the target date only six times , most recently in 2003 with the fy2004 budget resolution . budget resolutions have been adopted an average of almost 36 days after the target date . this report will be updated as warranted .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao provided information on the : quality of air inside the national institute of environmental health sciences ( niehs ) building when it was occupied in 1981 ; health effects associated with exposure to formaldehyde ; and current management practices at niehs for air handling and air monitoring . gao noted that : niehs does not have data showing what the air quality was inside its new facility during the first 5.5 months that the building was occupied ; however , in response to some employees ' concerns , the agency began monitoring the air in september 1981 ; the agency found that formaldehyde levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.34 parts per million ( ppm ) , well below the occupational safety and health administration 's safety standard in effect in 1981 ; officials of the niehs said that during the first 5.5 months , they made adjustments to the air handling system to balance the air flow and introduce more outside air to help alleviate the respiratory problems that some employees were experiencing ; formaldehyde is a known irritant ; short - term exposure to formaldehyde at concentrations as low as 0.41 ppm can irritate the eyes and the respiratory tract ; such effects usually pass quickly , however once exposure ends ; according to the national institute for occupational safety and health , short - term exposure to very high concentrations of formaldehyde at levels of 14.1 to 14.3 ppm has produced cancer in the nasal passages of laboratory animals ; because it is carcinogenic in animals and is known to damage genetic material in cell cultures , formaldehyde has been classified as a probable human carcinogen ; however , examination of epidemiological evidence has not demonstrated a firm relationship between formaldehyde and cancer in humans ; the niehs ' current managers are more aware of the need for adequate air handling systems in buildings and for routinely monitoring indoor air levels to protect employees from exposure to indoor air pollutants than managers were in 1981 ; for example , prior to a recent move into a new laboratory module at research triangle park , the agency took a number of steps to ensure the quality of the building 's indoor air , including improved air handling and monitoring measures ; and the manufacturing standards for building materials and office furnishings are more stringent today to ensure that the off - gassing levels of chemicals such as formaldehyde are much lower than in the past years .
this paper explains the u.s. economic sanctions in place up to the point when north korea was delisted as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism . until june 2008 , u.s. economic sanctions were imposed against north korea for five primary reasons : ( 1 ) north korea is seen as posing a threat to u.s. national security ; ( 2 ) north korea is designated by the secretary of state as a state sponsor or supporter of international terrorism ; ( 3 ) north korea is a marxist - leninist state , with a communist government ; ( 4 ) north korea has been found by the state department to have engaged in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; and ( 5 ) north korea has been found by the president to have detonated a nuclear explosive device . the united states has also taken steps to isolate the macau - based banco delta asia for counterfeiting and money - laundering activities , actions north korea has characterized as attacks against it . in accordance with u.s. law , the united states limits some trade , denies trade in dual - use goods and services , limits foreign aid , and opposes entry into or support from international financial institutions . at the president 's discretion , north korea would also be subject to the economic sanctions pursuant to the international religious freedom act of 1998 , under which the administration has identified north korea as a `` country of particular concern '' since 2001 , and pursuant to the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 , under which the administration has classified north korea in the category of most severe offender ( tier 3 ) since 2003. in october 2002 , after meetings between high - level u.s. and north korean government officials , the united states reported that north korea had confirmed suspicions that it had reactivated its nuclear weapons development program . an international crisis ensued , with north korea expelling international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) inspectors and declaring that it would withdraw from the non - proliferation treaty . participants in the korean energy development organization ( kedo ) — including united states , japan , south korea and european union — in turn suspended shipments of fuel oil . kedo also suspended construction of the light - water reactors , the completion of which had been planned for 2003. north korea officially withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty on january 10 , 2003 ( effective three months hence ) , the first signatory country to do so .
federal employees participate in one of two retirement systems . the civil service retirement system ( csrs ) was established in 1920 and covers only employees hired before 1984. participants in the csrs do not pay social security payroll taxes and they do not earn social security benefits . for a worker retiring after 30 years of federal service , a csrs annuity will be equal to 56.25 % of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of basic pay . the social security amendments of 1983 ( p.l . 98-21 ) required federal employees hired after 1983 to participate in social security . because the csrs was not designed to coordinate with social security , congress directed the development of a new retirement plan for federal workers hired after 1983. the result was the federal employees ' retirement system ( fers ) act of 1986 ( p.l . 99-335 ) . the fers has three elements : ( 1 ) social security , ( 2 ) the fers basic retirement annuity and fers supplement , and ( 3 ) the thrift savings plan ( tsp ) . the amount of the fers basic retirement annuity is determined by three factors : ( 1 ) the salary base , ( 2 ) the accrual rate , and ( 3 ) years of service . the salary base is the average of the worker 's highest three consecutive years of pay . under fers , the benefit accrual rate is 1.0 % per year of service , or 1.1 % for workers retiring at the age of 62 or later with 20 or more years of service . a worker with 30 years of service retiring at the age of 62 will receive a fers pension equal to 33 % of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of pay , or about 32 % of final annual salary . the tsp is a defined contribution retirement plan similar to the 401 ( k ) plans provided by many employers in the private sector . the income that a retired worker receives from the tsp will depend on the balance in his or her account . in 2015 , employees covered by fers or csrs can contribute up to $ 18,000 to the tsp . employees aged 50 or older can contribute an additional $ 6,000 . contributions of up to 5 % of pay made by workers under fers are matched by the federal government . workers covered by csrs can contribute to the tsp , but they receive no matching contributions . the tsp is a key element of the fers , especially for workers at the upper ranges of the federal pay scale . the social security benefit formula is designed to replace a greater share of income for low - wage workers than for high - wage workers . the fers basic annuity will replace about 32 % of final salary for an employee retiring at the age of 62 with 30 years of service . higher - wage federal workers need to contribute a greater percentage of pay to the tsp to reach the same level of income replacement as lower - paid workers can achieve from just the fers retirement annuity and social security . at an annual rate of return of 6.0 % , income from the tsp can replace about 33 % of final pay for a federal employee who contributes 10 % of pay over 30 years .
almost four decades after the supreme court ruling in regents of the university of california v. bakke , the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy . many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination , but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty . justice powell , in his opinion for the bakke court , stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is `` a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education , '' noting that `` [ t ] he atmosphere of 'speculation , experiment , and creation ' so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body . . in subsequent years , however , federal courts began to question the powell rationale , unsettling expectations about whether diversity - based affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . after a series of conflicting lower court rulings were issued regarding the use of race to promote a diverse student body , the supreme court agreed to review the race - conscious admissions policies used by the undergraduate and law school admissions programs at the university of michigan . in grutter v. bollinger , a 5 to 4 majority of the justices held that the law school had a `` compelling '' interest in the `` educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body , '' which justified its race - based efforts to assemble a `` critical mass '' of `` underrepresented '' minority students . but in the companion decision , gratz v. bollinger , six justices decided that the university 's policy of awarding `` racial bonus points '' to minority applicants was not `` narrowly tailored '' enough to pass constitutional scrutiny . the decisions resolved , for the time being , the doctrinal muddle left in bakke 's wake . and because the court 's constitutional holdings translate to the private sector under the federal civil rights laws , nonpublic schools , colleges , and universities are likewise affected . however , the grutter and gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting . to resolve this question , the supreme court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools and to avoid racial segregation . in a consolidated 2007 ruling in parents involved in community schools v. seattle school district no . 1 , the court struck down the seattle and louisville school plans at issue , holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment . more recently , the court 's decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education . in its 2013 ruling in fisher v. university of texas at austin , the court reaffirmed its holding in grutter , but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate court 's decision to uphold a race - conscious undergraduate admissions plan at the university of texas at austin . however , on remand , the appellate court upheld the university 's admissions program for a second time , a decision that appeared to prompt the court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term . meanwhile , in 2014 's schuette v. coalition to defend affirmative action , the court upheld michigan 's proposal 2 , which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education .
the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks prompted congressional action on many fronts , including passage of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate toolsrequired to intercept and obstruct terrorism ( usa patriot ) act , p.l . 107-56 . the act isbroadly scoped , and some of its provisions may affect internet usage , computer security , and criticalinfrastructure protection . in the area of computer security , the act creates a definition of `` computer trespasser '' andmakes such activities a terrorist act in certain circumstances . the act enables law enforcementofficials to intercept the communications of computer trespassers and improves their ability to trackcomputer trespasser activities . it also codifies some elements of u.s. critical infrastructure policyarticulated by both the clinton and george w. bush administrations to ensure that any disruptionsto the nation 's critical infrastructures are minimally detrimental . although the act does not explicitly address electronic commerce ( e - commerce ) , many ofthe law 's provisions may impact it . in particular , title iii responds to concerns that more can be doneto prevent , detect , and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism . over time , these provisions may affect e - commerce broadly , and electronic fund transfersspecifically . electronic government ( e - government ) could be affected by the act in both positive andnegative ways . the intense focus on improving data collection and information sharing practicesand systems may contribute to the establishment of government - wide technical standards and bestpractices that could facilitate the implementation of new and existing e - government initiatives . itcould also promote the utilization of secure web portals to help ensure the data integrity oftransactions between the government and citizens and business . however , concern about potentialabuses of data collection provisions could dampen citizen enthusiasm for carrying out electronictransactions with the government . the act provides law enforcement officials with greater authority to monitor internet activitysuch as electronic mail ( e - mail ) and web site visits . while law enforcement officials laud their newauthorities as enabling them to better track terrorist and other criminal activity , privacy rightsadvocates worry that , in an attempt to track down and punish the terrorists who threaten americandemocracy , one of the fundamental tenets of that democracy -- privacy -- may itself be threatened . because of the controversial aspects of some provisions in the act , particularly regardingprivacy , congress and other groups are expected to monitor closely how the act is implemented .
radio frequency spectrum policy issues before congress are characterized by economic , technological and regulatory complexity . of particular interest to policy makers are the allocation of spectrum for specific types of use ( such as tv broadcasting , radio , advanced wireless services , or unlicensed ) and the assignment of licenses for exclusive or shared use of specific frequencies . today , most frequencies allocated for commercial uses are assigned through auctions , with licenses going to the highest bidder . another important allocation of spectrum is for unlicensed use . both commercial and non - commercial entities use unlicensed spectrum to meet a wide variety of monitoring and communications needs . suppliers of wireless devices must meet requirements for certification to operate on frequency bands designated for unlicensed use . examples of unlicensed use include garage door openers and wi - fi communications . the federal communications commission ( fcc ) regulates licensed and unlicensed spectrum not allocated for federal use , is responsible for auctioning spectrum licenses , and can also use its authority to redistribute licenses . proceeds from spectrum license sales are presently attributed to general revenue in the u.s. budget . in the 108 th congress , however , a precedent was established with the creation of a spectrum relocation fund to hold proceeds from the auction of specified radio frequencies allocated to federal use ; federal agencies vacating spectrum to be auctioned for commercial use are being compensated from the fund for costs of relocation . in the 109 th congress , the deficit reduction act ( p.l . 109-171 ) included provisions that placed certain auction proceeds in a digital television transition and public safety fund . the fund is being mainly used to assist the transition from analog television broadcasting to digital broadcasting , and for contributions to programs for public safety . over $ 7 billion of the auction proceeds were applied to deficit reduction . the funding came from the auction of spectrum ( at 700 mhz ) currently used for analog television broadcasting , to be vacated by february 17 , 2009. the auction , auction 73 , concluded on march 18,2008 ; it grossed $ 19,592,420,000 . the rules for auction 73 introduced two new business models for spectrum management and assignment that represented departures from past policy . one model designated a block of spectrum licenses for a network that could be managed to accept any suitable wireless device or software application , referred to as open access . the other model would require a shared network to accommodate both public safety and commercial users in a partnership . a national license , referred to as the d block , was put up for auction , as part of auction 73 , with a reserve price of $ 1.3 billion . the winning bidder would have been required to assume the cost and responsibility of building the network using d block spectrum and adjacent spectrum assigned to public safety . the sole bid for the d block was below the reserve price and consequently the d block will be re - auctioned . the prospects for this new auction have triggered a debate about the nature of competition in the wireless industry and the need for a nationwide public safety network that may be resolved by congress through legislation .
the majority leader in the contemporary house is second - in - command behind the speaker of the majority party . typically , the majority leader functions as the speaker 's chief lieutenant or `` field commander '' for day - to - day management of the floor . although the majority leader 's duties are not especially well - defined , they have evolved to the point where it is possible to spotlight two fundamental and often interlocking responsibilities that orient the majority leader 's work : institutional and party . from an institutional perspective , the majority leader has a number of duties . scheduling floor business is a prime responsibility of the majority leader . although scheduling the house 's business is a collective activity of the majority party , the majority leader has a large say in shaping the chamber 's overall agenda and in determining when , whether , how , or in what order legislation is taken up . in addition , the majority leader is active in constructing winning coalitions for the party 's legislative priorities ; acting as a public spokesman — defending and explaining the party 's program and agenda ; serving as an emissary to the white house , especially when the president is of the same party ; and facilitating the orderly conduct of the house 's business . from a party perspective , three key activities undergird the majority leader 's principal goal of trying to ensure that the party remains in control of the house . first , the majority leader assists in the reelection campaigns of party incumbents by , for example , raising campaign funds and traveling to scores of house districts to campaign either with incumbents or challengers of the party . second , the majority leader promotes the party 's agenda by developing themes and issues important to core supporters in the electorate . third , the majority leader encourages party cohesion by , for instance , working to minimize internal factional disagreements that may undermine the majority party 's ability to govern the house .
supervised release replaces parole for federal crimes committed after november 1 , 1987. like parole , supervised release is a term of restricted freedom following a defendant 's release from prison . the nature of supervision and the conditions imposed during supervised release are also similar to those that applied in the old system of parole . however , whereas parole functions in lieu of a remaining prison term , supervised release begins only after a defendant has completed his full prison sentence . where revocation of parole could lead to a return to prison to finish out a defendant 's original sentence , revocation of supervised release can lead to a return to prison for a term in addition to that imposed for the defendant 's original sentence . a sentencing court determines the duration and conditions for a defendant 's supervised release term at the time of initial sentencing . as a general rule , federal law limits the maximum duration to five years , although it permits , and in some cases mandates , longer durations for relatively serious drug , sex , and terrorism - related offenses . a sentencing court retains jurisdiction to modify the terms of a defendant 's supervised release and to revoke the term and return a defendant to prison for violation of the conditions . several conditions are standard features of supervised release . some conditions , such as a ban on the commission of further crimes , are mandatory . other conditions , such as an obligation to report to a probation officer , have become standard practice by the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines , which courts must consider along with other statutorily designated considerations . together with these regularly imposed conditions , the sentencing guidelines recommend additional conditions appropriate for specific circumstances . a sentencing court may impose any of these discretion conditions , as long as they offend no constitutional limitations and as long as they involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary and `` reasonably relate '' to the nature of the offense ; the defendant 's crime - related history ; deterrence of crime ; protection of the public ; or the defendant 's rehabilitation . both a defendant 's constitutional rights and federalism concerns create outer limits for the application and scope of supervised release conditions . by nature , such conditions restrict a releasee 's freedom , and some conditions involve systems , such as child support orders , ordinarily governed by the states . nonetheless , federal courts have upheld a wide range of such conditions against constitutional challenges . the conditions of supervised release have been a source of constitutional challenges . yet a constitutionally suspect condition is also likely to run afoul of statutory demands . in which case , the courts often resolve the issue on statutory grounds . this report is available in an abridged form , without footnotes or citations to authority , as crs report rs21364 , supervised release : an abbreviated outline of federal law .
on december 18 , 2001 , the president bush signed the fy2002 department of transportation ( dot ) and related agencies conference agreement ( h.rept . 107-308 ) , appropriating a total of $ 59.588 billion for dot , a 2.5 % increase over the fy2001 enacted level . the enacted bill provides $ 507 million more than the house - passed version and $ 391 million less than the senate - passed bill . at $ 32.895 billion , the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) will receive slightly less than infy2001 . the federal railroad administration ( fra ) will receive $ 734 million , $ 21 million lessthan in fy2001 . the other major agencies all get increases . the federal aviation administration ( faa ) budget will increase roughly 6 % to $ 13.295 billion ; the federal transit administration ( fta ) budget will increase 8 % to $ 6.747 billion ; and the coast guard will receive an increase of 12 % to $ 5.031 billion . the act also includes $ 1.25 billion ( to be offset by user fee collections ) for the newtransportation security administration ( tsa ) . the enacted conference agreement mandates significant safety and inspection requirements be met by mexico - domiciled trucks before dot begins processing mexican applications for operating authorityin the u.s. beyond the commercial zones along the border . it does , however , include a number ofmodifications in response to administration concerns that the original senate bill ( as well as the housebill ) violated provisions of the north american free trade association agreement ( nafta ) . the conference agreement created a controversy when the conferees redirected and earmarked $ 997.6 million of revenue aligned budget authority ( raba ) funds . the raba mechanismadjusts dot program authorization and obligation levels to reflect recent fuel tax revenues ( byincreasing or decreasing both the authorization and the obligation limitation ) . for fy2002 , thisadded $ 4.5 billion to dot programs . this redirection of raba funds reduces the raba portionof the states ' formula funding by 10.7 % from what they otherwise would have received . authorizerssee this action as a usurpation of their authority , and some vowed to oppose this sort of action in thefuture . congress responded to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , by passing the 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attackson the united states ( p.l.107-38 ) . that act provides $ 40 billion , government - wide , to pay the costsof a variety of responses , including `` providing increased transportation security . . as of this writing , roughly $ 1.9 billion of these emergency supplemental funds have been approved for transfer to dot . key policy staff division abbreviations : rsi = resources , science , and industry division .
for at least a decade , the use of snowmobiles in yellowstone and other national parks has been controversial because of the potential impacts on wildlife and , until recently , the absence of standards for snowmobile emissions and noise . the national park service has attempted to address the issue by developing winter use plans that establish regulations and limits at individual park units . these plans have been the subject of numerous legal challenges . on september 15 , 2008 , the u.s. district court for the district of columbia vacated the national park service 's most recent winter use plan for yellowstone national park . the plan would have allowed up to 540 snowmobiles per day into the park beginning in the 2008-2009 winter season , provided that they met noise and emission standards and that the riders were accompanied by commercial guides . the nps plan was opposed by environmental groups and the vast majority of public commenters . with the rule vacated , it is unclear what limits will apply in the coming winter season . current model snowmobiles emit significant quantities of pollution . in one hour , a new model snowmobile emits as much hydrocarbon as a 2008 model auto emits in about four years ( 54,000 miles ) of driving . the environmental protection agency ( epa ) promulgated regulations limiting air emissions from snowmobiles in 2002 , but the regulations have the effect of allowing the machines to emit as much hydrocarbon pollution in a day as a new auto emits in its lifetime . snowmobiles also emit significant amounts of noise . epa has no snowmobile noise standards . the national park service has allowed snowmobile use in 43 units of the national park system , in many cases in apparent violation of executive orders from the nixon and carter years . outside of alaska ( where snowmobiles are permitted in most national parks by law ) , the most popular national park for snowmobiling has been yellowstone , which saw more than 87,000 snowmobile visits in the 2001-2002 winter season . under the clinton administration , the park service decided that the emissions and noise from snowmobiling were incompatible with protecting the park , and promulgated rules that would have phased out snowmobiles from yellowstone by the winter of 2003-2004. the bush administration revisited these rules and announced modifications in march 2003 that would have allowed continued use of snowmobiles . the 2003 rules and the clinton administration action have been the subject of conflicting court rulings : a federal court in wyoming has vacated and remanded the clinton administration 's phaseout , while a d.c. federal court has vacated and remanded the bush administration rules . for the last four winters , yellowstone and two neighboring park units have operated under a temporary plan that permits 720 snowmobiles per day in yellowstone , but sets standards for their emissions and requires snowmobilers to be accompanied by commercial guides . under these rules , snowmobile visits have declined by two - thirds . efforts to reduce snowmobile emissions and noise remain contentious . this report discusses snowmobile access to the parks , snowmobile emissions , epa 's emission standards , and congressional efforts to address these issues .
medicare is a federal insurance program that pays for covered health services for most persons 65 years of age and older and for most permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. part a of the program , the hospital insurance program , covers hospital , post - hospital , and hospice services . part b , the supplementary medical insurance program , is optional and covers a broad range of complementary medical services including physician , laboratory , outpatient hospital services , and durable medical equipment . part c provides private plan options for beneficiaries enrolled in both parts a and b. part d is an optional outpatient prescription drug program . medicare has established specific rules for payment of covered benefits . some , such as physician services and most durable medical equipment , are based on fee schedules . a fee schedule is a list of medicare payments for specific items and services , which are calculated according to statutorily specified formula and take into account the actual amount of care provided . many services , including inpatient and outpatient hospital care , are paid under different prospective payment systems ( ppss ) . a prospective payment system is a method of paying hospitals , or other providers , amounts or rates of payment that are established in advance for a defined period and are generally based on an episode of care , regardless of the actual amount of care used . other payments are based , in part , on a provider 's bid ( an estimate of the cost of providing a service ) relative to a benchmark ( the maximum amount medicare will pay ) . bids and benchmarks are used to determine payments in medicare parts c and d. payments for some items of durable medical equipment in specified locations are also based on the bids of competing providers . in general , the program provides for annual updates to these payment amounts . the program also has rules regarding the amount of cost sharing , if any , that beneficiaries can be billed in excess of medicare 's recognized payment levels . unlike other services , medicare 's outpatient prescription drug benefit can be obtained only through private plans . further , while all part d plans must meet certain minimum requirements , they differ in terms of benefit design , formulary drugs , premiums , and cost - sharing amounts . medicare payment policies and potential changes to these policies are of continuing interest to congress . the medicare program has been a major focus of deficit reduction legislation since 1980. in each congress since the 105th congress , laws have been passed to both increase , but more often slow , the rate of growth of payments to medicare providers and private plans . perhaps of particular interest in the 113rd congress is the update to the medicare physician fee schedule . the method for updating the physician fee schedule amount , known as the sustainable growth rate ( sgr ) , would have resulted in negative updates for physician payments in recent years , except that congress has stepped in to stop the updates . physician payment rates , which would have fallen 26.5 % in the absence of congressional action , are frozen through december 31 , 2013. under current law , medicare physician fee schedule payments are to be reduced by 24.4 % beginning january 2014. this report provides an overview of medicare payment rules by type of service , outlines current payment policies , and summarizes the basic rules for payment updates . in addition to the payment information provided in the tables of this report , medicare is subject to a maximum 2 % payment reduction due to sequestration . this report will be updated twice a year to reflect recent fiscal year and calendar year changes , and will be updated to reflect the details of how the 2 % reduction in payments will be applied .
congress is currently considering the u.s. - vietnam bilateral trade agreement ( bta ) . under the agreement , which was signed in july 2000 and requires congressional approval , the united states pledged to extend conditional normal trade relations status to vietnam , thereby significantly lowering tariffs on imports from vietnam , in return for hanoi 's agreement to enact a wide range of market - oriented reforms . congressional discussion over the bta is expected to highlight vietnam 's labor rights situation , a topic that has become a contentious part of the trade debate in recent years . the bta itself does not specifically address workers ' rights . the evolution of vietnam 's labor rights regime has been heavily conditioned by the tension between maintaining political stability and promoting economic development — two goals that often conflict . on the one hand , vietnamese workers are not free to form their own independent unions . all unions must belong to the vietnam general confederation of labor ( vgcl ) , an organ of the communist party . analysts have observed that the absence of a true right of association in vietnam has impeded the improvement of labor rights in other areas . collective bargaining agreements remain the exception rather than the rule . vietnam 's doi moi ( renovation ) economic reforms , launched in 1986 , have been followed by surging urban unemployment and a rise in child labor , forced prostitution , and the trafficking of women and children . workers in all sectors of the economy are often exposed to dangerous , unhealthy , and in some cases impoverished `` sweatshop '' conditions . rapid economic expansion , corruption , and shortages of funds , training , and personnel have made it extremely difficult for government authorities to enforce vietnam 's labor laws . on the other hand , since the launch of the doi moi reforms , worker rights have made substantial progress . vietnam rejoined the international labor organization ( ilo ) in 1992 and since then the government , unions , and local groups have intensified their cooperation with the ilo and other international groups . a comprehensive and detailed labor code was passed in 1994. among other advances , it recognized workers ' right to strike . there is evidence that over the past decade the vgcl and its member - unions have become more assertive — particularly on matters relating to wages , health , and safety — a development tolerated by the government . by many measures — the coverage of labor laws , the tolerance of wildcat strikes , the slowly increasing clout of grass - roots unions , the relative openness of debate over labor issues — there is evidence that the vietnamese labor rights regime is more flexible and responsive than its chinese counterpart . this report details vietnam 's law and policy in six areas of labor rights : the right of association / collective bargaining ; forced labor ; child labor ; health and safety ; wages , hours and welfare benefits ; and discrimination . this report also provides international context by contrasting the vietnamese and chinese labor rights regimes . comprehensive information about vietnam 's labor conditions are scarce . as more information is obtained , this report will be updated .
u.s. law provides for the temporary admission of various categories of foreign nationals , who are known as nonimmigrants . nonimmigrants are admitted for a designated period of time and a specific purpose . they include a wide range of visitors , including tourists , foreign students , diplomats , and temporary workers . there are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories . these visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) ; for example , b - 2 tourists , e - 2 treaty investors , f - 1 foreign students , h - 1b temporary professional workers , j - 1 cultural exchange participants , or s - 4 terrorist informants . the u.s. department of state ( dos ) consular officer , at the time of application for a visa , as well as the department of homeland security ( dhs ) inspectors , at the time of application for admission , must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to nonimmigrant status . the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the type of nonimmigrant visa for which the application is made . both dos consular officers ( when the alien is petitioning abroad ) and dhs inspectors ( when the alien is entering the united states ) must confirm that the alien is not ineligible for a visa under the so - called `` grounds for inadmissibility '' of the ina , which include criminal , terrorist , and public health grounds for exclusion . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) inspectors in dhs tallied 163 million temporary admissions of foreign nationals to the united states during 2009. mexican nationals with border crossing cards and canadian nationals traveling for business or tourist purposes accounted for the vast majority of admissions to the united states , with approximately 126.8 million entries in fy2009 . the remaining categories and countries of the world contributed 36.2 million admissions in fy2009 . since many types of visas allow people to depart and re - enter the united states , the cbp data record multiple admissions during the same year . in fy2009 , dos 's consular officers issued 5.8 million nonimmigrant visas . nonimmigrant visas issued abroad had dipped to 5.0 million in fy2004 after peaking at 7.6 million in fy2001 . combined , visitor visas issued for tourism and business comprised the largest group of nonimmigrant visas in fy2009 , with about 4.1 million , down from 5.7 million in fy2000 . other notable groups were 0.7 million students and exchange visitors ( 12.3 % ) and 0.5 million temporary workers , managers , executives , and investors ( 8.7 % ) . according to the most recent analysis , there were 1.8 million nonimmigrants who maintained a residence in the united states in 2008. of the 1.8 million nonimmigrants , 50.8 % ( 0.93 million ) were temporary workers and their families , 32.2 % ( 0.59 million ) were students and their families , 13.1 % ( 0.24 million ) were exchange visitors and families , and 3.8 % ( 0.07 million ) were diplomats , other representatives , and their families . although most nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are not coming to reside permanently in the united states , many ultimately adjust their status to become legal permanent residents . the law and regulations set terms for nonimmigrant lengths of stay in the united states , typically have foreign residency requirements , and often limit what aliens are permitted to do in the united states ( e.g . , gain employment or enroll in school ) , but many observers assert that the policies are not uniformly or rigorously enforced . achieving an optimal balance among major policy priorities , such as ensuring national security , facilitating trade and commerce , protecting public health and safety , and fostering international cooperation , remains a challenge .
the indian health service ( ihs ) , an agency in the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , provides health care for eligible american indians / alaskan natives through a system of programs and facilities located on or near indian reservations and in certain urban areas . the ihs health delivery program is organized into 12 regional area offices and 161 local service units , and serves federal reservations , indian communities , and urban indians . in general , persons eligible for ihs services must be in ihs service areas and belong to federally recognized tribes . the ihs - served population generally has a higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than the u.s. population as a whole . several ihs publications compare the health conditions and causes of death of the ihs service population with those for the entire u.s. population . according to the latest of these , the average life expectancy at birth for the ihs service area population in 1999-2001 was 74.5 years , or 2.4 years less than the 76.9 years for the total u.s. population . ihs appropriations are separated into two budget categories : health services and health facilities . for fy2008 , the total appropriation for ihs was $ 3.35 billion , of which $ 2.97 billion ( 89 % ) was for health services and $ 374.6 million ( 11 % ) was for health facilities . other sources of ihs funding include a special diabetes program and reimbursements from medicare , medicaid , and private insurance . total ihs `` program - level '' funding , including all sources , was $ 4.28 billion in fy2008 . indian health advocates argue that ihs funding falls short of the need . although a number of legislative issues concerning ihs face the 111th congress , the primary focus has been on the reauthorization of the indian health care improvement act ( ihcia ) . two bills ( s. 1200 and h.r . 1328 ) were introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize the ihcia . both reauthorization bills would have expanded health services , eased processes for reimbursements from medicaid and other federal programs , coordinated behavioral health programs , and authorized other actions . s. 1200 was reported , amended , by the senate indian affairs committee on october 17 , 2007 ( s.rept . 110-197 ) . s. 1200 was passed , amended , by the senate february 28 , 2008 , and sent to the house . h.r . 1328 was reported , amended , by the house natural resources committee on april 4 , 2008 ( h.rept . 110-564 , part 1 ) . separately h.r . 1328 was forwarded , amended , by the house energy and commerce committee 's health subcommittee to the full committee on november 7 , 2007. h.r . 1328 was discharged by the energy and commerce and ways and means committees on june 6 , 2008 , and the natural resources version reported in april was placed on the calendar . concerns continue about many issues in the ihcia bills , including provisions on medicaid and other issues listed in a january 2008 statement of administration policy on s. 1200 , which threatened a veto of that bill . neither s. 1200 nor h.r . 1328 were passed by congress . no ihcia bill has been introduced in the 111th congress as of the date of this report , but certain medicaid - related provisions have been included in draft economic - stimulus legislation . this report will be updated .
under the populist rule of president hugo chávez , first elected in 1998 and reelected to a six - year term in december 2006 , venezuela has undergone enormous political changes , with a new constitution and unicameral legislature , and a new name for the country , the bolivarian republic of venezuela . u.s. officials and human rights organizations have expressed concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and threats to freedom of expression under president chávez , who has survived several attempts to remove him from power . the government benefitted from the rise in world oil prices , which sparked an economic boom and allowed chávez to increase expenditures on social programs associated with his populist agenda . after he was reelected , chávez announced new measures to move the country toward socialism , but his may 2007 closure of a popular venezuelan television station ( rctv ) that was critical of the government sparked protests , and his proposed constitutional amendment package was defeated by a close margin in a december 2007 national referendum . state and local elections held in november 2008 were a mixed picture of support for the government , with the opposition winning several key contests . in february 2009 , venezuelans approved a controversial constitutional referendum that abolished term limits and allows chávez to run for re - election in 2012 and beyond . in 2009 , the government has increased efforts to suppress the political opposition , including elected officials , and is continuing to threaten media critical of the government . the united states traditionally has had close relations with venezuela , the fourth major supplier of foreign oil to the united states , but there has been friction with the chávez government . u.s. officials have expressed concerns about human rights , venezuela 's military arms purchases , its relations with cuba and iran , and its efforts to export its brand of populism to other latin american countries . declining cooperation on anti - drug and anti - terrorism efforts has also been a concern . in september 2008 , bilateral relations worsened when president chávez expelled the u.s. ambassador to venezuela , and the united states responded in kind . under the obama administration , venezuela and the united states reached an agreement in late june 2009 for the return of respective ambassadors . while some observers are hopeful that the return of ambassadors will mark an improvement in relations , others emphasize continued u.s. concerns about the venezuelan government 's treatment of the news media and political opposition and about interference in the affairs of other countries in the region . to date in the 111th congress , the senate approved an amendment ( s.amdt . 1536 ) to the senate version of the national defense authorization act for fy2010 , s. 1390 , that requires the director of national intelligence to provide a report on venezuela 's military purchases , potential support for terrorist groups , and other venezuelan activities . in addition , several resolutions and bills related to venezuela have been introduced : h.r . 375 would , among its provisions , place restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting the nuclear programs of venezuela ; h.r . 2475 includes a provision identical to that in h.r . 375 described above that would place restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting the nuclear programs of venezuela ; h.res . 174 and h.con.res . 124 would express concern about anti - semitism in venezuela . note : this report provides background on political changes in venezuela , u.s. policy , and u.s. legislative initiatives from 2003-july 2009. it will not be updated .
when congressional committees engage in oversight of the administrative bureaucracy , or when members of congress intervene in agency proceedings on behalf of private constituents or other private entities with interests affecting the members 's constituency , such interventions involve varying degrees of intrusion into agency decisionmaking processes . this report will briefly examine the currently applicable legal and ethical considerations and standards that mark the limits of such intercessions . the report initially reviews the judicial development and application of standards for determining whether congressional pressure or influence will be deemed to have tainted an agency proceeding . it concludes that the courts , in balancing congress 's performance of its constitutional and statutory obligations to oversee the actions of agency officials against the rights of parties before agencies , have shown a decided predilection for protecting the congressional prerogatives . thus where informal rulemaking or other forms of informal decisionmaking are involved , the courts will look to the nature and impact of the political pressure on the agency decisionmaker and will intervene only where that pressure has had the actual effect of forcing the consideration of factors congress did not intend to make relevant . where agency adjudication is involved a stricter standard is applied and the finding of an appearance of impropriety can be sufficient to taint the proceeding . but even here the courts have required that the pressure or influence be directed at the ultimate decisionmaker with respect to the merits of the proceeding and that it does not involve legitimate oversight and investigative functions , before they will intervene . the report next examines the conduct of members of congress and their staffs intervening in administrative matters from the perspective of ethics and conflict of interest rules , statutes and guidelines bearing upon a member 's and staffer 's official duties . it notes that since congressional intervention and expressions of interest in administrative matters from a member 's office are recognized as legitimate , official representational and oversight functions and duties of members of congress , the primary focus of the ethical and statutory conduct restraints is limited to ( 1 ) any improper enrichment or financial benefit accruing to the member in return for , or because of , his or her official actions and influences , including the receipt of gifts or payments , or existing financial interests in , or relating to the matter under consideration ; and ( 2 ) any overt coercion or threats of reprisals , or promises of favoritism or reward to administrators from the member 's office which could indicate an arguable abuse of a member 's official representational or oversight role . additionally , ethical guidelines in congress incorporate an `` appearance '' standard for members which would counsel a member to adopt office procedures and systems which would prevent an appearance of a `` linkage '' between interventions and the receipt of things of value , particularly legitimate campaign contributions , and which would assure that decisions to intervene are based on the merits of a particular matter .
federal farm support , food assistance , agricultural trade , marketing , and rural development policies are governed by a variety of separate laws . however , many of these laws periodically are evaluated , revised , and renewed through an omnibus , multi - year `` farm bill . . the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-171 ) was the most recent omnibus farm bill , and many of its provisions expire in 2007 , so reauthorization is expected to be addressed in the first session of the 110th congress . the heart of every omnibus farm bill is farm income and commodity price support policy — namely , the methods and levels of support that the federal government provides to agricultural producers . however , farm bills typically include titles on agricultural trade and foreign food aid , conservation and environment , forestry , domestic food assistance ( primarily food stamps ) , agricultural credit , rural development , agricultural research and education , and marketing - related programs . often , such `` miscellaneous '' provisions as food safety , marketing orders , animal health and welfare , and energy are added . this omnibus nature of the farm bill creates a broad coalition of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that , individually , might not survive the legislative process . the scope and direction of a new farm bill may be shaped by such factors as financial conditions in the agricultural economy , competition among various interests , international trade obligations , and — possibly most important — a tight limit on federal funds . among the thorniest issues may be future farm income and commodity price support . questions of equity ( who should get aid and how much ) , program cost , conformance with wto trade obligations , effects on u.s. competitiveness in the global marketplace , and the unintended impacts of agricultural activities on the environment are among the considerations . the economic prosperity of the u.s. farm sector is heavily dependent upon exports , so the provisions of a new bill reauthorizing farm export and foreign food aid programs also will be of keen interest . moreover , the agricultural credit , research , conservation , domestic nutrition assistance , and rural development titles bring an array of interests into the debate , and their issues and concerns could prove equally contentious . several farm groups have strongly endorsed a continuation of current policies and programs . however , agriculture and rural interests not receiving much benefit from current programs oppose a simple extension and would like some of the spending to be aimed at solving their problems . furthermore , the secretary of agriculture has repeatedly stated that farm programs need to be made `` equitable , predictable and beyond challenge '' in the wto . this report will be updated as related developments transpire .
increasingly , congress and the bush administration are looking to utilize nonproliferation assistance programs , including cooperative threat reduction , to help reduce the risk of terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) . in the fy2004 national defense authorization act ( p.l . 108-136 , sec . 1308 ) , congress authorized the bush administration to spend $ 50 million of unobligated funds from the cooperative threat reduction program in states outside the former soviet union . as of september 2006 , the administration had spent such funds only in albania ( $ 38.5 million ) for the purpose of eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles . the report of the 9 / 11 commission called for continued support for threat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups . this report , which will be updated as needed , analyzes the range of possible applications of ctr funds , the kinds of assistance that might be supplied , and describes legal , financial , technical , and political constraints on possible assistance . a key underlying issue is that the countries posing the greatest risks may be the least amenable to cooperative approaches . a second issue is that there is an array of u.s. domestic and international legal restrictions on the most useful kinds of cooperation . both the executive branch and congress may need to consider domestic and international legal and political restrictions on cooperation with states outside the nonproliferation regimes , low levels of transparency exhibited by most of the potential recipient states , and the lack of incentives for many of these states to pursue threat reduction measures . in addition , congress may wish to consider whether potentially expanding the geographic scope of ctr may have a negative effect on existing programs . one school of thought believes russia , as the largest source of stocks of biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons , should continue to be the main focus of attention . other observers believe there is now an opportunity to focus on states within the nexus of terrorism and wmd . this report complements crs report rl31957 , nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance : u.s. programs in the former soviet union ; crs report rl31589 , nuclear threat reduction measures for india and pakistan ; and crs report rs21840 , expanding threat reduction and nonproliferation programs : concepts and definitions ( pdf ) .

the aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america has begun to have negative consequences for economic and social development in several countries , and continued increases in hiv infection rates threaten future development prospects . in contrast to other parts of latin america , the mode of hiv transmission in several caribbean and central american countries has been primarily through heterosexual contact , making the disease difficult to contain because it affects the general population . the countries with the highest prevalence or infection rates are belize , the bahamas , guyana , haiti , and trinidad and tobago , with rates between 2 % and 4 % ; and barbados , the dominican republic , honduras , jamaica , and suriname , with rates between 1 % and 2 % . the response to the aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america has involved a mix of support by governments in the region , bilateral donors ( such as the united states , canada , and european nations ) , regional and multilateral organizations , and nongovernmental organizations ( ngos ) . many countries in the region have national hiv / aids programs that are supported through these efforts . u.s. government funding for hiv / aids in the caribbean and central america has increased significantly in recent years . aid to the region rose from $ 11.2 million in fy2000 to $ 33.8 million in fy2003 . because of the inclusion of guyana and haiti as focus countries in the president 's emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) , u.s. assistance to the region for hiv / aids increased from $ 47 million in fy2004 to an estimated $ 139 million in fy2008 . for fy2009 , the administration requested almost $ 139 million in hiv assistance for the caribbean and central america , with $ 92 million for haiti and $ 20 million for guyana . in the 110th congress , h.r . 848 ( fortuño ) , introduced february 6 , 2007 , would add 14 caribbean countries to the list of focus countries under pepar . the additional countries are antigua & barbuda , barbados , the bahamas , belize , dominica , grenada , jamaica , montserrat , st. kitts & nevis , st. vincent and the grenadines , st. lucia , suriname , trinidad & tobago , and the dominican republic . in the second session of the 110th congress , the language of h.r . 848 was included in pepfar reauthorization legislation , h.r . 5501 ( berman ) , approved by the house on april 2 , 2008. the senate version of the pepfar reauthorization , s. 2731 ( biden ) , which was reported by the senate committee on foreign relations on april 15 , 2008 , does not have a similar provision expanding the list of caribbean countries that are focus countries . this report , which will be updated periodically , examines the characteristics and consequences of the hiv / aids epidemic in the caribbean and central america and the response to the epidemic in the region . also see crs report rl33485 , u.s. international hiv / aids , tuberculosis , and malaria spending : fy2004-fy2008 , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; crs report rl33396 , the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis , and malaria : progress report and issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report rl33771 , trends in u.s. global aids spending : fy2000-fy2008 , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
in a nationwide address on september 7 , 2003 , the president announced that he would request an additional $ 87 billion for ongoing military operations and for reconstruction assistance in iraq , afghanistan , and elsewhere . on september 17 , the white house submitted a formal request forfy2004 supplemental appropriations of that amount to congress . administration officials said theywould like to see congressional action completed some time before october 24 , when aninternational donors conference was scheduled to meet in madrid to seek pledges of economicassistance for iraq . on october 29 , house and senate appropriators announced a conference agreement , on h.r . 3289 , a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations and forreconstruction assistance in iraq and afghanistan . the house approved the conference agreementby a vote of 298-121 on october 31 , and the senate approved the measure by voice vote onnovember 3. the president signed the bill into law , p.l . 108-106 , on november 6. the key issue in congress was whether to provide reconstruction assistance to iraq entirely as grants or partly as loans . the conference committee rejected a senate proposal to provide about halfof the iraq reconstruction assistance as loans . on other issues , conferees eliminated a senateprovision adding 10,000 troops to the army for peacekeeping duties ; agreed to a modified versionof a senate provision to provide health insurance through the dod tricare program fornon - activated military reservists not eligible for employer - provided health insurance ; cut theadministration request for reconstruction assistance to iraq by $ 1.655 billion as in the house billrather than by $ 1.855 million as in the senate bill ; agreed to provide $ 400 million more forafghanistan than the administration requested , as in the house bill ; agreed to provided $ 245 millionfor assessed costs of u.n. peacekeeping in liberia , as in the house bill ; agreed to provide anadditional $ 100 million for liberia and $ 10 million for sudan for humanitarian assistance ; eliminated a house provision to require that iraq reconstruction be coordinated by asenate - confirmed official ; and did not include $ 1.3 billion for veterans health benefits that was inthe senate bill ( which may be provided instead in the pending va - hud - independent agenciesappropriations bill ) . the conference agreement also provides $ 500 million for the federalemergency management agency ( fema ) for disaster relief for hurricane isabel and the californiawildfires . in earlier floor action , congress rejected proposals to roll back tax cuts to pay for the bill ; to shift funds from iraq reconstruction to domestic programs ; to make release of funds conditional onspecific requirements ; and to transfer control of iraq reconstruction from the defense departmentto the state department .
industrial hemp is an agricultural commodity that is cultivated for use in the production of a wide range of products , including foods and beverages , cosmetics and personal care products , nutritional supplements , fabrics and textiles , yarns and spun fibers , paper , construction and insulation materials , and other manufactured goods . hemp can be grown as a fiber , seed , or other dual - purpose crop . however , hemp is also from the same species of plant , cannabis sativa , as marijuana . as a result , production in the united states is restricted due to hemp 's association with marijuana , and the u.s. market is largely dependent on imports , both as finished hemp - containing products and as ingredients for use in further processing ( mostly from canada and china ) . current industry estimates report u.s. hemp sales at nearly $ 700 million annually . in the early 1990s there was a sustained resurgence of interest to allow for commercial hemp cultivation in the united states . several states conducted economic or market studies and initiated or enacted legislation to expand state - level resources and production . congress made significant changes to federal policies regarding hemp in the 2014 farm bill ( agricultural act of 2014 ( p.l . 113-79 , §7606 ) . the 2014 farm bill provided that certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture may grow hemp under an agricultural pilot program . the bill further established a statutory definition for industrial hemp as `` the plant cannabis sativa l. and any part of such plant , whether growing or not , with a delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis . . delta - 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the dominant psychotrophic ingredient in cannabis sativa . in subsequent omnibus appropriations , congress has blocked the u.s. drug enforcement administration ( dea ) and federal law enforcement authorities from interfering with state agencies , hemp growers , and agricultural research . appropriators have also blocked the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) from prohibiting the transportation , processing , sale , or use of industrial hemp that is grown or cultivated in accordance with the 2014 farm bill provision . despite these efforts , industrial hemp continues to be subject to u.s. drug laws , and growing industrial hemp is restricted . under current u.s. drug policy , all cannabis varieties — including industrial hemp — are considered schedule i controlled substances under the controlled substances act ( csa , 21 u.s.c . §§801 et seq . ) . although hemp production is generally allowed following requirements under the 2014 farm bill , some aspects of production remain subject to dea oversight , including the importation of viable seeds , which still requires dea registration according to the controlled substances import and export act ( 21 u.s.c . §§951-971 ) . other guidance from dea , usda , and the food and drug administration provides additional clarification regarding federal authorities ' position on hemp and its future policies regarding its cultivation and marketing . this guidance supports dea 's contention that the commercial sale or interstate transfer of industrial hemp continues to be restricted . congress has continued to introduce legislation to further advance industrial hemp and address these types of concerns in the next farm bill . introduced legislation as part of the industrial hemp farming act — first introduced in the 109th congress and greatly expanded over the past few years — seeks to further facilitate hemp production in the united states but would also amend the csa to specify that the term marijuana does not include industrial hemp . an expanded version of this bill was introduced in the 115th congress in both the house and senate ( h.r . 5485 ; s. 2667 ) . many of the provisions in these bills are included in the senate - passed 2018 farm bill ( h.r . 2 ) that is now being debated in congress . similar provisions are not part of the house version of the 2018 farm bill ( h.r . 2 ) . myriad other bills introduced in both the house and the senate would further amend the csa and other federal laws to address industrial hemp .
intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( isr ) functions are principal elements of u.s.defense capabilities , and include a wide variety of systems for acquiring and processing informationneeded by national security decisionmakers and military commanders . isr systems range in sizefrom hand - held devices to orbiting satellites . some collect basic information for a wide range ofanalytical products ; others are designed to acquire data for specific weapons systems . some are '' national '' systems intended primarily to collect information of interest to washington - area agencies ; others are `` tactical '' systems intended to support military commanders on the battlefield . collectively , they account for a major portion of u.s. intelligence spending that , according to mediaestimates , amounts to some $ 40 billion annually . for some time congress has expressed concern about the costs and management of isrprograms . with minor exceptions , isr acquisition has been coordinated by the defense departmentand the intelligence community . although there are long - existing staff mechanisms for reviewingand coordinating isr programs in the context of the annual budget submissions , many in congressbelieve that existing procedures have not avoided duplication of effort , excessive costs , and gaps incoverage . examples that some observers cite are separate efforts to acquire a new generation ofreconnaissance satellites and a high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) known as global hawk . both systems acquire some of the same sorts of information and serve similar customers , but theyare acquired in distinctly different ways ; moreover , in both cases procurement efforts have beenbeset by increasing costs and schedule delays . recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of isr capabilities and require that thedefense department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of isr capabilitiesover the next fifteen years . an effective roadmap , if developed , could potentially ensure morecomprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money . to establish responsibilityfor an intelligence community - wide effort , the 9 / 11 commission recommended that a new positionof director of national intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program ( butnot joint military and tactical intelligence programs , which would continue to be managed by thedefense department ) . this position was included , after extended debate , in the intelligence reformand terrorism prevention act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-458 ) that was approved by the president ondecember 17 , 2004. the implications of this legislation for isr programs are as yet uncertain , butcongress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long - existing concernswith isr programs . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
when the soviet union collapsed in late 1991 , it reportedly possessed more than 27,000 nuclear weapons , and these weapons were deployed on the territories of several of the former sovietrepublics . all of the nuclear warheads have now been moved to russia , but russia still has around5,500 strategic nuclear weapons and perhaps as many as 12,000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclearweapons . many analysts in the united states and russia have expressed concerns about the safety , security , and control over these weapons . some of these concerns focus on russia 's nuclearcommand and control structure . financial constraints have slowed the modernization andreplacement of many aging satellites and communications links , raising the possibility that russiamight not be able to identify a potential attack or communicate with troops in the field if an attackwere underway . some fear that the misinterpretation of an ambiguous event might lead to thelaunch of nuclear weapons . some also expressed concern that the year 2000 computer bug couldaffect russia 's command and control system , but it did not . some concerns are also focused on the safety and security of nuclear warheads in storage facilities in russia . press reports and statements by russian officials about possible missingwarheads have added to these concerns . however , general eugene habiger , former commander - in - chief of theu.s . strategic command , stated that he had no major concerns about security at russiannuclear storage facilities after he visited several storage sites in oct. 1997 and june 1998. the united states and russia are cooperating in many fora to improve the safety , security , and control over russia 's nuclear weapons and materials . through the nunn - lugar cooperative threatreduction ( ctr ) program , the u.s. department of defense has provided assistance worth nearly $ 2 billion to help russia , ukraine , kazakhstan , and belarus safely transport and store weapons andeliminate launchers under the start treaties . the department of energy 's materials protection , control and accounting program is helping russia and other former soviet republics secure nuclearmaterials at research and other facilities in the former soviet union . the nations have also heldbilateral meetings to identify ways in which they might cooperate to improve security and resolveconcerns . this report will not be updated . for current information on u.s. and russian efforts to address concerns about the safety and security of russian nuclear weapons and materials see crs report rl31957 , nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance : u.s. programs in the former sovietunion .
the public utility holding company act of 1935 ( puhca ) and the federal power act ( fpa ) were enacted to eliminate unfair practices and other abuses by electricity and gas holdingcompanies by requiring federal control and regulation of interstate public utility holding companies . prior to puhca , electricity holding companies were characterized as having excessive consumerrates , high debt - to - equity ratios , and unreliable service . puhca remained virtually unchanged for50 years until enactment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978. purpa was , in part , intended to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and toprovide equitable rates to electric consumers . qualifying facilities ( qfs ) are exempt from regulationunder puhca and the fpa . electricity regulation was changed again in 1992 with passage of the energy policy act ( epact ) . the intent of title 7 of epact is to increase competition in the electric generating sectorby creating new entities , called `` exempt wholesale generators '' ( ewgs ) , that can generate and sellelectricity at wholesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca . this title also providesewgs with a way to assure transmission of their wholesale power to their purchasers . the effect ofthis act on the electric supply system has been more far - reaching than purpa . on april 24 , 1996 , the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) issued orders 888and 889. ferc issued these rules to remedy undue discrimination in transmission services ininterstate commerce and provide an orderly and fair transition to competitive bulk power markets.order 2000 , issued december 20 , 1999 , established criteria for forming transmission organizations . comprehensive electricity legislation may involve several components . the first is puhcareform . some electric utilities want puhca changed so they can more easily diversify their assets . state regulators have expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses , including cross - subsidization . consumer groups have expressed concern that a repeal of puhcacould exacerbate market power abuses in a monopolistic industry where true competition does notyet exist . the second issue is purpa 's requirement that utilities purchase power from qfs . manyinvestor - owned utilities support repeal of these mandatory purchase provisions . they argue that theirstate regulators ' `` misguided '' implementation of purpa has forced them to pay contractually highprices for power that they do not need . opponents of this legislation argue that it would decreasecompetition and impede development of renewable energy . the third main issue is reliability . without mandatory and enforceable reliability standards , proponents argue that reliability of the electric power system will not be at acceptable levels . opponents say these standards are unnecessary . this report will be updated as events warrant .
distributional issues often lie at the center of tax policy debates . distributional analysis may address several issues : how should the tax burden be distributed or , are progressive ( increasing as a share of income as income rises ) taxes justified ? . what is the estimated distribution of the current system ? . how does a particular proposal change that distribution ? . unlike many analyses that study optimal behavior related to allocative issues and economic efficiency , economic analysis can not be used to answer the questions of how the tax burden should be distributed . such an answer would depend on social preferences . economic analysis can , however , identify trade - offs and frame the issue analytically . for example , a number of plausible answers to this question could justify progressive tax structures . methodological issues , such as the income classifier , the unit of analysis , and assumptions regarding incidence all affect the estimates of the distribution of the current tax burden . yet all show a similar qualitative result : the federal tax system is progressive throughout its range , although it tends to get much flatter at the top . this pattern is primarily due to the individual income tax , which is quite progressive , and actually provides subsidies at lower - income levels . the other major tax is the payroll tax , which is a larger burden than the individual income tax for more than 80 % of the population . this tax is first progressive and then regressive ( effective tax rates fall with income ) . the corporate income and the estate taxes , while much smaller , are also progressive , whereas excise taxes are regressive . this overall progressive pattern has been in place historically , and is expected to continue in the future , although effective tax rates are currently low compared with other periods . unlike the federal tax system , state and local taxes tend to be regressive . thus , a progressive federal tax system would be necessary to prevent overall u.s. taxes from being regressive . the combined taxes appear slightly progressive . looking at taxes from a lifetime perspective would move the system more toward a proportional tax because average lifetime incomes reduces the variability of income . studies have suggested that overall lifetime taxes are roughly proportional to income . many different measures have been used to characterize the effects of a particular tax change on the distribution of income . a very different impression of tax changes may be obtained depending on the measure used . one popular measure , the percentage change in tax , can be misleading , because as taxes become very small even a negligible absolute change in taxes leads to a very large percentage change . for measuring the relative distribution of income , percentage change in disposable income provides a better measure of how resources are distributed . by this measure , the recent tax cuts made incomes less equal . this report will not be updated .
people obtain insurance to protect themselves against the possibility of financial loss in the future . health insurance provides protection against the possibility of financial loss due to high health care expenses . also , people do not know ahead of time exactly what their health care expenses will be , so paying for health insurance on a regular basis helps ease their out - of - pocket spending . while health coverage continues to be mostly a private enterprise in this country , government plays an increasingly significant role . government has initiated and responded to dynamics in medicine , the economy , and the workplace through legislation and public policies . one of the most recent efforts was enactment and ongoing implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ; p.l . 111-148 , as amended ) . aca includes provisions to encourage the expansion of health insurance coverage , and establish new federal health insurance standards , among other reforms . americans obtain health insurance in different settings and through a variety of methods . in 2013 , a majority ( 64.2 % ) of americans obtained health insurance through the private sector , which includes both employer - sponsored and individual market coverage . public programs ( medicare , medicaid / chip , or health services for military servicemembers and veterans ) provided coverage to 34.3 % of americans . approximately 13.4 % of americans were uninsured for the entire year of 2013. health insurance benefits are delivered and financed under different systems . the factors that distinguish one delivery system from another are many , including how health care is financed , how much access to providers and services is controlled , and how much authority the enrollee has to design her / his health plan . to illustrate , managed care is characterized by predetermined restrictions on accessing services and providers , whereas individual decision - making regarding use of health benefits is a hallmark of consumer driven health care , such as health savings accounts . as economic conditions change , a specific delivery system may gain or lose the interest of affected parties .
for decades , congress has enacted laws authorizing generic promotion programs for anumber of farm products to increase overall demand and consumption of the agricultural product . these generic promotion programs , commonly known as `` check - off '' programs , are funded throughthe payment of mandatory assessments imposed on the amount of product that a covered party sells , produces , or imports . some producers have opposed the use of generic advertisements and havebrought first amendment challenges in court . generally , these parties claim that they should notbe required to pay for advertisements ( i.e . , speech ) with which they disagree . the supreme court has ruled on the constitutionality of check - off programs three times inthe last eight years , the most recent of which occurred in may 2005. the court 's first two attemptsat addressing first amendment challenges to check - off programs resulted in contrasting outcomesand some confusion for lower courts . in johanns v. livestock marketing association , the supremecourt 's third and most recent decision concerning a check - off program ( beef ) , the court ruled thatthe generic advertising under the program was the government 's own speech , and was therefore notsusceptible to the first amendment challenge before it . the supreme court 's decision was basedon grounds that had not been previously addressed by the court in the earlier check - off cases andmay have far - reaching effects . for example , three circuit court rulings that invalidated othercheck - off programs have already been vacated by the court for reconsideration in light of johanns . this report begins with a brief introduction to check - off programs and then describes manyof the first amendment principles that have been discussed in check - off cases . next is an analysisof the first two challenges that reached the supreme court , as well as a brief discussion ofsubsequent lower court decisions . this report concludes with a discussion of johanns v. livestockmarketing association and its possible implications for check - off programs . this report will beupdated as warranted .
as a result of falling age - specific mortality , life expectancy rose dramatically in the united states over the past century . final data for 2003 ( the most recent available ) show that life expectancy at birth for the total population has reached an all - time american high level , 77.5 years , up from 49.2 years at the turn of the 20 th century . record - high life expectancies were found for white females ( 80.5 years ) and black females ( 76.1 years ) , as well as for white males ( 75.3 years ) and black males ( 69.0 years ) . life expectancy gaps between males and females and between whites and blacks persisted . in combination with decreasing fertility , the life expectancy gains have led to a rapid aging of the american population , as reflected by an increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and older . this report documents the improvements in longevity that have occurred , analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions and the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race . in addition , it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years . detailed statistics on life expectancy are provided . a brief comparison with other countries is also provided . while this report focuses on a description of the demographic context of life expectancy change in the united states , these trends have implications for a wide range of social and economic programs and issues that are likely to be considered by congress . this report will be updated upon release of final data for 2004 by the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) .
persons suspected of criminal or terrorist activity may be transferred from one state ( i.e . , country ) to another for arrest , detention , and / or interrogation . commonly , this is done through extradition , by which one state surrenders a person within its jurisdiction to a requesting state via a formal legal process , typically established by treaty . far less often , such transfers are effectuated through a process known as `` extraordinary rendition '' or `` irregular rendition . . these terms have often been used to refer to the extrajudicial transfer of a person from one state to another . in this report , `` rendition '' refers to extraordinary or irregular renditions unless otherwise specified . although the particularities regarding the usage of extraordinary renditions and the legal authority behind such renditions are not publicly available , various u.s. officials have acknowledged the practice 's existence . during the bush administration , there was controversy over the use of renditions by the united states , particularly with regard to the alleged transfer of suspected terrorists to countries known to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture , purportedly with the knowledge or acquiescence of the united states . in january 2009 , president obama issued an executive order creating a special task force to review u.s. transfer policies , including the practice of rendition , to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements . in august , the task force issued recommendations to ensure that u.s. transfer practices comply with applicable standards and do not result in the transfer of persons to face torture . these recommendations include strengthening procedures used to obtain assurances from a country that a person will not face torture if transferred there , and the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the treatment of transferred persons . this report discusses relevant international and domestic law restricting the transfer of persons to foreign states for the purpose of torture . the u.n. convention against torture and other cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment ( cat ) , and its domestic implementing legislation ( the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 ) impose the primary legal restrictions on the transfer of persons to countries where they would face torture . both cat and u.s. implementing legislation generally prohibit the rendition of persons to countries in most cases where they would more likely than not be tortured , though there are arguably limited exceptions to this prohibition . historically , the state department has taken the position that cat 's provisions concerning the transfer of persons do not apply extraterritorially , though as a matter of policy the united states does not transfer persons in its custody to countries where they would face torture ( u.s. regulations and statutes implementing cat , however , arguably limit the extraterritorial transfer of individuals nonetheless ) . under u.s. regulations implementing cat , a person may be transferred to a country that provides credible assurances that the rendered person will not be tortured . neither cat nor its implementing legislation prohibits the rendition of persons to countries where they would be subject to harsh treatment not rising to the level of torture . besides cat , additional obligations may be imposed upon u.s. rendition practice via the geneva conventions , the war crimes act ( as amended by the military commissions act ( p.l . 109-366 ) , the international covenant on civil and political rights ( iccpr ) , and the universal declaration on human rights . legislation was introduced in the 110th congress to limit or bar u.s. participation in renditions . it is possible that similar legislation will be proposed in the 111th congress .
enhancing border and transportation security ( bts ) are essential strategies for improving andmaintaining homeland security . border security entails regulating the flow of traffic across thenation 's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods and people are detected and denied entry.this requires a sophisticated border management system that balances the need for securing thenation 's borders with facilitating the essential free flow of legitimate commerce , citizens , andauthorized visitors . transportation security involves securing the flow of people and goods alongthe nation 's highways , railways , airways , and waterways . ( for more information on the complexityof the bts challenge , see crs report rl32839 , border and transportation security : thecomplexity of the challenge , by [ author name scrubbed ] . ) . while in the immediate aftermath of 9 / 11 effortsprimarily concentrated on an expanded federal role in aviation security ( in particular on theheightened screening of passengers and baggage ) , increasingly attention is being turned towardsother modes of transportation . the effective implementation of border and transportation security measures requires theparticipation of numerous agencies . federal responsibility for border and transportation securityefforts is primarily contained within the department of homeland security ( dhs ) . dhs 's borderand transportation security directorate houses : the bureau of customs and border protection ( cbp ) , which has responsibility for security at and between ports - of - entry along the border ; thebureau of customs and immigration enforcement ( ice ) , which has responsibility for investigatingand enforcing the nation 's customs and immigration laws ; and the transportation securityadministration ( tsa ) , which is responsible for the security of the nation 's transportation systems . the u.s. coast guard is a stand - alone agency within dhs , and has primary responsibility for themaritime components of homeland security ( u.s. ports , coastal and inland waterways , and territorialwaters ) . dhs 's citizenship and immigration services bureau ( uscis ) is charged with approvingimmigrant petitions . in addition , the department of state 's ( dos ) bureau of consular affairs isresponsible for issuing visas ; and the department of justice 's ( doj 's ) executive office forimmigration review ( eoir ) has a significant policy role through its adjudicatory decisions onspecific immigration cases . for more information on border agencies , see crs report rs21899 , border security : key agencies and their missions , by [ author name scrubbed ] . for more information oncurrent bts programs and policies , see crs report rl32840 , border and transportation security : selected programs and policies , by [ author name scrubbed ] et al . this report provides a summary of the roles and responsibilities of various federal agenciesengaged in border and transportation security activities ; describes selected concepts and termsprominent in border and transportation security debates ; and discusses selected issues that might beof interest to the 109th congress . for more information on bts policy options , see crs report rl32841 , border and transportation security : possible new directions and policy options , bywilliam robinson et al . this report will be updated as significant developments occur . key policy staff : border and transportation securit .
this report provides a chronology of selected events leading up to and following thediscoveries of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , or `` mad cow disease '' ) in north america . these are primarily regulatory , legal , and congressional developments that are frequently referencedin the ongoing policy debate . the chronology generally does not contain entries for the introductionof the many bse - related bills introduced into this or previous congresses , except for those in recentyears where committee or floor action has occurred . this report , which will be updated if significantdevelopments ensue , is intended to be used alongside other crs reports that provide morebackground and context for the bse policy debate , and that cover many specific legislativeproposals . the chronology begins in 1986 , when bse was first identified by a british laboratory . asthe united kingdom and others attempted to understand and contain bse , the u.s. and canadiangovernments were establishing panels to study the disease and began instituting a series ofsafeguards aimed at keeping it out of north america or stopping any spread if it should occur here . the chronology proceeds into may 2003 , when canada reported the first native case in northamerica ; december 2003 , when the united states reported finding a case in a u.s. herd ; and mostof 2004 , when both countries worked to reassure consumers of the safety of north american cattleand beef and to reopen foreign markets blocking these exports . u.s. and canadian officials since2003 also have been strengthening various regulatory safeguards aimed at protecting the cattle herdand the food supply from bse . the chronology continues with major events of 2004 , 2005 , and the first half of 2006 , whichhave revolved around efforts to re - establish more open cattle and beef trade within north america , even while a handful of new cases of bse have emerged here , and the steps being taken to regainthe japanese and korean markets , which were until december 2003 two of the four leading foreignbuyers of u.s. beef . both were closed as of mid - 2006 ( although japan appeared on the verge ofreopening as of this writing ) . congress can be expected to continue to play a role , holding oversighthearings , providing funding for bse - related activities , and possibly considering legislative optionsto address one or more of the outstanding issues .
climate change is viewed as a global issue , but proposed responses generally require action at the national level . in 1992 , the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) , which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases . over the past 16 years , a variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states , including monitoring of electric utility carbon dioxide emissions , improved appliance efficiency , and incentives for developing renewable energy sources . this report provides background on the evolution of u.s. climate change policy , from ratification of the unfccc to the george w. bush administration 's 2001 rejection of the kyoto protocol to the present . recent federal court decisions — most notably the supreme court 's 2007 decision in massachusetts v. epa that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act — have raised the issue of whether epa should directly regulate greenhouse gases . this report focuses on major regulatory programs that monitor or reduce greenhouse gas emissions , along with their estimated effect on emissions levels . the george h. w. bush , clinton , and george w. bush administrations largely relied on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions . this focus was particularly evident in the current administration 's 2006 climate action report ( car ) , submitted under the provisions of the unfccc . of roughly 50 programs summarized in the 2006 car , seven were described as `` regulatory . . however , this small subset of the total u.s. effort accounts for a large share of greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved over the past decade - and - a - half . in general , these efforts were established and implemented in response to concerns other than climate change , such as energy efficiency and air quality . the energy policy act of 2005 ( p.l . 109-58 ) included provisions indirectly related to greenhouse gas emissions , such as energy efficiency and renewable energy . the energy independence and security act of 2007 ( p.l . 110-140 ) addresses renewable energy and conservation , but also includes provisions specifically on climate change . these include a requirement for the use of renewable fuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuels , and the establishment of an office of climate change and environment in the department of transportation to implement research on mitigating the causes and addressing the effects of climate change on transportation . in june 2008 , the senate considered a bill ( s. 3036 ) to establish an economy - wide cap - and - trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . however , after discussion , a cloture motion on this bill failed , and the bill was tabled . while some provisions in energy laws enacted over the past 16 years have led to lower greenhouse gas emissions or addressed climate change directly , other provisions in those same laws have almost certainly resulted in higher emissions . to date , no energy law has had reducing greenhouse gas emissions as the main organizing principle . energy - related activities are responsible for about 86 % of the country 's greenhouse gas emissions , and 98 % of its carbon dioxide emissions . climate change policy directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions must address energy supply and consumption and , thus , be integrated with energy policy . this will be a pivotal challenge to the 111th congress 's and the incoming administration 's anticipated efforts to enact legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
the house of representatives resolves into the committee of the whole , a parliamentary device designed to allow greater participation by members in debate , to consider most major measures . various rules and procedures govern how and when members can engage in debate , offer amendments , make motions and requests , and take other actions in the committee of the whole . in addition , measures considered in the committee of the whole typically are subject to conditions governing debate and amendments that are specified by a special rule or a unanimous consent agreement . time during general debate is controlled by the chair and ranking member of the committee that reported the measure under consideration . these members , called floor managers , determine who may speak , for how long , and in what order . time during the amendment process is sometimes controlled in a similar way under the terms of a special rule . alternatively , the amending process might proceed under the `` five - minute rule , '' whereby the proponent and an opponent of an amendment are recognized by the chair of the committee of the whole for five minutes each . additional members may offer `` pro forma amendments '' solely for the purpose of gaining recognition to speak for five minutes . in some circumstances , members might make motions to close or limit five - minute debate . if a member believes a pending matter violates a house rule , he or she may make a point of order against it ; a member may also reserve a point of order to be made later against an amendment . a ruling by the chair as to whether a matter violates a house rule may be appealed . a member might also make a parliamentary inquiry to ask a question about a procedural situation . some actions can be taken in the committee of the whole by unanimous consent ; however , a member can not ask unanimous consent to take actions in committee of the whole that are properly performed by the house or that substantially modify conditions established by a special order agreed to by the house . the committee of the whole resolves back into the house proper by `` rising . . members might make a motion simply to rise , when the committee of the whole has not concluded consideration of a measure , or to rise and report , when consideration has concluded . special rules usually include language that makes a motion to rise and report unnecessary . members occasionally make the motion to rise and report with the recommendation to strike the enacting clause . a quorum for conducting business in the committee of the whole is 100 members , but a quorum is presumed to be present unless it is otherwise demonstrated through a process that begins when a member makes a point of order on the floor . three kinds of votes can take place in the committee of the whole : voice , division , and recorded .
s. 5 , the class action fairness act of 2005 has three main sections : ( 1 ) anamendment to the federal diversity statute ; ( 2 ) a provision regarding removal ; and ( 3 ) a consumerclass action `` bill of rights . . it would control and restrict class action lawsuits by shifting some ofthe suits from state to federal courts . this would be achieved by creating federal jurisdiction overclass action suits when the total amount in dispute exceeds $ 5,000,000 and when any plaintiff livesin a state different from that of any defendant . the bill would treat certain `` mass actions '' with morethan 100 plaintiffs as class actions for purposes of jurisdiction . s. 5 would requirejudges to review all settlements based on the issuance of coupons to plaintiffs and limit attorney'sfees to the value of the coupon settlements actually received by class members . it would also requirecareful scrutiny of `` net loss '' settlements in which class members ultimately lose money . thelegislation would ban settlements that award some class members a larger recovery because they livecloser to the court . it would allow federal courts to maximize the benefits of class actionsettlements . among other things , s. 5 would also require that a notice of proposedsettlements be provided to the appropriate state and federal officials such as the state attorneysgeneral . it was reported out of the senate judiciary committee without amendment . on february10 , 2005 , the senate passed s. 5 ( 72-26 ) without amendment . on february 17 , 2005 , the house also passed s. 5 without amendment , 279-149 and it is expected to be signedby the president .
u.s. relations with india depend largely on india 's political leadership . india 's 2004 nationalelections ended governance by the center - right coalition headed by prime minister atal biharivajpayee and brought in a new center - left coalition led by prime minister manmohan singh . following the upset victory for the historically - dominant indian national congress party led bysonia gandhi , gandhi declined the post of prime minister in the new left - leaning united progressivealliance ( upa ) coalition government , instead nominating her party lieutenant , oxford - educatedeconomist manmohan singh , for the job . as finance minister from 1991-1996 , singh was thearchitect of major indian economic reform and liberalization efforts . on may 22 , thewidely - esteemed sikh became india 's first - ever non - hindu prime minister . the defeated bharatiyajanata party now sits in opposition at the national level , led in parliament by former deputy primeminister lal advani . a coalition of communist parties supports the upa , but new delhi'seconomic , foreign , and security policies are not expected to be significantly altered . the newgovernment has vowed to continue close and positive engagement with the united states in all areas . this report , which will not be updated , provides an overview of the elections , key parties , and u.s.policy interests .
on december 17 , 2003 , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) issued a proposed rule to address the effect of interstate transport of air pollutants on non - attainment of the nationalambient air quality standards ( naaqs ) for fine particulates ( pm 2.5 ) and ozone ( specifically , the8-hour standard ) . the proposed interstate air quality ( iaq ) rule appeared in the federal register january 30 , 2004. for pm 2.5 , the proposed rule finds that the interstate transport of sulfur dioxide ( so 2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( nox ) from 28 states and the district of columbia contributessignificantly to downwind non - attainment ; for ozone , the proposed rule finds that interstate transportof nox from 25 states and d.c. contributes significantly to downwind non - attainment of the 8-hourstandard . with the iaq rule , epa proposes a region - wide emissions cap for nox and so 2 to be implemented in two phases -- 2010 and 2015. based on the methodology employed in the proposedrule , epa estimates reductions of about 70 % from baseline emissions in 2015. epa 's methodologydetermined the caps by applying `` highly cost effective '' pollution controls on electric generatingunits . epa has presented the proposed iaq rule and the accompanying proposed mercury ( hg ) rule as a `` suite of integrated air actions '' to reduce emissions of three pollutants -- so 2 , nox , and hg . the two proposed rules are integrated in such a way that the technologies reducing so 2 and noxemissions under the iaq rule also reduce enough hg emissions to meet the modest 2010 reductionrequirements of the proposed hg rule . this combination of requirements and technology allowsutilities to meet the requirements of both rules without installing three different control technologies -- one for each pollutant . as epa does not provide a cost - benefit analysis of hg reductions , it is notpossible to quantitatively determine whether this decision is economically efficient in terms ofpotential hg benefits foregone by not imposing a more stringent reduction requirement . however , from the broader perspective of the interaction of the proposed rules with the underlying clean air act ( caa ) , there is a resulting lack of integration . it is likely to be argued thatthe proposed rule simply represents another layer on an already multi - layered cake called the cleanair act . adding a regionwide annual cap and trade program onto a regulatory structure whosefoundation is health - based national standards that focus on the local concentration of pollutants inthe ambient air presents numerous difficulties . as a result , there are multiple inconsistencies betweenthe proposed rule and other provisions of the caa . these conflicts are not surprising -- there islittle epa can do to resolve them out by regulation . if the administration 's goal is to restructurecaa compliance strategies toward market - oriented cap and trade programs without creating morelayers and conflicts , it is possible a statutory solution will be necessary . this report will be updated if events warrant .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) issued changes to grazing regulations ( 43 c.f.r . part 4100 ) on august 11 , 2006 , after a three year review . some portions of the regulations have been enjoined . the previous major revision of grazing rules , which took effect in 1995 , was highly controversial . the 2006 changes addressed many of the same issues , and received mixed reviews . blm asserted that the 2006 changes were needed to increase flexibility for grazing managers and permittees , to improve rangeland management and grazing permit administration , to promote conservation , and to comply with court decisions . critics contend that a need for change was not justified and that changes adopted removed important environmental protections and opportunities for public comment . under the 2006 changes , the blm and a permittee could share title to structural range improvements , such as a fence . permittees could acquire water rights for grazing , consistent with state law . the occasions on which blm would be required to get input from the public on grazing decisions were reduced . the administrative appeals process on grazing decisions was modified and the extent to which grazing could continue in the face of an appeal or stay of a decision was delineated . the definition of grazing preference was broadened to include a quantitative meaning — forage on public land . changes were made to the timeframe and procedures for changing grazing management after a determination that grazing is a significant factor in failing to achieve rangeland health standards . the three - year limit on temporary nonuse of a permit was removed , and permittees are able to apply for nonuse of a permit for up to one year at a time . conservation use grazing permits were eliminated . changes that have been enjoined relate primarily to public participation , sharing title to range improvements , and fundamentals of rangeland health . blm also considered , but did not propose , certain changes due to adverse public reaction or other considerations . on june 17 , 2005 , blm had issued a final environmental impact statement ( feis ) analyzing the potential impact of proposed changes in the regulations , an alternative , and the status quo . on march 31 , 2006 , blm published an addendum to the feis addressing public comment received after the closing date of march 2 , 2004 , primarily from the fish and wildlife service . final regulatory changes took effect august 11 , 2006. blm also considered , but did not make , changes to its grazing policies , which the agency had believed could be carried out under existing rules . potential changes that were examined included the establishment of reserve common allotments to serve as backup forage when permittees ' regular allotments are unavailable ; conservation partnerships between the blm and permittees whereby permittees work to improve environmental health in return for certain benefits ; voluntary allotment restructuring to allow multiple permittees to merge allotments ; conservation easement acquisition to preserve open space ; and landscape habitat improvement to promote species conservation and facilitate consultations under the endangered species act .
the 113th congress may consider a comprehensive reform of the nation 's immigration system ( cir ) , and during such discussions , the detention of noncitizens in the united states might be an issue . congress may choose to reevaluate detention priorities ( i.e . , who should be detained , when they should be detained ) and detention resources . under the law , there is broad authority to detain foreign nationals ( aliens / noncitizens ) while awaiting a determination of whether the noncitizen should be removed from the united states . the law also mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention ( i.e . , the aliens must be detained ) . aliens subject to mandatory detention include those arriving without documentation or with fraudulent documentation , those who are inadmissible or deportable on criminal grounds , those who are inadmissible or deportable on national security grounds , those certified as terrorist suspects , and those who have final orders of deportation . aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained , paroled , or released on bond . the priorities for detention of these aliens are specified in statute and regulations . for example , the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) increased the categories of aliens subject to mandatory detention . this increase has raised concerns about the justness of mandatory detention , especially as it is applied to asylum seekers arriving without proper documentation . as of december 22 , 2012 , on an average day in fy2013 , there were 34,696 noncitizens in department of homeland security ( dhs ) custody . the amount of detention space is almost exclusively controlled by congress through appropriations , and congress has been active in providing oversight of detention space allocations and detention conditions . since fy2002 , congress has increased the number of funded detention beds from 21,109 beds to 34,000 beds . as dhs increases its ability to identify aliens who are subject to removal from local jails in more remote locations , the nationwide allocation of detention space may become an issue . furthermore , the detention policy for aliens who have received a final order of removal may also be a congressional concern . after a final removal order has been issued against an alien , the law provides that the alien be removed within 90 days , except as otherwise provided in the statute . certain aliens subject to a removal order `` may be detained beyond the removal period and , if released , shall be subject to [ certain ] terms of supervision . . this provision had been interpreted as permitting indefinite detention where removal was not reasonably foreseeable , but in 2001 , the u.s. supreme court in zadvydas v. davis , interpreted it as only permitting detention for up to six months where removal was not reasonably foreseeable . nonetheless , the u.s. supreme court stated that its ruling was made `` absent clear guidance from congress '' ( i.e . , that it was not clear what congressional intent was related to detaining aliens who could not be removed within 90 days ) . comprehensive immigration reform ( cir ) bills in the 109th and 110th congress would have modified and codified the regulations regarding the detention of those with final orders of removal . in the 112th congress , h.r . 1932 , as reported by the house judiciary committee would have amended the immigration and nationality act to allow dhs to indefinitely detain , subject to six - month reviews , aliens under orders of removal who could not be removed if certain conditions were met .
the 9 / 11 commission , in its recent report on the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , criticized the u.s. intelligence community 's ( ic ) fragmented management structure and questioned whether theu.s . government , and the ic , in particular , is organized adequately to direct resources and build theintelligence capabilities that the united states will need to counter terrorism , and to address thebroader range of national security challenges in the decades ahead . the commission made a number of recommendations , one of which was to replace the current position of director of central intelligence ( dci ) with a national intelligence director ( nid ) whowould oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest -- including a nationalcounterterrorism center ( nctc ) -- across the u.s. government , manage the national intelligence program ; oversee the agencies that contribute to it ; and have hiring , firing , and budgetary authorityover the ic 's 15 agencies . although the commission recommended that the director be located inthe executive office of the president , the commission vice chairman in testimony before congresson september 7 , 2004 , withdrew that portion of the recommendation in light of concerns that thenid would be subject to undue influence . the commission further recommended that a deputy nidbe established to oversee the day - to - day operations of the central intelligence agency ( cia ) . thecommission 's recommendation to strengthen management authority over the ic is the latestcontribution to an ic structural reform debate that dates at least to 1955 , when arguments forstronger ic authority began to surface . omb deputy director james schlesinger in 1971 firstbroached the nid concept . congress currently is considering two principal bills , s. 2845 , introduced by senators collins and lieberman , and h.r . 10 , introduced by representative hastert , that would establish the nid position . [ for a comprehensive comparison of all recent nidlegislative proposals , see crs report rl32600 ( pdf ) and crs report rl32601 ( pdf ) ] . reactions to the concept of an nid have been mixed since its inception . supporters argue that the dci can not manage the ic , the cia and serve as the president 's chief intelligence advisor , anddo justice to any of the jobs . other than at the cia , the dci also lacks hiring , firing and budgetauthority . they argue that the absence of strong , centralized leadership has resulted in dividedmanagement of intelligence capabilities ; lack of common standards and practices across theforeign - domestic intelligence divide ; structural barriers that undermine the performance of jointintelligence work ; and a weak capacity to set priorities and move resources . opponents counter that an nid would lose day - to - day control over the cia , a natural power base and , as a result , influence . they also contend that an nid will shift the balance of control awayfrom dod , risking intelligence support to the warfighter . the congressional role includes decidingwhether to establish the position of the nid and its authority . this report will be updated as eventswarrant .
this report contains an overview of the major procurement agreements to which the unitedstates is a party , including the world trade organization ( wto ) agreement on governmentprocurement , the procurement chapter of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) andprovisions from other free trade agreements . in addition , this report highlights major federal lawsthat relate to the government - procurement obligations of the united states .
congress recently completed action on the bush administration 's fy2004 supplemental budget request to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan . it wassigned into law , p.l . 108-106 , on november 6 , 2003. a major issue in the congressional debate onthis , and other such supplementals of the past , is whether military and peacekeeping operationsshould be funded with supplemental requests or via the regular defense appropriations process . some members of congress have urged the president to include the costs of current and futureoperations in iraq and afghanistan in the department of defense 's ( dod 's ) regular appropriations , arguing that these are now ongoing operations that should be planned for and funded in the annualdefense budget . others prefer supplementals due to the unpredictability of military andpeacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan . this unpredictability , they argue , makes itextremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type of operation in advance . this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations , supplemental appropriations , or acombination of the two . the report shows that since 1990 , congress generally has funded combatoperations with supplemental appropriations . in initial stages of post - combat peacekeepingoperations , however , congress has tended to rely on a combination of supplemental and regularappropriations . as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing , congress has switched to usingregular appropriations .
the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) for five years . congress has inconclusively debatedlong - term tanf authorizations since 2002 , instead adopting short - term extensions . the latestextension ( p.l . 109-19 ) funds the program through december 31 , 2005. thus far in the 109thcongress , the senate finance committee has reported s. 667 ( s.rept . 109-51 ) . a billintroduced by house republican leaders , h.r . 240 , has received approval from thehouse ways and means committee 's subcommittee on human resources . s. 667 and h.r . 240 are very similar in terms of how they wouldcontinue funding under the tanf program . both bills extend basic tanf funding at current levels ( $ 16.6 billion for the 50 states , the district of columbia , and the territories ) through fy2010 andextend supplemental grants provided to 17 states through fy2009 . both bills provide new , categorical grants for marriage promotion activities totaling $ 200 million per year financed througha reduction in current tanf bonuses to states . the major difference in the tanf fundingprovisions of the two bills is how they provide extra contingency ( recession - related ) funding to thestates . h.r . 240 essentially extends the current law fund that provides matchinggrants to states experiencing high and increased unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads . s. 667 eliminates the requirement that states expend additional money to accesscontingency funds , and instead bases extra funding on the cost of increased caseloads for states thatmeet revised unemployment or food stamp caseload criteria . the two bills would substantially revise the tanf work participation standards that statesmust meet . under current law , 50 % of tanf families with an adult or minor household head mustparticipate , though the 50 % rate is reduced by caseload reductions that have occurred since welfarereform . both s. 667 and h.r . 240 would raise this standard to 70 % , though under both bills the standard could be reduced through credits ( though the credits differbetween the two bills ) . both also eliminate a separate 90 % participation rate requirement fortwo - parent families . both bills would raise the minimum hours required of family members in orderto be considered full participants , though h.r . 240 would raise them by morethan would s. 667. the bills also differ in the activities countable toward theparticipation standards : h.r . 240 narrows the list of activities countable , requiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work , community service , or work experienceprograms except for a short ( usually three - month ) period when states may themselves define whatcounts as `` activities . . s. 667 keeps all activities under current law as countable , andallows states to count a wider range of activities for three months ( more under some circumstances ) . both bills contain non - tanf provisions relating to child support enforcement , responsible '' fatherhood '' programs , and transitional medical assistance ( not addressed herein ) . this report willbe updated as s. 667 and h.r . 240 move through the legislative process .
the united states and many of its trading partners use laws known as trade remedies to mitigate the adverse impact of various trade practices on domestic industries and workers . u.s. antidumping ( ad ) laws ( 19 u.s.c . §1673 et seq . ) . authorize the imposition of duties if ( 1 ) the international trade administration of the department of commerce ( ita ) determines that foreign merchandise is being , or likely to be , sold in the united states at less than fair value , and ( 2 ) the u.s. international trade commission ( usitc ) determines that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury , or that the establishment of an industry is materially retarded , due to imports of that merchandise . u.s. countervailing duty laws ( 19 u.s.c . §1671 et seq . ) . authorize the imposition of countervailing duties ( cvd ) if the ita finds that the government of a country or any public entity has provided a subsidy on the manufacture , production , or export of the merchandise , and the usitc determines injury or threat thereof . u.s. safeguard laws ( 19 u.s.c . §2251 et seq . ) . authorize the president to provide temporary import relief from injurious surges of imports resulting from fairly competitive trade from all countries . other safeguard laws authorize relief for import surges from communist countries ( 19 u.s.c . §2436 ) and from china ( 19 u.s.c . §2451 ) . in each case , the usitc conducts an investigation , forwards recommendations to the president , and the president may act on the usitc 's recommendation , modify it , or take no action . these laws are deemed consistent with u.s. international obligations provided that they conform to the world trade organization ( wto ) agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures ( ascm ) and the wto agreement on implementation of article vi of the general agreement on tariffs and trade , 1994 ( ada , antidumping agreement ) agreed to as part of the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations that established the world trade organization ( wto ) , as well as other trade agreements to which the united states is a party . in the first session of the 112th congress , legislation was introduced seeking to amend trade remedy statutes , including addressing currency misalignment ( s. 1619 , s. 328 , and h.r . 639 ) in trade remedy investigations . s. 1130 and related bill s. 1267 , the strengthening america 's trade laws act , seek , in part , to provide more specific methodology for trade remedy actions in nonmarket economy countries . in the second session , h.r . 4105 seeks to specifically apply countervailing action to nonmarket economy countries in light of a december 19 , 2011 decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit that cvd action may not be applied to the imports of such countries . s. 2153 , an identical measure , passed in the senate by unanimous consent on march 5 , 2012. this report discusses , first , congressional interest in trade remedy laws , and describes legislation seeking to amend the laws in the first session of the 112th congress . second , it describes antidumping and countervailing duty laws , procedures , and investigations . third , u.s. safeguard statutes and investigative procedures are presented . finally , an appendix provides a chart outlining briefly all u.s. trade remedy statutes , major actors , and effects of these laws .
during the 108th congress , the house of representatives and the senate finance committee approved two different versions of a bill that would have reauthorized and revised the temporaryassistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant . this legislation , h.r . 4 , alsoincluded many changes to the child support enforcement ( cse ) program . h.r . 4 waspassed by the house in february 2003. the senate finance committee reported a substitute versionof the bill in september 2003 ( s.rept . 108-162 ) . on march 29-april 1 , 2004 , the senate debatedh.r . 4 ; disagreement arose regarding amendments to the bill , and republicans failed topass a motion to limit debate . h.r . 4 was not passed by the senate . although not identical , both versions of h.r . 4 were similar in focus , direction , and content with respect to the cse provisions . both versions of h.r . 4 includedprovisions that sought to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase theeconomic independence of former welfare families and provide a stable source of income for allsingle - parent families with a noncustodial parent . both versions of the bill provided incentives ( inthe form of federal cost sharing ) to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf offamilies to the families themselves , thereby reducing the amount that state and federal governmentsretain ( often referred to as a family - first policy ) . under both bills , families currently receiving tanfbenefits as well as former tanf recipients would have potentially received a larger share of childsupport that was collected on their behalf . the approach used by the bills differed significantly , however , with regard to how states would help tanf families receive more child support . under the house - passed bill , states would havebeen given federal cost sharing incentives to encourage states to increase ( or establish ) the amountof child support payments they pass through to tanf families ( and disregard in determining tanfbenefits ) . the senate finance committee version of the bill provided federal cost - sharing for theentire amount that the state disregards and passes through to families . moreover , the house - passedbill provided a more limited amount of federal cost sharing for state pass - through and disregardpolicies than the senate finance committee bill . both versions of the bill would have revised some cse enforcement tools and added others ; increased funding for the federal parent locator service ( fpls ) ; increased funding for federaltechnical assistance to the states ; required states to review child support orders of tanf familiesevery three years ; and required that a report be submitted to congress on undistributed child supportcollections . the house - passed bill included a provision that would have established a $ 25 annualuser fee for individuals who had never been on tanf but received cse services and who receivedat least $ 500 in any given year . the senate finance committee - approved bill included provisionsthat would have increased funding for the cse access and visitation program ; and required statesto adopt a later version of the uniform interstate family support act ( uifsa ) so as to facilitate thecollection of child support payments in interstate cases . this report will not be updated .
two separate but closely related issues confront congress each time the president introduces armed forces into a situation abroad that conceivably could lead to their involvement in hostilities . one issue concerns the division of war powers between the president and congress , whether the use of armed forces falls within the purview of the congressional power to declare war and the war powers resolution ( wpr ) . the other issue is whether or not congress concurs in the wisdom of the action . this report does not deal with the substantive merits of using armed forces in specific cases , but rather with congressional authorization for military action , and the application and effectiveness of the wpr . the purpose of the wpr ( p.l . 93-148 , passed over president nixon 's veto on november 7 , 1973 ) is to ensure that congress and the president share in making decisions that may get the united states involved in hostilities . compliance becomes an issue whenever the president introduces u.s. forces abroad in situations that might be construed as hostilities or imminent hostilities . criteria for compliance include prior consultation with congress , fulfillment of the reporting requirements , and congressional authorization . if the president has not complied fully , the issue becomes what action congress should take to bring about compliance or to influence u.s. policy . a related issue has been congressional authorization of u.n. peacekeeping or other u.n. - sponsored actions . for over three decades , war powers and the war powers resolution have been an issue in u.s. military actions in asia , the middle east , africa , central america , and europe . presidents have submitted 136 reports to congress as a result of the war powers resolution , although only one ( the mayaguez situation ) cited section 4 ( a ) ( 1 ) or specifically stated that forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities . congress invoked the wpr in the multinational force in lebanon resolution ( p.l . 98-119 ) , which authorized the marines to remain in lebanon for 18 months . in addition , p.l . 102-1 , enacted in january 1991 , authorizing the use of u.s. armed forces in response to iraqi aggression against kuwait , stated that it constituted specific statutory authorization within the meaning of the wpr . on november 9 , 1993 , the house used a section of the wpr to state that u.s. forces should be withdrawn from somalia by march 31 , 1994 ; congress had already taken this action in appropriations legislation . war powers have been at issue in former yugoslavia / bosnia / kosovo , iraq , and haiti . authorizing military actions in response to the terrorist attacks against the united states of september 11 , 2001 , through p.l . 107-40 directly involved war powers . the continued use of force to obtain iraqi compliance with u.n. resolutions remained a war powers issue from the end of the gulf war on february 28 , 1991 , until the enactment of p.l . 107-243 in october 2002 , which explicitly authorized the president to use force against iraq , an authority he exercised in march 2003 , and continues to exercise for military operations in iraq . most recently , issues associated with presidential compliance with the war powers resolution have arisen over his use of u.s. military forces to support a u.n. sanctioned `` no - fly zone '' in libya , without obtaining congressional authorization for such action . debate continues on whether using the war powers resolution is effective as a means of assuring congressional participation in decisions that might get the united states involved in a significant military conflict . proposals have been made to modify or repeal the resolution . none have been enacted to date . this report will be updated as events warrant .
the 110th congress took limited action to oversee implementation and funding of the endangered species act ( esa ; p.l . 93-205 , 16 u.s.c . §§ 1531-1543 ) and to consider proposals to amend the act . major issues in recent years have included the role of science in decision - making , consultation requirements for federal agencies , critical habitat ( ch ) designation and procedures , protection by and incentives for property owners , and appropriate protection of listed species , among others . in addition , many have advocated enacting as law some esa regulations promulgated during the clinton administration . esa has been one of the more contentious environmental laws . this may stem from its strict substantive provisions , which can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources . under esa , species of plants and animals ( both vertebrate and invertebrate ) can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction . once a species is listed , powerful legal tools are available to aid its recovery and protect its habitat . esa may also be controversial because dwindling species are usually harbingers of broader ecosystem decline . esa is considered a primary driver of large - scale ecosystem restoration issues . the most common cause of species listing is habitat loss . the authorization for spending under esa expired on october 1 , 1992. the prohibitions and requirements of esa remain in force , even in the absence of an authorization , and funds have been appropriated to implement the administrative provisions of esa in each subsequent fiscal year . in the 109th congress , several proposals would have reauthorized and extensively amended esa , but none were enacted . no legislative proposals were introduced in the 110th congress to reauthorize the esa . in the 110th congress , the food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l . 110-246 , included a provision amending the internal revenue code to permit the deduction of expenditures for endangered species recovery . on species of international concern , the 110th congress enacted p.l . 110-132 , reauthorizing the african elephant conservation act and the rhinoceros and tiger conservation act of 1994 through fy2012 , and p.l . 110-133 , reauthorizing the asian elephant conservation act through fy2012 . a number of bills introduced in both the house and senate to address global climate change included provisions that would have allocated funds to the fws endangered species program and to related funds to assist species adaptation to climate change . this report identifies and discusses oversight issues and legislation introduced in the 110th congress to address specific concerns related to how esa is implemented and how endangered species are managed .
the kingdom of saudi arabia , ruled by the al saud family since its founding in 1932 , wields significant global influence through its administration of the birthplace of the islamic faith and by virtue of its large oil reserves . close u.s. - saudi official relations have survived a series of challenges since the 1940s . in recent years , shared concerns over sunni islamist extremist terrorism and iranian government policies have provided some renewed logic for continued strategic cooperation . political upheaval and conflict in the middle east and north africa have created new challenges , and the trump administration has sought to strengthen u.s. ties to saudi leaders as the kingdom implements a series of new domestic and foreign policy initiatives . successive u.s. administrations have referred to the saudi government as an important partner , and u.s. arms sales and related security cooperation have continued with congressional oversight and amid some congressional opposition . the trump administration , like its recent predecessors , praises saudi government counterterrorism efforts . since 2009 , the executive branch has notified congress of proposed foreign military sales to saudi arabia of major defense articles and services with a potential aggregate value of nearly $ 139 billion . the united states and saudi arabia concluded arms sale agreements worth more than $ 65 billion , from fy2009 through fy2016 . since march 2015 , the u.s. - trained saudi military has used u.s. - origin weaponry , u.s. logistical assistance , and shared intelligence in support of military operations in yemen . legislation has been proposed in the 115th congress to condition or disapprove of some u.s. weapons sales and condition or direct the president to end u.s. support to saudi operations without specific authorization ( h.j.res . 102 , h.j.res . 104 , s.j.res . 40 , s.j.res . 42 , s.j.res . 54 , s.j.res . 55 ) . in parallel to close security ties , official u.s. reports describe restrictions on human rights and religious freedom in the kingdom . some saudi activists advocate for limited economic and political reforms , continuing decades - long trends that have seen saudi liberals , moderates , and conservatives advance different visions for domestic change . saudi leaders in 2018 reversed a long - standing ban on women 's right to drive , amid some arrests of women 's rights advocates and critics of social liberalization . while some limited protests and arrests have occurred since unrest swept the region in 2011 , clashes involving saudi security forces have not spread beyond certain predominantly shia areas of the oil - rich eastern province . since assuming the throne in 2015 , king salman bin abd al aziz ( age 82 ) has made a series of appointments and reassignments that have altered the responsibilities and relative power of leading members of the next generation of the al saud family , who are the grandsons of the kingdom 's founder . the king 's son , crown prince mohammed bin salman ( age 33 ) , is the central figure in saudi policymaking . he has asserted control over national security forces , sidelined potential rivals , proposed and begun implementing bold economic and social changes , and arrested prominent figures accused of corruption , including some fellow royal family members . ambitious plans for the transformation of the kingdom 's economy seek to provide opportunity for young saudis and bolster nonoil sources of revenues for the state . abroad , the kingdom pursues a multidirectional policy and has aggressively confronted perceived threats . saudi decisionmaking long appeared to be risk - averse and rooted in rulers ' concerns for maintaining consensus among different constituencies , including factions of the royal family , business elites , and conservative religious figures . crown prince mohammed bin salman 's assertive and more centralized leadership has challenged this model of governance . the change is leading saudis and outsiders alike to reexamine their assumptions about the kingdom 's future . congress may examine these developments when considering the scope , terms , and merits of u.s. - saudi partnership , proposed arms sales and nuclear cooperation , and security commitments .
the impoundment control act ( ica ) was included as title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 , signed into law on june 12 , 1974 ( 88 stat . 332 ) . under the ica , unless congress takes action to approve a rescission request from the president within the 45-day review period prescribed by the law , the funds must be released . with respect to a presidential rescission message , congress may approve more or less than the amount requested by the president . in addition , absent a specific request from the president , congress on its own accord may initiate rescission actions , by cancelling previously appropriated funds in a subsequent law . according to data compiled by the government accountability office ( gao ) , from fy1974 through fy2008 , presidents requested 1,178 rescissions under the ica , totaling somewhat over $ 76 billion . close to a third of the proposals were approved by congress , with approximately 40 % of the total dollar amount of presidential rescission requests ( $ 25 billion ) enacted by congress . the sum of rescissions requested by the president and subsequently enacted exceeded $ 1 billion in only four of the 35-plus years ( fy1981 , fy1982 , fy1992 and fy1994 ) . during this period congress initiated 1,880 rescission actions amounting to $ 197.1 billion , nearly eight times the total of presidentially requested rescission subsequently enacted , reflecting a trend toward an increasing number of rescissions being initiated by congress . the line item veto act of 1996 ( p.l . 93-344 ) , in effect for less than eighteen months before being overturned by the supreme court in 1998 , gave the president enhanced rescission authority by reversing the burden of action regarding rescission proposals ; cancellations of the president became permanent unless disapproved by congress ( ultimately requiring rejection by a 2 / 3 majority in both chambers ) . during this time , the president also had authority to cancel new items of direct spending and certain targeted tax benefits as well as items of discretionary spending . figures from the congressional budget office indicate that the 82 cancellations made by president clinton in fy1998 ( including those overturned ) totaled some $ 355 million , with a projected five - year savings just under $ 1 billion . president clinton 's use of the short - lived enhanced rescission authority thus was not notably different from the prior annual record of presidential rescissions under the ica framework . during his two terms in office , president george w. bush sent no formal ica rescission requests to congress , but some controversy developed over his use of alternative means to propose spending reductions . president bush , while evidently reluctant to use existing rescission authority contained in the ica , called repeatedly for enactment of a measure that would give the president greater authority to reject items of spending . such a bill passed the house in the 109th congress and was reported in the senate . a contentious issue is whether such a measure might give preference to presidential spending priorities over congressional spending priorities , arguably affecting the legislative power of the purse . during his first year in office , president barack obama sent no formal ica rescission requests to congress . on may 24 , 2010 , however , the president transmitted to congress a draft proposal , the `` reducing unnecessary spending act , '' which would establish expedited procedures for congressional consideration of certain rescission messages . this report will be updated as events warrant .
to discharge its constitutional duties , congress depends on information obtained from theexecutive branch . domestic and national security information is provided through agency reportsand direct communications from department heads , but lawmakers also receive information directlyfrom employees within the agencies . they take the initiative in notifying congress , its committees , and members of congress about alleged agency illegalities , corruption , and waste within the agency . this type of information comes from a group known as whistleblowers . through such techniques as `` gag orders '' and nondisclosure agreements , presidents haveattempted to block agency employees from coming directly to congress . in response , congress hasenacted legislation in an effort to assure the uninterrupted flow of domestic and national securityinformation to lawmakers and their staffs . members of congress have made it clear they do not wantto depend solely on information provided by agency heads . overall , the issue has been how toprotect employees who are willing to alert congress about agency wrongdoing . the first procedures enacted to protect agency whistleblowers appeared in the civil servicereform of 1978. it also contained language that excluded protections to whistleblowers who workin federal agencies involved in intelligence and counterintelligence . in 1989 , congress passed thewhistleblower protection act in an effort to strengthen statutory protections for federal employeeswho assist in the elimination of fraud , waste , abuse , illegality , and corruption . that statute continuedthe exemption for national security information . it did not authorize the disclosure of anyinformation by an agency or any person that is ( 1 ) specifically prohibited from disclosure by anyother provision of law , or ( 2 ) `` specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in theinterest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs . . several statutes apply expressly to national security information . congress has passed aseries of laws known collectively as the military whistleblowers protection act , under whichmembers of the military may give information to members of congress . it also passed theintelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 to encourage the reporting tocongress of wrongdoing within the intelligence agencies . in crafting this legislation , congress hassought to balance its need for information with national security requirements , giving intelligencecommunity whistleblowers access to congress only through the intelligence committees . for legalanalysis see crs report 97-787 , whistleblower protections for federal employees , by l. paigewhitaker and michael schmerling . this report will be updated as events warrant .
the logan act , codified at 18 u.s.c . § 953 , states : any citizen of the united states , wherever he may be , who , without authority of the united states , directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof , in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states , or to defeat the measures of the united states , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years , or both . this section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply , himself or his agent , to any foreign government or the agents thereof for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects . the logan act was intended to prohibit united states citizens without authority from interfering in relations between the united states and foreign governments . there appear to have been no prosecutions under the act in its more than 200-year history . however , there have been a number of judicial references to the act , and it is not uncommon for it to be used as a point of challenge concerning dealings with foreign officials there has been renewed interest in the logan act in 2015 as the result of a letter signed by 47 u.s. senators to iran suggesting that negotiations about a nuclear deal between the president and the iranian leadership would be an executive agreement that another president or congress would be able to abrogate . some have raised questions about the constitutionality of the act , whether it applies to members of congress , and its current viability . commenters have provided arguments that both support and oppose the legality of the senators ' letter . although attempts have been made to repeal the act , it remains law and at least a potential sanction which could be used against anyone who without authority interferes in the foreign relations of the united states .
even though the united states has reduced the number of warheads deployed on its long - range missiles and bombers , consistent with the terms of the 2010 new start treaty , it also plans to develop new delivery systems for deployment over the next 10-30 years . the 116th congress will continue to review these programs , and the funding requested for them , during the annual authorization and appropriations process . during the cold war , the u.s. nuclear arsenal contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons . the longer - range systems , which included long - range missiles based on u.s. territory , long - range missiles based on submarines , and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states , are known as strategic nuclear delivery vehicles . at the end of the cold war , in 1991 , the united states deployed more than 10,000 warheads on these delivery vehicles . with the implementation of new start completed in february 2018 , the united states is limited to 1,550 accountable warheads on these delivery vehicles , a restriction that will remain in place at least through 2021 , while new start treaty remains in force . at the present time , the u.s. land - based ballistic missile force ( icbms ) consists of 400 land - based minuteman iii icbms , each deployed with one warhead , spread among a total of 450 operational launchers . this force is consistent with the new start treaty . the air force is also modernizing the minuteman missiles , replacing and upgrading their rocket motors , guidance systems , and other components , so that they can remain in the force through 2030. it plans to replace the missiles with a new ground - based strategic deterrent around 2029. the u.s. ballistic missile submarine fleet currently consists of 14 trident submarines . each has been modified to carry 20 trident ii ( d - 5 ) missiles — a reduction from 24 missiles per submarine — to meet the launcher limits in the new start treaty . the navy converted 4 of the original 18 trident submarines to carry non - nuclear cruise missiles . nine of the submarines are deployed in the pacific ocean and five are in the atlantic . the navy also has undertaken efforts to extend the life of the missiles and warheads so that they and the submarines can remain in the fleet past 2020. it is designing a new columbia class submarine that will replace the existing fleet beginning in 2031. the u.s. fleet of heavy bombers includes 20 b - 2 bombers and 40 nuclear - capable b - 52 bombers . the b - 1 bomber is no longer equipped for nuclear missions . this fleet of 60 nuclear - capable aircraft is consistent with the u.s. obligations under new start . the air force has also begun to retire the nuclear - armed cruise missiles carried by b - 52 bombers , leaving only about half the b - 52 fleet equipped to carry nuclear weapons . the air force plans to procure both a new long - range bomber , known as the b - 21 , and a new long - range standoff ( lrso ) cruise missile during the 2020s . doe is also modifying and extending the life of the b61 bomb carried on b - 2 bombers and fighter aircraft and the w80 warhead for cruise missiles . the obama administration completed a review of the size and structure of the u.s. nuclear force , and a review of u.s. nuclear employment policy , in june 2013. this review advised the force structure that the united states will deploy under the new start treaty . the trump administration completed its review of u.s. nuclear forces in february 2018 , and reaffirmed the basic contours of the current u.s. force structure and the ongoing modernization programs . the trump administration has also called for the development of a new low - yield warhead for deployment on trident ii ( d - 5 ) missiles . congress will review the administration 's plans for u.s. strategic nuclear forces during the annual authorization and appropriations process , and as it assesses the costs of these plans in the current fiscal environment . this report will be updated as needed .
as congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include additional border and interior enforcement , a significant expansion of guest workers , and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration , some question whether the department of homeland security ( dhs ) can handle the increased immigration workload . there are concerns that the immigration responsibilities in the dhs are not functioning effectively . dhs secretary michael chertoff announced a `` second stage review '' ( 2sr ) in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items . currently , three agencies in dhs have important immigration functions : customs and border protection ( cbp ) , immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) , and u.s. citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) . the immigration functions are dispersed across three agencies within dhs . the assistant secretary of ice , the commissioner of cbp , and the director of uscis all serve with the same rank directly under the dhs secretary . of these , only the director of uscis has responsibilities that are exclusively immigration . while the dhs secretary is the lead cabinet officer on immigration issues , he shares substantial immigration policymaking roles with the attorney general and the secretary of state . some now argue the disaggregation of the government 's immigration responsibilities across several agencies has weakened immigration as a policy priority and has made it much more difficult for the executive branch to develop a comprehensive immigration reform and border security strategy . others maintain that the current organizational structure sharpens the focus on the key , yet disparate , immigration functions and is optimal from a homeland security perspective . in seven of the eight workload measures analyzed over the past decade in this report , the immigration workload has declined in recent years . only removals of aliens has surpassed levels prior to the restructuring of immigration responsibilities . while several key workload trends — notably , border apprehensions and immigration adjudications — are inching upward , the workload trends in asylum , inspections , naturalization , criminal prosecutions , and work site enforcement have declined or remained flat . thus far , independent assessments of the functioning of immigration in dhs have centered on problems rather than successes . indeed , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) has concluded that many of the management problems that existed before the restructuring of the federal immigration functions still remain . an underlying question is whether a sufficient length of time has elapsed to assess dhs 's efficacy in managing immigration policy . this report does not track legislation and will not be regularly updated .
this report examines the growing threat of transnational organized crime to u.s. nationalsecurity and global stability . the end of the cold war -- along with increasing globalizationbeginning in the 1990s -- has helped criminal organizations expand their activities and gain globalreach . criminal networks are believed to have benefitted from the weakening of certain governmentinstitutions , more open borders , and the resurgence of ethnic and regional conflicts across the formersoviet union and many other regions . transnational criminal organizations have also exploitedexpanding financial markets and rapid technological developments . in addition , terrorist networksare believed to be increasingly supporting themselves through traditional crime , and have beenlinked to criminal organizations . alliances between the two groups could amplify threats toamerican security . transnational criminals engage in a spectrum of illicit activities , includingnarcotics and arms smuggling , trafficking in persons , counterfeiting , and money laundering and otherfinancial crimes . the report also outlines the u.s. response to international crime . while u.s. policy is framedwithin the 1998 international crime control strategy , it is also shaped by other more recent federaland agency plans . agencies heading government efforts include the departments of state , defense , justice , treasury , and homeland security . key federal programs and initiatives and theirinteragency coordination are discussed . international cooperation and agreements are vital to u.s.strategy ; also , many programs seek to assist and train foreign law enforcement . finally , this reportexamines likely congressional concerns related to u.s. efforts to combat transnational crime . thereport will not be updated .
one of the majority party 's prerogatives is writing the house rules and using its majority status to effect the chamber 's rules on the day the new house convenes . it is a feature of the house that it must adopt rules at the convening of each congress . while each new house largely adopts the chamber rules that existed in the previous congress , each new house also adopts changes to those rules . institutional and political developments during the democratic majority , particularly during the 103rd congress , were a prelude to the rules changes made by the republicans when they took control of the house in the 104th congress . rules changes made at the convening of the 104th congress addressed most aspects of the committee system : decision - making autonomy , jurisdictions , internal committee procedures and structure , and staff . rules changes for the 104th congress and after also addressed most aspects of legislation deliberations on the house floor and organization of the chamber . for example , the minority was guaranteed the ability to offer the motion to recommit with instructions , commemorative legislation was banned , the names of signatories of discharge petitions were publicized , provisions were made for convening a house with a reduced membership due to a terrorist attack , and the speaker was subjected to a term limit that was later repealed . two of the eight goals of the republicans ' 1994 contract with america dealt with budgetary legislation . house rules were changed to require a three - fifths vote to pass a federal income tax rate increase , and cost estimates replaced baselines as the preferred way of understanding the year - to - year changes in federal spending . rules changes in the administration of the house were extensive . offices were abolished and others created . responsibilities were shifted and accountability clarified . rules changes affecting ethical standards were largely technical , with most major changes taking place through freestanding and other legislation . the house rules changes made starting in the 104th congress reflected a republican frame of reference that was built over many years as the minority party . most rules , however , did not change , either at all or substantially , since they had evolved over decades to support the majority in its organization and operation of the house . rules changes do not necessarily enable a majority to pass legislation , to overcome voter sentiments , or to work smoothly with the minority . rules facilitate the majority 's organization and operation of the house ; they do not dictate to party leaders and others how to run the house or what outcomes can be achieved . this report describes and analyzes only rules changes made on the opening day of a new congress , but it references in footnotes selected other legislation and actions that also changed or affected house rules during the 104th congress and during subsequent congresses . this report is the first in a series on house rules changes at the beginning of a congress . for changes in the 110th , 111th , and 112th congresses , see crs report r42395 , a retrospective of house rules changes since the 110th congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] and [ author name scrubbed ] . this report will not be updated .
beginning in the late 1970s , congress gave railroads flexibility to set rates and to enter into confidential contracts with their customers . over the last decade , large railroads have consolidated and , particularly in recent years , have achieved higher profitability . these changes have left some bulk shippers , particularly those that claim to be `` captive '' to a single railroad , frustrated with what they perceive as poor rail service and exorbitant rates . `` captive shippers '' claim that the railroad serving them acts like a monopoly — charging excessively high rates and providing less service than they require . such complaints have led congress to consider whether the present , largely deregulated , regime should be revised to accommodate the interests of `` captive shippers . . a major point of contention is whether current railroad industry practices should be changed to guarantee such shippers more railroad routing options . legislation , supported by captive shippers and opposed by the railroads and other shippers , failed to reach the floor of either the house or senate in the last congress , and has been reintroduced in the 112th congress ( s. 49 and s. 158 ) . in the wake of renewed congressional interest , the surface transportation board ( stb or board ) , successor agency of the interstate commerce commission ( icc ) , is reviewing its policies with respect to railroad access and competition issues . it announced a hearing on `` bottleneck rates '' and `` competitive access '' matters . changes in these policies might benefit some shippers of bulk products , such as coal and grain , but could be disadvantageous to shippers of other products , such as maritime containers and domestic truck trailers , that want railroads to maintain high levels of investment in order to provide fast , reliable service for high - value shipments . the captive shipper issue has wider economic implications than just the division of revenue between railroads and their customers . higher fuel prices , congestion on certain segments of the interstate highway system , and rising domestic and international trade volumes are driving shippers to demand more rail capacity . freight revenues are a significant means of financing rail capacity because the railroads receive negligible public financing . if it acts in this area , congress would face consideration of how a legislated or regulatory solution to the `` captive shipper '' problem would affect the development of a more robust and efficient railroad system .
this report describes the fy2008 appropriations for the department of homeland security ( dhs ) . the administration requested a net appropriation of $ 35.5 billion in net budget authority for fy2008 . the requested net appropriation for major components of the department included the following : $ 8,783 million for customs and border protection ( cbp ) ; $ 4,168 million for immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) ; $ 3,608 million for the transportation security administration ( tsa ) ; $ 8,457 million for the u.s. coast guard ; $ 1,399 million for the secret service ; $ 1,047 for the national protection and programs directorate ( npp ) ; $ 5,042 million for the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) ; $ 30 million for us citizenship and immigration services ( uscis ) ; $ 799 million for the science and technology directorate ( s & t ) ; and $ 562 million for the domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) . the house passed h.r . 2638 on june 15 , 2007. h.r . 2638 included $ 37.4 billion in net budget authority for dhs for fy2008 . h.r . 2638 contained the following in net budget authority for major components of dhs : $ 8,923 million for cbp ; $ 4,192 million for ice ; $ 3,842 million for the tsa ; $ 8,352 million for the u.s. coast guard ; $ 1,396 million for the secret service ; $ 1,035 million for the npp ; $ 7,239 million for fema ; $ 30 million for uscis ; $ 777 million for s & t ; and $ 556 million for the dndo . on july 26 , 2007 , the senate passed its version of h.r . 2638. the senate bill included $ 40.6 billion in net budget authority , including $ 3 billion in emergency funding ; not including the emergency funding , senate - passed h.r . 2638 included $ 37.6 billion in net budget authority for dhs for fy2008 . the bill contained the following amounts of net budget authority for major components of dhs : $ 8,841 million for cbp ; $ 4,433 million for ice ; $ 3,685 million for the tsa ; $ 8,559 million for the u.s. coast guard ; $ 1,396 million for the secret service ; $ 914 million for the npp ; $ 7,019 million for fema ; $ 50 million ( plus and additional $ 60 million in emergency funding ) for uscis ; $ 838 million for the s & t ; and $ 550 million for the dndo . senate - passed h.r . 2638 also included a $ 3,000 million emergency supplemental appropriation for border - security purposes . the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 ( p.l . 110-161 ) was signed into law by the president on december 26 , 2007. the dhs appropriations act of 2008 was included as division e of p.l . 110-161. the act provides $ 38.7 billion in net budget authority for fy2008 . p.l . 110-161 contains the following amounts of net budget authority for major components of dhs : $ 9,423 million for cbp ; $ 4,734 million for ice ; $ 4,021 million for the tsa ; $ 8,521 million for the u.s. coast guard ; $ 1,386 million for the secret service ; $ 1,177 million for the npp ; $ 6,807 million for fema ; $ 81 million for uscis ; $ 830 million for the s & t ; and $ 485 million for the dndo . this report will not be updated .
there is no consensus among experts in and outside the u.s. government about the magnitude of the threat to u.s. national interests posed by the al qaeda organization . virtually all experts agree that al qaeda and its sympathizers retain the intention to conduct major attacks in the united states , against u.s. interests abroad , and against western countries . in assessing capabilities , many believe that the al qaeda organization and its leadership are no longer as relevant to assessing the global islamic terrorist threat as they were on september 11 , 2001. some believe u.s. and allied counter efforts have weakened al qaeda 's central leadership structure and capabilities to the point where al qaeda serves more as inspiration than as an actual terrorism planning and execution hub . according to this view , the threat from al qaeda has been replaced by a threat from a number of loosely affiliated cells and groups that subscribe to al qaeda 's ideology but have little , if any , contact with remaining al qaeda leaders . those who take this view believe that catastrophic attacks similar to those on september 11 , 2001 are unlikely because terrorist operations on that scale require a high degree of coordination . an alternate view is that the remaining al qaeda leadership remains in contact with , and possibly even in control of numerous islamic militant cells and groups that continue to commit acts of terrorism , such as the july 7 , 2005 bombings of the london underground transportation system . according to those who subscribe to this view , al qaeda as an organization has not been weakened to the degree that some administration officials assert , and the global effort against islamic terrorism would benefit significantly from finding and capturing al qaeda founder osama bin laden and his top associate , ayman al - zawahiri . subscribers to this view believe that a coordinated attack on the scale of september 11 should not be ruled out because the remaining al qaeda structure is sufficiently well - organized to conduct an effort of that magnitude . this paper will focus on the al qaeda organization and its major affiliates , but not the full spectrum of like - minded islamist cells or groups that might exist . this report will be updated as warranted by developments . see also crs report rl32759 , al qaeda : statements and evolving ideology , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
the annual state , foreign operations and related agencies appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews the u.s. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in general . funding for foreign operations and state department / broadcasting programs has been steadily rising since fy2002 , and amounts approved for fy2004 in regular and supplemental bills reached an unprecedented level compared with the past 40 years . emergency supplementals enacted since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks to assist the front - line states in the war on terrorism , fund afghanistan and iraq reconstruction , and upgrade state department operations and security upgrades , also have pushed spending upward . this report analyzes the fy2008 budget request and funding trends , including major issues congress may consider , and tracks congressional action . major issues confronting the 110th congress include : the overall size of the budget request that represents an 11 % increase over fy2007 enacted levels ; a foreign aid reform plan that seeks to align assistance with u.s. strategic objectives ; significant increases for presidential initiatives ; continued costs relating to iraq and afghanistan ; and secretary rice 's transformational diplomacy initiative for the state department . congress completed action on all appropriations bills in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act ( h.r . 2764 ) during the week of december 17 , 2007. the president signed the act on december 26 ( p.l . 110-161 ) . the act also included $ 2.4 billion in emergency supplemental funds for international affairs . the senate - passed state , foreign operations , and related programs appropriations bill was the vehicle used for the consolidated bill . on february 6 , 2007 , the administration sent to congress its fy2008 budget that included significant increases for the international affairs budget . on june 5 , 2007 , the house appropriations subcommittee on state , foreign operations , and related agencies marked up the fy2008 measure providing a total of $ 34.243 billion ; full committee consideration followed on june 12. the house passed the bill , h.r . 2764 , on june 22. the senate appropriations committee approved its version of the bill on june 28 , and the senate passed it on september 6 , approving the same level of total funding as the house bill . the president sent an fy2008 supplemental request to congress on october 22 seeking , among other funds , an additional $ 3.6 billion for international affairs . this report will be updated to further reflect congressional action .
health care spending is one of the most rapidly growing portions of the federal budget . projections suggest if the rapid growth in health care costs is not curtailed , governments at all levels will face an uncomfortable choice between significant cuts in other spending priorities or major tax increases . this report examines the economic justification for government intervention and involvement in health care markets . many analysts claim market - oriented policies , in certain instances , could lower costs and enhance efficiency in health care . this report discusses the invisible hand theorem , which states that when certain assumptions hold , market outcomes will be efficient . these assumptions require that no one has an informational advantage over another , that no spillover effects exist in consumption or production , that no one exerts market power , and that no scale economies exist in production . many characteristics of health care markets fail to satisfy the assumptions of the invisible hand theorem . moreover , fundamental characteristics of health care ( such as informational asymmetries between patients and health care professionals and between payers and providers , as well as ethical and distributional concerns ) complicate efforts to expand the use of market or market - like incentives in health care . rising health care costs in part reflect the cost of technological advances , whose benefits exceed their costs , and the aging of the u.s. population . the growing role of third - party reimbursement over the past half century weakened incentives to minimize costs and thus has also led to higher health care costs . many analysts have called for initiatives which would improve the functioning of health care markets , such as improving consumer information and allowing greater use of bargaining . these initiatives may help reduce or slow the growth of health care costs , but may also have unintended negative consequences . greater use of market - like incentives can improve the efficiency of the health care system , but only if they take into account the special characteristics of health care .
the corporation for national and community service ( cncs ) is an independent federal agency that administers the programs authorized by two statutes : the national and community service act of 1990 ( ncsa ; p.l . 101-610 ) , as amended , and the domestic volunteer service act of 1973 ( dvsa ; p.l . 93-113 ) , as amended . ncsa and dvsa programs were most recently reauthorized by the edward m. kennedy serve america act ( p.l . 111-13 ) . this report describes programs authorized by these laws and compares cncs funding for fy2015 , fy2016 , fy2017 , and fy2018 . the ncsa is designed to meet unmet human , educational , environmental , and public safety needs and to renew an ethic of civic responsibility by encouraging citizens to participate in national service programs . the major programs authorized by ncsa include americorps state and national grants and the national civilian community corps ( nccc ) . the ncsa also authorizes the national service trust , which funds educational awards for community service participants . a central purpose of the dvsa , which authorizes the volunteers in service to america ( vista ) program and the national senior volunteer corps , is to foster and expand voluntary service in communities while helping the vulnerable , the disadvantaged , the elderly , and the poor . the dvsa also authorizes the national senior volunteer corps , which includes three programs for senior citizens : the foster grandparent program , the senior companion program , and the retired and senior volunteer program ( rsvp ) . appropriations for the dvsa and the ncsa programs are made annually through the departments of labor , health and human services , and education , and related agencies appropriations act ( labor - hhs - ed ) . cncs programs are funded through fy2018 under the consolidated appropriations act , 2018 ( p.l . 115-141 ) . the fy2018 appropriations amount for cncs is $ 1.064 billion , which is $ 34 million more than the fy2017 amount of $ 1.030 billion . this report will be updated as warranted by legislative developments .
recent increases in energy prices and a steady escalation in global energy demand — expected to rise by nearly 60 % over the next 20 years — have led u.s. policy - makers to engage in a wide ranging debate over how best to address the country 's future energy requirements . similarly , energy security has become a policy priority for the european union ( eu ) and its 27 member states . the eu imports about 50 % of its energy needs . barring significant changes , the european commission expects this figure to rise to 65 % by 2030. about half of the eu 's natural gas imports and 30 % of its imported oil come from russia . europe 's growing dependence on russian energy , and long - term energy agreements between russian firms and some european governments have fueled speculation that moscow is using the `` energy weapon '' to try to influence european foreign and economic policy . the eu has traditionally exerted little if any influence over individual member state energy policy . however , in march 2007 , in the face of increasing concern about europe 's reliance on russian energy , and growing public pressure to address global climate change , eu member states agreed to forge an `` energy policy for europe . . they have agreed on a set of eu - wide targets — some legally binding — to increase the use of renewable energy , and reduce carbon emissions . however , member states continue to pursue divergent external energy policies , particularly toward russia , and some european countries remain reluctant to cede national control over energy markets . the united states and europe have steadily broadened the transatlantic energy dialogue to include joint promotion of collective energy security , energy efficiency and alternative energy sources . at the april 2007 u.s. - eu summit , leaders on both sides of the atlantic agreed to advance cooperation to develop alternative and renewable energy technologies . however , u.s. officials have expressed concern at some european member states ' unwillingness to exert more pressure on russia to comply with eu market principles . on the other hand , european leaders appear increasingly frustrated with u.s. reluctance to pursue binding multilateral regulatory frameworks to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy efficiency . members of congress have expressed an interest in efforts to increase european energy security , particularly vis - a - vis russia . in the first session of the 110th congress , committees held hearings that touched on the issue of european energy dependence on russia , and on european efforts to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use . the second session of the 110th congress may also hold hearings and pursue legislation on various aspects of eu energy policy . this report examines some of europe 's critical energy security challenges and eu efforts to coordinate a common european energy strategy . it also includes an overview of broader transatlantic energy security cooperation and will be updated as needed . for additional information , see crs report rl34261 , russian energy policy toward neighboring countries , by [ author name scrubbed ] , and crs report rs22409 , nato and energy security , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
the devastation and displacement caused by hurricane katrina in the gulf coast region ofthe united states has very specific implications for foreign nationals who lived in the region . whether the foreign national is a legal permanent resident ( lpr ) , a nonimmigrant ( e.g . , temporaryresident such a foreign student , intracompany transferee , or guest worker ) or an unauthorized alien ( i.e . , illegal immigrant ) is a significant additional factor in how federal laws and policies are applied . in this context , the key question is whether congress should relax any of these laws pertaining toforeign nationals who are victims of hurricane katrina . many of the victims of hurricane katrina lack personal identification documents as a resultof being evacuated from their homes , loss or damage to personal items and records , and ongoingdisplacement in shelters and temporary housing . as a result of the widespread damage anddestruction to government facilities in the area affected by the hurricane , moreover , many victimswill be unable to have personal documents re - issued in the near future . lack of adequate personalidentification documentation , a problem for all victims , has specific consequences under immigrationlaw , especially when it comes to employment and eligibility for programs and assistance . noncitizens -- regardless of their immigration status -- are not barred from short - term , in - kind emergency disaster relief and services , or from assistance that delivers in - kind services atthe community level , provides assistance without individual determinations of each recipient 's needs , and is necessary for the protection of life and safety . as legislation to ease the eligibility rules ofmajor federal programs for hurricane katrina victims generally is under consideration , the questionof whether to ease the specific rules for immigrants has arisen ( s. 1695 ) . most avenues for immigration require that aliens have a family member or employer who iseligible , able , and willing to sponsor them . there are very few immigration opportunities based onself petitioning . the loss of life , devastation of businesses , or depletion of personal assets directlyaffects visa qualifications for otherwise eligible aliens who are victims of hurricane katrina or thefamily of victims . it also affects nonimmigrants whose purposes for the temporary visas aredisrupted by the hurricane and its aftermath . legislation comparable to that enacted for survivingfamily of victims of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks has passed the house ( h.r . 3827 ) . finally , at various times in the past , the government has given discretionary relief fromdeportation so that aliens who have not been legally admitted to the united states or whosetemporary visas have expired nonetheless may remain in this country temporarily . following theseptember 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , for example , family members of victims whose ownimmigration status was dependent on the victim 's immigration status were assured that they shouldnot be concerned about facing immediate removal from the united states . this report will beupdated .
under the copyright act , internet radio broadcasters , or `` webcasters , '' that stream copyrighted music to their listeners are obliged to pay royalty fees to the sound recording copyright owners at statutory rates established by the copyright royalty board ( crb ) . however , some webcasters may also have the option of paying different royalty fees that are privately negotiated with soundexchange , the entity that collects performance royalties on behalf of sound recording copyright owners and recording artists . on march 9 , 2007 , the crb announced statutory royalty rates for certain digital transmissions of sound recordings by webcasters for the royalty period january 1 , 2006 , through december 31 , 2010. several webcasters appealed the crb 's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . the appellants argued that the rates were unreasonably high and that the absence of a cap on minimum fees paid per licensee was arbitrary and capricious . on july 10 , 2009 , the federal court of appeals issued a decision that upheld nearly all aspects of the crb 's determination of rates . two recent laws , the webcaster settlement act of 2008 ( wsa of 2008 ; p.l . 110-435 ) and the webcaster settlement act of 2009 ( wsa of 2009 ; p.l . 111-36 ) , facilitated the ability of webcasters to enter into voluntary agreements with soundexchange that provide alternative royalty rates that substitute for the statutory rates established under the crb 's decision . these agreements generally permit a webcaster to pay lower rates and may cover a longer royalty period . pursuant to the wsa of 2008 and 2009 , voluntarily negotiated royalty agreements were reached between soundexchange and the following entities : the corporation for public broadcasting ( for the online streaming of public radio stations ) ; the national association of broadcasters ( for online simulcasts by fm and am radio stations ) ; a group of `` small '' webcasters ; certain `` pureplay '' commercial webcasters ( those that derive nearly all of their revenue from the streaming of sound recordings ) such as pandora , live365.com , and accuradio ; noncommercial educational webcasters ( college - affiliated internet radio stations ) ; noncommercial religious broadcasters ( that stream their am / fm programming over the internet ) ; and sirius xm ( concerning internet streaming of sirius programming as opposed to its satellite - transmitted programming ) . although the above settlements cover the same royalty period as the crb 's determination ( from 2006 through 2010 ) , some rate agreements extend beyond that period , until the end of 2015. thus , webcasters that are parties to extended agreements need not participate in the crb proceedings to determine statutory royalty rates for the period 2011 to 2015 , which were initiated in january 2009. any webcaster that chooses not to opt - in to a settlement agreement with soundexchange must instead comply with the applicable statutory rates and terms established by the crb for the period 2006-2010 , and will be subject to any new rates that the crb determines for 2011-2015. this report surveys the legislative history of this issue , the crb 's rate decision , and the congressional and public response .
presidential signing statements are official pronouncements issued by the president contemporaneously to the signing of a bill into law that , in addition to commenting on the law generally , have been used to forward the president 's interpretation of the statutory language ; to assert constitutional objections to the provisions contained therein ; and , concordantly , to announce that the provisions of the law will be administered in a manner that comports with the administration 's conception of the president 's constitutional prerogatives . while the history of presidential issuance of signing statements dates to the early 19th century , the practice has become the source of significant controversy in the modern era as presidents have increasingly employed the statements to assert constitutional and legal objections to congressional enactments . president reagan initiated this practice in earnest , transforming the signing statement into a mechanism for the assertion of presidential authority and intent . president reagan issued 250 signing statements , 86 of which ( 34 % ) contained provisions objecting to one or more of the statutory provisions signed into law . president george h. w. bush continued this practice , issuing 228 signing statements , 107 of which ( 47 % ) raised objections . president clinton 's conception of presidential power proved to be largely consonant with that of the preceding two administrations . in turn , president clinton made aggressive use of the signing statement , issuing 381 statements , 70 of which ( 18 % ) raised constitutional or legal objections . president george w. bush continued this practice , issuing 161 signing statements , 127 of which ( 79 % ) contain some type of challenge or objection . the significant rise in the proportion of constitutional objections made by president george w. bush was compounded by the fact that his statements were typified by multiple objections , resulting in more than 1,000 challenges to distinct provisions of law . although president barack obama has continued to use presidential signing statements , the obama administration has used the interpretive tools with less frequency than previous administrations — issuing 20 signing statements , of which 10 ( 50 % ) contain constitutional challenges to an enacted statutory provision . the number and scope of such assertions in the george w. bush administration gave rise to extensive debate over the issuance of signing statements , with the american bar association ( aba ) publishing a report declaring that these instruments are `` contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers '' when they `` claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of congress . . however , in analyzing the constitutional basis for , and legal effect of , presidential signing statements , it becomes apparent that no constitutional or legal deficiencies adhere to the issuance of such statements in and of themselves . rather , it appears that the appropriate focus of inquiry in this context is on the assertions of presidential authority contained therein , coupled with an examination of substantive executive action taken or forborne with regard to the provisions of law implicated in a presidential signing statement . applying this analytical rubric , it seems evident that the issues involved center not on the simple issue of signing statements , but rather on the view of presidential authority that governs the substantive actions of the administration in question . this report focuses on the use of signing statements by recent administrations , with particular emphasis on the administrations of george w. bush and barack obama .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) has helped 3.69 million afghan refugees return to afghanistan since march 2002 , marking the largest assisted return operation in its history . in addition , more than 1.11 million refugees have returned to afghanistan without availing themselves of unhcr 's assistance , bringing the total number of returnees to at least 4.8 million . despite the massive returns , possibly 3.5 million registered and unregistered afghans still remain in these two countries of asylum — up to 2.46 million in pakistan and more than 900,000 in iran — making afghans the second - largest refugee population in the world . these numbers are far greater than the initial working assumption in 2002 of 3.5 million refugees ; in fact , the total is believed to be more than 8 million . the united states spent approximately $ 332.37 million between fy 2002 and fy 2005 on humanitarian assistance to afghan refugees and returnees through the department of state 's bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) . it continues to provide support to refugees and returnees . the 110th congress faces several relevant challenges . the safe and voluntary return of refugees to afghanistan is not only a major part of the u.s. reconstruction effort in afghanistan , but also an important indicator of its success . to the extent that refugees continue to return , it can be seen that afghans are taking part in the future of their country . it is becoming more difficult , however , to encourage refugees to return . those who were most capable of returning did so in the early years ; those who remain have progressively less to return to — houses , livelihoods , family — in afghanistan . furthermore , maintaining the high pace of returns will require greater levels of reintegration assistance to anchor returnees in their homes and help them reestablish their lives in afghanistan . security will also be a major factor in population displacement within and across borders . the status of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran has also been somewhat controversial in recent years as these governments want all afghan refugees to return to afghanistan . officials in pakistan have become concerned that the concentrations of afghans in the country pose a security and crime risk , as individuals and goods are smuggled across the border . at the same time , however , many observers argue that afghan labor migration may be beneficial to both iran and pakistan — which take advantage of cheap and effective immigrant labor — as well as afghanistan , whose citizens benefit heavily from remittances sent in from abroad . to cut off this source of income for many poor afghans could have disastrous consequences — not only humanitarian , but in the security sphere as well , as more than a million afghans along the afghan - pakistan border are deprived of livelihoods and resort to other means to feed their families . reportedly , many afghans cross the border regularly , without documentation , and islamabad does not appear to have the resources to control this flow . a future challenge will thus be to balance reasonable concerns about security with the importance of afghanistan 's labor plans in the regional economies and the forces that drive its migration patterns . it remains to be seen what effect the pakistani government 's recently announced plans for controlling and securing the afghan border , through the construction of fences and planting of landmines , will have on refugee movements . this report will be updated .
in the united states , the term `` big oil companies '' is likely to be taken to mean the major private international oil companies , largely based in europe or america . however , while some of those companies are indeed among the largest in the world , by many important measures , a majority of the largest oil companies are state - owned , national oil companies . by conventional definitions , national oil companies hold the majority of petroleum reserves and produce the majority of the world 's supply of crude oil . since national oil companies generally hold exclusive rights to exploration and development of petroleum resources within the home country , they also can decide on the degree to which they require participation by private companies in those activities . the national oil companies typically do not operate strictly on the basis of market principles . because of their close ties to the national government , in many cases their objectives might include wealth re - distribution , jobs creation , general economic development , economic and energy security , and vertical integration . although these objectives might be desirable from the point of view of the nation 's government , they are unlikely to be equivalent to the maximization of shareholder value , the stated objective of the private international oil companies . differing objectives might be considered to be important only if they lead to different characteristics and outcomes , which is the case for the national oil companies . many of these companies have been found to be inefficient , with relatively low investment rates . they tend to exploit oil reserves for short - term gain , possibly damaging oil fields , reducing the longer term production potential . some also have limited access to international capital markets because of poor business practices and a lack of transparency in their business deals . high oil prices since late 2003 have masked the effect of some of these characteristics in the flow of oil revenues . however , if the price of oil moderates , the potential supply constraint related to the inefficient operations of the national oil companies may be a destabilizing factor in the world oil market . a wide variety of policy directions can be taken to mitigate the potential challenge posed by the dominance of national oil companies . demand management policy can reduce the u.s. dependence on imports . the u.s. government can use its political influence to try to encourage nations not to use national oil companies to forward the aims of the government , but to follow commercial practices to maximize revenue flows . an expanded supply of oil could be encouraged as a condition for trade and aid agreements in some cases . finally , promoting international trade and recognized commercial practices could be encouraged .
in the past few years , the people 's republic of china ( prc ) has experienced rising social unrest , including protests , demonstrations , picketing , and group petitioning . according to prc official sources , `` public order disturbances '' grew by nearly 50 % from 58,000 incidents in 2003 to 87,000 in 2005. although political observers have described social unrest among farmers and workers since the early 1990s , recent protest activities have been broader in scope , larger in average size , greater in frequency , and more brash than those of a decade ago . fears of greater unrest have triggered debates with the communist party leadership about the pace of economic reforms and the proper way to respond to protesters . workers in state - owned enterprises and the special economic zones producing goods for export , peasants and urban residents who have lost their farmland or homes to development projects , and others have engaged in mass protests , some of them violent , often after having exhausted legal channels for resolving grievances . a december 2005 clash between villagers and police in dongzhou village , southeastern guangdong province , in which 3-20 villagers were killed , has became a symbol of the depth of anger of those with grievances and the inability of chinese administrative , legal , and political institutions to resolve disputes peacefully . u.s. interests regarding social unrest in china include human rights concerns , ongoing u.s. - funded democracy and rule - of - law programs in the country , the effects of social unrest on u.s. investments in china , and the effects on prc foreign policy . growing disparities of income , official corruption , and the lack of democratic institutions are likely to continue to fuel social unrest . the potential for widespread social upheaval has captured the keen attention of the communist party leadership . however , in the medium term , the prc government is likely to be able to contain protests through policies that mix accommodation and suppression and that promote continued economic growth . most analysts do not expect social unrest to evolve into a national political movement unless linkages among disaffected groups strengthen and other social groups , particularly the middle class , intellectuals , and students , join the protests as well . policy options for congress include monitoring the situation , increasing assistance for local democracy , civil society , rule - of - law and environmental programs in china , supporting a free press and independent judiciary , or pressing the chinese government to respect the rights of protestors and release jailed activists . on december 15 , 2005 , a bi - partisan group of u.s. congressional leaders submitted a letter to the prc ambassador to the united states , zhou wenzhong , expressing `` deep concern '' over the shooting incident in dongzhou . this report , which will be updated periodically , discusses the causes of growing social unrest in china and describes recent incidents , explains how the prc government responds to protest activities , analyzes implications for prc politics , and discusses policy options for congress .
social security plays an important role in reducing poverty , not only among the aged but among children as well . children may be eligible for social security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies , becomes disabled , or retires . in addition to receiving social security in their own right , children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members receiving benefits . based on a congressional research service ( crs ) analysis of u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data , in april 2013 , an estimated 8.5 million children lived in families in which one or more family members received social security — 11.6 % of all children . of this number , an estimated 5.1 million were either child beneficiaries in their own right , or lived with a parent or guardian who reported receiving social security . the remaining 3.4 million children lived in families in which social security was received only by extended family members ( e.g , grandparents , aunts , uncles , nieces or nephews ) or other family members ( adult siblings ) . for the former group , social security 's effect on child poverty is more directly related to social security policy , whereas for the latter group , social security 's effect on child poverty is more directly related to children 's incidental family living arrangements . children living in families who received social security were about equally as likely to be poor ( 24.4 % ) in april 2013 as children living in families who did n't ( 23.3 % ) . children estimated to have received social security benefits on their own behalf and / or to live with a parent or guardian who received social security were more likely to be poor ( 27.2 % ) than children who incidently were living in families in which social security is received only by extended family members ( e.g . , grandparent , aunt , uncle ) or adult sibling ( 21.3 % ) . social security benefits lifted an estimated 1.952 million children above the official poverty line in april 2013. among children in families that received social security , an estimated 47.8 % ( 4.062 million ) would have been considered poor based on family income other than social security . the addition of social security to family income reduces the incidence of poverty among these children to 24.8 % ( 2.110 million ) . in april 2013 , it 's estimated that over two - fifths of social security dollars paid to families with children helped children who otherwise would be counted as poor . social security benefits paid on behalf of children and / or their parents or guardians amounted to nearly an estimated $ 3.847 billion in april 2013 , or $ 46.167 billion on an annualized basis . of this amount , nearly half ( 49.2 % ) , $ 22.072 billion on an annualized basis , went to families who would have been considered poor based on their pre - transfer income ( i.e . , excluding social security ) , about two and one - half times the estimated $ 8.738 billion in combined federal and state cash welfare spending under the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program in fy2013 , and five times the federal ( only ) share of $ 4.485 billion .
the energy and water development appropriations bill provides funding for civil works projects of the army corps of engineers ( corps ) , the department of the interior 's bureau of reclamation ( bor ) , the department of energy ( doe ) , and a number of independent agencies . key budgetary issues involving these programs include the distribution of army corps of engineers appropriations across the agency 's authorized construction and maintenance activities ( title i ) ; support of major ecosystem restoration initiatives , such as florida everglades ( title i ) and california `` bay - delta '' ( calfed ) ( title ii ) ; funding for the proposed national nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain , nevada , and proposals to store nuclear spent fuel temporarily ( title iii : nuclear waste disposal ) ; and the administration 's proposed global nuclear energy partnership to supply plutonium - based fuel to other nations ( title iii : nuclear energy ) . the fy2008 energy and water development bill was enacted as division c of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 ( p.l . 110-161 ) . the omnibus funding measure was passed by congress december 19 , 2007 , and signed by the president december 26 , 2007. the act provides $ 31.4659 billion for energy and water programs , about $ 1 billion below the fy2007 appropriation and about $ 500 million above the administration 's request . the house appropriations committee reported out its fy2008 energy and water development appropriations bill , h.r . 2641 ( h.rept . 110-185 ) , on june 6 , 2007. the bill as reported did not contain indications of funding for specific projects . on june 20 the bill was debated on the house floor , but was not voted on pending submission by the appropriations committee of a supplement specifying funding for individual projects . that supplement was voted by the committee july 12 , and the house approved the bill july 17 , 2007. the senate subcommittee on energy and water development appropriations approved its version of the bill on june 26 , and the full senate appropriations committee approved it june 28 , 2007 ( s. 1751 , s.rept . 110-127 ) .
in april 1980 , the federal government enacted the crude oil windfall profit tax on the u.s.oil industry . the main purpose of the tax was to recoup for the federal government much of therevenue that would have otherwise gone to the oil industry as a result of the decontrol of oil prices . supporters of the tax viewed this revenue as an unearned and unanticipated windfall caused by highoil prices , which were determined by the opec ( organization of petroleum exporting countries ) cartel . despite its name , the windfall profit tax ( wpt ) was actually an excise tax , not a profits tax , imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price . while mostdomestically produced oil was subject to the tax ( about 2 / 3 in 1985 ) , the remaining 1 / 3 that wastax - exempt was significant ( 1.3 billion barrels in 1985 , or 360,000 barrels per day ) . the $ 80 billionin gross revenues generated by the wpt between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the $ 393billion projected . due to the deductibility of the wpt against the income tax , cumulative net wptrevenues were about $ 38 billion , significantly less than the $ 175 billion projected . this reportpresents estimates of the amount of foregone oil production from 1980-1986 due to the wpt underthree alternative supply price responses , reflecting three different assumptions about the priceelasticity of the domestic oil supply function , a critical factor ( statistic ) in estimating lost oil outputand increased import dependence . from 1980 to 1988 , the wpt may have reduced domestic oilproduction anywhere from 1.2 % to 8.0 % ( 320 to 1,269 million barrels ) . dependence on importedoil grew from between 3 % and 13 % . the tax was repealed in 1988 because ( 1 ) it was anadministrative burden to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , ( 2 ) it was a compliance burden to theoil industry , ( 3 ) due to low oil prices , the tax was generating little or no revenues in 1987 and 1988 , and ( 4 ) it made the united states more dependent on foreign oil . the depressed state of the u.s. oilindustry after 1986 also contributed to the repeal decision . reinstating the windfall profit tax would reduce recent oil industry windfalls due to highcrude and petroleum prices but could have several adverse economic effects . if imposed as an excisetax , the wpt would increase marginal production costs and be expected to reduce domestic oilproduction and increase the level of oil imports , which today is at nearly 60 % of demand . crudeprices would not tend to increase . some have proposed an excise tax on both domestically producedand imported oil as a way of mitigating the negative effects on petroleum import dependence . sucha broad - based wpt would tend to reduce import dependence , but it would lead to higher crude oilprices and likely to oil industry profits , potentially undermining its original goals . because the purecorporate profits tax is relatively neutral in the short run -- few , if any , price and output effects occurbecause marginal production costs are unchanged in the short run -- a possible option would be acorporate income surtax on the upstream operations of crude oil producers . such a tax that wouldrecoup any recent windfalls with less adverse economic effects ; imports would not increase becausedomestic production would remain unchanged . in the long run , such a tax is a tax on capital ; itreduces the rate of return , thus reducing the supply of capital to the oil industry .
the bush administration has proposed eliminating the section 8 housing choice voucher program and replacing it with a new program in each of the past several years . while the specifics have changed , each proposal would significantly alter key features of the current program , including its administration , funding distribution , tenant contributions toward rent , initial and ongoing eligibility of families , and the eligible uses of program funds . the first proposal was referenced in the president 's fy2004 budget request and was later introduced in the 108th congress ( h.r . 1841 / s . 947 ) . called the housing assistance for needy families act of 2003 , it would have created a new block grant administered by states — rather than the local public housing authorities ( phas ) that administer the current program — and eliminated many of the current rules governing the program . hearings were held on the legislation , although no further action was taken . language to enact the second proposal , called the flexible voucher program ( fvp ) , was included in the administrative provisions section of the president 's fy2005 budget request . under the fvp , phas would have retained administration of the new grant program , although most of the federal section 8 voucher rules and regulations would have been eliminated . the appropriations committees did not include the language in their versions , nor the final version , of the fy2005 hud budget , and authorizing legislation was not introduced before the close of the 108th congress . the president 's fy2006 budget request again called for enactment of a flexible voucher program . during the first session of the 109th congress , a modified version of the fvp was included as title i of the state and local housing flexibility act of 2005 ( h.r . 1999 / s . 771 ) . the president 's fy2007 budget request reiterated the administration 's support for the bill . the house financial services committee held hearings on the bill , although no further action was taken before the close of the 109th congress . in the second session of the 109th congress , the house financial services committee approved a bipartisan section 8 voucher reform bill , the section 8 voucher reform act of 2006 ( h.r . 5443 ) . while notably narrower in scope than the president 's reform proposals , it would have represented the first major reform of the program since the quality housing and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1998 ( p.l . 105-276 ) . it was not enacted before the close of the 109th congress . this report includes a table comparing the key features of the reform proposals from the 109th congress . it will not be updated .
the department of justice ( doj ) was created in june 1870 , with the attorney general as its head . since its establishment , doj has expanded to include 40 agencies . the office of justice programs ( ojp ) , the community oriented policing services office ( cops ) , and the office of violence against women , provide grant funds to state , local , and tribal governments for crime prevention and intervention programs as well as funding for criminal justice system improvement programs . this report discusses several doj grant programs administered through ojp and cops , including the weed and seed , the drug court discretionary grant program , the prisoner re - entry initiative , the president 's dna initiative , the debbie smith dna backlog grant program , the kirk bloodsworth post - conviction dna testing program , the paul coverdell grant program , assistance to indian tribes ( indian country prison grants , tribal courts grant program , indian country alcohol and crime demonstration program ) , and tribal law enforcement assistance . in recent years , congress has questioned the effectiveness of many doj grant programs . as congress continues to cut appropriations for many discretionary grant programs , there may be greater scrutiny of these programs . this report discusses this issue as well as issues concerning the effective management and accounting of doj grant programs . this report will be updated as warranted .
the state criminal alien assistance program ( scaap ) is a formula grant program that provides financial assistance to states and localities for correctional officer salary costs incurred for incarcerating `` undocumented criminal aliens . . currently , scaap funds do not cover all of the costs for incarcerating immigrants or foreign nationals . the program is administered by the office of justice programs ' bureau of justice assistance , located in the u.s. department of justice , in conjunction with the u.s. department of homeland security . between fy1995 and fy2009 , a total of more than $ 5 billion has been distributed to states in scaap funding . recent changes to scaap include reauthorization through fy2011 and the requirement that scaap reimbursements be used for correctional purposes only . legislation introduced in the 111th congress includes provisions that would extend the program through fy2014 and authorize appropriations at $ 1 billion annually for fy2011-fy2014 ( h.r . 2282 ) ; and would change scaap eligibility guidelines to reimburse states not only for criminal aliens convicted of two misdemeanors or a felony , but also for those charged with these crimes as well ( s. 168 ) . funding for the program has also been included in the commerce , justice , science and related agencies appropriations act of 2010 ( h.r . 2847 ) . h.r . 2847 as passed by the house on june 18 , 2009 , would appropriate $ 300 million for scaap , and the senate reported version would appropriate $ 228 million for the program . this report will be updated as warranted by legislative , funding , or policy developments .
despite the huge increase in u.s. external debt , the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus . the size of this surplus has varied , hitting a low of $ 4 billion in 1998 and a high of $ 37 billion in 2003 , but over the past 25 years , the surplus has remained between $ 15 billion and $ 30 billion . since 2003 , the surplus has fallen , reaching $ 28 billion in 2004 and $ 11 billion in 2005. this means that the united states , although a large net debtor , has been borrowing free of any economically meaningful debt service cost . what is behind this apparent paradox ? . attempts to resolve this paradox have considered special factors that tend to mitigate the effects of the current account deficit on the value of foreign debt , the role of unmeasured u.s. exports , and bias in data collection . a 2005 study by economist william cline argues that two factors have worked to limit the impact of large current account deficits on the nation 's economic debt service payments . first is the effect of valuation changes that have caused the magnitude of u.s. net indebtedness to grow much more slowly than the size of the current account deficits would indicate . second is the effect of asymmetrical capital returns — the united states earns a higher rate of return on its foreign investments than foreigners earn on their u.s. investments . a more controversial interpretation of the paradox of the united states having large net external liabilities along with an investment income surplus has been provided by economists hausmann and sturzenegger . they maintain that the official current account data have failed to record a large volume of service exports , so large that the united states has in truth remained a large net external creditor . the name they give to these invisible assets is `` dark matter , '' for , like the astronomical phenomenon , they have a visible effect ( generating investment income ) but stem from a source that can not be seen ( hidden service exports ) . looking at the sizable gap between the rate of return on u.s. foreign direct investment ( fdi ) and that on fdi in the united states , the anomaly is not the high u.s. yield ( 7.5 % ) but the suspiciously low foreign yield ( 2.5 % ) . why pour hundreds of billions of investment into the united states for a yield below that available from holding virtually risk free u.s. treasury bonds ? . or , given the high yield on u.s. fdi , it would seem likely that there are superior investment opportunities elsewhere . this apparent violation of rational economic behavior suggests that there could be something wrong with the fdi earnings data reported by foreign firms operating in the united states . while the rate of past debt accumulation may have been smaller than what the size of u.s. current account deficits would indicate , and while the size of the u.s. net debt position and investment income balance may be subject to significant measurement error , the sheer size of prospective trade deficits will mean that , if not now , the united states will soon be a net debtor and will also soon have a sizable deficit in investment income — incurring a true debt burden . this report will be updated as events warrant .
while the acceptance by members of congress and staff of personal gifts from most outside , private sources is significantly regulated and restricted by internal congressional rules , members of the house and senate may still generally accept from some private sources — other than those who are registered lobbyists or registered foreign agents — necessary travel expenses , including transportation , food and lodging , for travel `` in connection with '' their official duties , such as for fact - finding trips , conferences or symposia , under certain limited circumstances . under both house and senate rules , the over - all purpose of any privately funded trip of this nature must be related or connected to official duties , and may not be `` substantially recreational in nature . . furthermore , while members may accept `` necessary '' travel expenses for events which are sufficiently officially - related or `` officially connected , '' the expenses for incidental recreational activities during these trips , such as the costs for golf , snow - skiing , jet - skiing , or tennis , are expressly not considered `` necessary '' expenses of such travel under either the house or the senate rules , and thus fall within the general prohibitions and the $ 50 limitations on gifts from private sources . ( under both the house and senate rules , gifts from any private source , other than from relatives and certain long - term personal friends , are generally prohibited if the value of the gift is $ 50 or more . ) . the duration of any permitted trip under the `` officially connected '' travel exception is limited in the house to four days for domestic and seven days for foreign travel ( excluding travel days ) , and in the senate to three days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel ( also excluding travel days ) . staff employees must receive advance approval for accepting from private sources expenses for such officially connected travel , and whenever expenses or reimbursement for officially connected travel are accepted by members or staff , a disclosure report on such travel and expenses is required to be made within 30 days of the end of the travel .
the united states has had a military alliance with south korea ( r.o.k . ) . and important interests in the korean peninsula since the korean war of 1950-1953. many u.s. interests relate to communist north korea . since the early 1990s , the issue of north korea 's development of nuclear weapons has been the dominant u.s. policy concern . experts in and out of the u.s. government believe that north korea has produced plutonium for at least six atomic bombs . north korea tested nuclear devices in october 2006 and may 2009. in 2007 , a six party negotiation ( among the united states , north korea , china , south korea , japan , and russia ) produced agreements that resulted in a disablement of north korea 's main nuclear reactor and u.s. removal of north korea from the u.s. list of state sponsors of terrorism . in april 2009 , north korea rejected six party talks . the obama administration began bilateral talks with north korea in december 2009 aimed at returning north korea to the six party talks ; north korea demanded first a lifting of u.n. sanctions and negotiation of a u.s. - north korean peace treaty . other north korean policies affect u.s. interests . north korean exports of counterfeit u.s. currency and u.s. products produce upwards of $ 1 billion annually for the north korean regime . north korea earns considerable income from sales of missiles and missile and nuclear technology cooperation with iran and syria . it has developed short - range and intermediate - range missiles , but it has so far failed to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile . it is estimated to have sizeable stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons . pyongyang 's main goal of its nuclear program appears to be the development of nuclear warheads that can be mounted on its missiles . north korean involvement in international terrorism has included the kidnapping of japanese citizens , reportedly arms and training to the hezbollah and tamil tigers terrorist groups , and cooperation with the iranian revolutionary guards in development of missiles and nuclear weapons . u.s. human rights groups are involved in responding to the outflow of tens of thousands of north korean refugees into china , due to severe food shortages inside north korea and the repressive policies of the north korean regime . u.s. and international food aid to north korea has been provided since 1995 , but north korea rejected south korean food aid in 2008 and expelled u.s. food aid workers in march 2009. north korea faces severe food shortages in 2010. south korea followed a conciliation policy toward north korea under the administrations of kim dae - jung and roh moo - hyun ; but president lee myung - bak , elected in december 2007 , linked south korean aid to north korea , including food aid , to the nuclear and other policy issues . north korea responded by cutting off most contacts with the lee government until august 2009. north korea then made overtures to south korea , probably because of its worsening food situation . the united states signed a free trade agreement ( fta ) with south korea ( the seventh - largest u.s. trading partner ) in 2007. there is substantial opposition to the fta in congress . the obama administration has called for renegotiation on the automobile provisions and additional south korean measures to open the r.o.k . market to imports of u.s. beef . the u.s. - r.o.k . military alliance appears to function well . it is dealing with several issues of change : relocations of 28,500 u.s. forces within south korea ; construction of new bases ; the creation of separate u.s. and south korean military commands in 2012 ; possible future withdrawals of u.s. ground forces to u.s. conflict areas ; an r.o.k . military contribution to afghanistan ; and south korean financial support for u.s. forces .
crime data collected through the uniform crime reports ( ucr ) , the national incident - based reporting system ( nibrs ) , and the national crime victimization survey ( ncvs ) are used by congress to inform policy decisions and allocate federal criminal justice funding to states . as such , it is important to understand how each program collects and reports crime data , and the limitations associated with the data . this report reviews ( 1 ) the history of the ucr , the nibrs , and the ncvs ; ( 2 ) the methods each program uses to collect crime data ; and ( 3 ) the limitations of the data collected by each program . the report then compares the similarities and differences of ucr and ncvs data . it concludes by reviewing issues related to the nibrs and the ncvs . the ucr represents the first effort to create a national , standardized measure of the incidence of crime . it was conceived as a way to measure the effectiveness of local law enforcement and to provide law enforcement with data that could be used to help fight crime . ucr data are now used extensively by researchers , government officials , and the media for research , policy , and planning purposes . the ucr also provides some of the most commonly cited crime statistics in the united states . the ucr reports offense and arrest data for 8 different part i offenses and arrest data for 21 different part ii offenses . the nibrs was developed by the federal bureau of investigation to respond to the law enforcement community 's belief that the ucr needed to be updated to provide more in - depth data to meet the needs of law enforcement into the 21st century . the nibrs collects data , including data on offense ( s ) , offender ( s ) , victim ( s ) , arrestee ( s ) , and any property involved in an offense , for 46 different group a offenses and 11 different group b offenses . despite the more detailed crime data that the nibrs can provide , nationwide implementation of the program has been slow , for a variety of reasons , including cost considerations . the ncvs is the primary source of information on the characteristics of criminal victimization , and on the number and types of crime not reported to law enforcement . the ncvs has four major objectives : ( 1 ) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime , ( 2 ) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to police , ( 3 ) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes , and ( 4 ) to permit comparisons over time and population type ( e.g . , urban , suburban , and rural ) . the ncvs asks respondents whether they have been the victim of rape and sexual assault , robbery , simple and aggravated assault , purse snatching / pickpocketing , burglary , theft , or motor vehicle theft . in addition to collecting data on the number of victimizations , the ncvs gathers data on the details of each incident of victimization . this report will be updated as warranted .
federal complaint - handling , ombudsman , and advocacy offices have different forms , capacities , and designations . this report , which reviews the state of research in this field and the heritage of such offices , examines and compares them , along with recent legislative developments and past proposals to establish a government - wide ombudsman . in so doing , the report identifies the basic characteristics of these offices , recognizing differences among them with regard to their powers , duties , jurisdictions , locations , and resources , as well as control over them . this study covers only ombudsman - like offices at the federal level that deal with the public , sometimes known as `` external ombudsmen . . it does not cover `` internal ombudsmen , '' that is , offices created to handle complaints from employees and resolve disputes between them and management ; ombudsman - like offices in the private sector ; or similar entities at other levels of government in the united states or abroad , except to note differences among them . legislative interest , albeit sporadic , in establishing a government - wide ombudsman or standardizing individual offices across - the - board dates to the early 1960s . these efforts extended in the 1970s to proposals to establish an independent office of consumer representation or consumer affairs , a plan that president jimmy carter later endorsed . another initiative emerged in 1993 , when president william clinton — through an executive order `` setting customer service standards '' — directed executive departments and agencies to make information , service , and complaint - systems easily accessible and provide means to address such complaints . the order also called for agencies to set customer service standards , survey customers , report to the president on those surveys , and publish customer service plans . a subsequent government - wide customer satisfaction survey , incidentally , found a similar range of satisfaction between the private and public sectors . notwithstanding these efforts over the past five decades , no comprehensive , across - the - board transformations have occurred . nonetheless , numerous individual offices have been established , modified , and proposed by administrative directives , public laws , and congressional bills . this piecemeal approach — reflecting different demands in both the government and society over time and across policy areas — has resulted in a variety of ombudsman - like offices . although a complete , authoritative identification and description of current offices does not exist , a number of studies — from past and contemporary eras , along with the examples here — provide a wide sampling of complaint - handling and advocacy offices for examination and consideration as models . this report consists of three parts : ( 1 ) an analysis of the ombudsman concept and a brief look at which countries around the world have used ombudsmen ; ( 2 ) a breakdown of the various ways in which federal complaint - handling offices differ ; and ( 3 ) an identification and description of selected ombudsman - like offices , including specifics on their origins and operations . this report will be updated as events warrant .
as the u.s. constitution has been interpreted , states have the primary obligation to ensure child welfare . however , congress provides significant federal funds to help states exercise this responsibility ( $ 7.9 billion appropriated in fy2008 ) . most of this support is provided for children who are in foster care and who meet specific federal eligibility criteria . this report discusses the federal framework for child welfare policy ; reviews the scope of activities , and children and families served , by state child welfare agencies ; summarizes several child welfare - related hearings that were held in 2007 ; describes child welfare and related legislative proposals that have been introduced in the 110th congress ; and reviews child welfare programs for which funding authorization has expired or is set to expire on the last day of fy2008 . child welfare agencies seek to ensure the well - being of children and their families , including protecting children from abuse or neglect and ensuring that they have a safe and permanent home . in fy2006 child protection agencies found 905,000 children to be victims of abuse or neglect . some of these children were removed to foster care , some remained in their homes and received services , while others received no further follow - up from the agency . after reaching a recorded high of 567,000 on the last day of fy1999 , the number of children in foster care has declined by about 10 % , and on the last day of fy2006 , an estimated 510,000 children were in foster care . less than half of these children are eligible for federal foster care support under title iv - e of the social security act . legislation that would respond to a number of the concerns raised in 2007 child welfare hearings has been introduced in the 110th congress . these proposals would expand the eligible populations served with title iv - e funds to include ( potentially ) all children in foster care or adopted ( with special needs ) from foster care ( h.r . 5466 , h.r . 4207 , s. 2900 , s. 1462 , h.r . 4091 , and s. 3038 ) , as well as children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with a relative ( s. 661 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 5466 , and s. 3038 ) , and youth who choose to remain in foster care until their 21st birthday ( s. 1512 , h.r . 4208 , s. 2560 , and h.r . 5466 ) . other introduced proposals would authorize additional support for child and family services ( h.r . 5466 and s. 2237 ) ; authorize or require new services or protections for children in , or about to enter , foster care ( h.r . 3283 , s. 379 , s. 382 , h.r . 687 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; seek to improve services for youth who have , or are expected to , age out of care ( s. 2341 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 4208 / s . 2560 , and h.r . 3409 ) ; help support or permit access to services for kinship caregivers and further encourage their use as caregivers ( s. 661 , h.r . 2188 , h.r . 5645 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; provide new support for training or other related efforts to improve the child welfare workforce ( h.r . 5466 , h.r . 2314 and s. 2944 ) ; aim to improve foster and adoptive parent recruitment efforts ( s. 2395 and h.r . 4198 ) ; permit direct access to federal title iv - e funds for tribal governments ( s. 1956 , h.r . 4688 , and h.r . 5466 ) ; and make other related changes intended to enhance the welfare of children , including requiring states to have licensing standards for certain residential programs for youth with emotional or behavioral issues ( h.r . 5876 ) , and expanding or making permanent the current adoption tax credit rules ( h.r . 273 , h.r . 471 , s. 561 , h.r . 1074 , h.r . 3192 , and h.r . 4313 ) . this report will be updated as legislative activity occurs .
nanotechnology — a term encompassing nanoscale science , engineering , and technology — is focused on understanding , controlling , and exploiting the unique properties of matter that can emerge at scales of one to 100 nanometers . a key issue before congress regarding nanotechnology is how best to protect human health , safety , and the environment as nanoscale materials and products are researched , developed , manufactured , used , and discarded . while the rapidly emerging field of nanotechnology is believed by many to offer significant economic and societal benefits , some research results have raised concerns about the potential adverse environmental , health , and safety ( ehs ) implications of nanoscale materials . some have described nanotechnology as a two - edged sword . on the one hand , some are concerned that nanoscale particles may enter and accumulate in vital organs , such as the lungs and brains , potentially causing harm or death to humans and animals , and that the diffusion of nanoscale particles in the environment might harm ecosystems . on the other hand , some believe that nanotechnology has the potential to deliver important ehs benefits such as reducing energy consumption , pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions ; remediating environmental damage ; curing , managing , or preventing diseases ; and offering new safety - enhancing materials that are stronger , self - repairing , and able to adapt to provide protection . stakeholders generally agree that concerns about potential detrimental effects of nanoscale materials and devices — both real and perceived — must be addressed to protect and improve human health , safety , and the environment ; enable accurate and efficient risk assessment , risk management , and cost - benefit trade - offs ; foster innovation and public confidence ; and ensure that society can enjoy the widespread economic and societal benefits that nanotechnology may offer . congressionally - mandated reviews of the national nanotechnology initiative ( nni ) by the national research council and the president 's council of advisors on science and technology have concluded that additional research is required to make a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials .
the foreign tax credit alleviates the double - taxation that would result if u.s. investors ' overseas income were to be taxed by both the united states and a foreign country . u.s. taxpayers credit foreign taxes paid against u.s. taxes they would otherwise owe , and in doing so concede that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income . but the united states retains the primary right to tax u.s. - source income , placing a limit on the foreign tax credit : foreign taxes can only offset the part of a u.s. taxpayer 's u.s. tax that falls on foreign source income . it is this limit to which the american jobs creation act of 2004 ( p.l . 108-357 , jobs act ) applied . to calculate the limit , a firm separates its revenue and costs , for tax purposes , into those having a foreign source and those having a u.s. source . foreign taxes can offset u.s. tax on revenue `` sourced '' abroad ; in effect , foreign - source income is exempt from u.s. tax for firms whose foreign tax credits exceed the limit ( firms with `` excess credits '' ) . but because deductions allocated abroad reduce u.s. tax , the effect is the same as if deductions allocated to foreign sources can not be claimed for u.s. tax purposes . if a u.s. firm has foreign investments , current law requires at least part of the u.s. interest to be allocated to foreign sources based on the theory that debt is fungible — that regardless of where funds are borrowed , they support a firm 's worldwide investment . but multinational firms have argued that if part of domestic interest is allocated abroad , part of foreign interest should be allocated to the united states , which would reduce u.s. tax . ( some critics have suggested , however , that granting multinationals tax benefits through interest allocation revisions should be accompanied by restrictions on the benefit of deferral , which allows taxes . ) . this worldwide allocation rule was adopted in the jobs act , but has not yet been implemented . the jobs act called for implementation starting in 2009 , while p.l . 110-289 subsequently delayed implementation until 2011. in the 111th congress , the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 , p.l . 111-92 , delayed implementation of the worldwide allocation rules to 2018 , while the hiring incentives to restore employment act , p.l . 111-147 , further delayed implementation to 2021. another proposal in the 111th congress , h.r . 3962 , the affordable healthcare for america act of 2009 , would repeal the worldwide allocation rule . the current law 's interest allocation rules are likely imperfectly structured to achieve the objective of the foreign tax credit limit and worldwide allocation of interest as enacted by the jobs act , while losing revenue , would probably be more consistent with the basic objective of the foreign tax credit limit . tax planning techniques , however , could undermine this objective and cause further revenue loss . and , like the foreign tax credit limit itself , allocation rules contribute to tax distortions which may be heightened with worldwide allocation . further , an expansion of the bank `` subgroup '' elections contained in the jobs act may not be consistent with the general objective of worldwide allocation of interest . although the jobs act contains anti - abuse rules , these subgroup elections may permit firms to avoid the impact of the interest allocation rules . this report will be updated as legislative events warrant .
this report provides an overview and analysis of u.s. - yemeni relations amidst evolving political change in yemeni leadership , ongoing u.s. counterterrorism operations against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) operatives in yemen 's hinterlands , and international efforts to bolster the country 's stability despite an array of daunting socio - economic problems . along with determining how best to counter terrorist threats emanating from yemen , congress and u.s. policy makers also may consider the priority level and resources that should be accorded to attempts to stabilize yemen and to establish and maintain strong bilateral relations with yemeni leaders . on november 23 , 2011 , after eleven months of protests and violence that claimed over 2,000 lives , then - president ali abdullah saleh of yemen signed on to a u.s. - backed , gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) - brokered transition plan . in line with the plan , yemen held a presidential election in february 2012 with one consensus candidate on the ballot — former vice president abed rabbo mansour al hadi . president hadi took office in february 2012 shortly after his election . he resigned on january 22 , 2015 , and is under house arrest , surrounded by fighters from the houthi movement . many administration officials have declared that al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the yemen - based terrorist organization that has attempted several attacks on the u.s. homeland , presents the most potent threat among al qaeda 's remaining affiliates . in recent years , the administration and congress have committed greater resources to counterterrorism and stabilization efforts there . amid debate over the accomplishments and objectives of u.s. military and intelligence operations in yemen , president obama has suggested that u.s. policy in yemen may inform u.s. policy in other cases , such as the military campaign against the islamic state organization in iraq and syria . it is unclear whether and how lessons from yemen 's specific situation might apply in other contexts . many analysts assert that yemen is or is becoming a failed state and safe haven for al qaeda operatives for a variety of reasons and as such is likely to remain an active theater for u.s. counterterrorism operations for the foreseeable future . given yemen 's contentious political climate and its myriad development challenges , most long - time yemen watchers suggest that security problems emanating from yemen may persist in spite of increased u.s. or international efforts to combat them — an argument with which few would disagree given the events of early 2015. as recently as the fall of 2014 , the obama administration expressed cautious optimism about yemen 's trajectory , though the 2014-2015 takeover of sana ' a by the houthis , a clan from the zaydi sect ( related to shia islam ) has upended yemen 's political transition . the state department reports that the united states committed more than $ 221.4 million in assistance to yemen in fy2014 , in addition to $ 316.23 million in fy2013 and more than $ 353 million in fy2012 . u.s. military assistance to yemen has focused on bolstering its unmanned aerial surveillance capabilities and training its armed forces . current annual appropriations language includes a provision that would restrict u.s. funding of yemen 's military were it to be controlled by a foreign terrorist organization .
pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act ( rcra ) , the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) has established regulations regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes . although there are federal requirements under rcra for the management of hazardous waste , some states have opted to implement more stringent requirements — particularly with regard to the management of certain hazardous wastes generated by households and small businesses ( entities that are essentially exempt from rcra 's hazardous waste management requirements ) . one category of household hazardous waste that many states are choosing to regulate more strictly is electronic waste , commonly referred to as `` e - waste . . e - waste generally refers to obsolete , broken , or irreparable electronic equipment like televisions , computers and computer monitors , laptops , printers , cell phones , copiers , fax machines , stereos , or video gaming systems . cathode ray tubes ( crts ) in televisions and computer monitors have presented a particular concern to states , primarily due to the potentially significant amounts of lead they contain and the large numbers in which they are generated . state concerns specific to the landfill disposal or incineration of e - waste are largely due to its increasing volume and often bulky nature ; hazardous constituents , such as lead and mercury , it may contain ; its high cost of recycling ; and the inability of interested stakeholders , such as electronics retailers and manufacturers , to reach consensus on how to voluntarily implement a national e - waste management system . states have responded to this concern by enacting their own e - waste management laws . requirements of those laws range from a ban only on the landfill disposal or incineration of designated e - wastes to the implementation of a full e - waste collection , transportation , and recycling system . to date , 14 states have enacted some form of e - waste management law ( as many as 20 states proposed e - waste laws in 2006 and 2007 ) . although the goal of each law is similar — to avoid landfill disposal and incineration of certain types of e - waste — approaches taken to achieve that goal differ significantly . however , most state laws and proposals have certain broad elements in common , such as specifying the electronic devices covered under the law ; how a collection and recycling program will be financed ; collection and recycling criteria that must be met to minimize the impact to human health and the environment ; and restrictions or requirements that products must meet to be sold in the state . as more states propose e - waste legislation , potentially regulated stakeholders ( particularly electronics manufacturers and retailers ) have expressed concern that they will be required to comply with a patchwork of state requirements throughout the united states . this concern has led to an increased call for federal legislation regarding e - waste management . to help policy makers better understand the impact of state e - waste legislation , this report discusses issues that have led to state action , common elements in state - waste laws and proposals , and an overview of each enacted state law .
commercial ties between the united states and the 27-member european union are substantial , growing , and mutually beneficial . however , differences in regulatory approaches limit an even more integrated marketplace from developing . to deal with this situation , a variety of government - to - government efforts have been created to dismantle existing regulatory barriers and to prevent new ones from emerging . these efforts fall under the rubric of transatlantic regulatory cooperation ( trc ) and are at the heart of today 's u.s. - eu economic relationship . this report is intended to serve as an introduction and primer on a complicated , broad , and often highly technical set of issues . since the mid - 1990s , both u.s. and european multinational companies have viewed divergent ways of regulating markets for both goods and services as the most serious barriers to transatlantic commerce . the primary reason why these companies seek to achieve greater harmonization in standards and regulatory procedures is to reduce costs imposed by having to comply with two different sets of regulations and standards . trc must deal with a number of key differences between the united states and eu concerning approaches to regulation . these differences involve political support for regulation and public attitudes towards risk and transparency . until they converge or are re - aligned , a transatlantic gap in regulatory policies is likely to persist . regulatory cooperation is an umbrella concept that incorporates a broad range of activities . at one end of the spectrum are information exchanges and dialogues among regulators that are designed to build trust and confidence . at the other end of the spectrum are activities designed to harmonize regulatory approaches through acceptance of common principles and standards . in between are activities that involve varying degrees of intrusion into the autonomy of regulators . trc initiatives have made progress in reducing costs to businesses and consumers in some sectors , but not in others . one of the key obstacles to more extensive cooperation frequently cited is the domestic orientation of regulatory agencies involved in the process . to promote more effective trc , two policy options are commonly advanced : ( 1 ) attracting high - level political support and ( 2 ) increasing dramatically the involvement of legislators ( congress and the european parliament ) . the transatlantic economic council ( tec ) , which was created in april 2007 , was designed , in part , to generate the kind of high - level political support that previous initiatives may have lacked . at the last tec meeting , held in november 2011 , the two sides agreed to avoid creating new and unintended barriers to trade and investment , especially in emerging technologies , such as nanotechnology , biobased food , and cloud computing . the leaders also encouraged regulators on both sides to implement common regulatory principles and best practices . trc has been mostly an executive branch driven process . yet , through authorization and appropriations of the many different regulatory agencies involved in trc , congress could play a more central role if it decided to move in this direction . as domestic regulation takes place in an increasingly integrated transatlantic marketplace , congress will be called upon to balance the often competing demands of trade expansion and barrier reduction against domestic health and safety concerns .
most federal employees ( 59.8 % ) are paid on the general schedule , a pay scale that consists of 15 pay grades in which an employee 's pay increases are to be based on performance and length of service . some members of congress , citizens , and public administration scholars have argued that federal employee pay advancement should be more closely linked to job performance . with explicit congressional authorization enacted in 2003 , the department of defense ( dod ) created the national security personnel system ( nsps ) as a unique pay scale attempting to more closely link employee pay to job performance . nsps has been plagued by criticisms since it went into effect in 2006. the system has faced legal and political challenges from unions and employees who claim it is inconsistently applied and causes undeserved pay inequities , among other concerns . on october 7 , 2009 , house and senate conferees reported a version of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2010 that included language to terminate nsps . on october 8 , 2009 , the house agreed to the conference report . the senate agreed to the conference report on october 22 , 2009. on october 28 , 2009 , the president signed the bill into law ( p.l . 111-84 ) . dod must now return the employees currently enrolled in nsps to the gs or to the pay scale in which they were previously enrolled . the return to the gs or other pay scales must be completed by 2012 , pursuant to the legislation . nsps was initially intended to cover all dod employees , but has a current enrollment of roughly 211,000 civilian employees , or 29.4 % of the department 's 717,000-person workforce . like other performance - based pay systems , nsps makes job performance a predominant factor in determining employee pay . a supervisor and an employee who use nsps are to work together to create an annual appraisal plan that accurately reflects an employee 's performance . a supervisor then is to use the appraisal to evaluate the employee . at the end of each appraisal year , an employee may be assigned a percentage increase in pay based on his or her performance . these increases are called pay shares . lower - performing employees may receive fewer pay shares or no pay shares . an employee must acquire at least a satisfactory performance rating to be eligible for any performance - based bonuses . this report reviews the creation of the nsps , examines how nsps operates , discusses litigation against it , and analyzes lessons that can be learned from nsps as congress decides whether to maintain the gs , create a new federal pay system , or modify existing ones . it will be updated as necessary .
north koreans have been crossing the border into china , many in search of refuge , since the height of north korea 's famine in the 1990s . the state department estimates that 30,000-50,000 north korean refugees currently live in china ( some non - governmental organizations estimate the number is closer to 300,000 ) and believes those who are repatriated may face punishment ranging from a few months of `` labor correction '' to execution . a number of reports also document the difficult conditions faced by north koreans who remain in china . the plight of the north koreans focuses attention not only on those seeking refuge and their refugee status , but also points to the factors driving their decision to leave , primarily food shortages , deteriorating humanitarian conditions , and human rights violations . north korea is generally characterized as one of the world 's worst violators of human rights and religious freedom , an issue that some members of congress and interest groups say should assume greater importance in the formation of u.s. priorities towards north korea . congressional concern about human rights in north korea and conditions faced by north korean refugees led to the passage of the north korean human rights act ( nkhra ) in 2004. north korean refugees in china and human rights issues are frequently raised simultaneously , particularly in a congressional context . although the situation for north koreans seeking to leave their country and for those who remain inside its borders pose different questions and may call for separate responses , both focus on the nature of the regime in pyongyang . critics of the north korean government have raised both issues together to put pressure on the regime , particularly when nuclear weapons program negotiations stalled . some advocates do not want to link refugee and human rights issues , claiming that the former calls for a quieter , cooperative approach , while the latter requires a more outspoken response to the north korean government 's practices . although some policy experts insist that the united states has a moral imperative to stand up for the oppressed , others say that this creates obstacles in the nuclear disarmament negotiations . in 2007 , the bush administration entered into bilateral talks with north korea and linked the prospect of diplomatic relations and pyongyang 's re - entry into the international community with only the nuclear issue , leaving out human rights and refugee concerns . nevertheless , north korean human rights and refugee issues remain significant concerns and also have broader regional importance . china and south korea want to avoid a massive outflow of refugees , which they believe could trigger the instability or collapse of north korea . north korean refugees seeking resettlement often transit through other asian countries , raising diplomatic , refugee , and security concerns for those governments . south korea , as the final destination of the vast majority of north koreans , struggles to accommodate new arrivals and does not want to damage its relations with north korea . this report will be updated as events warrant .
scientific and technical knowledge and guidance influences not just policy related to science and technology , but also many of today 's public policies as policymakers seek knowledge to enhance the quality of their decisions . science and technology policy is concerned with the allocation of resources for and encouragement of scientific and engineering research and development , the use of scientific and technical knowledge to enhance the nation 's response to societal challenges , and the education of americans in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics . science and engineering research and innovations are intricately linked to societal needs and the nation 's economy in areas such as transportation , communication , agriculture , education , environment , health , defense , and jobs . as a result , policymakers are interested in almost every aspect of science and technology policy . the three branches of government — executive , congressional , and judiciary — depending on each branch 's responsibility , use science and technology knowledge and guidance to frame policy issues , craft legislation , and govern . the science and engineering community , however , is not represented by one individual or organization . on matters of scientific and technical knowledge and guidance , its opinions are consensus - based with groups of scientists and engineers coming together from different perspectives to debate an issue based on the available empirical evidence . in the end , consensus is achieved if there is widespread agreement on the evidence and its implications , which is conveyed to policymakers . policymakers then determine , based on this knowledge and other factors , whether or not to take action and what actions to take . if there are major disagreements within large portions of the community , however , consensus is not yet achieved , and taking policy actions in response to a concern can be challenging . several organizations , when requested by the federal government or congress , provide formal science and technology policy advice : federal advisory committees , congressionally chartered honorific organizations , and federally funded research and development corporations . in addition , many other organizations and individuals — international intergovernmental organizations , policy institutes / think tanks , the public , professional organizations , disciplinary societies , universities and colleges , advocacy , special interest , industry , trade associations , and labor — also provide their thoughts . these organizations may agree on the scientific and technical knowledge regarding an issue , but disagree on what actions to take in response , as their values on a proposed policy may differ . policymakers may be overwhelmed with an abundance of information from these organizations . despite these challenges , scientific and technical knowledge and guidance can provide policymakers with an opportunity to make their decisions based on the best information available , along with other factors they might take into account , such as cultural , economic , and other values , so that societal and economic benefits are enhanced and losses are mitigated .
social security has significantly reduced elderly poverty . the elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35 % in 1959 to an all - time low of 9 % in 2006 , in large part because of social security . if social security benefits did not exist , an estimated 44 % of the elderly would be poor today assuming no changes in behavior . the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program , also provides benefits to the poorest elderly , many of whom do not qualify for social security benefits . however , despite these programs , about 3.4 million elderly individuals remained in poverty in 2006. the social security system faces a long - term financing problem . the social security trustees project cash - flow deficits beginning in 2017 and trust fund insolvency in 2041. many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the future . benefit reductions could affect the low - income elderly , many of whom rely on social security benefits for almost all of their income . such potential benefit reductions could lead to higher rates of poverty among the elderly compared to those projected under the current benefit formula . because the low - income elderly are especially vulnerable to benefit reductions , many recent social security reform proposals have included minimum benefits or other provisions that would mitigate the effect of benefit cuts on the elderly poor . this report analyzes the projected effects of four possible approaches to mitigating the effects of social security benefit reductions on elderly poverty in 2042 , the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency . the options are compared to a payable baseline , which assumes current - law benefits would need to be cut across the board to balance social security 's annual income and spending at the point of insolvency . the four options examined are ( 1 ) a poverty - line social security minimum benefit ; ( 2 ) a sliding - scale social security minimum benefit ; ( 3 ) a poverty - line ssi benefit ; and ( 4 ) a poverty - line ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility . major findings include the following : each of the four options would reduce elderly poverty compared to the payable baseline — ranging from a negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for the option to create a sliding - scale social security minimum benefit to a reduction of three percentage points for the poverty - line ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility . the elderly poverty rate under all of the options would be higher than under the current law scheduled baseline , which assumes the current benefit formula can be maintained with no reductions . the ssi options examined would target the additional spending more efficiently toward the poor elderly than would the social security options . the social security options examined would reduce the incomes of some elderly because of interaction effects ; the ssi options would not create such interactions .
u.s. - russian trade is governed by title iv of the trade act of 1974 , which sets conditions on russia 's normal trade relations ( ntr ) , or nondiscriminatory , status , including the `` freedom - of - emigration '' requirements of the jackson - vanik amendment ( section 402 ) . changing russia 's trade status to unconditional ntr or `` permanent normal trade relations status ( pntr ) `` requires legislation to lift the restrictions of title iv as they apply to russia and authorize the president to grant russia pntr by proclamation . on november 16 , 2012 , the house passed ( 365-43 ) , and on december 6 , 2012 , the senate passed ( 92-4 ) h.r . 6156 , which does just that , among other things . the legislation also included provisions — the magnitsky rule of law accountability act of 2012 — that impose sanctions on individuals linked to the incarceration and death of russian lawyer sergei magnitsky . h.r . 6156 also authorized pntr status for moldova . president obama signed the legislation into law on december 14 , 2012. pntr for russia became an issue for the 112th congress because , on august 22 , 2012 , russia joined the wto after having completed a 19-year accession process . the wto requires each member to accord newly acceding members `` immediate and unconditional '' most - favored - nation ( mfn ) status , or pntr . in order to comply with wto rules , the united states had to extend pntr to russia .
infectious diseases are estimated to cause more than 25 % of all deaths around the world . a number of infectious disease outbreaks over the past decade , such as h5n1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) , have heightened concerns about how infectious diseases might threaten global security . international air travel and trade have complicated efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases . people could cross borders carrying a highly contagious disease before an infectious agent causes symptoms . non - health officials are becoming increasingly aware of the threat that infectious diseases pose . an event that illuminated the issue occurred in may 2007 , when a man known to be carrying a drug - resistant form of tuberculosis ( tb ) crossed a number of international borders unabated . the world health organization ( who ) estimates that someone contracts tb every second and that about one - third of all people in the world carry tb ; most of these cases , however , are latent . in 2006 , an estimated 14.4 million people were living with tb globally , including 9.2 million who contracted the disease that year . about 1.7 million people carrying tb died in 2006 , including 200,000 people co - infected with hiv / aids . about 80 % of all estimated new tb cases arising in the world each year occur in 22 high - burden countries ( hbcs ) . who indicates that the global incidence of tb per capita peaked around 2003 and since then , incidence per 100,000 population stabilized in europe and declined in all five who regions , although the absolute number of new cases increased between 2005 and 2006 in africa , the middle east , europe , and southeast asia . in sub - saharan africa , weak health systems , minimal access to health facilities , insufficient staffing and little human resource development , ill - equipped and substandard laboratories , and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) co - infection have limited countries ' ability to contain tb . in fy2008 , congress funded u.s. global tb operations at unprecedented levels . through fy2008 consolidated appropriations , congress provided $ 162.2 million to international tb programs and an additional $ 840.3 million for a u.s. contribution to the global fund to fight hiv / aids , tb , and malaria ( global fund ) . the house passed and the senate foreign relations committees reported out companion tb bills , stop tb now act ( h.r . 1567 and s. 968 ) to support global tb efforts and authorize $ 330 million in fy2008 and $ 450 million in fy2009 . they also authorized $ 70 million and $ 100 million for anti - tb programs at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) in fy2008 and fy2009 , respectively . although congress voted to increase support for global tb efforts , some members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs . the administration requested $ 97.1 million for fy2009 global tb efforts , some $ 55 million less than appropriated in fy2008 . this report , which will be updated periodically , discusses some key issues congress might consider as debate ensues about the proper level and use of global tb funds .
this crs report analyzes the security implications of taiwan 's presidential election of march 22 , 2008. this analysis draws in part from direct information gained through a visit to taiwan to observe the election and to discuss views with a number of interlocutors , including those advising or aligned with president chen shui - bian and president - elect ma ying - jeou . this crs report will discuss the results of taiwan 's presidential election and symbolic yet sensitive referendums on u.n. membership , outlook for taiwan 's stability and policies , implications for u.s. security interests , and options for u.s. policymakers in a window of opportunity . this report will not be updated . the united states positioned two aircraft carriers near taiwan . thus , there was u.s. relief when the referendums , as targets of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) 's condemnation , failed to be valid . kuomintang ( kmt ) candidate ma ying - jeou won with a surprising and solid margin of victory ( 17 percent ; 2.2 million votes ) , against democratic progressive party ( dpp ) candidate frank hsieh . the near - term outlook for taiwan 's future is positive for stability and in policy - making on defense . however , in the longer term , the question of taiwan 's identity and sovereignty as separate from the prc remains unsettled . moreover , the people 's liberation army ( pla ) has continued to build up its forces that threaten taiwan , raising the issue of whether the military balance already has shifted to favor the prc . the results of march 22 sapped the prc 's alarmist warnings about the election and referendums , although it might still warn about instability until the inauguration on may 20 while chen is still president . nevertheless , cross - strait tension is greatly reduced . chen is effectively weakened and concentrating on the transition . ma is less provocative towards beijing than chen . ma gives pro - u.s. assurances . there is future uncertainty , however , as the kmt could choose to accommodate beijing , challenge beijing , or seek a bipartisan consensus on national security . in one view , there is an opportunity to turn u.s. attention from managing the cross - strait situation to more urgent priorities that require the prc 's improved cooperation , such as dealing with nuclear proliferation in north korea and iran , the crisis in darfur in sudan , repression in burma , the crackdown in tibet , etc . alternatively , a window of opportunity is presented for the first time in years to take steps to sustain u.s. interests in security and stability in the taiwan strait . considerations include whether to counter perceptions in beijing of `` co - management '' with washington and rising expectations about u.s. concessions to prc demands , notions denied by the administration . an issue for policymakers is what approach to take in a window of opportunity . u.s. policymakers have various options to : continue the existing approach ; engage with president - elect ma ( including a possible u.s. visit before his inauguration ) ; strengthen ties for taiwan 's military , political , and economic security ( including a possible consideration of its request for f - 16c / d fighters ) ; promote a new cross - strait dialogue ; and conduct a strategic review of policy toward taiwan .
written for congressional staff , this report identifies and provides details on how to obtain information on legislative procedures and process in the house and senate . it provides references to selected crs products and offers information on the crs legislative institutes . a listing of selected supplementary materials is also provided . this report will be updated as new information is available .
as of april 14 , 2003 , most health care providers ( including doctors and hospitals ) and health plans are required to comply with the new privacy rule mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( `` hipaa '' ) , and must comply with national standards to protect individually identifiable health information . the hipaa privacy rule creates a federal floor of privacy protections for individually identifiable health information ; establishes a set of basic consumer protections ; institutes a series of regulatory permissions for uses and disclosures of protected health information ; permits any person to file an administrative complaint for violations ; and authorizes the imposition of civil or criminal penalties . in hearings prior to the effective date of the rule , there was widespread concern over aspects of the rule , including the extent to which it preempted state laws . on april 17 , 2003 , hhs published an interim final rule establishing the rules of procedure for investigations and the imposition of civil money penalties concerning violations . this interim final rule will be effective may 19 , 2003 through september 16 , 2003. hhs plans to issue a complete enforcement rule with both procedural and substantive provisions after notice - and - comment rulemaking . this report will be updated .
continuing appropriations acts , often known as continuing resolutions ( crs ) , have been a component of the annual appropriations process for decades . when congress and the president do not reach final decisions about one or more regular appropriations acts by the beginning of the federal fiscal year , october 1 , they often enact a cr . two general types of crs are used . an `` interim '' cr provides agencies with stopgap funding for a period of time until final appropriations decisions are made , or until enactment of another interim cr . a `` full - year '' cr provides final funding amounts for the remainder of a fiscal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts . `` anomalies '' may be included in an interim cr to prevent what parties to cr negotiations perceive as major problems that would be caused if an otherwise uniform approach were used to provide funding and impose related restrictions . the president , office of management and budget ( omb ) , and agencies often are involved with congress in the process of formulating , negotiating , and implementing interim crs . an implication of their involvement is that they may influence the potential impacts of interim crs . interim crs typically are intended to both ( 1 ) preserve congressional prerogatives to make final decisions on full - year funding levels and ( 2 ) prevent a funding gap and corresponding government shutdown . consequently , interim crs provide relatively restrictive funding levels for agencies and usually prohibit projects or activities that were not funded in the previous year ( sometimes called `` new starts '' ) . interim crs also impose some paperwork burden on federal agencies . two other potential impacts might be identified . first , the restrictive funding level of an interim cr may impact upon an agency 's activities , compared to the situation of receiving full - year appropriations . for example , agency personnel may reduce or delay a variety of actions , including hiring , award of contracts , and travel . second , an agency funded by an interim cr may experience some uncertainty about what its final funding level will be . uncertainty may cause an agency to alter its operations , rates of spending , and spending patterns over time , with potential ripple effects for internal management of the agency and its programmatic activities . whether any potential impacts manifest themselves in actual cases would depend on specific circumstances , including how the interim cr is crafted , the time of year , and an agency 's or program 's particular operations . omb and agency documents , as well as government accountability office ( gao ) reports , provide additional perspectives on potential impacts of interim crs . related issues for congress may include use of anomalies to manage impacts , congressional access to information and views from agencies and their employees , and the assumptions that are used when assessing potential impacts . more extensive analysis on this subject is available in crs congressional distribution memorandum , potential impacts of interim continuing resolutions ( crs ) on agency operations and the functioning of the federal government , coordinated by [ author name scrubbed ] ( available on request ) . this report will be updated annually or more frequently as events warrant .
the issue of expanding intellectual property protections for geographical indicationsforwines , spirits , and agricultural products is being debated in the world trade organization ( wto ) . geographicalindications areimportant in international trade because they are commercially valuable . some european and developing countrieswant to establish tougher restrictions and limits on the use of geographical names for products , while the united states and associatedcountries arguethat the existing level of protection of such terms is adequate . decisions about the future scope of protection ofgeographicalindications will be made as the current ( doha ) round of multilateral trade negotiations continues . congress ismonitoring thenegotiations and their potential impacts on u.s. producers . this report will be updated as events warrant .
congress has long taken a leadership role in establishing and sustaining offices of inspector general ( oigs ) , which now exist in more than 60 federal departments and agencies . this effort began with congress 's initiation of the first contemporary statutory inspectors general ( igs ) in 1976 ; it has continued with passage of the broadly encompassing 1978 inspector general ( ig ) act and 1988 amendments as well as with additions and modifications in the meantime . in the 110 th congress , two bills designed to increase the igs ' independence and accountability or otherwise modify specific provisions have been introducedâ h.r . 928 and s. 1723 . these bills are similar , and their major provisions include a fixed term of office for igs ; removal for cause only ; apprisal of the intention to remove or transfer an ig given to congress 15 or 30 days in advance ; notification of the annual ig budget request to congress and the office of management and budget ( omb ) when the ig submits it to agency administration ; establishment of a council of inspectors general on integrity and efficiency , replacing the two current councils operating under executive order ; and creation of an integrity committee composed of council members to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by an inspector general or officials in the office . the house oversight and government reform committee reported h.r . 928 with some changes on september 27 , 2007. the bush administration has taken exception to several provisions in h.r . 928 âremoval for cause , transmittal of budget requests to congress , and an independent ig councilâand , on october 1 , 2007 , threatened a veto of the legislation . the house passed h.r . 928 , with amendments , by a vote of 404-11 on october 3 , 2007. this report , which will be updated as developments dictate , covers the main provisions of the proposals .
on september 14 , 2007 , president george w. bush signed s. 1 , the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 ( p.l . 110-81 ) , into law . the honest leadership and open government act ( hloga ) amended the lobbying disclosure act ( lda ) of 1995 ( p.l . 104-65 , as amended ) to provide , among other changes to federal law and house and senate rules , additional and more frequent disclosures of lobbying contacts and activities . this report explains the role of the clerk of the house of representatives and the secretary of the senate in implementing lobbying registration and disclosure requirements and summarizes the guidance documents they have jointly issued . under the hloga and predecessor lobbying laws , the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate manage the registration , filing , and the collection of documents submitted by the lobbyists and lobbying firms . prior to the hloga , lobbyists were required to file paper documents with both the clerk and the secretary . these forms are now filed electronically and jointly with the clerk and the secretary . in addition , the clerk and the secretary are responsible for making documents publicly available and reporting incorrect or false filings to the u.s. attorney for the district of columbia . beginning in december 2007 , the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate issued joint guidance documents for hloga implementation . the guidance document identified eight substantive changes to the 1995 lobbying disclosure act , and discussed how the clerk and secretary interpret and implement the hloga 's provisions . in addition , the guidance document provided direction on successful completion of quarterly registration and disclosure documents , the new semi - annual reporting requirement , and interpretation of the clerk and secretary 's role in referring non - compliance to the u.s. attorney . since issuing an initial guidance document in 2007 , the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate , pursuant to 2 u.s.c . §1605 , have conducted periodic reviews of existing guidance and have issued multiple updates . most recently , the document was updated on january 31 , 2017 , to update registration thresholds pursuant to changes in the consumer price index ; provide additional clarifications on identifying clients and covered officials ; provide additional examples for filing by outside lobbyists ; clarify that all income and expenditure reporting should be rounded to the nearest $ 10,000 ; clarify that all `` sole proprietors '' are required to file two ld - 203 disclosure forms — one for the registrant [ firm ] and one for the individual lobbyist ; and encourage filers to use the online public database for compliance purposes . for further analysis on the honest leadership and open government act and the lobbying disclosure act , see crs report r40245 , lobbying registration and disclosure : before and after the enactment of the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report r44292 , the lobbying disclosure act at 20 : analysis and issues for congress , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
on june 5 , 2000 , the national commission on terrorism ( ntc ) , a congressionallymandated bi - partisan body , issueda report providing a blueprint for u.s. counter - terrorism policy with both policy and legislative recommendations.the report could be significant in shaping thedirection of u.s. policy and the debate in congress . it generally argues for a more aggressiveu.s . strategy in combating terrorism . critics , however , argue thatntc conclusions and recommendations ignore competing u.s. goals and interests ; i.e that a proactive strategymight lead to the curbing of individual rights andliberties , damage important commercial interests , and widen disagreements between the u.s. and its allies overusing the `` stick '' as opposed to the `` carrot '' approach in dealing with states that actively support or countenance terrorism . the ntc report is likely to stimulate strong congressional interest in counterterrorism policy in the 107th congress . likely areas of focus are ( 1 ) a more proactivecounterterrorism policy ; ( 2 ) a stronger state sanctions policy ; and ( 3 ) a more cohesive / better coordinated u.s.federal counterterrorism response . january 23 , 2001press reports indicate that rep. j.c. watts ( r - okla ) has urged house speaker dennis hastert to create a houseselect committee on domestic terrorism . in the106th congress , h.r . 4210 , which passed the house , would also give added attention todomestic terrorism by establishing a president 's council ondomestic preparedness in the white house . moreover , in the 106th congress , s. 3205 , the ( kyl - feinstein ) counteterrrorism act of 2000 , whichpassed the senate , incorporated a number of recommendations of the ntc including measures to ensure ( 1 ) enhanced policy emphasis on control of biologicalpathogens and terrorist funding raising ; ( 2 ) better sharing of fbi intelligence ; ( 3 ) easier recruitment of ciacounter - terrorism informants ; and ( 4 ) maintainingsyria and iran on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism . this report will not be updated .
members of the uniformed services and u.s. citizens who live abroad are eligible to register and vote absentee in federal elections under the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act ( uocava , p.l . 99-410 ) of 1986. the law was enacted to improve absentee registration and voting for this group of voters and to consolidate existing laws . since 1942 , a number of federal laws have been enacted to assist these voters : the soldier voting act of 1942 ( p.l . 77-712 , amended in 1944 ) , the federal voting assistance act of 1955 ( p.l . 84-296 ) , the overseas citizens voting rights act of 1975 ( p.l . 94-203 ; both the 1955 and 1975 laws were amended in 1978 to improve procedures ) , and the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee voting act of 1986. the law is administered by the secretary of defense , who delegates that responsibility to the director of the federal voting assistance program ( fvap ) at the department of defense ( dod ) . improvements to uocava were necessary as the result of controversy surrounding ballots received in florida from uniformed services and overseas voters in the 2000 presidential election . both the national defense authorization act for fy2002 ( p.l . 107-107 ) and the help america vote act of 2002 ( p.l . 107-252 ) included provisions concerning uniformed services and overseas voting . the ronald w. reagan defense authorization act for fy2005 ( p.l . 108-375 ) amended uocava as well , and the john warner national defense authorization act for fy2007 ( p.l . 109-364 ) extended a dod program to assist uocava voters . in the 111th congress , a major revision of uocava was completed when president obama signed the national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fy2010 ( p.l . 111-84 ) on october 28 , 2009. it included an amendment ( s.amdt . 1764 ) that contained the provisions of s. 1415 , the military and overseas voter empowerment act ( the move act ) . in july 2014 , the election assistance commission issued its election administration and voting survey report that included data on uocava as well as domestic registration and voting in the 2014 election cycle . the biennial uocava report is mandated by the help america vote act and had previously been issued separately from the general survey report . according to the results , ballots were transmitted to uocava voters by election officials in all 50 states and four of the territories , but more than half of all ballots were sent from california , florida , new york , and washington . the rate of ballots returned for counting was slightly lower than in the midterm election of 2010 , and substantially lower than in the presidential election of 2012. states counted 94.6 % of the ballots that were returned . the overseas vote foundation released the results of its 2014 post - election survey in february 2015. overall , 74 % of those who requested an absentee ballot received it and 23 % did not ( slightly more than 2 % did not know or remember whether a ballot was received ) . two bills introduced in the 114th congress would amend uocava . these include h.r . 12 which is primarily related to other voting issues ; and s. 2814 , a version of the fy2017 ndaa bill introduced `` by request '' but that did not advance . in addition , a provision in the house - passed ndaa bill ( h.r . 4909 ) would continue some uocava reporting requirements , despite terminating some unrelated reports . in the 113th congress , the senate committee on rules and administration held a hearing on s. 1728 on january 29 , 2014 , and reported the bill with an amendment in the nature of a substitute on april 10 , 2014. it would have required states to report statistics on the number of absentee ballots sent to uocava voters before the election , established online voter registration and updating for uniformed services voters , and made an absentee ballot request valid for the entire two - year federal election cycle . the legislation did not advance .
freedomcar and the hydrogen fuel initiative are two complementary government - industry research and development ( r & d ) policy initiatives that promote the development of hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles . coordinated by the department of energy ( doe ) , these initiatives aim to make mass - market fuel cell and hydrogen combustion vehicles available at an affordable cost within 10 to 15 years from the launch of the initiatives . however , questions have been raised about the design and goals of the initiatives . this report discusses the organization , funding , and goals of the freedomcar and fuel partnerships , and issues for congress .
the 110th congress passed an omnibus farm bill ( food , conservation , and energy act of 2008 , p.l . 110-246 ) to authorize and direct the implementation of the u.s. department of agriculture 's ( usda 's ) major programs across the spectrum of its mission areas through fy2012 . the enacted bill reorganizes the department 's research , education , and economics mission area , which currently comprises four agencies that separately administer intramural and extramural programs supporting agricultural research and development ( r & d ) . the research title of p.l . 110-246 ( title vii ) classifies all current research , extension , and education programs into two groups — capacity programs and competitive programs — based upon the way in which their funding is distributed to recipients . title vii creates an umbrella coordinating entity known as the research , education , and extension office ( reeo ) in the office of the under secretary for research , education , and economics , and designates the under secretary as the chief scientist of usda . the reeo will coordinate and plan both capacity and competitive programs , as well as usda - administered intramural ( agricultural research service ( ars ) ) and extramural programs . extramural programs ( both capacity and competitive ) , currently administered by the cooperative state research , education , and extension service ( csrees ) ) , will be transferred to a new national institute for food and agriculture ( nifa ) , and csrees will cease to exist on october 1 , 2009. within the new nifa , the existing national research initiative competitive grants program ( nri ) will be expanded into an agriculture and food research initiative ( afri ) . it will incorporate the purposes of the former initiative for future agriculture and food systems ( ifafs ) , whose authority the new farm bill repeals . the house and senate versions of the farm bill would have provided $ 865 million and $ 160 million , respectively , in mandatory funding for certain research programs over the five - year life of the bill . the enacted bill provides a total of $ 333 million in mandatory funds for ( 1 ) a new specialty crop research initiative ( $ 230 million ) ; ( 2 ) research on fresh produce food safety ( $ 25 million ) ; and ( 3 ) organic agriculture research ( $ 78 million ) . the enacted farm bill research title includes major initiatives to provide capacity - building support to hispanic - serving agricultural colleges and to make them eligible to receive funding through a wider range of grant programs . this report will not be updated .
this report compares selected recommendations of the president 's commission on care for america 's returning wounded warriors ( pccww ) , often called the dole - shalala commission in reference to its co - chairs , and the veterans ' disability benefits commission ( vdbc ) . the vdbc was established in 2004 to study veterans ' benefits in a broad context . the pccww was established in 2007 following reports of problems among injured servicemembers returning from iraq and afghanistan with medical rehabilitation and access to benefits . the pccww was charged to focus specifically on the needs of these individuals . the recommendations presented in this report are those that relate to the transition of injured servicemembers from military service to civilian life and / or veteran status . this report does not examine certain other recommendations , such as those in the vdbc report regarding benefits for survivors of deceased servicemembers , or regarding evaluation of presumptive disability , i.e . , establishing service connection for certain long - term health effects of hazardous exposures . as this report is limited to a comparison of the final recommendations of the pccww and the vdbc , it will not be updated .
the higher education act ( hea ) supports several programs that provideservices and incentives to disadvantaged students to help increase their educational attainment . foremost amongtheseprograms are the federal trio programs and the gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduateprogram ( gear up ) . these programs are primarily intended for individuals who are from low - income families and wouldbe thefirst in their family to attain a college degree . this report reviews available data on these populations and attemptstomeasure the extent to which high school graduates from these groups go on to college . this report is intended asasupplement to crs report rl31622 , trio and gear up programs : status and issues , and will notbe updated .
several bills were introduced in previous sessions of congress that would have addressed the recently recognized phenomenon of patented tax strategies . these legislative initiatives would have prevented the grant of exclusive intellectual property rights by the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) on methods that individuals and enterprises might use in order to minimize their tax obligations . this issue may arise before the 112th congress . many commentators trace the rise of tax strategy patents to the 1998 opinion of the federal circuit in state street bank v. signature financial group , which rejected a per se rule that business methods could not be patented . in recent years , the uspto has issued a number of patents that pertain to tax strategies . several of these patents have been subject to enforcement litigation in federal court . the 2010 decision of the supreme court in bilski v. kappos continues to allow for the possibility of business method patents , and potentially tax strategy patents as well . the impact of tax strategy patents upon social welfare has been subject to a spirited debate . some observers are opposed to tax strategy patents . these commentators believe that patent protection is unnecessary with respect to tax avoidance techniques due to a high level of current innovation . others believe that patent - based incentives to develop tax avoidance strategies are not socially desirable . they assert that patents may limit the ability of individuals to utilize provisions of the tax code intended for all taxpayers , interfering with congressional intent and leading to distortions in tax obligations . others have expressed concerns that tax strategy patents may potentially complicate legal compliance by tax professionals and individual taxpayers alike . other experts believe that these concerns are overstated , and also make the affirmative case that tax strategy patents may provide positive social benefits . they explain that patents on `` business methods '' have been obtained and enforced for many years . they also observe that the grant of a patent does not imply government approval of the practice of the patented invention , and that professionals in many spheres of endeavor have long had to account for the patent system during their decision - making process . they also believe that the availability of tax strategy patents may promote innovation in a field of endeavor that is demonstrably valuable . further , such patents might promote public disclosure of tax strategies to tax professionals , taxpayers , and responsible government officials alike . three bills that were introduced , but not enacted , in the 111th congress — h.r . 1265 , h.r . 2584 , and s. 506 — would have prohibited the issuance of patents on tax strategies . other legislative responses , including oversight of the uspto , promotion of cooperation between the uspto and the irs , and the encouragement of private sector contributions to the patent examination process , are also possible .
this report provides a brief list of key house , senate , legislative support agencies , and executive branch offices , as well as links to online resources of use to new congressional staff who work with legislative procedures and conduct legislative research . some of the websites listed are available only to congressional offices ; other sites are restricted by chamber and are only available to those staff working in either house or senate offices . this report is intended for congressional use only and will be updated annually .
the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventions and administers the registration of trademarks . it also assists other federal departments and agencies protect american intellectual property in the international marketplace . the uspto is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as `` offsetting collections '' and subject to spending limits established by the committee on appropriations . until recently , appropriation measures limited uspto use of all fees accumulated within a fiscal year . critics of this approach argued that because agency operations are supported by payments for services , all fees were necessary to fund these services in the year they were provided . some experts claimed that a portion of the patent and trademark collections were used to offset the cost of other , non - related programs . proponents of limiting use of funds collected maintained that the fees appropriated back to the uspto were sufficient to cover the agency 's operating budget . on december 9 , 2016 , president obama signed into law the further continuing and security assistance , appropriations act of 2017 ( p.l . 114-254 ) . this act , among other provisions , continues uspto 's budget supported by patent fees at $ 3.231 billion . for fy2017 , the administration 's request for a fee - based budget authority was $ 3.244 billion . p.l . 112-29 , the leahy - smith america invents act , keeps the use of fees collected within the congressional appropriations process , but requires that fees generated above the budget authority provided by the committee on appropriations be placed in a separate fund within the department of the treasury . while use of these `` excess '' funds still remains under the control of the appropriators , they may only be used for the work of the uspto .
the senate frequently enters into unanimous consent agreements ( sometimes referred to as `` uc agreements '' or `` time agreements '' ) that establish procedures for the consideration of legislation that the senate is considering or will soon consider . in recent practice , such unanimous consent agreements have sometimes included a provision that would require a 60-vote threshold to be met for amendments or legislation to be considered agreed to , rather than the simple majority ordinarily required . these amendments or measures may be of a controversial nature with the potential for causing a filibuster . by incorporating a 60-vote threshold , such uc agreements avoid the multiple requirements imposed by senate rule xxii for invoking cloture , while preserving the same requirement for super - majority support . this report will be updated each session of congress .
the fy2006 budget completed the funding required in the shipbuilding and conversion , navy ( scn ) account for the navy 's program to refuel and convert four trident ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) into cruise - missile - carrying and special operations forces ( sof ) support submarines ( ssgns ) . initial operational capability ( ioc ) for the program was declared on november 1 , 2007. the total estimated cost of the program is about $ 4.0 billion . this report will be updated as events warrant .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed year 2000 ( y2k ) computing crisis risks to the department of education , focusing on : student financial aid systems ; actions the department has taken in recent months to address these risks ; and key issues the department must deal with if its systems are to be ready for the century change : testing of systems , exchanging data with internal and external partners , and developing business continuity and contingency plans . gao noted that : education faces major risks that y2k failures could severely disrupt the student financial aid delivery process , including delaying disbursements and application processing ; further , because of systems interdependencies , repercussions from y2k - related problems could be felt throughout the student financial aid community -- a network including students , institutions of higher educations , financial organizations , and other government agencies ; the department was very slow in implementing a comprehensive y2k program to address these risks -- basic awareness and assessment tasks were not completed until recently ; education is now accelerating its program , but with the slow start , it remains in a position of playing catch up ; accordingly , the department has major challenges ahead but limited time remaining to adequately deal with them ; and therefore , it must also focus on developing appropriate contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of key systems failures .
gao discussed the importance of having strong agency chief information officers ( cio ) and an effective cio council , focusing on its study of how leading private - and public - sector organizations control system development projects and successfully apply technology to improve their performance , which identified a specific set of strategic practices that these organizations use to improve performance through information management . gao noted that : senior executives in the successful organizations it studied were personally committed to improving the management of technology ; applicable laws make federal agency heads directly responsible for establishing goals and measuring progress in improving the use of information technology to enhance the productivity and efficiency of agency operations and assign a wide range of duties and responsibilities to cios ; agencies should place cios at a senior management level , working as a partner with other senior officials in decisionmaking on information management issues ; having effective cios will make a difference in building the institutional capacity and structure needed to implement sound management practices ; shortly after the clinger - cohen act went into effect , the office of management and budget ( omb ) evaluated the status of cio appointments at 27 agencies and noted that at several agencies , the cio 's duties , qualifications , and placement met the act 's requirements ; however , omb had concerns about a number of other agencies that had acting cios , cios whose qualifications did not appear to meet the act 's requirements , or cios who did not report directly to the head of the agency ; omb also raised concerns about agencies where the cios had other major management responsibilities or where it was unclear whether the cios ' primary duty was information resource management ; one area that gao will focus on is cios who have major responsibilities in addition to information management ; only 12 agencies have cios whose responsibilities are focused solely on information management ; gao is particularly troubled by agencies that have vested cio and chief financial officer responsibilities in one person ; because it may be difficult for the cio of a large department to adequately oversee and manage the specific information needs of the department 's major subcomponents , gao has also supported the establishment of a cio structure at the subcomponent and bureau levels ; gao has reported on instances where the subcomponent cios were not organizationally positioned and empowered to discharge key cio functions ; the cfo council has played a lead role in creating goals for improving federal financial management practices ; the council does not yet have a strategic plan to help guide its work and serve as a benchmark for measuring progress ; and ultimately , the successful implementation of information management reforms depends heavily upon the skills and performance of the entire cio organization within departments and agencies , not just the cio as an individual .
gao discussed : the year 2000 risks facing the government ; major concerns with the government 's progress in fixing its systems ; and guidance on year 2000 testing , which is designed to assist agencies in the most extensive and expensive part of remediation . gao noted that : addressing the year 2000 problem in time will be a tremendous challenge for the federal government ; to complicate matters , agencies must consider the computer systems belonging to federal , state , and local governments ; the private sector ; foreign countries ; and international organizations that interface with their systems ; the year 2000 could cause problems for the many facilities used by the federal government that were built or renovated within the last 20 years and contain embedded computer systems to control , monitor , or assist in operations ; if agencies neglect any of these issues , the impact of year 2000 failures could be widespread , costly and potentially disruptive to vital government operations worldwide ; overall , the government 's 24 major departments and agencies are making slow progress in fixing their systems ; many agencies were not adequately acting on critical steps to establish priorities , solidify data exchange agreements , and develop contingency plans ; some agencies are not adequately prepared for testing their systems for year 2000 compliance ; complete and thorough year 2000 testing is essential to provide reasonable assurance that new or modified systems process dates correctly and will not jeopardize an organization 's ability to perform core business operations after the millenium ; since the year 2000 computing problem is so pervasive , the requisite testing is extensive and expensive ; to address the testing problem , gao issued a new installment of its year 2000 guidance which addresses the need to plan and conduct year 2000 tests in a structured and disciplined fashion ; if effectively implemented , the guide should help federal agencies successfully negotiate the complexities involved with the year 2000 testing process ; and however , the success of the government 's year 2000 remediation efforts ultimately hinges on setting governmentwide priorities , ensuring that agencies set priorities and develop contingency plans consistent with these priorities , developing an accurate picture of remediation progress , designating lead agencies for end - to - end testing efforts , and addressing other critical issues such as recruiting and retaining qualified information technology personnel .
the federal voluntary voting system guidelines ( vvsg ) are a set of technical standards for voting systems that use computers to assist in recording or counting votes . the first version went into effect in december 2007 , and a draft second version has been developed . the vvsg replaced the federal voluntary voting systems standards ( vss ) . the 2005 vvsg are a partial revision of the vss , with revision focused mainly on accessibility , usability , and security . the 2007 draft is a complete rewrite . several issues have been raised about the vvsg that may require congressional attention . among them is the question of timing . some vendors claim that there needs to be more time for technology development before the new guidelines become effective ; some activists argue that problems with voting systems , and federal requirements , demand more rapid implementation of the vvsg . the new guidelines did not have much direct impact on voting systems used in 2006. one exception was provisions relating to paper - ballot audit trails , which several states now require to be used in conjunction with electronic voting machines such as touchscreen systems . like the vss , the vvsg are voluntary , but some observers believe that a regulatory approach would be more appropriate given the importance of elections to the democratic process . however , since many states require that voting systems be certified , vendors are expected to treat the vvsg in the same way they have treated the vss — as effectively mandatory .
affirmative action remains a subject of public debate as the result of legal and political developments at the federal , state , and local levels . over the years , federal courts have reviewed minority admissions programs to state universities ; scrutinized the constitutional status of racial diversity policies in public elementary and secondary schools ; ruled on minority preferences in public and private employment as a remedy for violation of civil and constitutional rights ; and considered federal , state , and local efforts to increase minority participation as contractors and subcontractors on publicly financed construction projects . this report provides a brief history of federal affirmative action law .
amid ongoing insurgency , the united states handed sovereignty to an iraqi interimgovernment on june 28. the bush administration maintains that the handover was a success and will begin atransition todemocracy and stability . critics assert that the handover does not appear to have diminished the anti - u.s.insurgency , threateningthe transition roadmap developed by the united states and united nations . legal issues may arise regarding thevalidity of lawsissued during the occupation , as well as the status of u.s. troops in iraq . see crs report rl31339 , iraq : u.s. regime changeefforts and post - saddam governance .
although the vast majority of muslims in europe are not involved in radical activities , islamist extremists and vocal fringe communities that advocate terrorism exist and reportedly have provided cover for terrorist cells . germany and spain were identified as key logistical and planning bases for the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . the march 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid have been attributed to an al qaeda - inspired group of north africans . uk authorities have named four british muslims as the perpetrators of the july 2005 terrorist attacks on london ; in august 2006 , british law enforcement arrested several british muslims suspected of plotting to blow up airliners flying from the uk to the united states . this report provides an overview of islamist extremism in europe , possible terrorist links , european responses , and implications for the united states . it will be updated as needed . see also crs report rl31612 , european counterterrorist efforts : political will and diverse responses in the first year after september 11 , by [ author name scrubbed ] ( pdf ) , and crs report rl33166 , muslims in europe : integration in selected countries , by [ author name scrubbed ] et al .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the district of columbia 's management reform initiatives . gao noted that : over the past 3 fiscal years , the district government has proposed hundreds of management reform initiatives that were estimated to save millions of dollars as well as improve government services ; however , as of june 1 , 2000 , the district had only reported savings of about $ 1.5 million related to these initiatives and had not consistently tracked the status of these projects ; neither the district of columbia financial responsibility a nd management assistance authority nor the district could provide adequate details on the goals achieved for all of the projects that had been reported as completed or in various stages of completion ; the district does not have a systematic process to monitor these management reform projects and determine where savings or customer service improvements have been realized ; and the district can not say for certain how funds designated for management reform have been spent or whether the key goals of these initiatives have been realized .
gao discussed proposed amendments to the single audit act of 1984 and the act 's importance . gao noted that : congress enacted the act in response to state and local governments ' poor accounting practices and lack of accountability for federal funds ; audits were not uniform and some grantees were subjected to multiple annual audits while others were not audited for long periods of time ; state and local governments have greatly improved their accountability and financial management under the act ; proposed amendments would reduce administrative burdens on grantees who receive comparatively small amounts by raising audit thresholds so that audit coverage returns to the 95-percent level ; grantees below the thresholds would still have to maintain records and be subject to monitoring ; the amendments require the office of management and budget to develop a risk - based approach to targeting audit resources at higher - risk programs ; the amendments ' required summary reports would increase audit timeliness and usefulness ; shortening the audits ' due date to 9 months from the fiscal year 's close would also improve the audits ' timeliness ; bringing nonprofit organizations under the act would subject all grantees to uniform requirements ; and the proposed amendments would make the single audits the basis for other audits .
china has a determined , yet still modest , program of civilian space activities planned for the next decade . the potential for u.s. - china cooperation in space — an issue of interest to congress — has become more controversial since the january 2007 chinese anti - satellite test . the test reinforced concerns about chinese intentions in outer space and jeopardized space assets of more than two dozen countries by creating a large cloud of orbital space debris . some argue that chinese capabilities now threaten u.s. space assets in low earth orbit . others stress the need to expand dialogue with china . this report outlines recent activities and future plans in china 's civilian space sector . it also discusses benefits and trade - offs of possible u.s. - china collaboration in space , as well as several options to improve space relations , including information exchange , policy dialogue , and joint activities . for more information , see crs report rs21641 , china 's space program : an overview , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
the congressional franking privilege , which dates from 1775 , allows members of congress to transmit mail matter under their signature without postage . congress , through legislative branch appropriations , reimburses the u.s. postal service for the franked mail it handles . use of the frank is regulated by federal law , house and senate rules , and committee regulations . reform efforts during the past 30 years have reduced overall franking expenditures in both election and non - election years . even - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 85 % from $ 113.4 million in fy1988 to $ 16.9 million in fy2014 , while odd - numbered - year franking expenditures have been reduced by over 90 % from $ 89.5 million in fy1989 to $ 8.3 million in fy2015 . house mail costs have decreased from a high of $ 77.9 million in fy1988 to $ 6.8 million in fy2015 . the senate has dramatically reduced its costs , from $ 43.6 million in fy1984 to $ 1.5 million in fy2015 . during the 114 th congress , one piece of legislation ( h.r . 1873 ) has been introduced that would eliminate the traditional franking privilege of members of congressâthe use of the member 's signature in lieu of prepayment for the mailing of letters related to official business . the bill , however , would continue to authorize the use of official funds for the purpose of member official communications with constituents and others , as `` congressional mail . . it would also eliminate , without replacement , the franking privilege of survivors of members of congress . an identical bill ( h.r . 4872 ) was introduced in the 113 th congress . during the 112 th congress , one piece of legislation was introduced that would have altered the franking privilege for former speakers of the house . s. 3528 would have repealed the authorization providing franking privileges to former speakers of the house . during the 111 th congress , two pieces of legislation were introduced that would have altered the franking privilege for members . h.r . 5151 would have restricted representatives ' use of the frank to documents transmitted under the official letterhead used for the member 's stationery . h.r . 2056 would have prohibited senators and representatives from sending mass mailings during a period starting 90 days prior to a primary and ending on the day of the general election for any election in which the member is a candidate for reelection . during the 110 th congress , five pieces of legislation were introduced to alter the franking privilege for members . one bill would have required that all pieces of mail sent in a mass mailing include a statement indicating the cost of producing and mailing the mass mailing . another bill would have prohibited mass mailings in the form of newsletters , questionnaires , or congratulatory notices . three bills would have prohibited senators and representatives from sending mass mailings during a period starting 90 days prior to a primary and ending on the day of the general election for any election in which the member is a candidate for reelection . this report will be updated as legislative action warrants . see also crs report rl34188 , congressional official mail costs , by [ author name scrubbed ] ; and crs report rl34274 , franking privilege : historical development and options for change , by [ author name scrubbed ] .
iran has an active interest in developing , acquiring , and deploying a broad range of ballistic missiles , as well as developing a space launch capability . this was spotlighted several times since 2008. in mid - july 2008 , iran launched a number of ballistic missiles during military exercises , reportedly including the medium - range shahab - 3 . at the time , a pentagon spokesman said iran was `` not testing new technologies or capabilities , but rather firing off old equipment in an attempt to intimidate their neighbors and escalate tension in the region . . subsequent analysis of the july 2008 missile launches shows iran apparently digitally altered images of those launches . iran announced other missile and space launch tests in august and november 2008. in february 2009 , iran announced it launched a satellite into orbit and `` officially achieved a presence in space . . this short report seeks to provide an overview of the reported or suspected variety of iranian ballistic missile programs . because there remains widespread public divergence over particulars , however , this report does not provide specificity to what iran may or may not have , or is in the process of developing . this report may be updated .
the federal material witness statute provides that , `` if it appears from an affidavit filed by a party that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding [ including a grand jury proceeding ] , and if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena , a judicial officer may order the arrest of the person and treat the person in accordance with the provisions of section 3142 of this title [ relating to bail ] . no material witness may be detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the testimony of such witness can adequately be secured by deposition , and if further detention is not necessary to prevent a failure of justice . release of a material witness may be delayed for a reasonable period of time until the deposition of the witness can be taken pursuant to the federal rules of criminal procedure , '' 18 u.s.c . 3144. in response to objections that the authority had been misused , h.r . 3199 as reported by the house judiciary committee required justice department reports on use of the authority in a grand jury context . the provision was dropped before the bill was taken up . the version sent to the president after passage had no such provision . s. 1739 would rewrite section 3144 , among other things , establishing explicit and more demanding standards for arrest and detention and imposing explicit time limitations on detention . this is an abridged version of crs report rl33077 , arrest and detention of material witnesses : federal law in brief , by [ author name scrubbed ] , without footnotes , most citations to authority , or appendixes .
this report provides a summary review of issues related to pakistan and terrorism , especially in the context of u.s. interests , policy goals , and relevant assistance . the outcomes of u.s. policies toward pakistan since 9 / 11 , while not devoid of meaningful successes , have neither neutralized anti - western militants and reduced religious extremism in that country nor contributed sufficiently to the stabilization of neighboring afghanistan . many observers thus urge a broad re - evaluation of such policies . sources for this report include , among other things , the u.s. departments of state and defense , congressional transcripts , intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations , regional press reports , and major newswires . this report will be updated periodically .
inflation measures the rate of change in all prices . maintaining low and stable inflation is one of the primary goals of macroeconomic policy . but how should inflation be measured ? . policymakers , particularly at the federal reserve , often refer to core inflation in their policy decisions . core inflation is commonly defined as a measure of inflation that omits changes in food and energy prices . some policymakers prefer to use core inflation to predict future overall inflation because food and energy price volatility makes it difficult to discern trends from the overall inflation rate . a drawback of an over - reliance on core inflation , however , is that an extended period of rapidly rising food or energy prices could cause all other prices to accelerate . a focus on core may cause policymakers to fail to react to such a rise in inflation until it is too late . this scenario may have occurred recently . many economists are concerned that rapid increases in food and energy prices are now pushing overall inflation to uncomfortably high levels . furthermore , several studies have failed to find core inflation to be a good forecaster of future inflation , casting doubt on the very rationale for relying on it .
the plaintiff in leegin creative leather products v. psks , inc. successfully asked the supreme court to soften the longstanding treatment of resale price maintenance ( rpm , vertical imposition of direct , minimum price restraints ) as a per se ( automatic , and not capable of being justified ) antitrust offense . rpm had been so analyzed since the court decided in 1911 that a manufacturer of patent medicines could not lawfully agree with retailers of its products on the prices at which those products would be sold ( dr. miles medical company v. john d. park & sons company , 220 u.s. 373 ) . such agreements , the court had said in dr. miles , constituted both unlawful restraints of trade under the common law , and violations of the sherman act 's prohibition against `` contract [ s ] or combination [ s ] ... in restraint of trade '' ( 15 u.s.c . § 1 ) . leegin 's practice of entering into contracts with its retailers of the brighton line of leather products to set the prices at which the dealers would resell those products was challenged by a discounting retailer whose replacement shipments were terminated ; the trial court found a per se violation of section 1 ( 2004 wl 5254322 ) , and the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed that decision ( 171 fed.appx . 464 ( 2006 ) ) . leegin argued in the supreme court that because rpm may sometimes be pro - consumer ( might , for example , allow the retailers to profitably provide extra services desired by some consumers ) , the practice should not be conclusively presumed unreasonable `` without elaborate inquiry as to 'its precise harm or business justification for its use . ' . agreeing with leegin , the court overruled dr. miles , stating that allowing rpm to be analyzed as a rule of reason violation ( pursuant to which the procompetitive effects of a judicially determined antitrust violation are weighed against the anticompetitive results of the challenged activity ) should be allowed : `` notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct , it can not be stated with any degree of confidence that [ rpm ] always tend [ s ] to restrict competition ... .

revelations in early 2008 that cattle were mistreated at a california slaughter plant raised questions about enforcement of the humane methods of slaughter act . evidence emerged that the plant had permitted nonambulatory ( `` downer '' ) cattle to be slaughtered for human food , also potentially jeopardizing food safety . the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) announced the largest meat recall ever , alerted school food authorities to destroy any unconsumed products from the plant , and launched an investigation . since then , animal welfare activists have alleged additional cases of mistreatment at livestock markets . the 110th congress responded with hearings and proposals to alter current policy , but no statutory changes were enacted . in the 111th congress , the senate - passed version of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( h.r . 1 ) included a provision to permanently prohibit the use of federal funds for inspecting any nonambulatory disabled cattle for use as human food , regardless of the reason or time the animal became nonambulatory . ( uninspected cattle can not enter the food supply . ) . however , the provision was removed by house - senate conferees prior to final enactment ( as ( p.l . 111-5 ) ; the house version lacked the provision . additional bills are possible in the 111th congress . meanwhile , usda published a final rule in the march 18 , 2009 , federal register that now specifically requires cattle slaughter establishments to notify fsis inspectors when cattle become nonambulatory disabled even if they have already passed ante - mortem inspection ; all such cattle must be condemned ( diverted from the human food supply ) and properly disposed of . usda already was condemning them if they were nonambulatory at the time of ante - mortem inspection , as a safeguard against the introduction into the human food supply of the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse , or `` mad cow disease '' ) .
congress has expressed a great deal of interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) to surveil the united states ' international land border . u.s. customs and border protection ( cbp ) utilizes advanced technology to augment its usbp agents ' ability to patrol the border , including a fleet of six uavs . this report examines the strengths and limitations of deploying uavs along the borders and related issues for congress . uavs come with several costs and benefits . one potential benefit of uavs is that they could fill a gap in current border surveillance by improving coverage along remote sections of the u.s. borders . moreover , the range of uavs is a significant asset when compared to border agents on patrol or stationary surveillance equipment . yet , despite potential benefits of using uavs for homeland security , various problems encountered in the past may hinder uav implementation on the border . there are concerns regarding the high accident rates of uavs , which have historically been multiple times higher than that of manned aircraft . inclement weather conditions can also impinge on a uav 's surveillance capability . also , according to the cbp inspector general , the costs of operating a uav are more than double the costs of operating a manned aircraft . recent attention has focused on the expanding area of operations for cbp - operated uavs . on june 23 , 2010 , the federal aviation administration ( faa ) granted a certificate of authorization requested by cbp , clearing the uav flights along the texas border and gulf region . other requests have reportedly been delayed due to safety concerns , some of which stem from previous incidents . despite safety concerns , some policymakers continue to call for the increased domestic use of uavs . the supplemental appropriations bill of fy2010 ( h.r . 4899 ) would include $ 32 million for the acquisition of two additional uavs by cbp . this report will be updated as events warrant .
states are able to use revenues from health care provider taxes to help finance the state share of medicaid expenditures . federal statute and regulations define a provider tax as a health care - related fee , assessment , or other mandatory payment for which at least 85 % of the burden of the tax revenue falls on health care providers . for states to be able to draw down federal medicaid matching funds , the provider tax must be both broad - based ( i.e . , imposed on all providers within a specified class of providers ) and uniform ( i.e . , the same tax for all providers within a specified class of providers ) . also , states are not allowed to hold the providers harmless for the cost of the provider tax ( i.e . , states can not guarantee that providers receive their money back ) . a vast majority of states use at least one provider tax to help finance medicaid . many of these states use the provider tax revenue to increase medicaid payment rates for the class of providers , such as hospitals , responsible for paying the provider tax . this financing strategy allows states to fund increases to medicaid payment rates without the use of state funds because the increased medicaid payment rates are funded with provider tax revenue and federal medicaid matching funds . states also use provider tax revenues to fund other medicaid or non - medicaid purposes . states first began using health care provider taxes to help finance the state share of medicaid expenditures in the mid - 1980s . some states were particularly aggressive in their use of provider taxes . as a result , in the early 1990s , the federal government imposed statutory and regulatory limitations on states ' use of health care provider tax revenue to finance medicaid . while federal requirements allow states to impose provider taxes on 19 classes of health care providers , the classes of providers that are most often taxed include nursing facilities , hospitals , and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities ( icf / id ) . states ' use of medicaid provider taxes has increased in recent years . limiting or eliminating states ' use of provider taxes in financing medicaid has been identified as a way to reduce federal medicaid spending . a few years ago , there were a few proposals to limit or eliminate states ' use of provider taxes , but provider tax proposals had not been discussed in the past couple years . however , recently , the house energy and commerce committee marked up a bill ( h.r . 4725 ) that includes a medicaid provider tax provision . this report provides background regarding states ' use of provider taxes in the 1980s and describes the relevant federal statutes and regulations , which were mostly established in the early 1990s . the report explains how states use provider taxes to help finance medicaid and provides information regarding the extent to which states currently use such taxes . the report ends with a discussion of past and present proposals that would impact medicaid provider taxes .
the catastrophic devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in late august 2005 , and to a lesser degree , hurricanes wilma and rita , led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of families . following the storm , the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) took primary responsibility for meeting the emergency housing needs of displaced families . the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , the nation 's housing agency , also played a role . hud modified its existing grant programs — primarily through waivers — to make them more flexible for communities wishing to serve displaced families . the department also took steps to aid displaced families that had been homeless or receiving hud assistance prior to the storm by developing a new voucher program , and by issuing guidance to lenders offering protections for homeowners with fha - insured mortgages . finally , congress has used hud programs , particularly the community development block grant ( cdbg ) program , as a conduit for providing relief and recovery funds to devastated communities . this report details hud 's efforts to provide assistance to affected families and communities immediately after the storm and in the initial rebuilding stages . it will not track hud 's role in the longer - term rebuilding of the devastated areas .
in 2007 , the supreme court issued its decision in massachusetts v. epa , its first pronouncement on climate change and a singularly important environmental law decision . this report reviews that decision , but leaves coverage of the many epa actions based on the decision to other crs reports . massachusetts v. epa was a case brought to challenge epa 's denial of a petition asking the agency to regulate greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions from new motor vehicles under the clean air act ( caa ) . by a vote of 5-4 , the court held first that massachusetts had standing to sue , an issue that took up most of the majority opinion . on the merits , the court found that the caa definition of `` air pollutant '' was unambiguously broad enough to include ghgs . that being so , the court held , caa section 202 authorizes epa to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles on the basis of their possible climate change impacts . finally , the court determined that the phrase `` in [ the administrator 's ] judgment '' in section 202 did not authorize epa to inject policy considerations into its decision whether to so regulate . for these reasons , the court reversed the lower court decision upholding the petition denial . the court 's decision left epa with three options for responding to the petition : ( 1 ) find that new motor vehicle ghg emissions may `` endanger public health or welfare , '' the prerequisite to limiting them under section 202 , then issue emission standards ; ( 2 ) find that they do not satisfy that prerequisite , or ( 3 ) decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making either finding ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . given the state of climate change science by 2007 , it was widely believed at the time that option ( 1 ) was the only legally defensible one for epa . this is the option that epa took , starting with an `` endangerment finding '' issued in 2009. since 2007 , the finding of standing in massachusetts generally has not proved helpful to non - state plaintiffs in climate change litigation , leaving intact this considerable threshold hurdle for climate change plaintiffs . in addition , the massachusetts holding was used , in part , by a 2011 supreme court decision to bar federal common law claims against entities based on their contribution to climate change . on the other hand , massachusetts has been applied by epa to support regulations not only of motor vehicles but also of stationary sources of ghg emissions . in particular , massachusetts helped bring about a 2010 litigation settlement that committed epa to restricting ghg emissions from certain stationary sources of emissions under section 111 of the caa . epa issued two rules based in part on this settlement : new source performance standards ( nspss ) for ghg emissions from new , modified , or reconstructed fossil fuel fired power plants , and emission guidelines ( known as the `` clean power plan '' ) for ghg emissions from existing fossil fuel fired power plants . both rules are being challenged in litigation , and the clean power plan was stayed by the supreme court in february 2016 , as discussed in other crs reports . the massachusetts decision remains judicially unquestioned . its holding that the caa authorizes epa to regulate ghg emissions remains the governing law , barring supreme court reversal or congressional amendment of the caa .
china has experienced a sharp rise in the inflow of so - called `` hot money , '' foreign capital entering the country supposedly seeking short - term profits , especially in 2008. chinese estimates of the amount of `` hot money '' in china vary from $ 500 billion to $ 1.75 trillion . the influx of `` hot money '' is contributing to china 's already existing problems with inflation . efforts to reduce the inflationary effects of `` hot money '' may accelerate the inflow , while actions to reduce the inflow of `` hot money '' may threaten china 's economic growth , as well as have negative consequences for the u.s. and global economy . this report will be updated as circumstances warrant .
this report provides an overview of s. 852 , the fairness in asbestos injury resolution ( fair ) act of 2005. the bill would largely remove asbestos claims from the courts in favor of the no - fault administrative process set out in the bill . the bill would establish the office of asbestos disease compensation to award damages to asbestos claimants from the asbestos injury claims resolution fund . companies that have previously been sued for asbestos - related injuries — and insurers of such companies — would be required to make contributions totaling roughly $ 140 billion to this fund .
on september 23 , 2005 , president bush signed the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 ( ketra ; h.r . 3768 ) into law , p.l . 109-73 . it primarily contains temporary tax relief intended to directly and indirectly assist individuals in recovering from hurricane katrina . the provisions cover a variety of areas , including work credits , charitable giving , and casualty losses . this report summarizes the act .
the supreme court granted certiorari in winkelman v. parma city school district ( 05-983 ) to determine whether , and if so , under what circumstances non - attorney parents of a child with a disability may bring suit without using an attorney under the individuals with disabilities education act . the circuit courts are split in their determinations of this issue with some circuits finding that non - attorney parents may not proceed pro se , another circuit holding that non - attorney parents have no limitations on their ability to proceed , and other courts of appeals holding that parents can proceed on procedural claims but must use a lawyer for substantive claims . this report will not be updated .
on october 30 , 2007 , the u.s. district court for the western district of louisiana issued a ruling in kerr - mcgee oil & gas corp. v. allred that rebuffed efforts of the u.s. department of the interior ( doi ) to collect royalties from offshore oil and gas production leases based on so - called `` price thresholds '' for previously granted royalty relief . there has been considerable interest in the impact of this ruling on ongoing congressional efforts related to certain `` missing '' royalty payment requirements in leases issued by the minerals management service ( mms ) of the doi in 1998 and 1999 , including the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act of 2007 , as found at sections 7501-7505 of h.r . 3221. the house of representatives passed h.r . 3221 on august 4 , 2007. this report ( 1 ) provides background on the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act ( dwrra ) , pursuant to which royalty - free leases , including the controversial 1998 and 1999 leases , were issued ; ( 2 ) summarizes relevant portions of the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act , which attempts to encourage the renegotiation of the controversial 1998 and 1999 leases ; ( 3 ) summarizes the recent ruling in the kerr - mcgee matter ; and ( 4 ) analyzes the potential impact of that recent ruling on the proposed royalty relief for american consumers act and any similar legislative efforts . this analysis is restricted to a discussion of the potential impact of the recent ruling on section 7504 of h.r . 3221 , which would place restrictions on holders of leases that lack price thresholds . it does not address section 7503 of h.r . 3221 , which seeks to `` clarify the authority '' of the secretary of the interior to include price thresholds on royalty relief in offshore leases pursuant to section 304 of the dwrra .
the railroad retirement board ( rrb ) , an independent federal agency , administers retirement , survivor , disability , unemployment , and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families . railroad retirement payroll taxes include two tiers — tier i and tier ii taxes . the tier i tax finances the tier i railroad retirement benefit that is equivalent to social security benefits and the tier ii tax finances the tier ii benefit , tier i benefits in excess of social security benefits , and supplemental annuities . since 2002 , tier ii tax revenues in excess of obligatory rrb benefits and associated administrative costs have been invested in private stocks , bonds , and other investments . prior to the railroad retirement and survivors ' improvement act of 2001 ( rrsia ; p.l . 107-90 ) , surplus railroad retirement assets could only be invested in u.s. government securities — just as the social security trust funds must be invested . the rrsia established the national railroad retirement investment trust ( nrrit ; hereinafter , the trust ) to manage and invest part of the rrb 's assets in much the same way that the assets of private - sector and most state and local government pension plans are invested . the remainder of rrb 's assets continues to be invested solely in u.s. government securities . congress structured the trust in an effort to ensure investment independence and limit political interference . it also aimed to increase railroad retirement system funding , add enhanced benefits , potentially reduce taxes , and protect system financing in case of market downturns . the trust 's assets are invested in a diversified portfolio , both to minimize investment risk and avoid disproportionate influence over an industry or firm . the trust is a tax - exempt entity independent of the federal government , and it is not subject to the same oversight as federal agencies . however , the rrsia requires an annual management report to congress . from its inception in february 2002 to september 30 , 2017 , $ 21.3 billion has been transferred to the trust from the rrb and $ 21.1 billion has been transferred from the trust to pay railroad retirement benefits . at the end of fy2017 , the net asset value of the trust was $ 26.5 billion . the trust 's investments have generally followed the markets ' recent performance . from fy2003 to fy2017 , the trust 's annual returns averaged 8.3 % , slightly higher than expectations of the bill 's drafters , who assumed nominal annual returns of 8.0 % . as the trust 's investment portfolio diversified over time , its administrative expenses steadily increased , to 36 basis points in fy2011 , but fell to 31 basis points in fy2017 , and remain low when compared with other mutual funds . the combined fair market value of tier ii taxes and trust assets is designed to maintain four to six years ' worth of rrb benefits and administrative expenses . to maintain this balance , the railroad retirement tier ii tax rates automatically adjust as needed . this tax adjustment does not require congressional action . the railroad retirement tier ii tax rates increased in 2013 and most recently in 2015 .
a check cashing enterprise is a fee - based business that will cash a customer 's check without requiring an account relationship . the u.s. check cashing industry underwent a significant expansion in the 1990s . customers are attracted by the immediate access to funds , availability of service without a bank account , and convenience of extended hours of operation . in general , the industry is viewed as a provider of valuable financial services to an under served market segment . check cashers are dependent on access to bank services to operate . banks provide depository accounts , check collection and clearing operations , funds transfer , and access to lines of credit for liquidity purposes . banks and check cashers are both subject to bank secrecy act ( bsa ) regulations . the bsa is an anti - money laundering and anti - terrorism financing statute . federal regulators have cautioned banks that nonbank money service businesses ( an umbrella term that includes check cashing enterprises ) can present heightened money laundering risks . consequently , some banks have discontinued their business relations with check cashers . the discontinuance of services to check cashers brought about complaints to regulators and increased lobbying of congress . bank regulators have issued guidance to clarify bsa compliance expectations . congress held hearings on the concerns of banks and check cashers . this report will be updated as events and legislation warrant .
on november 28 , 2007 , the international tracing service ( its ) opened its vast archives of materials on victims of germany 's national - socialist ( nazi ) regime to the public , granting direct access to the archives for the first time since their establishment shortly after world war ii . access to information in the archives was previously limited to victims of nazi crimes and their descendants , and as recently as 2006 , its had a recorded backlog of over 400,000 requests for information . as part of its may 2006 agreement to open the archives , the 11-nation international commission overseeing its agreed to provide a digital copy of the collections to designated research institutions in commission member states . to date , digital copies of the archives ' central name index of about 17.5 million names , and of some 13 million records documenting deportations to nazi concentration camps , have been transferred to the u.s. holocaust memorial museum . museum officials expect these documents to be accessible to the public by early 2008 , and hope that all the its archives will be digitized and transferred to the museum by late 2010. access to the archives has been an issue of ongoing interest to many members of congress . this report will be updated as events warrant .
as congress debates comprehensive immigration reform and its component parts of immigration control ( i.e . , border security and interior enforcement ) , legal reform ( i.e . , temporary and permanent admissions ) , and the resolution of unauthorized alien residents , concerns arise over the capacity of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) to identify and remove temporary aliens on nonimmigrant visas who fail to depart after their visas expire . it is estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally ( with fraudulent documents or bypassing immigration inspections ) . the most recent estimate ( published in 2013 ) is that 11.7 million foreign nationals resided in the united states without authorization in 2012. dhs does not have reliable data on emigration and nonimmigrant departures from the united states . as a consequence , reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available . over the years , the overstay estimates ranged from 31 % to 57 % of the unauthorized population ( depending on methodology ) . a 2013 study of visa overstays from 2000 to 2009 estimated that total nonimmigrant overstays to the united states dropped from 705,000 per year to 190,000 per year , or about 73 % , over the decade . as of june 2013 , the u.s. government accountability office ( gao ) reported that dhs 's unmatched arrival - departure records totaled more than 1 million ; however , the failure of dhs to consistently update the alien 's record — for example , if the authorized period of admission is extended , if deferred departure is granted , or if the immigration status changes — is a major factor that prevents dhs from calculating reliable estimates of overstays .
in credit suisse securities v. billing , the supreme court examined whether entities in a heavily regulated industry are necessarily entitled to immunity from prosecution under the federal antitrust laws simply by virtue of their regulated status . the court had previously ruled that , absent a specific congressional mandate , such immunity may be granted only by findings either of `` clear repugnance '' between the regulatory scheme and enforcement of the antitrust laws , or sufficiently pervasive regulation of an industry as would be disrupted by application of the antitrust laws ; the credit suisse opinion reaffirms that reasoning . a class of securities investors alleged that they had paid artificially inflated prices for certain securities because of purportedly antitrust - violative actions taken by the underwriters of some initial public offerings ( ipos ) . the challenged practices included the formation of syndicates ; requiring purchasers of ipos to make future purchases ( `` laddering '' ) ; and requiring purchasers to buy other , less desirable securities ( `` tying '' ) . in response , defendants / appellants asserted that they were immune to prosecution under the antitrust laws because of the pervasive regulation of the securities industry by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , which administers a comprehensive system of regulation including major parts of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934. the sec , they argued , should be the sole arbiter of the validity of their actions , notwithstanding that congress had not expressly so provided in the applicable legislation . although the district court , which agreed with the underwriters , dismissed the case , the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed after a lengthy discussion of supreme court case law in the area . the supreme court reversed the court of appeals , accepting the `` pervasive regulation of the securities industry '' argument . specifically , it found that the conduct at issue was `` at the core of marketing new securities , '' noted that `` securities regulators proceed with great care to distinguish the encouraged and permissible from the forbidden , '' and concluded , therefore , `` that the securities laws are 'clearly incompatible with the application of the antitrust laws in this context . . this report will not be updated .
on july 9 , 2005 , president bush signed s. 714 , the junk fax prevention act ( `` the act '' or jfpa ) ( p.l . 109-21 ) and on april 5 , 2006 , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) issued its final rules in the related proceeding . these rules provided an established business relationship ( ebr ) exemption to the prohibition on sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements ; provided a definition of an ebr to be used in the context of unsolicited facsimile advertisements ; required the sender of a facsimile advertisement to provide specified notice and contact information on the facsimile that allows recipients to `` opt - out '' of any future facsimile transmissions from the sender ; and specified the circumstances under which a request to `` opt - out '' complied with the jfpa . also , the rules required that small businesses and nonprofits adhere to the rules and clarified the term `` unsolicited advertisement . . the fcc did not address whether there should be a time limit on the duration of an ebr . the rules in their entirety became effective on august 1 , 2006. on april 5 , 2006 , in accordance with the jfpa , the gao submitted a report to congress on the fcc 's enforcement of the junk fax law . on january 4 , 2007 , in accordance with the jfpa , the fcc released its first annual report on the enforcement of its junk fax rules . the fcc 's junk fax fact sheet is available online at http : / / www.fcc.gov / cgb / consumerfacts / unwantedfaxes.html .
gao discussed the general services administration 's ( gsa ) progress in upgrading the security of federal buildings under its operation , focusing on : what criteria gsa used to assess security risks and prioritize security upgrades for its buildings ; the implementation and operational status of gsa 's security upgrade program and the costs gsa has incurred by both funding source and type of security upgrade ; and whether any problems have hindered gsa 's implementation of the security upgrade program . gao noted that : gsa used the department of justice ( doj ) report 's criteria to assess risks and prioritize security upgrades in its buildings ; despite the formidable challenges posed by this program , gsa has made progress implementing upgrades in federal buildings throughout the country , particularly in its higher risk buildings ; gsa 's data systems indicate that about 7,000 upgrades were completed and it estimates that roughly $ 353 million were obligated from the federal buildings fund for the upgrade program nationally between october 1 , 1995 , and march 31 , 1998 ; however , mistakes made by rushing to meet the timetables in the doj report because of gsa 's sense of urgency to upgrade security in its buildings , reduced staffing due to downsizing , data reliability problems , and uncertain funding sources have hindered gsa 's upgrade program implementation ; because of data reliability problems , neither gsa nor gao can specify the exact status or cost of the building security upgrade program , and because gsa has not established program outcome measures , neither gsa nor gao knows the extent to which completed upgrades have resulted in greater security or reduced vulnerability for federal office buildings ; and gsa is not in a good position to manage its program to mitigate security threats .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the health care financing administration 's ( hcfa ) progress in : addressing its most immediate priorities ; and strengthening its internal management to effectively discharge its major implementation and oversight responsibilities . gao noted that : hcfa is facing an unprecedented set of challenges ; the immediacy and resource demands associated with meeting the year 2000 computer system challenges -- coupled with hcfa 's late start in addressing them -- have put a tremendous burden on the agency this past year and have affected the timing and quality of its work on many other projects ; it has also slowed efforts to improve the oversight of ongoing operations , such as financial management and medicare fee - for - service claims administration , which desperately need attention ; even where hcfa has made progress -- such as in implementing a number of the mandated health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the balanced budget act of 1997 requirements -- gao believes that more work , and many refinements , are still needed ; hcfa must meet these challenges with an aging workforce ; hcfa has taken a number of steps internally to capitalize on its staff 's strengths to deal with a rapidly changing health care marketplace and growing responsibilities ; for example , hcfa has developed a strategic plan that better articulates its future direction , has progressed in its customer - focused reorganization by moving staff to their new organizational units , and has hired more staff with needed skills ; on the other hand , in focus groups gao conducted , hcfa managers and staff discussed issues that continue to hamper effective agency operations ; to further strengthen hcfa 's ability to effectively manage its employees and programs , the administration has proposed new authorities for contracting and new flexibility in hiring in the president 's budget for fiscal year 2000 ; it also proposes new mechanisms to enhance agency accountability , with biannual reports to congress and an advisory board to help the agency streamline internal and program management ; hcfa senior officials have taken concrete steps to improve agency management this year but will need to maintain the momentum over the next several years to overcome the agency 's current and future challenges ; and this will be especially difficult in an agency that for years has been plagued by external pressures and management problems .
gao discussed the social security administration 's ( ssa ) efforts to address future policy changes and program issues . gao noted that : ssa is strengthening its strategic management process , developing performance measures , measuring customer satisfaction , and producing accurate financial statements ; ssa has not performed the research , analysis , and evaluation needed to inform the public on the future of social security financing ; by 2015 , 50 million people will be receiving social security benefits and 2.6 workers will be paying taxes into the social security system ; the aging of the baby boom generation , coupled with increasing life expectancy and the declining ratio of contributing workers to beneficiaries , will place unprecedented strains on the social security system ; ssa disability caseloads have grown by 70 percent in the last decade ; ssa has attempted to redesign its disability claims process , but it is unable to determine whether specific process changes will achieve the desired results ; ssa has not sufficiently promoted return - to - work initiatives in the disability program ; ssa faces significant challenges in modernizing its information systems , managing increasing workloads with a reduced workforce , and delivering its services ; and ssa needs effective leadership to inform the national debate on social security financing issues , complete the redesign of the disability claims process , promote return to work programs , enhance program integrity , and make technological enhancements .
gao discussed major government programs and operations it has identified as high risk because of vulnerability to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement and legislative and agency actions that have resulted in progress towards resolving these problems . gao noted that : without additional attention to resolve problems in the 25 areas that are the current focus of gao 's high - risk initiative , the government will continue to miss huge opportunities to save billions of dollars , make better investments to reap the benefits of information technology , improve performance and provide better service , and more effectively manage the cost of government programs ; effective and sustained follow - through by agency managers is essential to make further headway and achieve greater benefits ; continued oversight by congress will add essential impetus to ensuring progress as well ; landmark legislation passed by congress in the 1990s has established broad management reforms , which , with successful implementation , will help resolve high - risk problems and provide greater accountability in many government programs and operations ; overall , agencies are taking high - risk problems seriously , trying to correct them , and making progress in many areas ; congress has also acted to address several problems affecting these high - risk areas through oversight hearings and specific legislative initiatives ; full and effective implementation of legislative mandates , gao suggestions , and corrective measures by agencies , however , have not yet been achieved because the high - risk areas involve long - standing problems that are difficult to correct ; federal agencies often fail to appropriately manage their finances , identify clearly what they intend to accomplish , or do the job effectively with a minimum of waste ; the government performance and results act ( gpra ) requires agencies to set goals , measure performance , and report on their accomplishments ; gpra will be more difficult for some agencies to apply than for others , but gpra has the potential for adding greatly to government performance , a particularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited and public demand is high ; reliable financial information is key to better managing government programs , providing accountability , and addressing high - risk problems , but financial information has not been reliable enough to use in federal decisionmaking or to provide the requisite public accountability ; the landmark chief financial officers act spelled out a long overdue and ambitious agenda to help resolve financial management deficiencies ; and important and steady progress is being made under the act to bring about sweeping reforms and rectify the devastating legacy from inattention to financial management .
gao discussed medicare 's skilled nursing facility ( snf ) , home health care , and inpatient rehabilitation benefits and the administration 's forthcoming legislative proposals related to them . gao noted that : medicare 's snf costs have grown primarily because a larger portion of beneficiaries use snfs than in the past and because of a large increase in the provision of ancillary services ; for home health care costs , both the number of beneficiaries and the number of services used by each beneficiary have more than doubled ; although the average length of stay has decreased for inpatient rehabilitation facilities , a larger portion of medicare beneficiaries use them now , which results in cost growth ; the administration 's major proposals for both snfs and home health care are designed to to give the providers of these services increased incentives to operate efficiently by moving them from a cost reimbursement to a prospective payment system ; what remains unclear about these proposals is whether an appropriate unit of service can be defined for calculating prospective payments and whether the health care financing administration 's data bases are adequate for it to set reasonable rates ; administration officials also have discussed their intention to propose in the future a coordinated payment system for post - acute care as methods to give providers efficiency incentives ; these concepts have appeal , but gao has concerns about them similar to those it has for snf and home health prospective payments ; finally , the administration is proposing that snfs be required to bill for all services provided to their medicare residents rather than allowing outside suppliers to bill ; and this latter proposal has merit because it would make control over the use of ancillary services significantly easier .
gao discussed the capability of u.s. forces to fight and survive chemical and biological warfare . gao noted that : none of the army 's crisis - response or early - deployment units have complied with requirements for stocking equipment critical for fighting under chemical or biological warfare ; the department of defense ( dod ) has established two joint service groups to prioritize chemical and biological defense research efforts , develop a modernization plan , and develop support plans ; although dod has begun to field a biological agent detection system , it has not successfully fielded other needed equipment and systems to address critical battlefield deficiencies ; ground forces are inadequately trained to conduct critical tasks related to biological and chemical warfare , and there are serious weaknesses at all levels in chemical and biological defense skills ; medical units often lack the equipment and training needed to treat casualties resulting from chemical or biological contamination ; dod has inadequate stocks of vaccines for known threat agents and not implemented the immunization policy established in 1993 ; and the primary cause of these deficiencies is a lack of emphasis along the dod command chain , with dod focusing its efforts and resources on other priorities .
gao discussed the rights of taxpayers and their treatment during audits of their tax returns by the internal revenue service ( irs ) . gao noted that : irs has limited data on both the treatment of taxpayers and the burdens imposed on them during audits ; irs recently created a system to track taxpayers ' complaints about improper treatment but irs does not solicit input on all improper treatment ; similarly , irs has no comprehensive definition of , and little data on , the burden its audits impose on taxpayers ; irs has recently developed a survey that will ask individual taxpayers about their satisfaction with various parts of the audit process but results will not be available until 1998 ; irs has various indicators and standards on audit performance ; one measure of audit performance is how much additional tax is recommended ; irs does not have a corresponding measure on how much of the recommended tax is ultimately collected after taxpayer appeals ; without an indicator to balance taxes recommended against those collected , irs auditors could have an incentive to recommend taxes that would be unlikely to withstand a taxpayer challenge ; irs has nine audit standards ; gao 's work on one set of irs audit techniques -- those used in analyzing taxpayers ' financial status to identify unreported income -- showed that irs used these techniques in less than a quarter of the audits completed in the time periods covered by gao 's review ; in about one - quarter of the audits in which financial status techniques were used , irs did not have to contact the taxpayer to obtain information on the taxpayer 's financial status beyond what was reported on the tax return ; gao also found that irs ' use of financial status techniques has not increased in recent years ; regarding revenue impact , gao found that in about 16 percent of the cases where they were used , these techniques did help to identify significant amounts of unreported income -- $ 10,000 or more ; irs is concerned that its ability to target the potentially most noncompliant taxpayers for audits is deteriorating ; irs ' concern arises because it has not been able to rely on its past approach for developing statistically valid research data that allowed irs to create and periodically update formulas to target the returns with the most potential for noncompliance ; irs last collected these data through audits of a random sample of taxpayers for tax year 1988 ; and irs subsequently abandoned that approach due to concerns about its costs and to concerns from the public and congress about the taxpayer burden involved with those audits .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed operational and safety trends in the rail industry over the past 20 years and how the federal railroad administration ( fra ) has revised its rail safety program to address these trends . gao noted that : the railroad industry has changed significantly since the staggers rail act of 1980 made it federal policy that railroads would rely , where possible , on competition and the demand for services , rather than on regulation , to establish reasonable rates ; from 1976 to 1998 , mergers and acquisitions have significantly reduced the number of class i freight railroads ; these larger railroads have cut costs , increased the tonnage their trains carry , downsized their workforces , and eliminated , sold , or abandoned thousands of miles of unprofitable or little - used track ; during this same period , overall railroad safety has improved ; reported accident and fatality rates are down 75 and 36 percent , respectively , from 1976 levels ; despite this progress , each year about 1,000 people die as a result of grade - crossing accidents and trespassing , at least 9,000 railroad employees are injured , and thousands of people are evacuated from their homes because of hazardous materials released during train accidents ; fra instituted an important shift in its safety program in 1993 to address safety problems in the rail industry ; rather than continuing to use violations and civil penalties as the primary means to obtain compliance with railroad safety regulations , fra decided to emphasize cooperative partnerships with other federal agencies , railroad management , labor unions , and the states ; the partnering efforts generally focus on the nation 's larger railroads and have resulted in fra inspectors ' conducting fewer site - specific inspections of the railroad industry overall ; while 1996 and preliminary 1997 data , the latest data available , show improvements in safety , it is too early to determine if fra 's new approach will sustain a long - term decline in accidents and fatalities ; and in addition , fra 's new partnering efforts do not systematically respond to concerns about the level of workplace injuries for railroad employees and about the safety of railroad bridges .
gao discussed opportunities to improve u.s. export assistance centers ' ( useac ) operations . gao noted that : staff and customers at the four useac surveyed believed that collocating agency staff and nonfederal partner organizations improved export delivery services by increasing customer access to federal export promotion services ; although customers were highly satisfied with individual agencies ' services , they believed that cooperation among agency staffs could be improved ; 40 percent of the customers who used a second useac agency found the agency on their own without help from their useac contact , even though some of these customers expressed a need for another agency 's services ; some useac staff were reluctant to recommend other agencies ' services because they were not familiar with those agencies ' performance in service delivery ; to improve teamwork , useac directors believed that they needed to have input to staff performance appraisals with regard to intra - useac teamwork , a useac - wide client tracking system , adequate authority over useac expenditures , and a useac - wide accounting system ; three federal agencies were considering ways to give useac directors input to staff appraisals and plan to install an off - the - shelf client tracking system ; and the three agencies have agreed to allocate useac expenses based on a formula that reflects the limited capabilities of the international trade administration 's accounting system , but they are working on a separate financial management system for useac .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the privacy of medical records used for health research , focusing on : to what extent medical information used for research depends on personally identifiable information ; research that is and is not subject to current federal oversight requirements ; how the institutional review board ( irb ) ensures the confidentiality of health information used in research ; and what steps organizations have taken to safeguard information . gao noted that : the survey revealed that a considerable amount of health research relies on personally identifiable information ; while some of this research is subject to irb review -- either because it is federally supported or regulated research or because the organization voluntarily applies federal rules to all of its research -- some of the organizations conduct records - based research that is not reviewed by an irb ; the process of irb review does not ensure the confidentiality of medical information used in research -- primarily because the provisions of the common rule related to confidentiality are limited ; according to recent studies , the irb system on the whole is strained ; and nevertheless , although external review of their research is limited , most of the organizations in gao 's study told gao that they have various security safeguards in place to limit internal and external access to paper and electronic databases , and many say they have taken measures to ensure the anonymity of research and survey subjects .
pursuant to a congressional request , gao discussed the challenges that face the national archives and records administration ( nara ) and federal agencies in their efforts to manage the rapidly increasing volume of electronic records . gao noted that : nara and federal agencies are confronted with many electronic records management ( erm ) challenges , particularly technological issues ; nara must be able to receive electronic records from agencies , store them , and retrieve them when needed ; agencies must be able to create electronic records , store them , properly dispose of them when appropriate , and send valuable electronic records to nara for archival storage ; nara officials told gao that nara needs to expand its capacity to accept the increasing volume of electronic records from agencies ; in addition to increasing volume , nara must address some definitional problems , such as what constitutes an electronic record ; in addition , because agencies follow no uniform hardware or software standards , nara must be capable of accepting various formats from agencies and maintaining a continued capability of reading those records ; nara is not alone in facing erm challenges , the agencies also must meet federal records act responsibilities ; agencies must incorporate nara 's guidance into their own recordkeeping systems ; agencies ' reactions to erm challenges are varied ; on the basis of gao 's discussions with nara and some agency officials , gao learned that some agencies are waiting for more specific guidance from nara while others are moving forward by looking for ways to better manage their electronic records ; even though nara is aware of what some agencies are doing , it does not have governmentwide data on records management capabilities and programs of federal agencies ; nara had planned to do a baseline survey to collect such data on all agencies by the end of fiscal year 2000 ; the archivist decided , however , to temporarily postpone doing this baseline survey because he accorded higher priority to such activities as reengineering nara 's business processes ; gao recommended that nara do the baseline survey as part of its reengineering process ; the archivist stated that the baseline data would not be relevant to its reengineering efforts and therefore nara would not collect it at this time ; even though nara lacks governmentwide data on how agencies are implementing erm , nara has already begun revising its guidance to agencies ; gao 's review of the erm activities in four states and three foreign governments showed that approaches to erm differ ; and these entities often did things differently from each other and nara .
gao discussed u.s. efforts to control heroin trafficking from southeast asia to the united states . gao noted that : u.s. efforts have achieved some positive results in thailand and hong kong , but not in burma ; the united states has supported united nations ( un ) drug control projects in burma , but these efforts have met with limited success because the projects ' scope has been small , planning has been inadequate , and burma has not provided sufficient support ; the united states suspended direct counternarcotics assistance to burma because of human rights violations ; much of burma 's heroin - producing region is not under government control because of insurgencies headed by drug traffickers ; law enforcement efforts against heroin traffickers are impeded by the traffickers ' ability to shift transportation routes to countries with inadequate law enforcement capabilities ; and u.s. heroin control efforts are also impeded by a lack of cooperation with china on counternarcotics activities .
gao discussed its 1995 report on the smithsonian institution 's national air and space museum 's ( nasm ) aircraft restoration and preservation efforts , focusing on : the adequacy of aircraft storage facilities ; recommendations for improving the care of museum aircraft ; and the smithsonian 's response those recommendations . gao noted that : nasm devoted relatively few resources to aircraft restoration in fiscal year 1994 ; inadequate storage facilities contributed to the deterioration of previously restored aircraft ; nasm must compete with other smithsonian museums for limited funding ; nasm ability to raise $ 100 million in private funds for the construction of a storage facility is in doubt ; nasm has drafted a new mission statement that will focus the museum on its original goal , but it has not established collecting priorities that are linked to that mission statement ; and nasm will launch a major capital campaign to raise funds for the dulles extension facility .
gao discussed the federal aviation administration 's ( faa ) oversight of repair stations that maintain and repair aircraft and aircraft components , focusing on : the practice of using individual inspectors in repair station inspections ; the condition of inspection documentation ; and current faa actions to improve the inspection process . gao noted that : faa was meeting its goal of inspecting every repair station at least once a year and 84 percent of the inspectors believed that the overall compliance of repair stations was good or excellent ; more than half of the inspectors said that there were areas of compliance that repair stations could improve , such as ensuring that their personnel receive training from all airlines for which they perform work and have current maintenance manuals ; while faa typically relies on individual inspectors , the use of teams of inspectors , particularly at large or complex repair stations , may be more effective at identifying problems and are more liable to uncover systemic and long - standing deficiencies ; because of insufficient documentation , gao was unable to determine how well faa followed up to ensure that the deficiencies found during the inspections were corrected ; gao was not able to assess how completely or quickly repair stations were bringing themselves into compliance ; because faa does not tell its inspectors what documentation to keep , the agency 's ability to identify and react to trends is hampered ; faa is spending more than $ 30 million to develop a reporting system that , among other things , is designed to enable the agency to apply its inspection resources to address those areas that pose the greatest risk to aviation safety ; as gao has reported in the past , this goal will not be achieved without significant improvements in the completeness of inspection records ; since the may 1996 crash of a valujet dc - 9 in the florida everglades , faa has announced new initiatives to upgrade the oversight of repair stations ; these initiatives were directed at clarifying and augmenting air carriers ' oversight of repair stations , not at ways in which faa 's own inspection resources could be better utilized ; faa has several other efforts under way that would have a more direct bearing on its own inspection activities at repair stations ; one effort would revise the regulations governing operations at repair stations , and another would revise the regulations governing the qualifications of repair station personnel ; the revision of the regulations began in 1989 and has been repeatedly delayed ; the third effort is the addition of more faa inspectors , which should mean that more resources can be devoted to inspecting repair stations ; faa has recently announced a major overhaul of its entire inspection process ; and it is designed to systematize the process and ensure consistency in inspections and in reporting the results of these inspections so as to allow more efficient targeting of inspection resources .
