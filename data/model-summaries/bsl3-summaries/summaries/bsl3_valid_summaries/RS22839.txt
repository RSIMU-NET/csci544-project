the decision in school district of the city of pontiac v. secretary of the united states department of education arose in response to litigation surrounding § 9527 ( a ) of the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , as amended by the no child left behind ( nclb ) act of 2001 .
section 9527 ( a ) — the so - called "unfunded mandates" provision — states , "nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the federal government to ... mandate a state or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this act. .
enacted in 2002 , the nclb act reauthorized and revised the esea , which is the primary federal law that provides financial assistance to state and local school districts for pre - collegiate education .
for example , congress could choose to amend the nclb act to clarify that states that accept nclb funds are obligated to comply with all of the act's requirements , regardless of whether or not the costs of compliance are fully funded by the federal government .
