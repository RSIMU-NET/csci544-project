to help ensure the accuracy of its senior federal official travel reports , collect additional information from agencies on instances where travel is not being reported because of an exemption for intelligence agencies , as opposed to some other reason , and include such information in its reports where departmental data do not include trips pursuant to an agency's exercise of a reporting exemption .
the issues related to a provision of gsa regulations that exempts intelligence agencies from reporting information about government aircraft to gsa and that provision's application to unclassified data on senior federal official travel for nonmission purposes .
the federal government owns or leases over 1,700 aircraft to accomplish a wide variety of missions that include the management of natural resources , fire fighting , research and development , and law enforcement .
collecting additional information on which agencies are invoking the exemption and including such information in its reports could help ensure more complete reporting on the use of government aircraft , which could help provide gsa with reasonable assurance that its federal official travel reports are accurate and also provide the public a more comprehensive understanding of these trips .
we also reviewed gsa regulations and associated federal register notices from 1992 — when the definition of “intelligence agencies” was first added to gsa regulations — to 2012 to determine whether gsa provided a rationale for the exemption for intelligence agencies to report information about government aircraft .
