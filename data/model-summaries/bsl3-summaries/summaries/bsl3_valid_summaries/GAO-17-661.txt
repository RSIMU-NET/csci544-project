the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) , enacted in 2010 , included a provision for a 40 percent excise tax on high - cost employer - sponsored health coverage ( hereafter referred to as the tax ) intended , in part , to raise funds to offset costs associated with the law .
if the commissioner interprets that the statute does not provide the flexibility to mitigate the limitations of the bcbs standard plan premium cost data by combining data from multiple sources or by other means , we recommend seeking that authority from congress .
in addition , we interviewed knowledgeable officials from irs , the office of personnel management ( opm ) , the department of the treasury , and two agencies within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) â€” the agency for healthcare research and quality and the centers for medicare & medicaid services .
subsequent to reviewing the draft , irs and treasury officials contacted us to share some of their concerns with the wording of the recommendation related to combining claims costs of multiple health plans with varying designs .
to assess the benefits and limitations of using the bcbs standard plan data , as well as to identify alternatives , we reviewed relevant statutory provisions and the internal revenue service's ( irs ) 2015 notices related to the age and gender adjustment , as well as other agency documentation and federal internal control standards .
