this report addresses the basis for nasa's cost estimates to ( 1 ) service the hubble telescope by using the shuttle and ( 2 ) implement the caib's recommendations , including those recommendations directly related to safely returning the shuttle to flight .
for more than a decade , the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) hubble space telescope has provided unique images of the universe and has given scientists critical data needed to help understand a number of space mysteries .
nasa said that its decision to cancel the servicing mission was based largely on concerns about shuttle safety â€” specifically , the need to implement recommendations made by the columbia accident investigation board ( caib ) for safely returning the space shuttle to flight .
however , nasa's decision has prompted considerable debate .
nasa has now begun to explore the costs and benefits of various servicing alternatives , including robotic servicing , which should enable nasa to make a more informed decision regarding hubble's future .
the caib chairman suggested that only a study of the benefits and risks of a shuttle servicing mission to extend hubble's life could determine whether it is worth the risks .
