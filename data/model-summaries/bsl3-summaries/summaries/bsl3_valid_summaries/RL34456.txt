a presidential transition — the period from campaigning through placement of new administration personnel — is a unique time in american politics and holds the promise of opportunity as well as a real or perceived vulnerability to our nation's security interests .
unlike other man - made incidents that may occur with little warning , the presidential transition offers a broadly defined time frame in which an enemy of the united states may decide to undertake an incident of national security significance with the hope of manipulating the electoral process or changing the nation's foreign and domestic policies .
on a given day the outgoing administration has the ability to change the policies of a nation and possibly affect the international security environment , yet the following day the president and the national security leadership team are replaced by a new set of leaders who may have very different strategy and policy goals .
the incoming administration is likely to face three distinct types of national security challenges that could translate into short - and long - term national security risks .
other activities that the current and incoming administrations and congress may wish to consider undertaking during the presidential transition period include undertaking public outreach efforts to discuss possible risks to the nation , involving the national security representatives of presidential hopefuls in all transition - related discussions , establishing joint advisory councils responsible for addressing all transition - related risks , requiring the director of national intelligence ( dni ) to undertake efforts to support the nation's awareness of risks , reflecting the national security priorities of the new administration in the 2009 budget , passing the fy2009 appropriations without undue delay ; quickly assigning newly elected and existing members of congress to committees focused on national security , holding hearings comprised of national security experts to gather ideas on prospective u.s. national security policies and goals , and holding hearings soon after the inauguration of the new president to determine the administration's national security - related priorities .
