in order to gain an understanding of the initial effects of this reduction , we reviewed four major federal departments to ( 1 ) describe the activities they have undertaken in restructuring personnel offices and operations ; ( 2 ) ascertain what , if any , performance measures are in place to gauge results of the restructuring efforts ; and ( 3 ) identify issues agencies may commonly encounter when , in restructuring their personnel operations , they consider outsourcing automated personnel and / or payroll services to another agency or the private sector .
to develop measures that would have widespread application , we recommend that the director of opm , in conjunction with the president's administrative management council , lead an initiative that helps agencies develop common measures that could be used to make performance and cost comparisons of personnel operations within agencies and across government .
omb issues the guidance for agencies' annual performance plans and is a key recipient and user of those plans .
resource reductions and changing missions , coinciding with the replacement of aging human resource management information systems , are driving efforts in federal agencies to restructure their personnel offices .
