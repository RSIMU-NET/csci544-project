the report also includes a description of the status of dod's investigations on potential exposures of service members and veterans to health hazards , such as chemical and biological agents , and efforts that have been made by va and dod to monitor cancer incidence among gulf war veterans .
in recent years , va and dod have decreased their expenditures on research specifically for gulf war illnesses and have expanded the scope of their medical research programs to incorporate the long - term health effects of all hazardous deployments .
in addition , va has not reassessed the extent to which the collective findings of completed gulf war illnesses research projects have addressed key research questions or whether the questions remain relevant .
interagency committees formed by va to coordinate federal gulf war illnesses research evolved to reflect these changing priorities , but over time these entities have been dissolved or have become inactive .
the only assessment of progress in answering these research questions was published in 2001 , when findings from only about half of all federally funded gulf war illnesses research were available .
as of september 2003 , about 80 percent of the 240 federally funded medical research projects for gulf war illnesses had been completed .
