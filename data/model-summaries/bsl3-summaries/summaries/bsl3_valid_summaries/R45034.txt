haiti was without an elected president from february 2016 until february 2017 .
the legislature named senate president jocelerme privert interim president , to ensure that second - round presidential elections took place in april 2016 and a new president was installed in may .
after the haitian government failed to complete a cycle of elections , including a second round of presidential voting at the end of 2015 , former president michel martelly ended his term without an elected successor .
privert established a verification commission to investigate opposition - party charges of electoral fraud ; the commission called for the first round of the presidential election to be reheld .
policy priorities include support for economic growth and poverty reduction , including through bilateral trade and investment to promote job creation ; improved health care and food security ; promoting respect for human rights ; strengthening democratic institutions ; and strengthening the hnp so that the country can provide its own security and work more effectively with u.s. agencies to combat international crime .
meanwhile , privert's term expired on june 14 , 2016 , and the haitian legislature repeatedly did not vote on extending his mandate or appointing another provisional president .
