the social security administration ( ssa ) manages two of the largest federal disability benefit programs — social security disability insurance and supplemental security income — which together resulted in payments of more than $165 billion to about 13.5 million people with disabilities and their families in fiscal year 2010 .
to help ensure that ssa's disability decisions are as equitable and consistent with modern views of disability as possible , we recommend the commissioner of social security conduct limited and focused studies on the availability and effects of considering more fully assistive devices and workplace accommodations in its disability determinations .
limiting data collection methods .
we were asked to assess the social security administration's ( ssa ) plans and efforts to revise its disability criteria .
while ssa and others raise valid concerns as to their universal availability and other considerations , in the absence of studies on how certain assistive devices and workplace accommodations are playing a role in helping individuals with impairments to stay at work or return to work , and their costs in comparison with potentially many years of disability benefit payments , ssa may be missing an opportunity to potentially assist individuals with disabilities to re - engage with the workforce and to target finite resources efficiently and effectively .
