the issues in this work covered ( 1 ) the need for governmentwide strategic planning for the requirements for high - containment laboratories , including assessment of their risks ; ( 2 ) the need for national standards for designing , constructing , commissioning , operating , and maintaining such laboratories ; and ( 3 ) the oversight of biosafety and biosecurity at high - containment laboratories .
on june 5 , 2014 , staff in atlanta laboratories at the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) were potentially exposed to live spores of the ames strain of anthrax ( bacillus anthracis or b. anthracis ) .
on july 1 , 2014 , at the bethesda , maryland , national institutes of health ( nih ) , vials of potentially live smallpox ( variola ) virus were unexpectedly discovered .
we also reviewed cdc's july 11 , 2014 , report on the potential exposure to anthrax .
this testimony is primarily based on gao's past work on high - containment laboratories .
highly publicized laboratory errors and controversy about where high - containment laboratories should be located have raised questions about whether the governing framework , standards , and oversight for biosafety and biosecurity measures are adequate .
