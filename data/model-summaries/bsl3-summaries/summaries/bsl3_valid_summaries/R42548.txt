on july 1 , 2012 , a record number of mexican voters headed to the polls to elect a president who will serve a six - year term beginning on december 1 , 2012 .
thus , the results of these elections could lead to shifts in mexico's domestic and foreign policy priorities and have implications for u.s. - mexican relations .
elections for local and state offices took place in 14 states ( including mexico city's federal district ) , six of which held gubernatorial elections .
senators will serve six - year terms and deputies will serve three - year terms that began on september 1 , 2012 .
all 128 seats in the mexican senate and 500 seats in the lower house of congress , known as the chamber of deputies , were also up for election .
mexico does not permit consecutive reelection for any political office .
twelve years after losing the presidency for the first time in 71 years , the institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) won the presidential election ( see figure 1 ) , a plurality of seats in the senate ( see figure 2 ) and chamber of deputies ( see figure 3 ) , and gubernatorial elections in chiapas , jalisco , and yucat√°n ( see figure 4 ) .
