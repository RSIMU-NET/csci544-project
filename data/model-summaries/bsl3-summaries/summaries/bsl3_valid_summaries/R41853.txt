state governments rely on general sales and use taxes for just under one - third ( 31.7% ) of their total tax revenue — approximately $223 billion in fy2010 .
684 ( representative womack and others ) would grant ssuta member states and non - member states that meet less rigorous simplifications standards the authority to compel out - of - state vendors with greater than $1 million in remote sales to collect sales and use taxes .
this report intends to clarify significant issues in the remote sales tax collection debate , beginning with a description of state and local sales and use taxes .
this concern arises in part because the u.s. supreme court ruled out - of - state vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which they ( the vendors ) do not have nexus .
in hopes of stemming the potential loss of tax revenue , several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes — called the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ( ssuta ) .
alternatively , use taxes , levied at the same rate , are often not collected by the vendor if the vendor does not have nexus ( loosely defined as a physical presence ) in the consumer's state .
