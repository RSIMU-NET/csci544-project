although the social security administration ( ssa ) originally created ssns as a means to track worker's earnings and eligibility for social security benefits , over time the ssn has come to be used for a myriad of purposes .
my remarks today will focus on describing ( 1 ) public and private sector use and display of ssns and ( 2 ) ssa's role in preventing the proliferation of false identities .
in addition , some private sector entities have come to rely on the ssn as an identifier , using it and other information to accumulate information about individuals .
despite ssa's progress , some weaknesses remain .
although congress has passed a number of laws to protect the security of personal information , the continued use of and reliance on ssns by private and public sector entities and the potential for misuse underscores the importance of identifying areas that can be further strengthened .
for example , ssa now requires field staff to independently verify the identity information and immigration status of all noncitizen applicants with the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , prior to issuing an ssn .
allegations of ssn misuse include , for example , incidents where a criminal uses the ssn of another individual for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining credit , acquiring goods , violating immigration laws , or fleeing the criminal justice system .
