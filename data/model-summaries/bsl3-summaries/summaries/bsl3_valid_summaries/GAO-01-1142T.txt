my remarks today will focus on ( 1 ) medicare payment policies to cover part b - covered drug costs and costs of administering the drugs and ( 2 ) key features of other payers' reimbursement policies that suggest opportunities to improve the appropriateness of medicare's payments .
in september 2000 , the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) — now the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) — took steps to reduce medicare's payment for part b - covered drugs by authorizing medicare carriers , the contractors that pay part b claims , to use prices obtained in the justice department investigations of providers' drug acquisition costs .
in december 2000 , as part of recent medicare legislation , the congress asked us to study medicare's payments for part b - covered drugs and make recommendations for pricing methodology refinements .
most of the part b drugs with the highest medicare payments and billing volume fall into three categories: those that are billed for by physicians and typically provided in a physician office setting ( such as chemotherapy drugs ) , those that are billed for by pharmacy suppliers and administered through a durable medical equipment ( dme ) item ( such as a respiratory drug given in conjunction with a nebulizer ) , and those that are also billed by pharmacy suppliers but are patient - administered and covered explicitly by statute .
