for decades , most in congress have viewed iran with concern because of its nuclear program and its support of anti - u.s. and anti - israel militant movements in the region .
iran has similarly demonstrated resolve and commitment to a genuine space launch program as a matter of national pride and self - sufficiency in space in the face of widespread international condemnation .
in response to the iranian ballistic missile and space program , congress is considering the deployment of an ballistic missile defense site on the east coast to defend against possible iranian icbms .
why does iranian acquisition of ballistic missiles or iran's pursuit of a space launch capability matter , especially to the congress ? .
this report is limited to analyzing iran's efforts to develop , test and field ballistic missiles and to develop a space launch capability .
congress has held numerous hearings on iran , passed various resolutions regarding iran and approved a range of sanctions against iran over the past several decades .
although the behavior of rogue states such as iran may be catalyzing this change in attitude , the language of declaration 2 also carries the strong implication that in the future congress will gauge the missile threat more broadly than just focusing on the activities and progress of ballistic missile and nuclear programs in such rogue states .
