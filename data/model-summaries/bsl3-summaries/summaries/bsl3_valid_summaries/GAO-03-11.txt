the objectives of our review were to ( 1 ) identify the characteristics of the for - profit educational management companies operating in the district and determine the extent to which district schools managed by these companies have used their programs and ( 2 ) determine what is known about the effectiveness of these programs , as measured primarily by student achievement .
as agreed with your office , we ( 1 ) identified the characteristics of their programs and determined the extent to which district schools managed by them have used their programs and ( 2 ) determined what is known about the effectiveness of these companies' educational programs , as measured primarily by student achievement .
for example , school districts and charter schools are increasingly contracting with private , for - profit companies to provide a range of education and management services to schools .
in recent years , local school districts and traditional public schools have taken various initiatives to improve failing schools .
a key factor that helps explain the difference between the programs the companies offer and what has been implemented by district schools is that recent mergers and acquisitions have led to changes in management companies in these 6 schools ; these schools have generally left in place the educational programs of the companies that formerly managed them .
