to determine the prevalence and characteristics of households deemed eligible under states' broad - based categorical eligibility ( bbce ) policies that had incomes over the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) eligibility limits in fiscal years 2008 and 2010 , we analyzed the food and nutrition service's ( fns ) quality control ( qc ) system data of active snap cases .
during fiscal year 2011 , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) , previously known as the food stamp program , provided food and nutrition assistance to almost 45 million individuals each month for a total of $71.8 billion in benefits for the year .
while some of the recent increases in snap participation and costs are due to the recession and benefit increases included in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) , state policy changes intended to improve program access and simplify the administration of snap may also have had an effect .
also , although both groups had the same proportion of households with unearned income , a higher percentage of households with incomes above the federal limits had members who worked or who received unemployment insurance benefits .
