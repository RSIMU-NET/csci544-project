the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( hiv / aids ) is the leading cause of death in the countries of sub - saharan africa , where more than two - thirds of the people who are infected with hiv live .
specifically , we ( 1 ) identified the development and impact of the hiv / aids epidemic in sub - saharan africa and the challenges to slowing its spread , ( 2 ) assessed the extent to which the u.s. agency for international development's initiatives have contributed to the fight against aids in sub - saharan africa , and ( 3 ) identified the approach the agency used to allocate increased funding and the factors that may affect the agency's ability to expand its hiv / aids program in sub - saharan africa .
despite efforts by the international community to reduce the spread of hiv / aids in sub - saharan africa , the national intelligence council estimates that as many as one - quarter of the population of the hardest - hit countries in that region will die from aids over the next 10 years .
further , given the scale of the epidemic , aids has grown beyond a public health problem to become a humanitarian and developmental crisis .
