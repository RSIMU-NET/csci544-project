at a minimum , fda should ensure that ( 1 ) the information it has about private food testing laboratories and key personnel is communicated to state officials responsible for monitoring food salvaging operations after a major disaster and ( 2 ) these state officials are made aware of fda's guidance for maintaining the integrity of the food sampling process .
according to fda officials , state and local authorities are the most effective regulatory bodies for monitoring such operations because ( 1 ) fda has no authority to place an embargo on hazardous food ; ( 2 ) the states have intensive regulatory coverage of food warehouses and retail establishments , where most food salvaging operations occur ; and ( 3 ) fda has concentrated its resources on issues that pose a higher risk to public health , such as monitoring the blood supply and the safety of medical devices .
every year , millions of pounds of food is damaged or contaminated as a result of mishandling , accidents , or disasters , such as floods or fires .
first , fda did not adequately share information with kdhe about past problems it had experienced with a food owner's consultant and his laboratories .
