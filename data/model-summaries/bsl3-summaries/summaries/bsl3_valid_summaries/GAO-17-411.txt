in light of the limited nature of current federal efforts to increase primary care gme training , we continue to believe that our recommendation should be implemented and agree that an interagency group like the one proposed by hhs is an important first step toward ensuring a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to workforce planning .
in a 2015 report , we recommended that , to ensure that hhs workforce efforts meet national needs , hhs should develop a comprehensive and coordinated planning approach to guide its health care workforce development programs .
in this report , we describe: 1. changes in the number of residents in gme training by location and type of training from 2005 through 2015 , 2. federal efforts intended to increase gme training in rural areas , and 3. federal efforts intended to increase gme training in primary care .
from 2005 through 2015 , 99 percent of residents in gme programs trained in urban areas , despite some growth in rural areas .
to describe changes in the number of residents in gme training by location and type of training from 2005 through 2015 , we reviewed data on gme programs and residents within the 50 states and the district of columbia from the two main gme accrediting bodies â€” the accreditation council for graduate medical education ( acgme ) and the american osteopathic association ( aoa ) .
