in local markets , the demand for a particular wheat class ( and quality ) relative to its nearby supply will determine local prices .
wheat is the principal food grain grown in the united states ; however , a substantial portion ( 8% - 10% ) of the annual u.s. wheat crop is used as a feed grain .
in 2006 , the united states provided $2.1 billion of such assistance , which paid for the delivery and distribution of more than 3 million metric tons of u.s. agricultural commodities .
the rise in agricultural prices , combined with high oil prices , have contributed to higher food inflation in the united states and around the world .
international food aid is the united states' major response to reducing global hunger .
the largest wheat - producing countries are china , india , the united states , russia , canada , and australia .
because most u.s. food aid activities are fixed in value by annual appropriations , the amount of commodities that can be purchased declines with rising food prices .
in particular , lower - income households in many foreign markets where food imports are an important share of national consumption and where food expenses represent a larger portion of the household budget may be affected by higher food prices .
