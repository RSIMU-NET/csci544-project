we asked education to estimate the amount of title iv aid awarded to the following populations: ( 1 ) veteran students ; ( 2 ) nonveteran independent students ; and ( 3 ) nonveteran dependent students who were in their first year of enrollment on a full - time basis at a public 2-year , public 4-year , and private 4-year institution .
given the broad range of federal postsecondary financial aid available to students , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine whether receiving gi benefits affects veterans' eligibility for other federal financial aid and ( 2 ) compare the typical amount of federal financial aid awarded to veteran and nonveteran students based on various student and family characteristics that affect their eligibility for financial aid , including income and whether students were dependent or independent of their parents .
recently , concerns have been raised about whether gi benefits adequately cover educational costs and whether the receipt of gi benefits affects the amount of other federal financial assistance available to postsecondary students under title iv of the higher education act ( hea ) and the internal revenue code .
the primary title iv programs consist of ( 1 ) pell grants ; ( 2 ) subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans ; and ( 3 ) supplemental educational opportunity grants ( seog ) , perkins loans , and work study aid funded by the federal government and administered by participating higher education institutions , commonly known as campus - based aid .
