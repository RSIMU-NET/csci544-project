to bolster ssa's ability to address critical policy issues and correct programmatic weaknesses , the congress enacted legislation making ssa independent of the department of health and human services ( hhs ) as of march 31 , 1995 .
these challenges included managing for results and accountability ; funding future retirement benefits ; rethinking disability programs ; combating ssi fraud , waste , and abuse ; handling increasing workloads with reduced resources ; and establishing effective leadership .
the social security administration ( ssa ) administers the nation's largest federal program — social security — as well as the nation's largest cash welfare program , supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
undertaking many initiatives at one time is likely to limit the chances for success and has already led to implementation delays .
we are currently reviewing ssa's efforts to improve this service .
yet as ssa acknowledges , public confidence in its programs is low and has been low for some time .
ssa has faced significant challenges in implementing some of the more complex initiatives .
in recent years , disability caseloads have faced unprecedented growth .
social security's old age and survivors insurance ( oasi ) and disability insurance ( di ) programs provide benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors ; ssi provides assistance to the needy aged , blind , or disabled .
