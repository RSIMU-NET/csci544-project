our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess how chattanooga - area veterans' access to inpatient hospital and outpatient primary and specialty care compared to the department of veterans affairs' ( va ) established travel time and appointment waiting time guidelines and ( 2 ) determine how va's draft capital asset realignment for enhanced services ( cares ) plan could affect chattanooga - area veterans' access to such care .
we recommend that as part of his deliberations concerning whether additional access improvements for chattanooga - area veterans beyond those contained in the draft cares plan are warranted , the secretary of veterans affairs explore alternatives such as purchasing inpatient care locally for a larger proportion of chattanooga - area veterans' workload , particularly focusing on those veterans who may experience longer travel times as a result of the proposed shift of inpatient workload from murfreesboro to nashville ; expediting the opening of the four proposed community - based clinics ; and providing primary care locally for more of those veterans whose access will remain outside va's travel guideline , despite the opening of the four clinics .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) operates a nationwide health care system that is organized into 21 integrated health care networks comprising over 160 hospitals and 600 community - based outpatient clinics .
