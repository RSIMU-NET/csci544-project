amounts made available remain available until expended .
in order to provide guidance for responding to a spill of national significance and build on lessons learned , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the director of the coast guard's npfc to finalize the revisions the coast guard is drafting to its claims adjudication division's standard operating procedures to include specific required steps for processing claims received in the event of a spill of national significance .
npfc administers the fund by disbursing funds to government agencies to reimburse them for their oil spill cleanup costs ( cost reimbursements ) , monitoring the sources and uses of funds , adjudicating claims submitted by individuals and businesses to the fund for payment ( claims ) , and pursuing reimbursement from the responsible party for costs and damages paid from the fund ( billing the responsible party ) .
shortly after the april 20 , 2010 explosion , members of congress requested that we ( 1 ) identify the financial risks to the federal government resulting from oil spills , particularly deepwater horizon , ( 2 ) assess npfc's internal controls for ensuring that processes and payments for cost reimbursements and processes for claims related to the deepwater horizon spill were appropriate , and ( 3 ) describe the extent to which the federal government oversees the bp and gccf deepwater horizon oil spill - related claims processes .
