specifically , we determined 1. 	 the extent to which state laws require private health insurance plans to cover the four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes ; and 2. 	 the extent to which private health insurance plans cover the four colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes , specifically health plans sold by insurers to small employers and individuals in states that do not offered by large employers across the united states , and offered through the federal employees health benefits program ( fehbp ) .
that is , insurers and large employers with more colorectal cancer screening benefits could have been more likely to participate in our survey than those with fewer colorectal cancer screening test benefits .
to examine the extent to which the four key colorectal cancer tests are covered for screening purposes by private health insurance plans , we reviewed the extent to which state laws require such coverage , and we reviewed the extent of coverage among selected small employer and individual plans in states without such laws , a sample of large employer plans , and coverage within fehbp plans .
four of the health plans offered by the large employers did not cover any of the colorectal cancer tests for screening purposes .
