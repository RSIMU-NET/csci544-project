continuing appropriations acts ( commonly known as continuing resolutions or crs ) , which provide interim funding in the event that regular appropriations have not been enacted , have been an integral component of the annual appropriations process for decades .
in most of the years in which continuing resolutions have been used , a series of two or more have been enacted into law .
unless otherwise provided for in this joint resolution or in the applicable appropriations act , appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this joint resolution shall be available until ( a ) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution , or ( b ) the enactment into law of the applicable appropriations act by both houses without any provision for such project or activity , or ( c ) october 31 , 2003 , whichever first occurs .
whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations acts for a fiscal year is incomplete , an issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used .
if a funding gap occurs , federal agencies are typically required to begin a "shutdown" of the affected projects and activities , which includes the prompt furlough of non - excepted personnel .
