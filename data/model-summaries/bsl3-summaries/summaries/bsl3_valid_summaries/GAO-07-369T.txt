specifically , my testimony ( 1 ) discusses the likely fiscal impacts of royalty relief for leases issued under the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 and ( 2 ) describes other authorities for granting royalty relief that could further impact future royalty collections .
when the government grants royalty relief , it typically specifies the amounts of oil and gas production that will be exempt from royalties and may also specify that royalty relief is applicable only if oil and gas prices remain below certain levels , known as “price thresholds.” for example , the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act of 1995 , also known as the deep water royalty relief act ( dwrra ) , mandated royalty relief for oil and gas leases issued in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico from 1996 to 2000 .
in fiscal year 2006 , oil and gas companies received over $77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from federal lands and waters , and the minerals management service ( mms ) , the department of the interior's ( interior ) agency responsible for collecting royalties , reported that these companies paid the federal government about $10 billion in oil and gas royalties .
