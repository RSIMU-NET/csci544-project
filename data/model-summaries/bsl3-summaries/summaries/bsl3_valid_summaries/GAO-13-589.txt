for this report , we ( 1 ) identified the actions taken by dod to improve the quality and timeliness of past performance information and implement provisions of the act , and ( 2 ) assessed the effectiveness of those actions .
the department of defense ( dod ) relies on thousands of contractors to perform a broad array of activities needed to meet its mission .
although compliance with the reporting requirements for performance assessments has increased , dod still faces challenges with completing assessments on time .
we are not making recommendations in this report .
in addition , section 806 also requires the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement ( dfars ) to be revised to require that contractor assessments be posted to the databases used for making source selection decisions no later than 14 days after delivery of the performance assessment to the contractor .
for example , completing contractor assessments is considered a joint responsibility between the contracting and program office and , the assessing official often relies on others to provide information needed to complete the assessment , and in some cases may have difficulty obtaining the information .
dod still faces challenges , however , in completing assessments on time .
