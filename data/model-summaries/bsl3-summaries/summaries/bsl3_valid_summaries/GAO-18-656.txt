the objectives of our review were to ( 1 ) describe federal agencies' and nonfederal entities' support for research for transformational technological advances in selected areas , ( 2 ) examine federal agencies' coordination on this research , and ( 3 ) provide experts' views on considerations for maintaining u.s. competitiveness through transformational technological advances .
federal support for research and development can accelerate innovation , drive technological advances , and promote u.s. competitiveness in the global economy .
these advances are transformational because they result in new technologies or significantly enhanced capabilities in existing technologies .
addressing these challenges may require developing new materials .
overcoming barriers to innovation .
federal support for research is not only decentralized but also changes over time .
these steps could help address problems identified in previous interagency coordination efforts .
however , both the subcommittee and working group are recently established and have had limited time to fully implement the leading practices that we describe in this report .
