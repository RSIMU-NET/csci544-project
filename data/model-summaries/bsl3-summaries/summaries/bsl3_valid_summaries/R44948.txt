the social security administration ( ssa ) is responsible for administering two federal entitlement programs that provide income support to individuals with severe , long - term disabilities: social security disability insurance ( ssdi ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) .
in contrast , ssi is a need - based public assistance program that provides monthly cash payments to aged , blind , or disabled individuals ( including blind or disabled children ) who have limited assets and little or no social security or other income .
in 2017 , ssdi and ssi combined paid an estimated $199 billion in federally administered benefits to 14.5 million qualified disabled individuals and 1.5 million non - disabled dependents of disabled workers .
ssdi is a work - related social insurance program that provides monthly cash benefits to nonelderly disabled workers and their eligible dependents , provided the workers accrued a sufficient number of earnings credits during their careers in jobs subject to social security taxes .
old - age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) , commonly known as social security , is a federal social insurance program established under title ii of the social security act that provides workers and their families with a measure of protection against the loss of income due to the worker's retirement , disability , or death .
