the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) now estimates that 4.3 million medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) , and enrollment is growing at a rate of about 100,000 new members per month .
but stakeholders — hcfa , private - sector purchasers , and others , such as individual consumers — are concerned that the cost control strategies hmos use could lead to diminished quality of care .
as a result , stakeholders are interested in programs that protect consumers from cost reduction strategies that might adversely affect their health care .
although these are reasonable approaches to assessing quality , we have reported that hcfa has failed to aggressively enforce legal and regulatory requirements for its risk contract hmos .
like large private - sector purchasers of health care , hcfa , which administers medicare , finds the potential for cost savings associated with managed care attractive .
second , through its medicare peer review organization ( pro ) program , hcfa collects and evaluates performance indicators for certain procedures or diseases to assess hmo performance .
hcfa is now enhancing its quality assessment methods by strengthening its collaboration with the private sector to jointly develop better performance indicators for the health care needs of older americans .
