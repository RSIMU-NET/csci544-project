equal employment opportunity commission , usda's office of inspector general ( oig ) , gao , and others have described extensive concerns about discriminatory behavior in usda's delivery of services to program customers — in particular , minority farmers — and its treatment of minority employees .
usda agreed with this recommendation .
consequently , we recommended that usda prepare and implement an improvement plan for resolving discrimination complaints ; develop and implement a plan to ensure the accuracy , completeness , and reliability of ascr's databases on complaints ; and obtain an independent legal examination of a sample of usda's prior investigations and decisions on civil rights complaints .
regarding strategic planning , we reported that ascr's planning was limited and did not reflect the views of relevant stakeholders , such as community - based organizations and minority interest groups ; did not link to the plans of other usda agencies or the department ; could better measure performance to gauge its progress ; did not discuss the potential for using performance information for identifying usda's performance gaps ; and did not link funding with anticipated results .
also , some steps ascr took to speed up its work may have adversely affected the quality of its work .
