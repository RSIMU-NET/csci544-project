these problems include the difficulty in controlling contract costs , the failure to recover certain federal cleanup costs from the parties who are responsible for the contaminated sites , and the selection of sites for cleanup without assurance that they are the most dangerous sites to human health and the environment .
we surveyed epa regions , other federal agencies , and the states to ( 1 ) determine how many of the over 3,000 sites remain potentially eligible for the npl ; ( 2 ) identify the characteristics of these sites , including their health and environmental risks ; ( 3 ) determine the status of any actions to clean up these sites ; and ( 4 ) collect the opinions of epa and other federal and state officials on the likely final disposition of these sites , including the number of sites that are expected to be placed on the npl .
my comments today are based on a number of reports we have issued in recent years that relate to three specific issues: ( 1 ) progress made toward cleaning up sites in the program , ( 2 ) continuing management problems , and ( 3 ) factors affecting superfund's future workload .
