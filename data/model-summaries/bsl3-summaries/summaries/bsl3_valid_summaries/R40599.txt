in turn , the effects felt by individuals and businesses who have fallen prey to identity thieves extend outside of pure financial burdens ; identity thieves affect not only the nation's economic health , but its national security as well .
consequently , policymakers may debate the federal government's role in preventing identity theft and its related crimes , mitigating the potential effects of identity theft after it occurs , and providing the most effective tools to investigate and prosecute identity thieves .
federal trade commission ( ftc ) complaint data indicate that the most common fraud complaint received ( 18% of all consumer fraud complaints ) is that of identity theft .

federal law enforcement is thus challenged with investigating criminals who may or may not be operating within u.s. borders ; may have numerous identities — actual , stolen , or cyber ; and may be acting alone or as part of a sophisticated criminal enterprise .
an increase in globalization and a lack of cyber borders provide an environment ripe for identity thieves to operate from within the nation's borders — as well as from beyond .
