u.s. greenhouse gas emissions ( mmtce ) ,1990-2001 source: environmental protection agency , inventory of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990-2001 ( april 2003 ) , epa 430r03004 .
pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change , the united stateshas published "national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinksof all greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol , using comparable methodologies... agreed upon by the conference of the parties. .
u.s. baseline year greenhouse gas emissions source: epa , inventory of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks: 1990 - 2001 ) april 2003 , epa 430r03004 .
following international convention , epa presents the data in teragrams ofco 2 equivalent ; crs has converted thefigures to million metric tons of carbon equivalent ( mmtce ) , a metric that is more familiar to most u.s.policymakers .
even with the potential for sequestration andemissions trading to reduce domestic reduction efforts , a goal to reverse greenhouse gasemissions trends would represent an extraordinary technical and political challenge for u.s.energy and environmental policy .
according to the white house announcement , this goal means that the current ( 2002 ) intensity of 183 metric tons of carbon emissions per million dollars of gdp would fall to 151mmtce per million dollars of gdp in 2012 ( see figure 4 ) .
