specifically , this testimony addresses ( 1 ) irs's efforts to address its authentication challenges , ( 2 ) irs's progress in implementing its authentication strategy , and ( 3 ) additional steps we identified that irs could take to enhance its authentication programs and stay ahead of fraudsters .
further , we found that irs does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement nist's new guidance for secure online authentication and also lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies , which could provide taxpayers additional options to actively protect their identity .
in an environment with an increasing risk of fraud , identity theft ( idt ) , and cyberattacks , irs must ensure that its preventative security controls provide the agency with reasonable assurance that it is interacting with the legitimate taxpayer .
irs's ability to continuously monitor its current authentication methods while also looking ahead to new identity verification technologies is critical to keeping ahead of fraudsters , who constantly adapt their schemes to thwart irs's defenses .
specifically , irs created an identity assurance office ( iao ) in 2015 to work with stakeholders across irs to review and assess the agency's various authentication programs and efforts .
