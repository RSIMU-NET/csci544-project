this report ( 1 ) describes u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) processes for meeting the act's requirements and ( 2 ) describes how these requirements contribute to u.s. efforts to monitor compliance with the 2006 softwood lumber agreement .
to provide congress with sufficient time to clarify the u.s. customs and border protection's requirements under the softwood lumber act of 2008 , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the commissioner of cbp to report to congress on how the agency plans to fulfill the requirements of the act upon the expiration of international agreements related to softwood lumber .
cbp has established mechanisms to comply with its requirements .
we also met with lumber industry representatives and customs brokers in washington , d.c. ; blaine ; and buffalo to discuss the effect of the act's reconciliation and verification processes on u.s. government agencies' monitoring efforts of compliance with the bilateral trade agreement .
as required by the act , cbp has developed processes to verify the importer declaration , which includes verifying that the export price declared by the importer is the same as the export price provided on the export permit , if any , issued by the country of export ; the estimated export charge is consistent with the applicable export charge rate as provided by commerce ; and importers have “made appropriate inquiry , including seeking appropriate documentation from the exporter,” and to the best of the importer's knowledge and belief that the exporter has paid or committed to pay all applicable export charges .
