they must cut costs while still maintaining , if not improving , operations .
federal executives , operating in the current environment of reduction and change , face a difficult challenge .
most efforts that have attempted to address this challenge have had to come to grips with the difficulties of change â€” change is easy to talk about , but it is much harder to accomplish .
a handful of federal agencies have also begun to implement best practices and reduce costs .

it is usually much easier to cut , than it is to improve .
indeed , there has been a growing acknowledgement within government that what is needed is a revamping of how the government does what it does .
there is no reason , however , why all federal agencies cannot achieve comparable results .
i know that you and other members of this subcommittee are deeply concerned about finding ways for federal agencies to cut costs and streamline operations .
that is why i am very pleased to be here today to discuss governmentwide travel management , ways in which it can be improved , and the efforts underway to do so .
