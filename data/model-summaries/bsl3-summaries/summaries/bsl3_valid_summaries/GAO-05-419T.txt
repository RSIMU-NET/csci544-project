my statement , which focuses only on enlisted personnel , will address our preliminary findings with respect to ( 1 ) the extent to which the active duty , reserve , and national guard components have met their overall recruiting and retention goals ; ( 2 ) the degree to which the components have met their recruiting and retention goals for selected , hard - to - fill critical occupations ; and ( 3 ) steps the components have taken to enhance their recruitment and retention efforts .
to meet its human capital needs , the department of defense ( dod ) must convince several hundred thousand people to join the military each year , the majority of whom are recent high school graduates .
last fiscal year alone , dod had goals to recruit more than 180,000 personnel into its active duty forces and more than 120,000 personnel into its reserve components .
moreover , dod must retain tens of thousands of personnel each year to sustain its active duty , reserve , and guard forces .
our september 2003 report assessed dod's recruiting advertising programs , and concluded that dod did not have clear program objectives and adequate outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its advertising .
