for a number of years , the department of defense has been researching and developing defenses against ballistic missile attacks on the united states , its deployed forces , friends , and allies .
the software was to analyze data collected in flight by the kill vehicle's sensor ( which collects real - time information about threat objects ) , enabling the kill vehicle to distinguish an enemy warhead from accompanying decoys .
national missile defense program officials said that after considerable debate among themselves and contractors , the program manager reduced the number of decoys planned for intercept flight tests in response to a recommendation by an independent panel , known as the welch panel.the panel , established to reduce risk in ballistic missile defense flight test programs , viewed a successful hit - to - kill engagement as a difficult task that should not be further complicated in early tests by the addition of decoys .
in 1990 , the department awarded research and development contracts to three contractors to develop and test exoatmospheric kill vehicles .
the department planned to use the best of the three vehicles in a follow - on missile defense program .
