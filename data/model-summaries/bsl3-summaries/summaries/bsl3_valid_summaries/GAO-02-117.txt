since most of these costs had not been reported by dod , the chairman requested that we review and report on ( 1 ) the scope of ongoing operations at dod installations that have associated environmental cleanup costs , ( 2 ) the potential magnitude of cleanup costs associated with those operations , and ( 3 ) the availability of data to develop related cleanup cost estimates .
working largely with personnel already responsible for derp reporting , we identified over 200 sites with estimated cleanup costs in excess of $250 million , most of which had not been previously reported .
for fiscal year 2000 , we reported that dod did not maintain adequate systems or have sufficient information to develop an accurate estimate of key components of its environmental and disposal liabilities .
dod partially concurred with the remaining three recommendations .
although the installations have a process in place to accumulate the data needed for derp reporting , this process does not encompass all operations with probable and reasonably estimable cleanup costs .
our objectives were to determine: ( 1 ) the scope of ongoing dod operations with potentially significant cleanup costs , ( 2 ) the potential magnitude of costs to clean up and dispose of the hazardous waste resulting from those operations , and ( 3 ) the availability of data for developing cleanup cost estimates .
