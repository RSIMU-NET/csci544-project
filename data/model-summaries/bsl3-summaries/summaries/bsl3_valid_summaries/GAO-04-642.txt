the lack of reliable financial and performance information has posed significant challenges to the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) ability to manage its largest and most costly programs effectively .
for nearly 15 years , nasa contract management has been on gao's high - risk list â€” due in part to nasa's inability to collect , maintain , and report the full cost of its programs and projects .
because cost growth has been a persistent problem on a number of nasa programs , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify initial cost estimates in selected nasa programs and any changes in those cost estimates , ( 2 ) assess nasa's cost - estimating processes and methodologies , and ( 3 ) describe any barriers that make it difficult for nasa to improve its cost - estimating processes .
without such information , nasa has consistently developed unrealistic cost and schedule estimates , which , at least in part , are reflected in the cost growth and schedule increases in many of its programs .
for example , poor or inadequate cost estimates and management oversight have been central to the problems that plagued several programs , including those intended to develop new space transportation and the international space station programs .
