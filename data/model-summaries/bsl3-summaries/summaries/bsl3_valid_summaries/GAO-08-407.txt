to determine the effects , if any , of environmental laws and the department of defense's ( dod ) use of exemptions to the migratory bird treaty act , the marine mammal protection act , and the endangered species acton training activities and military readiness , we judgmentally selected and visited 17 military training locations throughout the continental united states , which included training sites from each military service component , to directly observe the effects of environmental laws and dod's use of exemptions on training activities , military readiness , and the environment .
this report discusses the effects , if any , of ( 1 ) environmental laws on dod's training activities and military readiness , ( 2 ) dod's use of exemptions from environmental laws on training activities , and ( 3 ) dod's use of exemptions on the environment .
new advances in technology , coupled with the ongoing shift in force posture , mean that the department of defense ( dod ) needs to continually update and maintain its training ranges .
we found that ( 1 ) while the services had individually taken a varying number of key management improvement actions , such as developing range sustainment policies , these actions lacked consistency across dod or focused primarily on encroachment without including commensurate efforts on other issues , such as maintenance and modernization ; ( 2 ) though the services could not precisely identify the funding required and used for their ranges , range requirements had historically been inadequately funded ; and ( 3 ) although dod policy , reports , and plans had either recommended or required specific actions , dod had not fully implemented these actions .
