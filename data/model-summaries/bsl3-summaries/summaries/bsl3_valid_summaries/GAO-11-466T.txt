thank you for the opportunity to discuss how the provisions put into place by the government performance and results act ( gpra ) modernization act of 2010 ( gprama ) , could help address significant fiscal , performance , and management challenges facing the federal government .
in particular , the act calls for: a more coordinated and crosscutting approach to achieving meaningful efforts to address weaknesses in major management functions , ensuring performance information is both useful and used in decision sustained leadership commitment and accountability for achieving results , engaging congress in identifying management and performance issues to address .
addressing these fiscal challenges will require action on several fronts .
the federal government is the world's largest and most complex entity , with about $3.5 trillion in outlays in fiscal year 2010 that fund a broad array of programs and operations .
absent changes in fiscal policy , the structural imbalance between spending and revenue paths lead to large and growing deficits .
many federal program efforts , including those related to ensuring food safety , providing homeland security , monitoring incidence of infectious diseases , or improving response to natural disasters , transcend more than one agency .
