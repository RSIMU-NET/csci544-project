specifically , this report addresses the ( 1 ) cost of cleanup efforts , ( 2 ) reasons that cleanups are so costly , and ( 3 ) potential opportunities for reducing costs and their impact on programmatic goals .
requires the department of defense ( dod ) to comply with a variety of laws — including the comprehensive environmental response , compensation , and liability act ( cercla ) and national environmental policy act — to effect federal real property disposal at most base realignment and closure ( brac ) installations .
as requested , we reviewed the cost of the department of defense's ( dod ) environmental cleanup efforts at bases being closed under the base realignment and closure ( brac ) process .
in the earlier years of the brac program , the congress had expressed concern about dod's slow progress in obligating funds for environmental cleanup .
our analysis shows that in recent years dod has greatly increased the rate at which it has obligated funds .
our prior work on environmental issues , for example , showed that dod has spent large amounts of money on studies but that actual cleanup progress has been slow .
