as agreed with your office , we assessed the extent to which ( 1 ) osha's worksite - specific targeting processes ensure that osha effectively identifies hazardous worksites , ( 2 ) the agency's measurement efforts allow it to accurately demonstrate its impact on workplace safety , and ( 3 ) its human capital efforts to enhance inspector quality are likely to improve enforcement .
as with many other organizations , osha seeks to ensure that it ( 1 ) focuses its limited resources on those workplaces most likely to cause worker injury , illness , or death ; ( 2 ) shows that its efforts make worksites safer ; and ( 3 ) has a highly trained workforce capable of carrying out its mission effectively .
although workplace fatality and injury rates have improved significantly over the last decade , the department of labor's occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) continues to strive to reduce work - related injuries , illnesses , and fatalities for the country's 120 million workers .
for example , while osha enforces safety and health regulations in 31 “federal osha states,” it has delegated its enforcement authority to protect workplace safety and health to 23 “state - plan states,” where state agencies have assumed responsibility for establishing their own goals and enforcing safety and health regulations .
