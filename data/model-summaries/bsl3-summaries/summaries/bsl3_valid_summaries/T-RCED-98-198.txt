finally , our testimony will review the fund's progress in meeting the strategic planning requirements of the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
because participants in the cdfi program are just beginning to report preliminary results , our discussion of this program will focus on the fund's progress in developing performance measures for awardees and systems to monitor and evaluate their progress .
we found that the performance measures in the assistance agreements generally assess activities ( such as the number of loans made ) rather than accomplishments reflecting the results of activities ( such as the number of new low - income homeowners ) .
as you know , access to credit and investment capital is essential for creating and retaining jobs , developing affordable housing , revitalizing neighborhoods , and promoting the development and growth of small businesses .
community - based financial institutions have improved the economic well - being of economically distressed communities and their residents through lending and investments tailored to these communities .
in contrast , participants in the bea program have largely completed the activities for which they are rewarded ; therefore , we will discuss the impact of the program on banks' investments in cdfis and distressed communities .
