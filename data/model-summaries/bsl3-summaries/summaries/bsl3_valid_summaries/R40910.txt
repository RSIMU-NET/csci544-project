the united states and almost 200 other countries are negotiating under the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) to address climate change cooperatively beyond the year 2012 .
in december 2008 , the then - incoming obama administration stated its policy to reduce u.s. emissions to 14% below 2005 levels by 2020 .
negotiations had lagged through 2008 .
pivotal discussions include: whether measurable commitments to reduce greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions will include all major emitting countries and how deep reduction commitments would be ; whether countries will agree to transparency and accountability regarding their commitments through robust measuring , reporting , and verification ( mrv ) requirements ; how much financing may be available for capacity building , ghg reductions , avoiding deforestation and forest degradation , technology cooperation , and adaptation to climate change in developing countries through private sector mechanisms and public finance , and what institutions may oversee such flows ; what means of technology cooperation would help to develop and deploy advanced , low - or no - emitting technologies , as well as to assist adaptation to climate impacts ; and what mechanisms and resources would assist the most vulnerable countries to adapt to projected climate change .
