to determine what information is available about the physical condition of school facilities in indian impact aid school districts and what is known about how the condition of school facilities affects student outcomes , we interviewed officials from state and federal agencies , and associations and reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations .
of the studies that focused on broad measures , such as measures of physical conditions or the suitability of school facilities , about one - half ( 7 of 13 ) found that schools with better facilities generally had better student outcomes .
education provided us with the list of states with school districts that received fiscal year 2008 impact aid funds for students living on indian lands .
however , concerns persist about the conditions of some school facilities , particularly those located near indian lands .
these may include projects for bringing facilities into compliance with current building codes that the school was not required to meet when built ; providing additional space in schools that are overcrowded ; or providing equipment to meet the school's needs , such as a science lab facility .
state and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the construction , renovation , and maintenance of public school facilities .
