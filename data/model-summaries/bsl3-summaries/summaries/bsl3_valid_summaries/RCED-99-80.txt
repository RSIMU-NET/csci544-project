outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have raised questions about the safety of the u.s. food supply and the inherent weaknesses of the fragmented federal food safety system .
specifically , we ( 1 ) examined the reasons for and approaches taken to consolidation , the costs and savings , if any , associated with consolidation , and efforts to assess the effectiveness of the revised food safety systems and ( 2 ) identified the lessons that the united states might learn from these countries' experiences in consolidating their food safety functions .
organizational flexibility .
strong leadership .
preconsolidation funding arrangements were maintained .
the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food safety and inspection service has regulatory responsibility for ensuring the safety of meat , poultry , and some egg products , while the department of health and human services' food and drug administration has regulatory responsibility for all other food products .
all four countries are incurring short - term costs while expecting long - term benefits .
for example , these countries had to operate dual systems ( while the new systems were being brought on line , the old system had to continue to operate ) ; purchase new equipment and office space ; and standardize procedures from the different agencies involved in the consolidation .
