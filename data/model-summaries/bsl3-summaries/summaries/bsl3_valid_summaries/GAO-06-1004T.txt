to understand more fully how this strategy might contribute to better protection of ip , i will address three topics: ( 1 ) the range and effectiveness of multi - agency efforts on ip protection that preceded stop ; ( 2 ) initial observations on the organization and efforts of stop ; and ( 3 ) initial observations on the efforts of u.s. agencies to prevent counterfeit and pirated goods from entering the united states , which relate to one of stop's goals .
these include ( 1 ) a study that we have initiated for this committee focusing on ip enforcement at the u.s. border , ( 2 ) a study for the house government reform committee on interagency efforts to protect ip rights , and ( 3 ) additional work on a customs and border protection ( cbp ) program called the “in - bond system” that allows goods to enter u.s. commerce at a port other than the port of arrival .
stop has energized u.s. efforts to protect and enforce ip and has initiated some new efforts , however its long - term role is uncertain .
eight federal entities , the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) , and the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) undertake the primary u.s. government activities to protect and enforce u.s. ip rights overseas .
