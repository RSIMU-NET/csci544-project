my testimony today , which is based on gao's recently completed and ongoing work at the coast guard , addresses three topics: ( 1 ) the coast guard's progress in justifying the deepwater replacement project and addressing our concerns about its affordability , ( 2 ) the coast guard's plans for spending its fiscal year 1999 emergency funds , and ( 3 ) the budget strategies the agency may have to consider in the future to address continuing budget constraints .
the coast guard plans to have performance data on its current ships and aircraft by april 1999 , and the agency plans to provide that information to contractors at that time .
the coast guard , an agency within the department of transportation ( dot ) , is responsible for maritime missions that range from search and rescue operations to the enforcement of fisheries , immigration , and drug laws .
coast guard officials said that competition among contractors would cut costs and more closely align the potential cost of the project with probable funding levels .
in the meantime , contractors working on the conceptual design for the project will be assessing alternatives without the benefit of current data on the performance shortcomings of the agency's ships and aircraft and the resource hours needed to fulfill its missions .
