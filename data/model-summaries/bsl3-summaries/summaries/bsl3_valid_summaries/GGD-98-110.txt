this report provides our observations on the general services administration's ( gsa ) fiscal year 1999 annual performance plan , dated march 5 , 1998 , that was submitted to congress as required by the government performance and results act of 1993 ( results act ) .
specifically , in developing the next plan , we recommend that the administrator take steps to refine gsa's performance goals to make them more quantifiable and results clarify how gsa's performance goals link to specific program activities in gsa's budget ; explain how gsa has coordinated its crosscutting functions with the discuss gsa strategies to be used and resources needed to achieve its performance goals and their intended results , as well as external factors that could affect its overall performance ; and discuss specific controls for verifying and validating data used to measure performance , recognize existing data limitations , and explain gsa efforts to overcome those limitations .
despite the expectations of the results act and related omb guidance that annual performance goals be quantifiable , in our view , only 9 of the 31 performance goals in the plan have measures and targets that decisionmakers can use to gauge progress .
