because the united states and the eu figure so dominantly in the development and use of agricultural policy on the global level , information comparing the eu and u.s. farm support programs will likely continue to be of interest to congress as the united states prepares for another round of domestic farm bill negotiations and the world trade organization ( wto ) doha negotiations move forward .
this report uses data from two public sources to compare agricultural support between the united states and the eu: ( 1 ) estimates of domestic support for agricultural programs based on wto notifications ; and ( 2 ) the oecd's country - level policy database .
yet some argue that the failure of the united states and eu to enact deeper , more rapid reforms of their respective farm support programs has contributed to delays in the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations within the world trade organization ( wto ) .
the european union ( eu ) is one of the united states' chief agricultural trading partners and also a major competitor in world markets for goods and services , as well as for farm products ( table 1 ) .
