because of your continuing interest in the effective use of food safety resources , i will focus on three key points: ( 1 ) the role of gao's high - risk series in raising the priority and visibility of the need to transform federal oversight of food safety , ( 2 ) the fragmented nature of federal oversight of food safety , and ( 3 ) the need to address federal oversight of food safety as a 21st century challenge .
the sustained attention and commitment by congress and agencies to resolve serious , long - standing high - risk problems have paid off ; because of sufficient progress , we were able to remove the high - risk designation from 18 areas â€” more than half of our original list .
with 15 agencies collectively administering at least 30 laws related to food safety , the patchwork nature of the federal food safety oversight system calls into question whether the government can more efficiently and effectively protect our nation's food supply .
since we began reporting on high - risk areas , the government has taken high - risk problems seriously and has made long - needed progress toward correcting them .
