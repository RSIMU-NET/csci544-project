cms has made progress in strengthening provider enrollment provisions , but needs to do more to identify and prevent potentially fraudulent providers from participating in medicare .
it is primarily based on our medicare program integrity products issued and recommendations made from april 2004 through march 2014 , as well as selected updates on cms activities , have identified as important to reducing fraud , waste , and abuse , and ultimately improper payments: and will focus on progress related to three key strategies we strengthening provider enrollment standards and procedures , improving prepayment and postpayment review of claims , and addressing identified vulnerabilities .
ppaca authorized and cms has implemented new provider enrollment procedures that address past weaknesses identified by gao and hhs's office of inspector general ( oig ) that allowed entities intent on committing fraud to enroll in medicare .
if cms suspects that providers or suppliers are billing fraudulently , it can take action through its contractors , including suspending claims payment , revoking billing privileges , or referring cases to law enforcement for investigation .
specifically , we are assessing the process used to enroll and verify the eligibility of medicare providers in medicare's provider enrollment , chain , and ownership system ( pecos ) and the extent to which cms's controls are designed to prevent and detect the continued enrollment of ineligible or potentially fraudulent providers in pecos .
