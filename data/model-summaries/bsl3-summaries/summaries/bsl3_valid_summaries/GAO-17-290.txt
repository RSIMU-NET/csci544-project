for any future probe and educate reviews , cms should establish performance metrics that will help the agency determine the reviews' effectiveness in reducing improper billing .
in fiscal year 2016 , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) reported that an estimated 11 percent of the payments made to health care providers under the medicare fee - for - service program were made improperly , representing $41.1 billion in improper payments .
to date , cms has required macs to conduct two probe and educate reviews: a review of short - stay hospital claims , which has been completed , and a review of home health claims , which is ongoing .
to help ensure that payments are made properly , the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency within hhs that administers the medicare program , contracts with medicare administrative contractors ( mac ) .
to examine macs' provider education department efforts to reduce improper billing and the extent to which cms oversees these efforts , we reviewed the first annual mac improper payment reduction strategy ( iprs ) report for the 8 macs that had contracts as of july 1 , 2016 .
