dod needs to study ways to expand the use of smaller wide - body aircraft to ensure an equitable distribution of the peacetime business and determine whether smaller wide - body aircraft could carry out a higher proportion of its peacetime missions as efficiently as , and possibly more economically as , the b - 747 does .
in the event of a national emergency , the department of defense ( dod ) will face requirements for air transportation that exceed its military airlift capabilities .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct that the reevaluation of mobility requirements mandated by the defense planning guidance include a more thorough study of craf capabilities , to include the types of cargo craf can carry and how much craf aircraft can land and be unloaded and serviced at military bases , and the air mobility command determine whether smaller wide - body aircraft could be used as efficiently and effectively as the larger b - 747-type planes to handle the peacetime cargo business that dod uses as an incentive for craf participants .
to meet additional requirements , dod can use the civil reserve air fleet , aircraft from u.s. commercial air carriers voluntarily committed and put under contract to dod for use during emergencies .
