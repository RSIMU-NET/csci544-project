in this report , we ( 1 ) identify the conditions that irf medicare patients have , the number of these patients considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions , and the number of irfs that meet the requirements of the 75 percent rule ; ( 2 ) describe how irfs assess patients for admission and whether cms reviews admission decisions ; and ( 3 ) evaluate the approach of using a list of conditions in the 75 percent rule to classify irfs .
irfs are required to assess patients prior to admission to ensure they require the level of services provided in an irf , and cms is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of individual admissions after the patient has been discharged through reviews for medical necessity conducted under contract by its fiscal intermediaries ( fi ) .
the conference report that accompanied the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 directed us to issue a report , in consultation with experts in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation , to assess whether the current list of conditions represents a clinically appropriate standard for defining irf services and , if not , to determine which additional conditions should be added to the list .
