in november 2011 , president obama and leaders of the european union ( eu ) named a high level working group on jobs and growth to recommend steps to broaden transatlantic economic ties .
one month later , president obama notified congress that the united states would enter into negotiations with the eu to seek a free trade agreement , referred to as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) .
in its final report , issued in february 2013 , the working group called for a new bilateral agreement to govern transatlantic trade and investment .
motor vehicle safety and emissions standards are areas where the united states and the eu could break new ground .
such an agreement , the working group urged , should provide for "the promotion of more compatible approaches to current and future regulation and standard - setting and other means of reducing non - tariff barriers to trade. .
trade in vehicles and parts between the united states and the eu reached $57 billion in 2012 , and numerous companies manufacture on both sides of the atlantic .
a similar bilateral regulatory initiative has been under way since 2011 with canada .
