for this study , we ( 1 ) assessed the extent to which current automated systems in selected states meet key information needs of programs that help low - income individuals with children obtain employment and become economically independent , ( 2 ) identified the approaches states are using to develop or modify their automated systems to better meet these information needs , and ( 3 ) identified the major obstacles states have encountered in working to improve their automated systems and the potential role of the federal government in helping overcome these obstacles .
this report , welfarereform: improvingstateautomatedsystemsrequirescoordinatedfederaleffort ( gao / hehs - 00-48 ) , based on a research and development effort by gao , examines the capabilities of states' automated systems to provide information needed for state and local officials to help low - income individuals with children obtain employment and become economically independent .
104-193 ) have profound implications for the information needs of states and the automated systems designed to meet these needs .
we developed a questionnaire to obtain information on four topics: ( 1 ) the extent to which automated systems for different programs share data ; ( 2 ) the accessibility of data from different automated systems using the desktop computers of tanf case managers ; ( 3 ) the overall extent to which information needs for case management , service planning , and monitoring program performance are met by current automated systems ; and ( 4 ) the most helpful actions that the federal government could take to help resolve the major obstacles encountered by states and localities in developing or modifying automated systems .
