my testimony today will focus on our prior work and discuss ( 1 ) factors that have affected gipsa's ability to investigate concerns about anticompetitive practices , ( 2 ) gipsa's actions to address our recommendations and areas where their efforts have fallen short , and ( 3 ) challenges and other issues we believe gipsa should consider as it moves to further strengthen its capacity to address competitiveness issues .
despite these plans , the january 2006 oig report identified substantial ongoing weaknesses in gipsa's investigative processes and noted that gipsa's actions to respond to the prior oig and gao reports had fallen short in key areas .
a more recent oig report shows that , in several key areas , gipsa still has not taken sufficient steps to address those recommendations .
usda concurred with our findings and noted specific actions it planned to take in response to our recommendations , including ( 1 ) formalizing consultations between gipsa and ogc on complex investigations , and integrating ogc attorneys into its investigative teams ; ( 2 ) developing a tiered process whereby routine investigations would be reviewed and approved by headquarters staff , while complex investigations received an additional ogc review ; ( 3 ) adopting relevant procedures used by doj and ftc for planning , developing , implementing , and reviewing investigations ; and ( 4 ) reporting publicly on changing business practices and activities that raise fairness and competition concerns .
