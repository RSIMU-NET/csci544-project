to help the congress consider long - term solutions to the funds' financial challenges , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how the funds' health benefits compare to benefits offered by other retiree plans , ( 2 ) how the health care costs of the funds' beneficiaries compare to the costs of other retiree groups , and ( 3 ) the efforts of the funds' officials to control costs .
the coal act replaced the existing umwa retiree health benefit funds with the combined benefit fund ( cbf ) and the 1992 benefit plan — collectively referred to in this report as the funds .
in 1992 , certain retired coal miners and their spouses and dependents — more than 100,000 individuals in all — faced a potential decrease in their employment - related health insurance coverage or loss of such coverage altogether .
to ensure that these individuals would continue to receive the health benefits specified in previous collective bargaining agreements reached with coal companies , often gained in exchange for lower pensions , the congress enacted the coal industry retiree health benefit act of 1992 ( coal act ) .
some former employers had stopped mining coal or gone out of business , so they were no longer contributing to the united mine workers of america ( umwa ) retiree benefit funds .
