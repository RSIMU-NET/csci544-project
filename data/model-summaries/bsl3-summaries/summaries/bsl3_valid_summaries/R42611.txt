the decision of whether to issue this permit has provided ( and continues to provide ) a rallying point for environmental groups who have voiced various concerns over the construction of the pipeline and / or further development of the oil sands .
for these stakeholders , the presidential permit decision has been seen as a gauge of the administration's support for reducing domestic fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions .
if constructed , the pipeline would transport crude oil ( e.g. , synthetic crude oil or diluted bitumen ) derived from oil sands resources in alberta , canada , to refineries and other destinations in the united states .
any decrease or delay in oil sands development could have significant impacts on the rate of growth in global ghg emissions both directly ( by curtailing production ) and indirectly ( by allowing more time for the development of energy - efficiency strategies , the promulgation of climate policies , and the deployment of lower - carbon energy technologies ) .
the presidential permit application — submitted by transcanada — for the pipeline's construction represents a singular decision made by the administration about whether or not the pipeline would serve the national interest .
