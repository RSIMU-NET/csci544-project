reflecting congressional interest in brownfields , you asked us to ( 1 ) compare federal agencies' planned financial assistance to brownfields , as stated in the partnership agenda , to their actual spending for brownfields in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 ; ( 2 ) describe the purposes of these obligations ; and ( 3 ) determine the extent to which agencies met the partnership's goals and objectives .
since the early 1990s , federal , state , and local governments have focused much attention on the cleanup and economic redevelopment of “brownfields” — abandoned , idle , or underused industrial and commercial facilities where real or perceived environmental contamination is a barrier to redevelopment .
to respond to our first and second objectives — to compare federal agencies' planned financial investment for brownfields , as stated in the partnership agenda , to their actual obligations for brownfields in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 , and to describe the purposes of these obligations — we used a structured data collection instrument to request and then review the fiscal year 1997 and 1998 brownfield - related obligations and activities of the following agencies: ( 1 ) the departments of energy , health and human services , housing and urban development , and transportation , ( 2 ) the economic development , the national oceanic and atmospheric , and the general services administrations , and ( 3 ) the environmental protection agency .
