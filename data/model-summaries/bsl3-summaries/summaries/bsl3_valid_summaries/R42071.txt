the heightened u.s. engagement in the asia - pacific region has raised questions about apec's continued role and relevance in u.s. foreign policy , particularly given the growing number of alternative regional events or organizations at which the united states can present its views .
the agenda of the economic leaders' meeting usually is based on the host's theme for the year , implying this year's meeting will center on regional economic integration , sustainable development , and regulatory convergence .
the asia - pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) was founded in 1989 for the purpose of promoting trade and investment liberalization in the asia - pacific as a means of fostering sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the region .
besides high - level trips to asia , the obama administration has sought to strengthen u.s. ties to the region .
in addition , the united states may use the event to inform the apec members about the status of the trans - pacific partnership ( tpp ) negotiations and possibly publicly announce a significant landmark in the tpp talks .
as host , president obama is likely to push for progress on the formation of a free trade area of the asia - pacific ( ftaap ) , a contentious concept on apec's agenda since 2005 .
