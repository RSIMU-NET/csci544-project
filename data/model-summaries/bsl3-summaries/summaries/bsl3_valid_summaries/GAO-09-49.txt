our objectives in this report were to determine to what extent ( 1 ) dod has guidance that establishes the biometrics data to be collected to support military activities and ( 2 ) there may be gaps in biometrics information shared between dod and dhs .
we focused the scope of our work on the department of defense ( dod ) , the four military services ( army , navy , marine corps , and air force ) , the department of state ( dos ) , the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) u.s. - visitor and immigrant status indicator technology ( us - visit ) program office , and the department of justice's federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .
while limited occasional direct sharing of dod and dhs biometrics has occurred , it is not regularized .
for example , dod uses biometrics to verify its common credential and to support access controls .
however , dhs officials stated that to date the only progress has been the sharing of iraqi asylum and refugee data , which provides dhs with biometrics data on individuals that dod has encountered in iraq .
the events of september 11 , 2001 , and operations to defeat insurgents in afghanistan and iraq have made it increasingly critical for military units to identify individuals they encounter in the field and share this information with other units and certain federal agencies .
