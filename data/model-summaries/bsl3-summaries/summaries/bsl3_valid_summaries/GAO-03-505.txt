thus , our objectives were to assess efforts by dod and the military services to ( 1 ) provide adequate training for joint close air support missions and ( 2 ) enhance the capabilities of the equipment used to support this mission .
the success or failure of our military forces in combat is directly linked to the realism and thoroughness of their training beforehand .
this axiom is especially true when aircraft are needed to deliver bombs on targets close to troops on the ground .
timely , well - practiced procedures and communication are essential because close air support on the battlefield often has to happen fast to achieve its objective .
however , dod has acknowledged that joint close air support mission deficiencies have existed for many years .
while dod has acknowledged the need for more effective training in its 2001 joint close air support action plan , it has been unable to resolve most of the plan's action items because of the time and effort required to resolve the issues and disagreement among the services .
failure to respond to a call for air support can leave troops exposed to enemy fire ; however , mistakes in communications and targeting can result in fatalities among friendly forces .
