my statement will focus on hud's problems and progress to date in addressing ( 1 ) its long - standing management deficiencies ; ( 2 ) its portfolio of multi - and single - family housing insured by the federal housing administration ( fha ) ; ( 3 ) budget and management problems plaguing the public housing program ; ( 4 ) the spiraling cost of assisted housing programs ; and ( 5 ) the need for consensus on hud reforms .
these problems include how to ( 1 ) reduce excessive housing subsidies and address the physical inadequacies of insured multifamily properties ; ( 2 ) maintain the improved financial health of the single - family insurance fund ; ( 3 ) address the social , management , and budget problems that exist in public housing ; and ( 4 ) deal with the spiraling costs of renewing housing subsidy contracts that assist lower - income families .
we believe that , for the foreseeable future , the agency will be high - risk in terms of its programs' being vulnerable to waste , fraud , and abuse .
the congress and hud have made a start at reexamining housing and community development policy , but reaching consensus on what the policy goals should be , how assistance should be provided , and how much the nation should spend on these activities will take some time .
