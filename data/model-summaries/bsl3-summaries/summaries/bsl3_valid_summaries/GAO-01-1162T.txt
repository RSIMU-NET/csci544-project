our testimony is based on our prior work and includes assessments of security concerns with ( 1 ) aviation - related computer systems , ( 2 ) airport access controls , and ( 3 ) passenger and carry - on baggage screening , including how the united states and selected other countries differ in their screening practices .
a safe and secure civil aviation system is a critical component of the nation's overall security , physical infrastructure , and economic foundation .
faa's efforts to address these problems have been slow .
as we reported last year , our reviews of the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of air traffic control ( atc ) computer systems showed that faa had not followed some critical aspects of its own security requirements .
billions of dollars and a myriad of programs and policies have been devoted to achieving such a system .
although it is not fully known at this time what actually occurred or what all the weaknesses in the nation's aviation security apparatus are that contributed to the horrendous events of last week , it is clear that serious weaknesses exist in our aviation security system and that their impact can be far more devastating than previously imagined .
