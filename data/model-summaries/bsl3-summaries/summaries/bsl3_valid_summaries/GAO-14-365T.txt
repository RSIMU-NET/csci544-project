4007 would require dhs to consult with the heads of other federal agencies , states and political subdivisions and business associations to identify chemical facilities of interest ; direct dhs to develop a risk assessment approach that includes all elements of risk , including threat data based on available intelligence , the vulnerability of the facility to terrorist attack , and consequence measurements including potential economic consequences ; reaffirm the risk - based performance standard approach to facility security plans and the use of alternative security programs allow chemical facilities to utilize any federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the terrorist screening database to satisfy the requirements of a personnel surety performance standard ; authorize the use of non - department or non - government entities , with the secretary's approval , for audits and inspections ; and require us to submit a semiannual report to congress containing our assessment of the implementation of the bill .
in february 2014 , iscd officials told us that they are taking a number of actions intended to lessen the time it takes to complete reviews of remaining plans including the following: providing updated internal guidance to inspectors and iscd updating the internal case management system ; providing updated external guidance to facilities to help them better prepare their site security plans ; conducting inspections using one or two inspectors at a time over the course of 1 day , rather than multiple inspectors over the course of several days ; conducting pre - inspection calls to the facility to help resolve technical issues beforehand ; creating and leveraging the use of corporate inspection documents ( i.e. , documents for companies that have over seven regulated facilities in the cfats program ) ; supporting the use of alternative security programs to help clear the backlog of security plans because , according to dhs officials , alternative security plans are easier for some facilities to prepare and use ; and taking steps to streamline and revise some of the on - line data collection tools such as the site security plan to make the process faster .
