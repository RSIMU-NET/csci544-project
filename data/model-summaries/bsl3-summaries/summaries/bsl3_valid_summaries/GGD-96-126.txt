it is inevitable that some revenue losses will occur in a program of this magnitude , and , as with any business enterprise , the risk of revenue losses must be weighed against the cost of establishing controls to prevent and detect such losses .
the postal service , however , is hindered in its ability to make data - driven decisions about the adequacy of bulk mail acceptance controls .
for example , the service does not know the full extent of losses resulting from mailer preparation errors , and , furthermore , it has not sought to develop a means for identifying such losses .
the current acceptance system does not produce information on ( 1 ) the extent to which improperly prepared mailings are entering the mail stream and the related revenue losses associated with improperly prepared mailings â€” including mailer - applied barcodes that do not meet the postal service's standards ; and ( 2 ) the amount of rework required for the postal service to correct improperly prepared mailings that enter the mailstream .
as agreed with the subcommittee , we evaluated the current system of controls for such mailings to assess whether those controls reasonably ensure that mailer - claimed discounts are granted only when earned .
