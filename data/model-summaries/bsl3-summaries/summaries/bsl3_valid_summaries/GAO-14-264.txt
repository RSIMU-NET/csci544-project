to analyze differences of opinion concerning discount rates for pension plan valuations and funding , gao examined ( 1 ) the significance of the differences in discounting approaches used by public versus private sector pension plans ; ( 2 ) the purposes for measuring the value of a plan's future benefits and key considerations for determining plan discount rate policy ; ( 3 ) the approaches select countries have taken to choose discount rates .
however , db plans have faced a number of challenges , including the lingering effects from the 2008 stock market downturn ; the implications of lower interest rates for the cost of financing retirement benefits ; increased longevity of plan participants ; and the possibility of a need for higher contributions to these plans .
the relevant regulation states that “the rates of interest used to discount future payments of benefits must be chosen prudently , taking into account either or both – ( i ) the yield on assets held by the scheme to fund future benefits and the anticipated future investment returns , and ( ii ) the market redemption yields on government or other high - quality bonds.” other plan assumptions to determine if any appear to be too high or inappropriate given plan risks and sponsor strength .
