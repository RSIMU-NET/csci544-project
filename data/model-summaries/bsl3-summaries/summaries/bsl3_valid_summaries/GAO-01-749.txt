to strengthen the federal role in ensuring the delivery of epsdt services and to bring greater visibility to ways that states can better serve children in medicaid , we recommend that the administrator of cms: work with states to develop criteria and time frames for consistently assessing and improving epsdt reporting and the provision of services , including requiring that states develop improvement plans as appropriate for achieving the epsdt goal of providing health services to children in medicaid ; and develop a mechanism for sharing information among states on successful state , plan , and provider practices for reaching children in medicaid .
in the short - term , cms can take action to obtain a better understanding of the many different state policies and practices so it can work collaboratively with states to improve data and reporting , monitor the provision of services , and better inform and reach beneficiaries .
medicaid , a joint federal and state program , finances health coverage for 21 million , or more than one in four , of the nation's children .
in several instances , the outcomes , including court orders and settlements agreed to by both parties to remedy known concerns , illustrate the difficulties states have encountered in providing services and also suggest strategies to remedy established epsdt deficiencies .
