in addition , this statement contains updates from tsa as of april 2019 about actions it has taken to address the recommendations made in our december 2018 report .
the pipeline security branch is responsible for conducting voluntary security reviews — corporate security reviews ( csr ) and critical facility security reviews ( cfsr ) — which assess the extent to which the 100 most critical pipeline systems are following the intent of tsa's pipeline security guidelines .
however , we also identified weaknesses in several areas of tsa's pipeline security program management , including: ( 1 ) updating and clarifying pipeline security guidelines ; ( 2 ) planning for workforce needs ; ( 3 ) assessing pipeline risks ; and ( 4 ) monitoring program performance .
for this report , we reviewed and analyzed relevant documents from tsa and other federal entities , evaluated tsa pipeline risk assessment efforts , and interviewed tsa officials , including officials within tsa's pipeline security branch .
tsa officials reported that staffing limitations had prevented tsa from conducting more reviews .
