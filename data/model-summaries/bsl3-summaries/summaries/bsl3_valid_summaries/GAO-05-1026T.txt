today , i am going to provide some information on the legislative and regulatory history of ballast water management and discuss some issues that pose challenges for the federal government's program for preventing the introduction of invasive species into u.s. waters from ships' ballast water discharges , including an update on concerns that we identified in our 2002 report .
numerous harmful species have been introduced into u.s. waters via ballast water and have caused serious economic and ecologic damage .
for fiscal year 2005 , agencies were to ( 1 ) sponsor eight ballast water technology projects , ( 2 ) develop and implement a standardized program to test and certify the performance capabilities of ballast water treatment systems , and ( 3 ) conduct a pilot scale verification trial of a full - scale treatment system to validate the standardized program .
the effects are not trivial ; the zebra mussel alone is estimated to have caused $750 million to $1 billion in costs between 1989 and 2000 .
as you know , many of these species are now permanent residents in u.s. ecosystems and have significantly altered the structure of these systems , or promise to do so in the future .
