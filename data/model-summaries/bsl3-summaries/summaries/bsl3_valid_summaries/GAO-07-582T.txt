in justifying much of the $5.8 billion in its supplemental fiscal year 2007 security forces fund request and its fiscal year 2008 security forces fund request , dod has pointed out that without the funds designated for mod and moi logistics and sustainment functions the coalition would have to continue to support the isf .
in november 2005 , the national security council issued the national strategy for victory in iraq , which states that the coalition will adjust its “posture and approaches as conditions evolve and iraqi capabilities grow,” and that coalition troop levels in iraq will decrease over time as the iraqis take on more responsibilities for themselves .
the national strategy implies a conditions - based linkage between the development of the isf , including its logistical and other support capabilities , and the size and shape of the u.s. presence in iraq .
in its next report to congress , issued in may 2006 , dod stated that more than 65 percent of personnel in the iraqi army's support forces had been trained and equipped and that logistics units were continuing to increase in capability .
in february 2006 , the department of defense ( dod ) issued its third report to congress , measuring stability and security in iraq , and stated that with the generation of regular line infantry battalions in the iraqi army largely completed , the focus of the train - and - equip program was shifting toward building combat support and combat service support units .
