in the first of three official u.s. farm income outlook releases scheduled for 2020 ( see box "ers's annual farm income forecasts" below ) , the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) economic research service ( ers ) projects that u.s. net farm income will rise 3.3% year - over - year in 2020 to $96.7 billion , up $3.1 billion from last year ( figure 1 and table a - 1 ) .
when national net farm income is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt - to - asset ratio , the two summary statistics provide a quick and widely referenced indicator of the economic well - being of the national farm economy .
as a result , the net cash farm income forecast for 2019 included $14.7 billion in sales from on - farm crop inventories , whereas the 2020 forecast includes a much smaller amount ( $0.5 billion ) in sales from on - farm inventories .
annual u.s. net farm income is the single most - watched indicator of farm sector well - being , as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes , input expenses , and marketing conditions that have prevailed during a specific time period ( see box "measuring farm profitability" for a definition of net farm income ) .
