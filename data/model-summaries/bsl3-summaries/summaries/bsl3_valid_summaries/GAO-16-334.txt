this report describes: 1. the prevalence and use of federal grants to train and fund sexual 2. what is known about the availability of sexual assault forensic examiners nationally and in selected states ; and 3. the challenges selected states face in maintaining a supply of sexual assault forensic examiners .
to describe the prevalence and use of federal grants to train or fund sexual assault forensic examiners , we asked officials at doj and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to identify and describe federal grant programs from which funds are available for these purposes .
the following three tables show the number of grantees that used funding to provide training for examiners and the number of examiners who received training by federal grant program and state in 2013 and , where available , 2014 .
the violence against women act ( vawa ) , most recently reauthorized in 2013 , authorized funding for federal grant programs administered by the department of justice ( doj ) that can be used by states and other eligible entities to , among other things , train sexual assault forensic examiners or fund examiner positions .
doj provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate .
