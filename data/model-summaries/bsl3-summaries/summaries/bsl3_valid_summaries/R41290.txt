president obama has nominated his solicitor general , elena kagan , to be the next supreme court justice .
rather , ms. kagan argues that first amendment case law is designed to prevent the government from enacting laws that are more likely to spring from improper motives .
in another article , she offers suggestions for developing statutes that would be consonant with her understanding of first amendment case law , and , therefore , more likely to be upheld as constitutional .
ms. kagan does not appear to be arguing for a change in first amendment analysis , or hinting towards how she believes cases would be better analyzed .
prior to her term as solicitor general , ms. kagan , in her capacity as an academic and scholar , wrote influential pieces analyzing free speech jurisprudence .
if confirmed , she would fill the seat being vacated by justice john paul stevens upon his retirement at the end of the 2009 / 2010 term .
in her first amendment scholarship , ms. kagan seems primarily concerned with developing an understanding of the evolution of the supreme court's first amendment jurisprudence .
this report will discuss some of her most significant scholarly articles related to the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech .
