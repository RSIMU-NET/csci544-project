this testimony discusses findings from gao reports and ongoing work that cover ( 1 ) progress reported and tools used to assess ansf capability , ( 2 ) challenges affecting the development of capable ansf , and ( 3 ) use of u.s. security force assistance advisory teams to advise and assist ansf .
specifically , we address ( 1 ) progress reported and tools used to assess ansf capability , ( 2 ) challenges affecting the development of capable ansf , and ( 3 ) use of u.s. security force assistance advisory teams to advise and assist ansf .
the department of defense ( dod ) and the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) report progress developing capable afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , but tools used to assess the performance of ansf units have changed several times .
gao is not making new recommendations but has made numerous recommendations in prior reports aimed at improving efforts to develop ansf capabilities .
since gao made its recommendations , additional trainers have deployed to afghanistan .
first , while the afghan government and coalition partners agreed in may 2012 to a sustainment model for ansf , with an annual budget of $4.1 billion , gao has previously reported the afghan government has limited ability to financially support its security forces and is dependent on donor contributions .
