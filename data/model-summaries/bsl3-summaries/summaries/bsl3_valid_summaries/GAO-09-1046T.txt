i will discuss ( 1 ) state's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts , and ( 2 ) state's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements .
in recent years gao has issued a number of reports on human capital issues that have hampered state's ability to carry out the president's foreign policy objectives ( see appendix i for a complete list of related gao products ) .
to ensure that hardship posts are staffed commensurate with their stated level of strategic importance and resources are properly targeted , gao recommends the secretary of state ( 1 ) take steps to minimize the experience gap at hardship posts by making the assignment of experienced officers to such posts an explicit priority consideration , and ( 2 ) develop and implement a plan to evaluate incentives for hardship post assignments .
a common element of these problems has been a longstanding staffing and experience deficit , which has both contributed to the gaps at hardship posts and fueled the language shortfall by limiting the number of staff available for language training .
despite some progress in addressing staffing shortfalls since 2006 , state's diplomatic readiness remains at risk for two reasons: persistent staffing vacancies and experience gaps at key hardship posts that are often on the forefront of u.s. policy interests .
