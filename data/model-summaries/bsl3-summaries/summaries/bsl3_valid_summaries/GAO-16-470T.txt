this statement addresses issues , if any , associated with ( 1 ) the epidemiology and transmission of the zika virus disease , including reporting on the incidence of disease and what is known about its link to microcephaly ; ( 2 ) detection and testing methods ; ( 3 ) methods for mosquito control ; and ( 4 ) the proposed federal research agenda as it relates to the zika virus and zika virus disease .
zika virus — which at present appears to be primarily transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes — can cause symptoms including fever , rash , conjunctivitis ( red eyes ) , and joint and muscle pain .
infectious diseases are a continuous threat for reasons that include: ( 1 ) emergence — at times rapid — of new infectious diseases ; ( 2 ) re - emergence of previously - known infectious diseases ; and ( 3 ) persistence of intractable infectious diseases .
the government accountability office ( gao ) has issued several reports dealing with preparedness for , detection of , and response to emerging infectious diseases domestically and internationally , as well as pandemics .
although a possible link between zika virus disease and microcephaly in newborn babies , as well as a link with guillain - barré syndrome in infected adults has been hypothesized , to date , the link has not been firmly established .
