to enhance medical units' preparedness to conduct current and future operations given the changing use of combat support hospitals and forward surgical teams in iraq and afghanistan , we recommend that the secretary of the army direct the army medical department to update its doctrine and the organization of medical units concerning their size , composition , and use .
specifically , we evaluated the extent to which ( 1 ) dod has assessed its need for military medical personnel in iraq and afghanistan , ( 2 ) the army has adapted the composition and use of its medical units to provide advanced medical care , and ( 3 ) the army fills medical personnel gaps that arise in theater .
in response to a draft of this report , dod mentioned to us that its operating units have sufficient organic medical support and the medical needs of deployed civilians are being met .
we interviewed officials with the joint staff , u.s. joint forces command , and the military services' force providers to include u.s. army forces command , u.s. fleet forces command , u.s. air combat command , and u.s. marine forces command , as well as officials with the army medical command , the navy bureau of medicine and surgery , and the air force personnel center about their processes for filling in - theater military medical personnel requirements .
