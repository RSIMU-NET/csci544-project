without political will and investment from the new enrique peña nieto administration , both the federal government and the states may not meet the 2016 constitutional deadline for implementing judicial reforms enacted in 2008 .
u.s. assistance is geared toward: 1 ) helping the federal and state governments adopt legislative frameworks to underpin the reform process ; 2 ) providing in - depth training for justice sector operators on their roles in the new system at all levels of government ; 3 ) building support for the reforms in mexican civil society ; and 4 ) addressing institutional and operational problems at all levels of government that may not directly relate to the reform process .
u.s. assistance under the mérida initiative has increasingly focused on supporting mexico's efforts to reform its justice sector institutions in order to reduce corruption and impunity .
