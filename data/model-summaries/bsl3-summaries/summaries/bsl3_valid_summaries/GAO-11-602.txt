to further help prevent international parental child abductions involving airline flights , particularly for persons identified as high risk for attempting such abductions , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security consider creating a program similar to the child abduction component of the prevent departure program that would apply to u.s. citizens .
this report provides ( 1 ) information on policies and measures airlines , federal agencies , and other entities have in place to prevent international parental child abductions involving airline flights and ( 2 ) options federal agencies , airlines , nongovernmental organizations , and others could consider to prevent international parental child abductions involving airline flights , as well as the advantages and limitations of those options .
since 2000 , the annual number of new international child parental abduction cases for which parents requested department of state ( state department ) assistance has nearly tripled .
in determining policies and efforts federal agencies , airlines , and others have to prevent international parental child abductions , we examined relevant laws and regulations and met with and obtained and analyzed information provided by the federal agencies ( departments of homeland security , justice , state , and transportation ) and seven child advocacy associations .
