our objectives in this report were to examine ( 1 ) the regulatory analyses , including benefit - cost analyses , federal financial regulators have performed to assess the potential impact of selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act ; ( 2 ) how federal financial regulators consulted with each other in implementing selected final rules issued pursuant to the dodd - frank act to avoid duplication or conflicts ; and ( 3 ) what is known about the impact of the final dodd - frank act regulations on the financial markets .
the 2007-2009 financial crisis created major disruptions in significant parts of the u.s. financial system and threatened the solvency of some large financial institutions , prompting the federal government to take extraordinary steps to moderate the adverse economic impacts .
in response to the crisis , congress passed the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd - frank act ) in 2010 , which includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial services firms and consolidate certain consumer protection responsibilities in the bureau of consumer financial protection , commonly known as the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) .
