policy makers and beneficiary advocates are questioning whether beneficiaries fully understand these differences when they enroll in a pffs plan and what their implications are for beneficiary spending , access to providers , and adequacy of benefits .

most recently , in an agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , seven health care organizations representing 90% of the non - group pffs market voluntarily agreed to suspend marketing of their pffs products because of complaints and accusations of deceptive marketing practices .
medicare is the nation's health insurance program for the aged , disabled , and persons with end stage renal disease .
