bulgaria is a parliamentary democracy that has held generally free and fair elections since the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989 .
the current coalition could face a serious challenge if a number of small center - right parties in the current parliament can form an alliance with the cedb .
bulgaria held its most recent parliamentary elections on june 25 , 2005 .
experts note that it has been a common phenomenon in central and eastern europe that when a former communist party ( such as the bsp ) moves to the center , often as part of european integration efforts , its place in the political spectrum is often taken over by populist and nationalist groups .
in fy2007 , bulgaria received $11 million in u.s. aid , including $9.6 million in foreign military financing ( fmf ) and $1.4 million in imet military training funding to bring bulgaria's military closer to nato standards .
the winner of the vote was a coalition led by the left - of - center bulgarian socialist party ( bsp ) , which received 82 seats in the 240-seat national assembly , bulgaria's unicameral parliament .
