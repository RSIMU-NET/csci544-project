the u.s. army corps of engineers ( usace ) is an agency within the department of defense with both military and civil works responsibilities .
more recently , congress has authorized the agency to restore aquatic ecosystems .
it began with improving and regulating navigation channels thereby facilitating the movement of goods between states and for import and export .
usace operates more than 700 dams ; has built 14,500 miles of levees ; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal , great lakes , and inland harbors , as well as 12,000 miles of inland waterways .
congress directs and oversees the specific navigation , flood control , and ecosystem restoration projects that usace plans and constructs through authorization legislation , annual and supplemental appropriations legislation , and oversight efforts .
the agency's civil works mission has evolved with the changing needs of the nation .
congress then charged the agency to help in reducing the damages from floods .
part of the issue is how effective , efficient , and equitable is the usace project delivery process in meeting the nation's needs .
for two of the bills — wrda 1992 and wrrda 2014 — there were titles for which the majority of the provisions were related to the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) while also being related to usace activities .
