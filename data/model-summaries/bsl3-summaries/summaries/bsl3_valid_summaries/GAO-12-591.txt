the department of energy's ( doe ) isotope development and production for research and applications program ( isotope program ) is the only domestic supplier for many of the more than 300 different isotopes that it sells , many of which are critical to medical , commercial , research , and national security applications .
specifically , our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) which isotopes are produced , sold , or distributed either by the isotope program or nnsa and how the two entities make isotopes available for commercial and research applications ; ( 2 ) what steps the isotope program takes to provide isotopes for commercial and research applications ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which doe is assessing and mitigating risks facing the isotope program .
the isotope program has begun taking some actions to identify and mitigate risks to achieving its mission of producing isotopes , such as the risk of relying on sales of a small number of commercial isotopes for a large percentage of its revenues , but without first establishing clear , consistent program objectives , the program's risk assessment efforts are not comprehensive .
in fiscal year 2009 , doe transferred the isotope program from its office of nuclear energy to its office of science and revised the program's mission to three purposes: ( 1 ) produce or distribute isotopes in short supply , their associated by - products and surplus materials , and deliver isotope - related services ; ( 2 ) maintain the infrastructure required to produce and supply isotopes and related services ; and ( 3 ) investigate and develop new or improved isotope production and processing techniques that can make new isotopes available for research and other applications .
