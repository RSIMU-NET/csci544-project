recurring problems in managing its programs and projects plagued the department of energy ( doe ) to such a degree in the late 1980s and early 1990s that some observers , including gao , called for a rethinking of the department's missions and structure .
of the more than 225 reports identified , we selected 121 that addressed doe corporate management functions , including strategic planning ; information technologies ; retaining , recruiting and training staff ; security ; environment , safety and health practices ; contracting ; program and project management ; and national laboratory reform .
concerned about the progress that doe has made to strengthen its management in recent years , you asked us to describe actions taken by doe to improve its performance in the early to assess doe progress since then in addressing management weaknesses and improving performance , and identify any underlying impediments to more effective management and improved performance at doe .
responding to calls for restructuring , by 1995 doe initiated “unprecedented” reforms that it said would “fundamentally improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the department.” created in 1977 from diverse agencies , doe manages the nation's nuclear weapons production complex , cleans up the environmental legacy from the production of nuclear weapons , and conducts research and development on both energy and basic science .
