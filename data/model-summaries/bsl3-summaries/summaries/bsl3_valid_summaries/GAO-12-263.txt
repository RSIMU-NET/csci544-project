assess the feasibility of providing contracting officials in military department programs that routinely use the national security exception with access to tools that facilitate market research and competitive solicitation in a secure environment , either through development of new tools or access to existing intelligence community systems .
our mandate required us to review ( 1 ) the pattern of usage of the national security exception by acquisition organizations within the department of defense to determine which organizations are commonly using the exception and the frequency of such usage ; ( 2 ) the range of items or services being acquired through the use of such exception ; ( 3 ) the process for reviewing and approving justifications involving such exception ; 4 ) whether the justifications for use of such exception typically meet the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation applicable to the use of such exception ; ( 5 ) issues associated with follow - on procurements for items or services acquired using such exception ; and ( 6 ) potential additional instances where such exception could be applied and any authorities available to dod other than such exception that could be applied in such instances .
to answer the mandate , we ( 1 ) identified the pattern of dod's use of the national security exception to full and open competition , including the range of goods and services acquired ; ( 2 ) assessed dod's process for using this exception ; and ( 3 ) determined the extent to which dod obtained competition on selected contracts when using the national security exception .
