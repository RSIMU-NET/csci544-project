this report analyzes ( 1 ) shortages in air - to - ground training ordnance required to meet training readiness requirements , ( 2 ) factors that account for the shortages , and ( 3 ) the effect of shortages on training and tactical aviation readiness .
factors contributing to shortages include ( 1 ) units do not ask for sufficient amounts of ordnance to support their training and exercise needs ; ( 2 ) the navy has given munitions a low funding priority , which has resulted in low ordnance stockpile - levels of live munitions and shortages of inert training munitions ; and ( 3 ) the navy has poorly allocated available ordnance .
to assess shortages in navy and marine corps air - to - ground training ordnance required to meet training readiness requirements , we reviewed the navy and marine corps' training , testing , and current operations submissions , and ordnance allocations for the naval air forces in the atlantic and pacific fleets , and marine forces atlantic and pacific .
yet , despite this direct link to training readiness , the navy's ordnance procurement budget request , which combines both its war time requirements and its training requirements , has been less than its training requirement alone .
