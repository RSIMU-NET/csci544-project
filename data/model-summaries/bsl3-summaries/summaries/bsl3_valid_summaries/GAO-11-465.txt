we reported in 2010 that dod's efforts to make intelligence data accessible across the defense intelligence community have been hampered by not having integration of service programs and a concept of operations for intelligence sharing .
even though urgent operational needs include isr capabilities , the usd ( i ) does not have a direct role in determining urgent operational needs .
although the services can share limited intelligence data , their progress toward full information sharing has been uneven .
to improve management of dod's isr enterprise and increase its ability to achieve efficiencies , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the usd ( i ) to take the following three actions: collect and aggregate complete financial data — including information on dual - use assets , urgent operational needs , capability funding from multiple sources , and military personnel funding — to inform resource and investment decisions .
under that mandate , this review examines the extent to which: ( 1 ) dod manages and oversees the full scope and cost of the isr enterprise ; ( 2 ) dod identified and minimized the potential for any unnecessary duplication in program , planning , and operations for isr ; and ( 3 ) dod's isr integration roadmap addresses key management elements required by law or directed by congressional committees .
