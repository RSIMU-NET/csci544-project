the 115 th congress continues to take an interest in u.s. research and development ( r&d ) and in evaluating support for federal r&d activities .
the report concludes with discussion and analysis of the r&d budget requests of selected federal departments and agencies that , collectively , account for nearly 99% of total federal r&d funding .
for fy2017 , president obama proposed $152.333 billion for r&d , an increase of $6.195 billion ( 4.2% ) over the estimated fy2016 enacted r&d funding level of $146.138 billion .
some members of congress have expressed concerns about the level of federal spending ( for r&d and for other purposes ) in light of the current federal deficit and debt .
on february 9 , 2016 , president obama released his proposed fy2017 budget .
this report begins with a discussion of the overall level of president obama's fy2017 r&d request , followed by analyses of the r&d funding request from a variety of perspectives and for selected multiagency r&d initiatives .
however , widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions about the prioritization of r&d , both in the context of the entire federal budget and among competing needs within the federal r&d portfolio .
