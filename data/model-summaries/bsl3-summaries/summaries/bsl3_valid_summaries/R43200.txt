meeting energy needs depends upon the availability of water , often in large quantities , for mineral extraction and mining , fuel production , hydropower , and thermoelectric power plant cooling .
this report first discusses water - related energy use broadly and then energy for facilities that treat and deliver water to end users and also dispose of and discharge wastewater .
improved energy management .
regulatory barriers also exist .
because one of the largest end uses of electricity in california is in treating , heating , and conveying water , energy companies in that state are working with the water sector to help utilities and companies reduce their energy use and boost their efficiency .
thus , more education and outreach to all types of water users , the general public , and public officials are needed on the water - energy nexus and how improving efficiency involves linkages between saving energy and saving water .
this interdependence , which is often described as the water - energy nexus , or energy - water nexus , is illustrated in the following graphic from a u.s. department of energy report .
better understanding is needed of linkages between energy , water , land , and agriculture and risks of climate change and extreme weather events on water availability and energy supply .
