this report examines ( 1 ) the actions the corps and reclamation have taken since 2009 to assess and respond to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure and ( 2 ) what challenges , if any , the corps and reclamation face in assessing and responding to the potential effects of climate change on water infrastructure , and the steps the agencies are taking to address them .
in 2009 , a law — commonly referred to as the secure water act — was enacted , requiring , among other things , that reclamation establish a climate change adaptation program to ( 1 ) assess the effect of and risk resulting from global climate change on the quantity of water resources and ( 2 ) develop strategies to address potential water shortages and other impacts .
through the basin studies , reclamation intends to identify basin - wide water supply vulnerabilities , project climate change's impacts on the performance of water infrastructure , and develop adaptation strategies — such as operational or physical changes to existing water infrastructure or development of new facilities — to address these impacts .
the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) — an agency within the department of defense and a major command within the army — is composed of four program areas including civil works , military construction , real estate , and research and development .
