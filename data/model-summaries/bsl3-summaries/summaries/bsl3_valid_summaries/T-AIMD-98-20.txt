we are pleased to be asked to provide our views on the progress being made by the national credit union administration ( ncua ) in ensuring that automated information systems belonging to the thousands of credit unions that ncua oversees are ready for the upcoming century date change .
if the year 2000 problem is not addressed in time , credit union computer systems — which affect billions of dollars of assets and transactions — will be unable to readily process transactions or produce accurate information .
as requested , my testimony today will highlight the year 2000 problem's potential impact on credit unions and their systems .
this testimony is the first in a series of reports you requested on the status of efforts by federal financial regulatory agencies to ensure that the organizations they oversee are ready to handle the year 2000 computer conversion challenge .
according to ncua , without properly functioning systems , credit unions like other financial institutions face the potential of failure .
in summary , we found that the year 2000 problem poses a serious dilemma for credit unions because they like other financial institutions rely heavily on information systems .
to prepare for this testimony , we performed a quick overview of ncua's efforts to date to ensure that credit unions have adequately mitigated the risks associated with the year 2000 date change and compared these activities to our year 2000 assessment guide .
