we have reported on the limited usefulness of mda's acquisition baselines for oversight due to ( 1 ) a lack of clarity , consistency , and completeness ; ( 2 ) a lack of high - quality supporting cost estimates and schedules ; and ( 3 ) instability in the content of the baselines .
moreover , to meet tight deadlines , mda has employed high - risk acquisition strategies that have resulted in significant cost growth , schedule delays , and in some cases , performance shortfalls .

i am pleased to be here today to discuss the progress made and challenges that remain for the department of defense's ( dod ) missile defense agency ( mda ) in developing and fielding the ballistic missile defense system ( bmds ) .
mda plans to spend about $7.5 billion per year through 2018 .
although the mda has made some progress , the new mda director faces considerable challenges in executing acquisition programs ; strengthening accountability ; assessing alternatives before making new investment commitments ; developing and deploying u.s. missile defense in europe and using modeling and simulations to understand capabilities and limitations of the bmds .
