in combination , these reports have three main objectives: to identify and describe the major general management laws under which the executive branch is required to operate , including their rationale , design , and scope ; to assist members of congress and their staff in overseeing management of the executive branch ; and to help congress when considering potential changes to the management laws , as well as other legislation , including authorizing statutes and appropriations .
this report , general management laws: major themes and management policy options , is a companion to crs report rl30795 , general management laws: a compendium ( pdf ) ( hereafter "compendium" ) .
the compendium contains profiles of selected "general management laws" â€” broad statutes designed to regulate the activities , procedures , and administration of all or most executive branch agencies .
the quality of the general management laws , as well as their implementation , are considered crucial to maintaining the accountability of the executive branch to congress , the president , and the public .
the entries are organized into the following seven functional categories: information and regulatory management ; strategic planning , performance measurement , and program evaluation ; financial management , budget , and accounting ; organization ; procurement and real property management ; intergovernmental relations management ; and human resources management and ethics .
