my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) u.s. efforts to develop capable anp forces ; ( 2 ) challenges that affect the development of capable anp forces ; and ( 3 ) our analysis of u.s. efforts to develop a coordinated , detailed plan for completing and sustaining the ansf , including the anp .
my testimony is based on our concurrently issued report regarding u.s. efforts to develop the afghan national security forces ( ansf ) , which consist of the afghan national army ( ana ) and the anp .
these include ( 1 ) shortages in the police mentors needed to provide training and evaluation and verify that police are on duty ; ( 2 ) shortfalls in several types of equipment that defense considers critical ; ( 3 ) a weak judicial system ; and ( 4 ) consistent problems with police pay , corruption , and attacks by insurgents .
according to defense , an improved police force is vital to stabilizing and maintaining security throughout afghanistan .
according to defense and state , sustainment costs will be transitioned to the government of afghanistan commensurate with the nation's economic capacity , and the united states and the international community will need to assist afghanistan in developing revenues .
