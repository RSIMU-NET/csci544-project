specifically , vha has not taken action to ensure that officials assess the recommendations from sail evaluations , document their decisions , and implement recommendations as appropriate .
vha designed sail to provide internal benchmarking of medical center performance and to promote high quality health care delivery across its system of regional networks and medical centers .
