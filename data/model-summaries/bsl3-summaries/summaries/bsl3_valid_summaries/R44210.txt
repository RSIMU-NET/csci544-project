this report analyzes the appellate body decisions in two disputes: u.s. – certain country of origin labeling requirements ( u.s. – cool ) and u.s. – measures concerning the importation , marketing and sale of tuna and tuna products ( u.s. – tuna ii ) .
the world trade organization's ( wto ) agreement on technical barriers to trade ( tbt agreement ) establishes obligations that wto members must adhere to when they impose requirements on a product's characteristics .
in two of these cases , which are still ongoing , the wto found that certain u.s. labeling requirements for food products violated the tbt agreement's nondiscrimination obligations — that is , the measures at issue treated foreign products less favorably than domestic products .
however , in recent years , the united states has faced claims alleging its failure to abide by the terms of the tbt agreement .
to date , relatively few wto disputes have been raised challenging member compliance with the tbt agreement's provisions .
the appellate body reports from these two disputes provide insight into how the wto applies these nondiscrimination provisions , and can provide guidance for congress to consider when enacting future programs that regulate product characteristics .
