that should strengthen its standards for and oversight of states' complaint practices and improve the deterrent effect of enforcement actions , including the use of fines and terminations .
we are also recommending that hcfa improve its management information systems to more completely include complaint investigation results and to be able to more effectively identify and respond to homes with recurring problems .
our work in selected states revealed that , for serious complaints alleging harm to residents , the combination of inadequate state practices and limited hcfa guidance and oversight have often resulted in policies or practices that may limit the number of complaints filed , serious complaints alleging harmful situations not being investigated promptly , and incomplete reporting on nursing homes' compliance history and states' complaint investigation performance .
investigations of complaints filed against nursing homes can provide a valuable opportunity for determining if the health and safety of nursing home residents are threatened .
further , regarding enforcement actions , hcfa has not yet realized its main goal â€” to help ensure that homes maintain compliance with federal health care standards .
the threat of sanctions appeared to have little effect on deterring homes from falling out of compliance because homes could continue to avoid the sanctions' effect as long as they temporarily corrected their deficiencies .
