these it acquisition management control weaknesses include compliance with dod's federated bea not being sufficiently expected costs not being reliably estimated ; earned value management not being adequately implemented ; system requirements not always being effectively managed , although this has recently improved ; key program risks not being effectively managed ; and key system quality measures not being used .
for decades , the department of defense ( dod ) has been challenged in modernizing its timeworn business systems .
however , it has not effectively implemented the process for all identified risks .
however , several important accuracy and credibility practices were not satisfied .
other reasons are that dod has yet to institutionalize key system modernization management controls , and it has not demonstrated the ability to consistently deliver promised system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget .
compounding the estimate's limited accuracy are limitations in its credibility .
to enhance gcss - mc's use of evm , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the navy , through the appropriate chain of command , to ensure that the program office ( 1 ) monitors the actual start and completion dates of work activities performed so that the impact of deviations on downstream scheduled work can be proactively addressed ; ( 2 ) allocates resources , such as labor hours and material , to all key activities on the schedule ; ( 3 ) integrates key activities and supporting tasks and subtasks ; ( 4 ) identifies and allocates the amount of float time needed for key activities to account for potential problems that might occur along or near the schedule's critical path ; ( 5 ) performs a schedule risk analysis to determine the level of confidence in meeting the program's activities and completion date ; ( 6 ) allocates schedule reserve for high - risk activities on the critical path ; and ( 7 ) discloses the inherent risks and limitations associated with any future use of the program's evm reports until the schedule has been risk - adjusted .
