the department of defense ( dod ) currently has ground - based and air - based radars but no capability to track moving targets from space .
given sbr's overall importance to dod and the intelligence community , we reviewed the sbr program to assess dod's progress in attaining the knowledge it needs by 2006 in terms of ( 1 ) requirements and ( 2 ) resources — technology , communications infrastructure , and funding .
in the past several decades , dod's space acquisitions have experienced problems that have driven up costs by hundreds of millions , even billions , of dollars ; have stretched schedules by years ; and have increased performance risks .
strengthen the ongoing study of options for tracking ground - moving targets by ensuring this work includes: ( 1 ) a full range of air and space options ; ( 2 ) measures of effectiveness that would help justify choosing sbr over air options ; and ( 3 ) the possibility of having to rely on tca alternatives for space options .
to meet a need for persistent global observation , dod and the intelligence community are working together to develop the space - based radar ( sbr ) system to find , identify , track , and monitor ground and sea targets — mobile or immobile — under all - weather conditions and on a near - continual basis across large swaths of the earth's surface .
