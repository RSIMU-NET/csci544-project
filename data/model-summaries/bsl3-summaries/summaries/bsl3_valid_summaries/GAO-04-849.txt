as agreed , you asked us to describe ( 1 ) the underlying concerns that have prompted the credit union industry's interest in making changes to the current capital requirements , ( 2 ) the issues associated with the potential use of secondary capital in all federally insured credit unions , and ( 3 ) the issues associated with the potential use of risk - based capital in all federally insured credit unions .
credit unions , which have approximately 82 million members across the united states , historically have occupied a unique niche among depository institutions .
they do not issue capital stock ; rather , they are not - for - profit entities that build capital by retaining earnings .
the changes called for generally include ( 1 ) amending the definition of net worth to include alternative forms of capital , such as unsecured subordinated debt instruments — known as secondary capital instruments ; ( 2 ) moving to risk - based capital standards ; and ( 3 ) some combination of the changes discussed above .
recent debate about and support for changes to the existing capital requirements for credit unions — which establishes the percentage of net worth to total assets that they must maintain — has raised concerns about potential safety and soundness implications .
