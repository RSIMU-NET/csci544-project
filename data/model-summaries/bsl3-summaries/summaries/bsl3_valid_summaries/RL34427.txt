to that end , the fed has been given broad authority over monetary policy and the payments system , including the issuance of federal reserve notes as the national currency .
although the fed has broad authority to independently execute monetary policy on a day - to - day basis , the fed's actions in the crisis have raised fundamental questions about the fed's proper role , and what role congress should play in assessing those issues .
namely , the fed's role in the bear stearns acquisition , the assistance to aig , citigroup , and bank of america , the creation of the primary dealer credit facility ( a sort of discount window for a group of non - member banks ) , and its intervention in the commercial paper market involved emergency authorities that had not been used in more than 70 years .
in a joint announcement in march 2009 , the treasury and fed stated a desire in the long run to transfer assets acquired by the fed ( via the maiden lane llcs ) from bear stearns and the american international group ( aig ) to the treasury , but to date have not taken any steps to do so .
