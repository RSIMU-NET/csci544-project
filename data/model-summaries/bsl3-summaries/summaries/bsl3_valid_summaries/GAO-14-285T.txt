my statement today is based on work on these issues we have completed for the subcommittee since passage of the 2012 act , including ( 1 ) implementing nextgen , ( 2 ) improving aviation safety , particularly with respect to implementing provisions of the 2012 act related to faa's certification processes , and ( 3 ) integrating uas into the nas .
thus , in the 2012 act , the congress directed faa to take various actions to improve the safety and efficiency of the current air traffic control ( atc ) system while transitioning to the next generation air transportation system ( nextgen ) .
in addition , given the potential opportunities afforded by new unmanned aircraft systems ( uas ) , the 2012 act included several provisions with respect to faa safely integrating uas into the national airspace system ( nas ) .
i appreciate the opportunity to testify today on progress made by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) in implementing key provisions of the faa modernization and reform act ( the 2012 act ) .
ongoing improvements to safety , implementation of nextgen , and integration of uas continue to be paramount as congress considers faa's progress to date , and begins to consider the next reauthorization bill .
