the fair housing act ( fha ) was enacted "to provide , within constitutional limitations , for fair housing throughout the united states. .
however , legislation that would amend the fha is routinely introduced in congress , including proposals to extend the act's anti - discrimination provisions to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation , gender identity , marital status , source of income , and status as a military servicemember or veteran ; and to make clear that the act does not support disparate impact discrimination claims .
additionally , the report addresses several specific types of discrimination that have been the source of fair housing litigation , including how the act's proscription on discriminating against families with children interplays with housing communities for older persons ; how the prohibition against discriminating on the basis of sex can provide protections to lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) individuals who are not expressly protected under the act ; and the intersection of local zoning laws , group homes , and the fha's protections against discrimination on the basis of mental and physical disabilities .
the original 1968 act prohibited discrimination on the basis of "race , color , religion , or national origin" in the sale or rental of housing , the financing of housing , or the provision of brokerage services .
