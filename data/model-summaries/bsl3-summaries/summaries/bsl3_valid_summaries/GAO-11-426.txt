to increase the transparency of the new network allocation process , and to ensure that internal control activities are performed and that the resources networks allocate to medical centers are monitored consistently and reliably , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to take the following two actions: require networks to provide rationales for all adjustments made to the allocation amounts proposed by the model in va's resource allocation process ; and develop written policies , consistent with federal internal control standards , to formalize existing practices for monitoring resources networks have allocated to medical centers .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) va's new process for networks to use in determining allocations to medical centers , and ( 2 ) how va centrally monitors resources networks have allocated to medical centers .
the new process involves three steps â€” first , va headquarters proposes medical center allocation amounts to networks using a standardized resource allocation model ; second , network officials review these amounts and can adjust them based on the needs of their medical centers that are not reflected in the initial allocation amounts proposed by headquarters ; and third , after making any adjustments , networks report final medical center allocation amounts to va headquarters in a consistent format .
