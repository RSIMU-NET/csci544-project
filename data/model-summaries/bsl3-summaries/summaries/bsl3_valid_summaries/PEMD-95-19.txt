the second , nutrition monitoring: data serve many purposes ; users recommend improvements ( gao / pemd - 95-15 ) , surveyed users of nutrition monitoring data about how the data are used and what changes are needed to the data collection activities .
this report responds to your request that we identify features of a model nutrition monitoring system and examine approaches to incorporating those features in the national nutrition monitoring and related research program ( nnmrrp ) .
the first , nutrition monitoring: progress in developing a coordinated program ( gao / pemd - 94-23 ) , assessed the nnmrrp's planning activities .
it builds on two earlier reports .
completing our response to the committee's request , this report builds on our earlier work to meet two objectives: ( 1 ) define a model nutrition monitoring program and ( 2 ) compare the current system with potential options for implementing the components of a model program in the nnmrrp .
the literature on the development of objectives to increase accountability for program results indicates that ( 1 ) objectives should be written in terms that can be used to judge progress toward achieving them and ( 2 ) implementation plans and specific measures of progress should be developed for the goals and objectives .
