we focused our work on two key areas: ( 1 ) how well labor's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are not referred to niosh for dose reconstruction but are being processed by labor and ( 2 ) how well labor's and niosh's procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are referred for dose reconstructions .
to determine how well the department of labor's ( labor ) procedures and practices ensure the timely and consistent processing of claims that are not referred to the national institute of occupational safety and health ( niosh ) for dose reconstruction but are being processed by labor , we reviewed labor's regulations , procedures , and practices related to processing claims .
specifically , hhs's advisory board is responsible under the statute for ( 1 ) reviewing a reasonable sample of individual dose reconstructions for scientific validity and quality , ( 2 ) advising on the development of guidelines to determine probability of causation and methods for dose reconstruction , and ( 3 ) reviewing special exposure cohort petitions .
as of january 31 , 2004 , labor had fully processed 83 percent of the nearly 30,000 claims for benefits under subtitle b that had not been referred to niosh for dose reconstruction .
