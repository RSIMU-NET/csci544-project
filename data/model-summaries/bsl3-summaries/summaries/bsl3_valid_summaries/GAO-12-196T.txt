my statement today focuses on initial observations from our ongoing review and examines ( 1 ) the trends in the rate of children receiving ssi benefits due to mental impairments over the past decade ; ( 2 ) the role that medical and nonmedical information , such as medication and school records , play in the initial determination of a child's medical eligibility ; and ( 3 ) the steps ssa has taken to monitor the continued medical eligibility of these children .
administered by the social security administration ( ssa ) , ssi is a nationwide federal assistance program that provides cash benefits to eligible low - income disabled individuals , including children , as well as certain individuals who are aged or blind .
in 2010 , ssa paid almost 8 million recipients about $50 billion in ssi benefits , of which more than $9 billion was paid to about 1.2 million disabled children .
our preliminary research suggests that several factors may have contributed to the increased number of child applicants and beneficiaries , including but not limited to ssa's and child advocates' outreach efforts , improved access to health insurance for children , the rising number of children living in poverty , and increased diagnosis of certain mental impairments .
