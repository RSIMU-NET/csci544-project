economic factors , new technologies , environmental concerns and associated regulatory policies , and other developments are changing the energy sources used to generate electricity in the united states .
this report will refer to the combined generation and transmission systems as the bulk power system , following the definition congress established in epact05: the term "bulk - power system" meansâ ( a ) facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network ( or any portion thereof ) ; and ( b ) electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission system reliability .
one notable change is increased generation from variable renewable energy ( vre ) sources such as wind and solar .
congress required the setting and enforcement of electric reliability standards in the energy policy act of 2005 ( epact05 ; p.l .
according to the u.s. energy information administration ( eia ) , combined generation from wind and solar sources increased from 1% of total electricity generation in 2008 to 9% of total electricity generation in 2018 .
these standards are developed by the north american electric reliability corporation ( nerc ) and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) in the united states .
