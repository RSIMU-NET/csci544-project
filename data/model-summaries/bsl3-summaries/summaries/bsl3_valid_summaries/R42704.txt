new events and changes in military , political , or social conditions can generate debate over who is eligible for various military awards .
requirements for military awards and decorations can change over time .
these changes tend to be controversial , especially with veterans groups .
congress has considered several pieces of legislation that would change who would be eligible to receive the purple heart , and under what conditions .
increasingly acknowledged conditions , such as traumatic brain injuries ( tbi ) and post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , as well as accidents and other events while deployed , bring up new questions as to when a servicemember deserves a purple heart .
although congress has traditionally left many military award requirements to the executive branch , the constitution does allow congress to act in this area , and events have prompted changes regarding eligibility for the purple heart .
on december 19 , 2014 , congress passed the carl levin and howard p. "buck" mckeon national defense authorization act ( ndaa ) for fiscal year 2015 .
the july 17 , 2015 , shooting of servicemembers at a marine recruiting office and a naval reserve center in chattanooga , tn , again prompted questions about applying the purple heart to terrorist attacks versus criminal acts .
