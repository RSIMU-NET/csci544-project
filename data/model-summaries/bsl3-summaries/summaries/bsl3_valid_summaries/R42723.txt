u.s. code , title 10 , section 5063 , united states marine corps: composition and functions , dated october 1 , 1986 , states the following: the marine corps will be organized , trained and equipped to provide an amphibious and land operations capability to seize advanced naval bases and to conduct naval land campaigns .
in response to these questions and the perceived need to examine the post - iraq and afghanistan marine corps , the department of the navy and dod studied the requirement to conduct large - scale amphibious operations and in early 2012 released a strategic vision for how amphibious operations will be conducted in the future .
in this regard , the marines are required by law to have the necessary equipment to conduct amphibious operations and land operations .
another possible congressional concern is to what extent a robust amphibious assault capability is a necessary component of u.s. national security .
if the navy and marine corps decide to adopt expeditionary advance base operations ( eabo ) as an operational concept , it could possibly have implications for the acv program , including the following: at the weapon systems level , would eabo require any changes to the vehicles themselves , such as enhanced survivability , lethality , or command , control , communications , computer , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( c4isr ) features ? .
