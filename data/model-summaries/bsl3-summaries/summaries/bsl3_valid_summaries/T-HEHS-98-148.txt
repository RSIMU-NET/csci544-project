i will discuss ( 1 ) how much federal and state funds states are spending on child care subsidy programs and how they are allocating these resources , ( 2 ) how states are trying to increase the supply of child care to meet the projected demand under welfare reform , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states are changing standards for child care providers in response to the anticipated increased demand under welfare reform .
to better help low - income families meet their child care needs , the congress combined four programs with different target populations into one program — the child care and development block grant ( ccdbg ) — with a single set of eligibility criteria and requirements .
our work is based on case studies of seven states' child care subsidy programs conducted between december 1996 and october 1997 ; information about the child care subsidy programs of all 50 states and the district of columbia , as described in the plans states are required to submit to the department of health and human services ( hhs ) under the personal responsibility act ; and other studies .
this program , now referred to as the child care and development fund ( ccdf ) , provides federal funds to states for child care subsidies for families who are working or preparing for work and who have incomes of up to 85 percent of a state's median income ( smi ) .
