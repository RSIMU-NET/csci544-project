several bills introduced in the 110 th congress would have imposed additional regulations on automated political calls , but would not necessarily apply to all circumstances in which the calls are used .
the calls can therefore play an important role in get - out - the - vote ( gotv ) and voter - education activities .
by contrast , if congress chose to require policy changes , it could add political calls to the do not call list or restrict the timing or number of calls .
some of those options would likely involve difficult questions about which groups and messages are devoted to campaign activities versus policy advocacy .
many of the concerns surrounding automated political calls are not about the calls themselves , but about how those calls are used .
finally , congress could place additional disclosure or disclaimer requirements on political calls .
legislation on the topic has also been introduced in the 111 th congress .
this report focuses on how automated calls are used during campaigns .
specifically , the bills would: ( 1 ) add political calls to the ftc do not call list ; ( 2 ) revise disclosure or disclaimer requirements or otherwise restrict automated political calls ; or ( 3 ) regulate political calls generally , which could include automated calls .
