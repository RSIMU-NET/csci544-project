some members have voiced interest in developing alternatives to current polices ( which expire in 2012 ) and incorporating them in the next omnibus farm bill in the 112 th congress or enacting the policies separately before then .
the financial stress of 2009 and similar episodes over the years have led the industry and congress to reconsider how to handle fluctuations in milk prices and financial prospects for dairy farmers .
in calendar year 2009 , the federal government spent more than $1 billion to support the industry through the milk income loss contract ( milc ) program , the dairy product price support program ( dppsp ) , and the dairy export incentive program ( deip ) .
financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 , brought on largely by sharply lower milk prices , activated standing federal programs to support dairy farmers .
the status quo — that is , continuing programs for price support , direct payments , federal milk marketing orders , export subsidies , import barriers , and periodic ad hoc emergency assistance — is also a potential option .
after appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance , congress granted another $350 million in october 2009 in the form of supplemental payments to dairy farmers and government purchases of dairy products for domestic feeding programs .
