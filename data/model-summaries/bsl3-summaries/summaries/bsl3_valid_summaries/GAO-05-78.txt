specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the results of arkansas coroner investigations of nursing home resident deaths , ( 2 ) the experience of the arkansas state survey agency in investigating suspected cases of resident neglect referred by county coroners , and ( 3 ) whether systemic weaknesses in state and federal nursing home oversight identified in our prior reports were evident in the survey agency's investigations of coroner referrals .
an october 2002 series in the st. louis post dispatch concluded that avoidable deaths of vulnerable nursing home residents was a widespread but rarely investigated problem .
the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , the federal agency responsible for managing medicare and medicaid , contracts with survey agencies in every state to oversee the quality of nursing home care .
the series spotlighted an arkansas law requiring investigations by county officials , such as coroners , of all nursing home deaths .
our subsequent reports on nursing home quality continued to demonstrate that ( 1 ) an unacceptably large proportion of nursing homes — one - fifth as of early 2002 — harmed residents and ( 2 ) states' periodic inspections of nursing homes failed to identify all serious deficiencies , such as preventable weight loss and pressure sores .
