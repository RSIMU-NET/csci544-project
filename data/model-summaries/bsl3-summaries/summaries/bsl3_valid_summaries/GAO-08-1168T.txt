we made several recommendations aimed at restoring epa's independence .
in this context , my testimony today discusses ( 1 ) highlights of our march 2008 report , chemical assessments: low productivity and new interagency review process limit the usefulness and credibility of epa's integrated risk information system , ( 2 ) key aspects of epa's revised iris assessment process , released on april 10 , 2008 , and ( 3 ) progress epa has made in completing assessments in fiscal year 2008 .
for our march 2008 report , we examined the outcome of steps epa has taken to ensure that iris contains current , credible chemical risk information ; to address the backlog of ongoing assessments ; and to respond to new requirements from the office of management and budget ( omb ) .
these additional process steps , which would have lengthened assessment times considerably , include giving federal agencies and the public 45 days to identify additional information on a chemical for epa's consideration in its assessment or to correct any errors on an additional assessment draft that would provide qualitative information ; giving potentially affected federal agencies 30 days to review the public comments epa received and initiate a meeting with epa if they want to discuss a particular set of comments ; allowing potentially affected federal agencies to have assessments suspended for up to 18 months to fill a data gap or eliminate an uncertainty factor that epa plans to use in its assessment ; and allowing other federal agencies to weigh in on ( 1 ) the level of independent peer review that would be sought ( that is , whether the peer reviews would be conducted by epa science advisory board panels , national academies' panels , or panels organized by an epa contractor ) ; ( 2 ) the areas of scientific expertise needed on the panel ; and ( 3 ) the scope of the peer reviews and the specific issues they would address .
