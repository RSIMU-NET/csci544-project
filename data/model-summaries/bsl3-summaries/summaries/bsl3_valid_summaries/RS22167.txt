in august 2002 , after federal agents seized and destroyed the respondent's medicinal marijuana plants , suit was brought in the northern district of california seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief against the u.s. attorney general preventing the prosecution of medicinal users pursuant to the csa .
the dispute in gonzales v. raich involved a conflict between california's compassionate use act and the federal controlled substances act ( csa ) .
moreover , the court held that california's state law permitting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes cannot be the basis for placing the respondent's class of activity beyond the reach of the federal government , due to the supremacy clause , which requires that , in the event of a conflict between state and federal law , the federal law shall prevail .
wickard stands for the proposition that congress can rationally combine the effects that an individual producer has on an interstate market to find substantial impacts on interstate commerce .
in reaching its conclusions , the court relied heavily on its 1942 decision in wickard v. filburn , which held that the agricultural adjustment act's federal quota system applied to bushels of wheat that were homegrown and personally consumed .
