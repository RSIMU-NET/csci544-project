to assist dod and congress in their oversight of dod's alternatively financed energy projects , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the military services to collect complete and accurate data on their alternatively financed energy projects , including data on the services' financial obligations and cost savings , and provide the data to dod at least annually to aid departmental oversight .
to help ensure that the military departments conduct the level of assessment required to assure the performance of their uesc projects over the life of the contract , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the office of the assistant secretary of defense ( energy , installations and environment ) to update its guidance to clarify the requirements for the verification of savings for uesc projects .
without updated and clear guidance on how the military departments should be taking steps to verify savings associated with uesc projects to validate project performance , the military services will likely continue to interpret dod guidance differently and are likely to take inconsistent approaches to assuring the performance of uesc projects , which could limit dod's visibility over projects that commit the departments to long - term payments .
