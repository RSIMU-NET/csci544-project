today , my testimony will focus on our preliminary observations related to ( 1 ) how vha used miscellaneous obligations during fiscal year 2007 , and ( 2 ) whether va's policies and procedures are designed to provide adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations .
we also used relevant sections of the federal acquisition regulations ( far ) ; va's acquisition regulations ; appropriation law ; and gao's standards for internal control in the federal government in assessing the design of va's policies and procedures , and we met with va and vha officials in washington , d.c. , and coordinated with vha's office of inspector general staff to identify any previous audit findings relevant to our audit work .
according to the department of veterans' affairs ( va ) policy , miscellaneous obligations can be used to record estimated obligations to facilitate the procurement of a variety of goods and services , including fee - based medical and nursing services ; beneficiary travel ; and for other purposes .
in addition , va's office of inspector general ( oig ) issued a report in may 2007 on the alleged mismanagement of funds at the va boston healthcare system .
