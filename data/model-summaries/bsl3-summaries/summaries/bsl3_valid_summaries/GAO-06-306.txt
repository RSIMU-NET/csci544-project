our objectives were to determine whether ( 1 ) fbi's internal controls provided reasonable assurance that payment of unallowable contractor costs would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business , ( 2 ) fbi's payments to contractors were properly supported as a valid use of government funds , and ( 3 ) fbi maintained proper accountability for assets purchased with trilogy project funds .
we are making the following 27 recommendations to the director of fbi and the administrator of general services to ( 1 ) facilitate the effective management of interagency contracting , ( 2 ) mitigate the risks of paying unallowable costs in connection with cost - reimbursement type contracts , and ( 3 ) improve fbi's accountability for and safeguarding of its computer equipment .
for several years congress recognized that the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) information technology ( it ) systems were archaic and inadequate for efficiently and effectively investigating criminal cases .
we also reviewed fbi policy and procedure manuals ; applicable federal regulations , including the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , federal travel regulation , and joint travel regulations ( jtr ) ; prior gao and doj oig reports on trilogy issues ; trilogy contract documents and interagency agreements ; contractor invoices ; and other documentation supporting goods provided and services rendered .
