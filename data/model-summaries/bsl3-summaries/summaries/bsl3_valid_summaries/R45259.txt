authorizes the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) to regulate underground injection activities to protect underground sources of drinking water , including injection wells used for aquifer recharge .
g roundwater , the water in aquifers accessible by wells , is a critical component of the u.s. water supply .
in recent years , congressional interest in groundwater has generally been in three major areas aquifer storage , recharge , and recovery ; groundwater rights ( including among other things , groundwater / surface water interaction and federal reserved water rights ) ; and groundwater supply monitoring and assessment .
it serves as a water source for domestic use and as irrigation water for agriculture , and it is used in mining , oil and gas development , industrial processes , livestock , and thermoelectric power , among other uses .
in recent congresses , some members have introduced legislation that could affect how groundwater resources may be managed to better ensure a sufficient and reliable supply , and several such bills ( or portions of such bills ) have been enacted into law .
how each state manages its groundwater resources differs and depends on a mix of common law emerging from the 19 th century , state law , court decisions , water settlements , and , to a lesser extent , federal law .
