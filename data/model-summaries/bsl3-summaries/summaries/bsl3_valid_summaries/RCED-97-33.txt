since 1993 , the department of energy has spent over $609 million to provide benefits to contractor employees separated in workforce restructuring and downsizing efforts at its facilities .
since these early efforts , energy has taken steps to improve its ability to retain critically needed skills .
as of november 1996 , a total of 35 workforce restructuring plans either had been approved or were in draft form .
the report concluded that energy did not ( 1 ) require the contractor to perform the skills analysis necessary to identify which employees were needed to perform the current mission and ( 2 ) effectively monitor the contractor's restructuring efforts .
brought on by the end of the cold war , this downsizing has been carried out using the benefits provided by section 3161 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 , which requires energy to develop plans for minimizing the impact of downsizing on the workforce at affected facilities .
in addition , given energy's limited oversight of the implementation of restructuring plans , problems with excessive costs or inappropriate benefits , such as those identified by audit organizations , could occur in future restructurings .
