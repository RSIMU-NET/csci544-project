a presidential “disaster declaration” authorizes federal assistance in the affected state ( s ) ; fema determines which counties within the state will receive assistance and the type ( s ) of assistance .
specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine if fema's and sba's disaster declaration policies and procedures differ for requests for rural , as compared with urban , areas ; ( 2 ) compare the length of time taken for each agency to respond to requests for rural and for urban areas ; ( 3 ) compare the proportion of requests for rural areas that were granted with the corresponding proportion for urban areas ; and ( 4 ) perform a limited number of case studies to identify factors that influence the length of time taken for the disaster declaration process .
assistance from the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and / or the small business administration ( sba ) may be provided if requested by state governors .
our report noted that ( 1 ) in cases of requests for a presidential disaster declaration , fema determines which counties within a declared state will receive assistance and ( 2 ) in the absence of a presidential declaration , the sba administrator may declare that counties struck by disasters are eligible to receive some types of sba assistance .
