tradoc's lessons learned program has two primary weaknesses that hamper its effectiveness .
the army assesses the performance of units during their rotations at the combat training centers , identifies the lessons learned from their battlefield experience , and disseminates this information so that training and doctrine can be modified to avoid repeating the same mistakes during training exercises .
in spite of the plan , these problems were not completely resolved .
as requested , we determined whether the army has an effective program for using these lessons learned to correct the problems identified at the training centers .
we found that the army has more aggressively implemented the 1990 plan , and recent data shows improvements in fratricide - related problems since that time .
we disagree that the informal approach has been effective .
a key reason for this is that no feedback mechanisms exist to provide information on the impact of the schools' training and doctrinal revisions — that is , whether they succeeded or failed in correcting the identified deficiencies .
training center data reported in october 1992 — 4 years later — showed that similar deficiencies remained .
second , tradoc lacks formal follow - up procedures for tracking the use of lessons learned and holding the schools accountable for correcting deficiencies .
