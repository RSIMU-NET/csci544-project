proponents of chemical disclosure laws maintain that public disclosure of the chemicals used in each well would allow for health professionals to better respond to medical emergencies involving human exposure to the chemicals ; assist researchers in conducting health studies on shale gas production ; and permit regulators and others to perform baseline testing of water sources to track potential groundwater contamination if it occurs .
hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to free oil and natural gas trapped underground in low - permeability rock formations by pumping a fracturing fluid under high pressure in order to crack the formations .
1084 and s. 587 , the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act ( frac act ) , would have created more broadly applicable disclosure requirements for parties engaged in hydraulic fracturing .
this report provides an overview of current and proposed laws and regulations at the state and federal levels that require the disclosure of the chemicals added to the fluid used in hydraulic fracturing .
states update their laws on fracturing chemical disclosure frequently , and thus this section is designed to show trends in how states structure these provisions rather than to describe the current status of the law in any particular state .
