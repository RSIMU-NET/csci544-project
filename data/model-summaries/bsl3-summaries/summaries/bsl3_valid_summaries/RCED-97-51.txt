specifically , you asked us to determine to what extent ( 1 ) the schedule estimate for stars is attainable and ( 2 ) cost estimates to make stars operational are likely to change .
we met with faa officials , including the ipt leader for terminal air traffic systems development ; the program director for national airspace system transition and implementation ; and representatives of faa's air traffic and airway facilities services .
the federal aviation administration ( faa ) oversees the largest , busiest , and most complex air traffic control system in the world .
since the early 1980s , faa's modernization efforts have experienced lengthy schedule delays and substantial cost overruns .
faa officials estimate that the agency will incur at least $18 million in costs to get the first 46 tracons and related facilities ready to accept the stars equipment .
faa has yet to obtain commitment from all key stakeholders responsible for ensuring that stars equipment is properly installed .
faa is aware that these issues pose a risk for stars and has begun several risk mitigation initiatives .
