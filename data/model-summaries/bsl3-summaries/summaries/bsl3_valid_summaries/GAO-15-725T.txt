examples of these weaknesses include: ( 1 ) granting users access permissions that exceed the level required to perform their legitimate job - related functions ; ( 2 ) not ensuring that only authorized users can access an agency's systems ; ( 3 ) not using encryption to protect sensitive data from being intercepted and compromised ; ( 4 ) not updating software with the current versions and latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities ; and ( 5 ) not ensuring employees were trained commensurate with their responsibilities .
my statement today will discuss ( 1 ) cybersecurity challenges that federal agencies face in securing their systems and information and ( 2 ) government - wide initiatives , including those led by dhs , aimed at improving agencies' cybersecurity .
dhs has implemented this recommendation .
as you know , the federal government faces an array of cyber - based threats to its systems and data , as illustrated by the recently reported data breaches at the office of personnel management ( opm ) , which affected millions of current and former federal employees .
these control categories are ( 1 ) limiting , preventing , and detecting inappropriate access to computer resources ; ( 2 ) managing the configuration of software and hardware ; ( 3 ) segregating duties to ensure that a single individual does not have control over all key aspects of a computer - related operation ; ( 4 ) planning for continuity of operations in the event of a disaster or disruption ; and ( 5 ) implementing agency - wide security management programs that are critical to identifying control deficiencies , resolving problems , and managing risks on an ongoing basis .
