to help mitigate vulnerabilities in mobile devices , we recommend that the chairman of the federal communications commission continue to work with wireless carriers and device manufacturers on implementing cybersecurity best practices by encouraging them to implement a complete industry baseline of mobile security safeguards based on commonly accepted security features and practices ; and monitor progress of wireless carriers and device manufacturers in achieving their milestones and time frames once an industry baseline of mobile security safeguards has been implemented .
the objectives of our review were to determine: ( 1 ) what common security threats and vulnerabilities currently exist in mobile devices , ( 2 ) what security features are currently available and what practices have been identified to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities , and ( 3 ) the extent to which government and private entities are addressing security vulnerabilities of mobile devices .
