to meet these objectives , we examined federal agency data and reports since 2009 , including fema's inventory and evaluation of public - alerting systems ; the ipaws program management plan ; nationwide eas test data and preliminary reports ; and various agency orders and rules .
specifically , the report examines ( 1 ) how the capabilities of the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) have changed since 2009 and what barriers , if any , are affecting its implementation and ( 2 ) the results of the nationwide eas test and federal efforts under way to address identified weaknesses .
the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) within dhs is responsible for modernizing eas and implementing the integrated public alert and warning system ( ipaws ) , which is intended to integrate eas and other public - alerting systems into a larger network to form a comprehensive public - alerting system .
specifically , we examined fcc's and fema's preliminary reports on the nationwide eas test results ; fcc orders and rules on eas ; fcc's website on the nationwide eas test ; fema's eas best practices guide ; and briefing documents from fema and noaa .
