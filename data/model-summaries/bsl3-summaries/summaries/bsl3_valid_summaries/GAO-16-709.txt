to help ensure that the corps and fema carry out the national levee - safety - related activities required in the water resources reform and development act of 2014 , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to direct the chief of engineers and commanding general of the u.s. army corps of engineers and that the secretary of homeland security direct the fema administrator to develop a plan , with milestones , for implementing these activities , using existing resources or requesting additional resources as needed .
to examine the progress that the corp and fema have made in carrying out key national levee - safety - related activities under the water resources reform and development act of 2014 , we reviewed pertinent federal laws and executive orders , including the water resources reform and development act of 2014 ; the water resources development act of 2007 ; the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ; executive order 11988 , floodplain management ; and executive order 13690 , establishing a federal flood risk management standard and a process for further soliciting and considering stakeholder input .
more specifically , the committee stated that all federal programs that significantly impact governmental and individual decision making in leveed areas must be aligned toward ( 1 ) the goal of reliable levees , ( 2 ) an informed and involved public , ( 3 ) shared responsibility for the protection of human life , and ( 4 ) mitigation of public and private economic damages .
