to better understand the implications of moving to the new strategy , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine whether irs has identified the expected benefits of cade 2 and set targets for measuring success , ( 2 ) examine the estimated costs of the program and assess irs's process for developing them , and ( 3 ) assess irs's process for managing the risks associated with cade 2 and describe the risks irs has identified using this process .
we recommend that the commissioner of internal revenue direct the appropriate officials to take the following five actions: to provide a better basis for measuring cade 2 performance in achieving ts1 benefits , set the remaining quantitative targets where feasible as soon as possible in 2011 ; in conjunction with developing the approach for ts2 expected in may 2011 , finalize the phase's expected benefits , set quantitative targets where feasible , and identify how related systems and business processes might be affected ; and to ensure the revised estimates for cade 2 are credible , include inflation when calculating costs , include the costs irs explicitly excluded or provide a rationale for excluding them , and include any business costs associated with moving to daily processing or document that these costs were excluded and provide a rationale for excluding them .
