fmcsa currently posts most of the scores publicly on its website for use by industry stakeholders and the public.fmcsa has indicated that a future rulemaking will include some of the information used to calculate sms scores to help determine a carrier's overall fitness to operate motor vehicles .
fmcsa's oversight program — the compliance , safety , accountability ( csa ) program — is based on the safety measurement system ( sms ) , a data - driven approach for identifying motor carriers at risk of presenting a safety hazard or causing a crash .
fmcsa agreed with our recommendations .
among these activities are new entrant safety audits and identification , or vetting , of “chameleon” carriers — motor carriers that have registered and been operating illegally in interstate commerce by using a new identity in an effort to disguise their former identity and evade enforcement actions issued against them by fmcsa .
fmcsa has taken actions to address our recommendations related to the vetting of chameleon carriers ; however , it has not taken action to address our recommendations to better account for limitations in the csa program .
fmcsa's primary mission of reducing crashes , injuries , and fatalities involving large trucks and buses is critical to the safety of our nation's highways .
