we recommend that the secretary of labor take the following eight actions: in order to ensure the quality and consistency of the whistleblower program and to ensure that osha has reliable information to use to monitor the program , we recommend that the secretary of labor direct the assistant secretary of osha to take the following actions: ensure that its new information system for tracking whistleblower complaints includes information on cases that are screened - out before they are investigated and the reasons for being screened - out .
audit guidance is unclear .
fully implementing the new standardized training on the complex issues that investigators confront and establishing minimum standards for the equipment they need are important first steps in helping ensure the program meets its goals .
