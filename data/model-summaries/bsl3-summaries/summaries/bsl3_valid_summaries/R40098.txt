since the 107 th congress , one of the dominant cwa issues has been water infrastructure financing — that is , extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects .
these include a general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the house and the senate ; and a lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues ( neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation ) .
since then , no comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced , but beginning in the 106 th congress , a number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues in the law have been enacted — especially , legislation to reauthorize several existing cwa programs .
as in the 2009 economic recovery legislation and the fy2010 regular appropriations , the president's budget requested that states use 20% of their capitalization grants for "green infrastructure" projects and also use 30% of assistance in the form of additional subsidization ( such as loan forgiveness ) to communities that face difficulties in paying for infrastructure projects .
