it focuses specifically on the district of columbia school system's use of an areawide utility contract for gas and energy management services between the general services administration ( gsa ) and the washington gas light company ( washington gas ) to renovate the schools .
unless actions are taken to improve controls over the actions remaining under the washington gas contract and procurement planning for future school renovation contracts , the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to fix the schools — including the $10.2 million in outstanding orders under the washington gas contract — will remain at risk to the same problems .
the district was faced with a substantial amount of deferred maintenance , which contributed to safety problems such as fire code violations and leaky roofs .
to identify the review process for using the washington gas contract , we reviewed the district of columbia code ; title 27 of the district of columbia's municipal regulations ; and policies and procedures issued by the office of contracting and procurement and dcps .
by mid - 1997 , the condition of the district of columbia's public schools had reached crisis proportions .
most of the schools were over 50 years old and had not been well - maintained .
