on june 6 , 2006 , the eu - 3 , russia , china , and the united states ( p - 5 + 1 ) offered iran a new negotiating proposal , which included incentives such as affirming iran's inalienable right to peaceful nuclear energy , assistance in building state - of - the - art light water reactors for iran , fuel supply guarantees , dismissing u.n. security council consideration of iran's npt noncompliance , wto membership , and an end to certain u.s. sanctions to allow iran to purchase agriculture appliances and boeing aircraft parts .
in 2002 , the national council of resistance of iran ( ncr ) helped expose iran's undeclared nuclear activities by providing information about nuclear sites at natanz ( uranium enrichment ) and arak ( heavy water production ) .
the p - 5 discussed sanctions through the fall , and the security council ultimately adopted unscr 1737 on december 23 , 2006 , which requires states to prevent the supply , sale or transfer of equipment and technology that could contribute to enrichment - , reprocessing - , heavy - water - related activities , or missile delivery systems in iran and to freeze the funds of persons and entities involved in the nuclear and ballistic missile programs .
