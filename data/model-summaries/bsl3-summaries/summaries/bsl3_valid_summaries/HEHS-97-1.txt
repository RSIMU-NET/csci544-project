in recent years , the social security administration ( ssa ) has had difficulty ensuring that people receiving disability benefits under the disability insurance ( di ) program are eligible for benefits .
such management includes ( 1 ) monitoring the disability status of all beneficiaries to help ensure program integrity and ( 2 ) helping as many beneficiaries as possible to become self - sufficient by determining their vocational rehabilitation ( vr ) service needs and providing them assistance to enter or reenter the workforce .
ssa is required by law to conduct periodic examinations , called continuing disability reviews ( cdr ) , to determine whether a beneficiary has medically improved to the extent that the person is no longer considered disabled .
information is included about databases used in estimating for the di and ssi programs the number of beneficiaries due or overdue for a cdr in fiscal year 1996 and analyzing their characteristics .
time - limiting disability benefits has been proposed as a way to reduce beneficiaries' dependence on cash benefits by removing them from the rolls after set periods of time .
to enable as many disabled individuals as possible to become self - sufficient , ssa should test the use of cdr contacts with beneficiaries to determine individuals' rehabilitation service needs and help them obtain the services and employment assistance they need to enter or reenter the workforce .
