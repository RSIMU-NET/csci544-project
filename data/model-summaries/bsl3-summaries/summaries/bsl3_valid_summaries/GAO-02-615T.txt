my testimony today will focus on three key issues: ( 1 ) the extent of caseload decline since welfare reform was implemented and the status of families who have left welfare , ( 2 ) the extent to which states are spending tanf and moe funds for cash assistance and noncash services and how this compares to welfare spending in fiscal year 1995 , and ( 3 ) the extent to which states are using tanf and moe funds to provide services to low - income families not included in the welfare caseload reported by states to hhs .
it ended the federal entitlement to assistance for eligible needy families with children under aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) and created the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , designed to help needy families reduce their dependence on welfare and move toward economic independence .
the tanf block grant , which is administered by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , makes $16.5 billion available to states each year , regardless of changes in the number of people receiving benefits .
first , many states have increased spending to engage more welfare families in work or work - related activities and to provide more intensive services for some of these families .
