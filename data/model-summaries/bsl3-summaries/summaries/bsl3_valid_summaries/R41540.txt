this report discusses the fed's actions to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing from september 2008 to the announcement of a further round of quantitative easing in november 2010 ( popularly referred to as qe2 ) .
congress has given the fed a statutory mandate to "promote effectively the goals of maximum employment , stable prices , and moderate long - term interest rates," and the fed has made the case that quantitative easing can help it to fulfill its mandate .
this announcement followed purchases of $300 billion of treasury securities , $175 billion of agency debt , and $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage - backed securities ( mbs ) since march 2009 .
