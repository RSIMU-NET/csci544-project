the most common use of phthalates is to increase the flexibility of polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) and polyvinylidene chloride ( pvdc ) polymers .
"phthalates" refers to a group of chemical compounds that are heavily produced and widely used to make the plastics found in thousands of consumer products .
the scientific basis for concerns about risks to human health appears to be strong in the case of some phthalates , adequate with respect to others , and weak for the remaining chemicals .
recent interest by governmental bodies , including congress , in the potential adverse human health effects that might be related to phthalate exposure has focused on six phthalates that are produced and used in very large quantities .
given the lack of legal authority to require testing for a chemical proposed for most uses , and the cost of testing , new formulations of products might pose either more or less risk than the current formulations .
the six phthalates are di - ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) , dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , benzyl butyl phthalate ( bbp ) , diisononyl phthalate ( dinp ) , diisodecyl phthalate ( didp ) , and di - n - octyl phthalate ( dnop ) .
