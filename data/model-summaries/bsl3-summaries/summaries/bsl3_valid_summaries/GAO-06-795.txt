to help improve tsa's management of eds and etd maintenance costs and strengthen oversight of contract performance , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security instruct the assistant secretary , transportation security administration , to take the following three actions: establish a timeline to complete its evaluation and close out the boeing contract and report to congressional appropriations committees on its actions , including any necessary analysis , to address the department of homeland security office of inspector general's recommendation to recover any excessive fees awarded to boeing service company ; establish a timeline for completing life - cycle cost models for eds , which tsa recently began ; and revise policies and procedures to require documentation of the monitoring of eds and etd maintenance contracts to provide reasonable assurance that contractor maintenance cost data and performance data are recorded and reported in accordance with tsa contractual requirements and self - reported contractor mean downtime data are valid , reliable , and justify the full payment of the contract amount .
to meet this requirement , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) deployed two types of equipment to screen checked baggage for explosives: ( 1 ) explosive detection systems ( eds ) that use specialized x - rays to detect characteristics of explosives that may be contained in baggage as it moves along a conveyor belt and ( 2 ) explosive trace detection ( etd ) machines , whereby an individual ( i.e. , a baggage screener , or transportation security officer ) swabs baggage and then inserts the swab into the etd machine , which in turn can detect chemical residues that may indicate the presence of explosives within a bag .
