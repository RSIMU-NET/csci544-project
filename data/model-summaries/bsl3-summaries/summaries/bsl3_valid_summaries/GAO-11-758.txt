as congress looks toward potentially reauthorizing the tanf program in 2012 , you asked us to address ( 1 ) how tribal tanf programs have changed since 2002 , especially in light of changing economic conditions ; ( 2 ) the challenges tribes face in administering their own tanf programs and what tribes have done to address them ; and ( 3 ) the extent to which the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) has provided guidance and oversight to promote the integrity and effectiveness of tribal tanf programs .
for example , hhs could consider more effective ways to provide training to tribes on how new guidance or policy decisions will affect the administration of their programs , and consistently update its web site to provide information on related tribal tanf technical assistance and training .
further , more prompt , consistent collection and review of all tribal tanf - related single audit report findings and work participation rate , caseload , and financial data , could help hhs to more effectively monitor tribal tanf programs and determine how it could better target its technical assistance and guidance to address areas where tribes may be having difficulty .
