my remarks today will focus on sba's ( 1 ) response to the september 11 terrorist attacks ; ( 2 ) performance plans and measures for its disaster loan program ; and ( 3 ) loan asset sales program , which involves selling disaster and other loans .
my comments are based on our recent reports on sba's disaster loan program ( small business administration: response to september 11 victims and performance measure for disaster lending , gao - 03-385 , jan. 29 , 2003 ) and loan asset sales program ( small business administration: accounting anomalies and limited operational data make results of loan sales uncertain , gao - 03-87 , jan. 3 , 2003 ) .
i am pleased to be with you today at this roundtable to discuss the role of the small business administration's ( sba ) disaster loan program in responding to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , general performance measures for the program , and the effects of sba's program to sell loans to private investors on disaster loans and their borrowers .
in reviewing sba's loan sales program , which includes disaster loans , we identified three areas needing improvement: tracking borrower inquiries and complaints ; sales budgeting and accounting , which affect the reliability of sba financial statements and budget information ; and reporting on the operational benefits of the loan sales .
