in this report , we evaluated program progress towards ( 1 ) achieving cost and performance goals ; ( 2 ) meeting schedule targets ; and ( 3 ) obtaining critical manufacturing knowledge prior to the low - rate production decision .
given that the kc - 46 program has encountered significant delays to the start of development test and the schedule moving forward remains risky , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the air force to ensure that key aerial refueling capabilities are demonstrated prior to the low - rate production decision .
the kc - 46 tanker modernization program , valued at $49 billion , is among the air force's highest acquisition priorities and is intended to provide aerial refueling to air force , navy , marine corps , and allied aircraft .
that analysis has not yet been completed .
it recently completed its fourth year of a planned seven - year development program to convert an aircraft designed for commercial use into an aerial refueling tanker .
this knowledge is based on practices we identified in previous work that are used by leading commercial companies , including ( 1 ) identifying key system characteristics and critical manufacturing processes ; ( 2 ) establishing a reliability growth plan and goals ; ( 3 ) conducting failure modes and effects analysis ; ( 4 ) conducting reliability growth testing ; ( 5 ) determining whether processes are in control and capable ; and ( 6 ) testing a production - representative prototype in its intended environment .
