congress created the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) to protect homeowners from flood losses , minimize the exposure of properties to flood damage , and alleviate taxpayers' exposure to flood losses .
severe repetitive loss refers to an nfip - insured structure that has incurred flood - related damage for which ( a ) four or more separate claims have been paid that exceeded $5,000 each and cumulatively exceeded $20,000 ; or ( b ) at least two separate claim payments have been made under such coverage , with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the fair market value of the insured structure .
