to enhance opportunities for increased benefits from the fedstate program we recommend that you develop and monitor , in conjunction with the states , implementation of a strategic framework that links fedstate project objectives to irs and state mission objectives ; and establish performance goals and ways to monitor and assess program results .
our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify the potential benefits of fedstate cooperative efforts ; ( 2 ) determine what , if any , conditions may impede the success of the program ; and ( 3 ) determine what , if any , fedstate program concerns the states have with irs' planned reorganization .
consequently , cooperation between the internal revenue service ( irs ) and state tax agencies offers opportunities for helping to achieve irs' strategic goals of increasing taxpayers' compliance with tax laws , improving taxpayer service , reducing burden on taxpayers , and increasing the efficiency of tax administration .
no action has been taken yet .
further , irs has not developed performance goals for the fedstate program and has not collected data on most programs to monitor or assess program progress and results .
