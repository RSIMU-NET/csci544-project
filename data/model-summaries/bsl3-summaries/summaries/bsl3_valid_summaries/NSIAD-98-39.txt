among its general mission responsibilities , the office of management and budget ( omb ) is to evaluate the effectiveness of agency programs , policies , and procedures ; assess competing funding demands among agencies ; set funding priorities ; and develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms .
specifically , we ( 1 ) identified federal funding for unclassified programs and activities to combat terrorism ; ( 2 ) determined whether any agency or entity has been designated to coordinate budget proposals , establish priorities , manage funding requirements , and help ensure the efficient allocation of federal resources for combating terrorism across federal agencies ; ( 3 ) explored opportunities for agencies to expand coordination of terrorism - related programs and activities under the government performance and results act principles and framework ; and ( 4 ) assessed issues concerning the reimbursement of support provided to agencies with lead counterterrorism responsibilities .
these efforts have shown that coordinating crosscutting programs takes time and sustained attention and , because of the statutory bases of crosscutting programs , may require congressional involvement to integrate the federal response to national needs .
we recommend that consistent with the responsibility for coordinating efforts to combat terrorism , the assistant to the president for national security affairs , nsc , in consultation with the director , omb , and the heads of other executive branch agencies , take steps to ensure that ( 1 ) governmentwide priorities to implement the national counterterrorism policy and strategy are established ; ( 2 ) agencies' programs , projects , activities , and requirements for combating terrorism are analyzed in relation to established governmentwide priorities ; and ( 3 ) resources are allocated based on the established priorities and assessments of the threat and risk of terrorist attack .
