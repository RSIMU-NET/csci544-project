on the basis of our research objectives , we obtained information on fee amounts paid by sponsors and participants for services , examined challenges sponsors faced in understanding how fees are charged , and identified actions the department of labor ( labor ) has taken to help sponsors understand and monitor fees .
for example , brightscope recently estimated that the average fees paid by plans with less than $10 million in assets for all recordkeeping , advice , and investment management services was 1.90 percent and 1.08 percent for plans with over $100 million in assets .
we interviewed labor , sec , and internal revenue service ( irs ) officials ; industry experts ; plan sponsors ; and service providers about factors that affect the amount of 401 ( k ) fees that can be charged to sponsors and participants as well as current and proposed regulations and the requirements governing the disclosure of fee information .
as american workers have increasingly come to rely on their 401 ( k ) plans for retirement income , policymakers have focused their attention on the fees charged to the plan sponsor — typically the employer offering the plan — and plan participants .
