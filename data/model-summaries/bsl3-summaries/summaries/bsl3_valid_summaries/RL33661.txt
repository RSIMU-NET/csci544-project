proponents of the labor shortage scenario assert that the nation's rate of economic ( output ) growth will slow because worker - starved u.s. firms would be unable to produce the quantity of goods and services demanded by u.s. consumers .
concern about this possibility waned when the historically low unemployment rates from 1998 to 2000 rose during , and for some two years after , the march - november 2001 recession .
this suggests the presence of tight labor market conditions that are related to long - running demographic trends .
in 2007 , however , the national unemployment rate averaged just 4.6% .
even if businesses were able to coax more individuals into the u.s. labor force by bidding up wages , it is claimed that a similar end - result could occur .
u.s. employers again have turned their attention to the shortage of labor they anticipate will occur in the not - too - distant future .
the scenario similarly does not consider that congress might take legislative action to mitigate the effect on the private economy of a perceived shortfall of workers â€” something it has done in the recent past ( e.g. , loosening and raising the cap on h - 1b visas for foreign workers in professional occupations ) .
