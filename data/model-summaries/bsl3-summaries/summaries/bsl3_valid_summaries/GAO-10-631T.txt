my testimony today will revisit and update the challenges we identified in previous reports , specifically ( 1 ) nfip's financial challenges , ( 2 ) fema's operational and management challenges relating to nfip , and ( 3 ) actions needed to address these challenges .
gao placed nfip on its high - risk list in march 2006 , not only because of the program's potential to incur billions of dollars in losses and the many financial challenges it faces , but also because of operational and management challenges within fema , many of which we have identified in previous reports to congress .
for example , as we have pointed out in previous reports , nfip provides subsidized and grandfathered rates that do not reflect the full risk of potential flood losses to some property owners , operates in part with unreliable and incomplete data on flood risks that make it difficult to set accurate rates , and has not been able to overcome the challenge of repetitive loss properties .
as of april 2010 , nfip owed approximately $18.8 billion to the u.s. treasury , primarily as a result of loans the program received to pay claims from the 2005 hurricane season .
