for much of u.s. history , alcohol excise taxes have served as one means to help fund emergency levels of spending ( such as during wartime ) and to reduce rising budget deficits ( such as in 1990 ) .
the modern - day interest in alcohol taxes is broad , with arguments presented to either raise or decrease current alcohol excise tax rates .
the federal government levies an excise tax , at the manufacturer and importer level , based on the per unit production or importation of alcoholic beverages ( e.g. , distilled spirits , wine , and beer ) for sale in the u.s. market .
in economic terms , a manufacturer or importer's effective tax rate is increased by less than the full magnitude of the tax because they can reduce the amount of their income that is subject to tax ( assuming they have income to tax ) .
alcohol excise taxes in the united states have a history almost as old as the federal government itself , as alcohol taxes were among some of the first federal revenue sources in the early republic .
various approaches could be taken , such as follows: increasing excise taxes could serve as a source of revenue as part of a larger budget deficit reduction package or as an offset , reducing excise taxes could benefit firms in the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry , or increasing excise taxes could discourage the negative spillover effects associated with alcohol consumption ( health , safety , crime , etc. ) .
