to prepare this statement , we relied on our previously published work on ntis ; related updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation , overlap , and duplication in the federal government ; and a review of legislation pertaining to ntis's role .
we found that for fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2011 , ntis had net earned revenues from all its functions ( products and services ) for 8 of these 11 years .
this information largely takes the form of research reports acquired from federal agencies and their contractors and grantees , as well as from other domestic and foreign sources .
however , the increasing availability of the information that ntis collects and disseminates — primarily through the web — has called the service's basic statutory function into question .
as we noted , ntis's revenues were generated exclusively from its products and services , and all its revenues , expenses , and capital expenditures were deposited into and paid out of its revolving fund .
our study also found that , during the period from fiscal year 1990 through 2011 , the majority of reports added to ntis's repository were older ; however , the demand for more recent reports was greater: from fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 2011 , most of the additions to ntis's repository were reports published in the year 2000 or before .
