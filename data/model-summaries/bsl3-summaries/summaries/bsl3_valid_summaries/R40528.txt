pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , the red sea , and the waters far off somalia's eastern coast , including the arabian sea , have been attributed to somali pirates .
2647 would have required the secretary of defense to embark military personnel on board u.s. - flagged vessels carrying cargos owned by the u.s. government if a vessel is traveling in a high - risk area and is determined by the coast guard to be at risk of being boarded by pirates .
as of march 2011 , somali pirates had been sighted as far east as off the coast of india , and as far south as the mozambique channel .
heightened military presence in an internationally recommended transit corridor in the gulf of aden has reduced attacks in that area , but pirates have adopted tactics that now allow them to attack more than 1,000 nautical miles off the somali coast .
despite international naval efforts to counter acts of piracy in the waters off somalia , pirates in this region continue to increase not only the sophistication and geographic range of their attacks , but also the level of violence against hostages .
