since 1991 , u.s. teen pregnancy , abortion , and birth rates have fallen considerably .
however , after 14 years of decline , the teen birth rate increased from 40.5 per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 in 2005 to 41.9 in 2006 and 42.5 in 2007 .
advocates of the abstinence - only approach argue that abstinence is the most effective means of preventing unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases ( including hiv / aids ) .
however , in 2008 , the teen birth rate reversed the two - year increase trend and dropped to 41.5 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 .
according to a 1997 survey , among the 69% of public school districts that had a district - wide policy to teach sex education , 14% had a comprehensive policy that treated abstinence as one option for adolescents in a broader sexuality education program ; 51% taught abstinence as the preferred option for teenagers , but also permitted discussion about contraception as an effective means of protecting against unintended pregnancy and disease ( an abstinence - plus policy ) ; and 35% taught abstinence as the only option outside of marriage , with discussion of contraception prohibited entirely or permitted only to emphasize its shortcomings ( abstinence - only policy ) .
