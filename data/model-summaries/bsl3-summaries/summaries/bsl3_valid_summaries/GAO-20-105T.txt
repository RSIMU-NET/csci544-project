without better information about the posting process , the inconsistency in the way in which duplicate comments are presented to public users of regulations.gov limits public users' ability to explore and use the data and could lead users to draw inaccurate conclusions about the public comments that were submitted and how agencies considered them during the rulemaking process .
under the apa , agencies engage in three basic phases of the rulemaking process: ( 1 ) initiate rulemaking actions , ( 2 ) develop proposed rulemaking actions , or notices of proposed rulemaking ( nprm ) , and ( 3 ) develop final rulemaking actions .
the administrative procedure act ( apa ) establishes procedures for rulemaking , which is the process agencies follow to develop and issue regulations .
while the apa does not include requirements for commenters to provide identity information , or for agency officials to include commenters' identity as part of their consideration of comments , key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites — like those used to facilitate the public comment process — should fully describe the data that are made available to the public , including by disclosing data sources and limitations .
