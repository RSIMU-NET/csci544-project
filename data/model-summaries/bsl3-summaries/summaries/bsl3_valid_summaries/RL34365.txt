important policy questions for congress include whether there is a need for further independent oversight of pilot performance ; whether vtss' should operate more like air traffic control centers ; and whether the pilot and ship captain should be required to agree on a passage plan before transiting a harbor ? .
on november 7 , 2007 , at about 8:30 a.m. , the container ship cosco busan sideswiped one of the towers of the san francisco - oakland bay bridge , ripping a 100-foot by 12-foot gash into the side of the hull and releasing over 50,000 gallons of the ship's bunker fuel into the bay .
other , preexisting legislation related to ship navigation is pending ( see the last section of this report ) .
congress has thus far held three hearings on the accident and has introduced legislation in reaction to the accident .
ever - larger ships , difficult or challenging slow - speed handling characteristics of some of these ships , and rising port traffic that is increasingly foreign - flagged may be cause for a review of pilotage , vessel traffic services , and other safety - related navigation services in u.s. ports .
