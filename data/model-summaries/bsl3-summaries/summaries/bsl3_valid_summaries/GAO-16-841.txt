as a complement to those reviews , this report ( 1 ) describes the factors that affect reported readiness levels and dod's efforts to manage the impact of continued deployments on readiness , and ( 2 ) assesses dod's implementation and oversight of department - wide readiness rebuilding efforts .
in commenting on the classified version of this report , dod partially concurred with three recommendations and concurred with two recommendations .
dod has acknowledged challenges with funding , accepting that it is a constrained resource .
the fundamental purpose of the military is to fight and win our nation's conflicts , and the department of defense ( dod ) has recognized the negative impact that more than a decade of deployments in support of counterinsurgency operations in iraq and afghanistan has had on the readiness of the force .
dod has stated that readiness rebuilding is a priority , but implementation and oversight of department - wide readiness rebuilding efforts has not fully included key elements of sound planning , which could place readiness recovery efforts at risk given the continued high pace of operations and many competing priorities .
without metrics against which to measure the services' progress toward agreed - upon , achievable readiness recovery goals , dod will be unable to determine the effectiveness of readiness recovery efforts or assess its ability to meet the demands of the national military strategy , which may be at risk .
