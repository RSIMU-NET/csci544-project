we make the following two recommendations to va: the under secretary for health should ensure that any action plan for achieving health equity includes key elements for successful implementation by consistently applying criteria identified in gao's past work on effectively managing performance , including developing performance measures to assess progress and creating clear lines of accountability by designating specific offices or officials with responsibility for coordinating efforts to implement actions and committing resources necessary for achieving its goals and objectives .
to examine the steps taken to reduce disparities in health care outcomes involving minority veterans to advance equity , we reviewed relevant documents from va that describe the efforts of the office of health equity ( ohe ) , which is responsible for advancing va health equity goals across the agency .
 ( recommendation 2 ) .
until va resolves known weaknesses with the completeness and accuracy of its race and ethnicity data , it will be limited in its ability to assess health equity for veterans receiving care at its facilities .
in our report , we 1. examine the extent to which va has taken steps to advance health equity for minority veterans ; 2. examine va's efforts to use race and ethnicity data to research and address disparities in health care outcomes involving minority veterans ; and 3. describe the feedback va collects from minority veterans on their patient experiences .
