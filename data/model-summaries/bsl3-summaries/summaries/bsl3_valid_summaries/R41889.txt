the u.s. congress — through its role in authorizations , appropriations , and oversight — would have significant input on u.s. participation in the fund , including whether and when to participate in the fund ; whether and how much to contribute to the fund , and with what source or sources of finance ; whether fund contributions would carry specific guidance in distribution and use ; how contributions to the fund would relate to other u.s. bilateral , multilateral , and private sector climate change assistance ; and whether and when to consent to negotiated treaty obligations , if submitted .
additional issues for congress concerning the climate negotiations in general , and the gcf in particular , may include the means to establish a more desirable form of agreement ( or lack thereof ) ; the compatibility of any international agreement with u.s. domestic policies and laws ; the adequacy of appropriations and fiscal incentives to achieve any commitments under the agreement ; and any requirements for potential ratification and implementing legislation , should a formal treaty emerge from the negotiations .
many voices , domestic and international , have called upon the united states and other industrialized countries to increase foreign assistance to lower - and middle - income countries to address climate change .
