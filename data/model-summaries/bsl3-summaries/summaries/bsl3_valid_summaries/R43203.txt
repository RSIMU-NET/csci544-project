this report will discuss the chevron decision ; explain when chevron deference applies ; highlight common agency statutory interpretations that generally do not receive deference under chevron ; and review the recent supreme court opinion in city of arlington v. fcc which clarified the applicability of chevron deference to circumstances in which an agency is interpreting the scope of its own jurisdiction .
often , however , congressional delegations of authority are imprecise , and , as a result , agencies must construe ambiguous terms and make interpretive decisions in order to implement congress's delegation .
in the absence of such clarity , chevron instructs reviewing courts to defer to an agency's construction of an ambiguous statute if the agency's interpretation is reasonable .
an administrative agency may generally only exercise that authority which is provided to it by congress .
first , the court noted that when congress enacts an ambiguous statutory delegation , it has , in effect , delegated to the agency it has empowered the authority to clarify the ambiguity .
the chevron test , which has been cited and followed thousands of times by federal courts since 1984 , requires courts to enforce the clearly expressed intent of congress .
