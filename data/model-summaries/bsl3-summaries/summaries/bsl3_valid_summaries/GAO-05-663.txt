to assist cbp in its efforts to develop a staffing model that will help provide a basis for budget justifications and management decision - making and to establish goals and performance measures to assess its progress in completing its staffing model and its cross - training program , we recommend that the secretary of the department of homeland security direct the commissioner of u.s. customs and border protection , to take the following five actions provide ports with targets and milestones for having staff cross - trained to measure the progress of its one face at the border program while being sensitive to work demands in setting training schedules ; incorporate wait time performance measures in the staffing model currently under development as required by the enhanced border security and visa protection act of 2002 ; use the staffing model under development to determine the optimal number of staff at each airport nationwide ; systematically solicit input from the field on staffing needs and include uniform , agencywide guidance on how they should assess their needs and environment ; and set out milestones for completing cbp's planned staffing model .
to assess cbp's progress in minimizing wait times for international air passengers while ensuring security , we analyzed ( 1 ) the wait times at the 20 u.s. international airports that receive most of the international traffic and factors affecting wait times ; ( 2 ) the steps airports and airlines have taken to minimize passenger wait times ; and ( 3 ) how cbp has managed staffing to minimize wait times across airports .
