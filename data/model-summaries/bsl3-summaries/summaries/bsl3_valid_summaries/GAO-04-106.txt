to improve va's testing of veterans identified as at risk of hepatitis c infection , we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for health to determine the effectiveness of actions taken by networks and facilities to improve the hepatitis c testing rates for veterans and , where actions have been successful , consider applying these improvements systemwide and provide local managers with information on current fiscal year performance results using a subset of the performance measurement sample of veterans in order for them to determine the effectiveness of actions taken to improve hepatitis c testing processes .
network and facility managers would benefit from knowing , in addition to the cumulative results , current fiscal year performance results for hepatitis c testing to determine the effectiveness of actions taken to improve hepatitis c testing rates .
in 1998 , the department of veterans affairs ( va ) launched a major initiative to screen all veterans treated at va facilities by asking them a series of questions about possible risk factors for hepatitis c and performing blood tests for those veterans identified as being at risk for contracting the disease .
as a result , you asked us to focus our work on testing performance and we ( 1 ) reviewed va's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis c , ( 2 ) identified factors that impede va's efforts to test veterans for hepatitis c in one va health care network , and ( 3 ) identified actions taken by va networks and medical facilities intended to improve the testing rate of veterans identified as at risk for hepatitis c. we reviewed va's fiscal year 2002 performance measurement process results in testing veterans it identified as at risk for hepatitis c , the most recently available data at the time we conducted our work .
