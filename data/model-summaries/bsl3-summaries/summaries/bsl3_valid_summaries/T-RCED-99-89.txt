specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) trends in crashes involving large trucks , ( 2 ) factors that contribute to such crashes , and ( 3 ) omchs' activities to improve the safety of large trucks .
however , omchs is unlikely to reach the goal because ( 1 ) its initiative to target high - risk carriers for safety improvements depends on data that are not complete , accurate , or timely ; ( 2 ) several activities will not be completed before the end of 1999 ; and ( 3 ) the effectiveness of omchs' educational campaign to improve car drivers' behavior is unknown .
my testimony presents preliminary information based on our ongoing work for this subcommittee on the effectiveness of the federal highway administration's office of motor carrier and highway safety ( omchs ) in improving the safety of large trucks ( those trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or more ) .
while omchs plans to conduct a national telephone survey within the next year to determine the level of public recognition of the “no - zone” campaign , the survey will not measure whether car drivers' behavior has changed .
