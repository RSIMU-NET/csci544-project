today , my testimony will focus on two areas: ï‚· hhs reported estimated improper payments in the medicare program for fiscal year 2010 , and the status of cms's efforts to implement key strategies to help remediate improper payments in the medicare program .
cms agreed with this recommendation .
the medicare improper payment estimates do not reflect all of the program's risk because hhs did not report a total improper payment estimated amount for its medicare prescription drug benefit program ( part d ) .
we supplemented that prior work with additional information on the nature and extent of medicare improper payments reported by hhs in its fiscal year 2010 agency financial report ( afr ) .
notably , we are beginning new work to assess cms's efforts to strengthen the standards and procedures for medicare provider enrollment to reduce the risk of enrolling providers that are intent on defrauding or abusing the program .
cms concurred with this recommendation .
we also received updated information from cms in february 2011 and , in select cases , as of july 2011 , on its actions related to relevant laws , regulations , guidance , and open recommendations pertaining to the key remediation strategies discussed later in this statement .
