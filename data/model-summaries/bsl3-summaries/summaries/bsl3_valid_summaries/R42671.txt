circuit decision and as agreed to in a september 4 , 2012 , consent decree , epa is to finalize its decision regarding the pm naaqs by december 14 , 2012 .
the date of the proposal was per a june 6 , 2012 , order issued by the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in response to petitions filed by advocacy groups and 11 states .
epa also held two public hearings for the proposal on july 17 , 2012 , in philadelphia , pa , and july 19 , 2012 , in sacramento , ca .
