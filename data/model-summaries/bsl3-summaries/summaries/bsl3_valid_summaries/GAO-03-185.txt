to facilitate improvements in program integrity , the cms administrator should propose legislation permitting the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries and requiring that these companies seek enrollment in medicare .
in order to enhance medicare's program integrity , congress may wish to amend the social security act to ( 1 ) permit the reassignment of benefits to staffing companies that retain contractor physicians to treat medicare beneficiaries so that cms may enroll these companies if they meet appropriate criteria and ( 2 ) require these staffing companies to seek enrollment in medicare .
to study the billing patterns of emergency department staffing companies that retain contractor physicians , we obtained medicare claims data paid in 2000 for beneficiaries in five states â€” alabama , florida , pennsylvania , texas , and west virginia .
as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction , we examined emergency department billings and focused this report on ( 1 ) whether staffing companies' contractor physicians bill medicare similarly to emergency department physicians with other affiliations , such as those practicing in partnerships , medical groups , or employee - based staffing companies , and ( 2 ) how cms's ability to monitor medicare billings has been affected by the lack of information linking contractor physicians to their staffing companies .
