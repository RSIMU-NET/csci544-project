the task force also made four overarching recommendations to ( 1 ) work toward closer adherence to current separation standards ( criteria for spacing between aircraft ) , ( 2 ) establish incentives that will ensure a return on investment for those wishing to install new technology and equipment on aircraft , ( 3 ) streamline the operational approval process that ensures the safety of equipment and the training of those that use the equipment in the national airspace system , and ( 4 ) follow up on and track recommendations to ensure their implementation .
we group these challenges into three areas: ( 1 ) directing resources and addressing environmental issues to ensure the timely implementation of capabilities , ( 2 ) adjusting faa's culture and business practices to support the implementation of operational improvements , and ( 3 ) developing and implementing cost - effective options to encourage airlines and general aviation operators to equip their aircraft with nextgen technologies .
on september 9 , 2009 , the task force issued its final report , which contained a list of recommendations to implement operational capabilities in five key areas — surface operations , runway access , congestion relief in metropolitan areas , cruise operations , and access to certain airspace — and two cross - cutting areas — data communication applications and integrated air traffic management .
