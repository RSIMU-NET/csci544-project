with its mission to “provide america's taxpayers with top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all,” irs is responsible for collecting most of the funds that pay for the federal government .
in summary , our assessment of irs's 2004 budget request shows that: irs is requesting 100,043 ftes and $10.4 billion , an increase of about 5 percent over its fiscal year 2003 request .
for 2003 , irs expects to process 130 million individual income tax returns , issue 99 million refunds , receive 100 million telephone calls , and assist 4 million taxpayers face - to - face at irs and volunteer offices .
to carry out its mission , irs has a budget of about $10 billion and staff of about 100,000 full time equivalents ( fte ) .
further , irs's recent history shows that it has been unable to increase resources in compliance , despite having made it a priority in budget requests .
we are pleased to participate in the subcommittee's inquiry into internal revenue service's ( irs ) fiscal year 2004 budget request and 2003 tax filing season performance .
