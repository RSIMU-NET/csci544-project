bia officials acknowledged that their fiscal year 2004 deferred maintenance estimate was only a starting point and that it needed to be revised for three key reasons: ( 1 ) the individuals who conducted the assessments were not knowledgeable about irrigation projects or infrastructure ; ( 2 ) not all projects used the same methodology to develop their deferred maintenance cost estimates ; and ( 3 ) some projects incorrectly counted new construction items as deferred maintenance .
