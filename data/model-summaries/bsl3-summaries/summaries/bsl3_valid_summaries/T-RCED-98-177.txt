concerned about how well this title i program was being operated , you and congressman bentsen asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the information needed to manage the program was available to hud , ( 2 ) the extent to which hud was overseeing program lenders , and ( 3 ) whether hud has any ongoing or planned efforts under way to strengthen its management and oversight .
hud officials attributed these weaknesses to the program's being lender - operated , limited staff resources , and hud's assignment of monitoring priorities .
hud also provides limited oversight of lenders' compliance with program regulations , conducting only 2 on - site lender reviews in fiscal year 1997 of the approximately 3,700 program lenders .
regarding the need for oversight of lenders' compliance , we found that loan claim files submitted by lenders to hud following loan defaults often do not contain required loan documents , including the original loan applications and certifications signed by the borrower that the property improvement work has been completed .
as a result of the management and oversight weaknesses we have observed , our preliminary work indicates that hud does not know who the program is serving , if lenders are complying with program regulations , and whether certain potential program abuses are occurring , such as violations of the $25,000 limitation on the amount of title i loan indebtedness for each property .
