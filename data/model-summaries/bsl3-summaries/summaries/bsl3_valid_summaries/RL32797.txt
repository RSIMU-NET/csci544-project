a few weeks before , merck had notified the food and drug administration ( fda ) that it was withdrawing vioxx from the market in response to recent study results indicating an increased risk of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths among the millions of patients who had been using vioxx since its introduction in 1999 .
after weighing the evidence on the safety and risk - to - benefit of vioxx and similar drugs , the committees unanimously asserted that the three cox - 2 inhibitors then holding fda approval for sale in the united states — vioxx , celebrex , and bextra — do increase the risk of heart attack and stroke .
illustrating the complexity of decisions that fda faces , a majority of the committee members , noting that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks for certain groups of people , therefore , recommended to fda that the agency permit the sale of these drugs — with , however , several severe limitations on advertising and strong warnings in consumer and clinician labeling about cardiovascular risk that is likely associated with dose and duration of use .
in this 100 th year of the food and drug administration , congress is clearly poised to examine whether fda needs more legal authority to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs .
