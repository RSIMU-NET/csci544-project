in response to your request , this report addresses whether nasa has effectively ( 1 ) designed controls over steps nasa identified as key to its controlled equipment reutilization process , including equipment sent to disposal , and ( 2 ) implemented policies , controls , and processes to enhance equipment reutilization .
the implementation of its new space exploration policy — a renewed spirit of discovery: the president's vision for u.s. space exploration — and the planned retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 will require nasa to move into a period of major transition .
we recommend that the nasa administrator direct the assistant administrator for the office of infrastructure and administration to take the following five actions to enhance comprehensive and consistent equipment reutilization: develop and implement specific guidance , establish a mechanism to oversee implementation , and provide the necessary training to assist nasa employees and contractors in providing clear , consistent , and accurate equipment descriptions and key information in the pp&e module , including the physical condition ( usability ) .
