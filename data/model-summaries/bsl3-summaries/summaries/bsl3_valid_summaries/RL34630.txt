others have contended that private funds , particularly so - called "soft money," which falls outside the scope of federal campaign finance law , have become too pervasive in conventions and that tighter restrictions are needed .
every four years , the two major political parties , and some third parties , select their presidential nominees at conventions .
additionally , congress appropriates federal funding for the securing of the convention venues .
these divergent views on the use of public funds to support party conventions also appear in other contexts in the debate surrounding campaign finance policy .

although both presidential public funds and security funds support conventions , congress may reassess them separately .

these conventions are run by and for parties , without a formal role for the federal government .
