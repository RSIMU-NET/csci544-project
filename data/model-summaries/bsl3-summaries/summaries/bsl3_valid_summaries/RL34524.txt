u.s. trade policy also seeks to promote economic growth in developing countries by offering trade preference programs , including the generalized system of preferences ( gsp ) , and the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ) .
rules of origin ( roo ) , the methodology used to prove country of origin , are central components of u.s. trade policy .
the country of origin of an imported product is defined in u.s. trade laws and customs regulations as the country of manufacture , production , or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the customs territory of the united states .
if congress desires to provide greater preferential access to the u.s. market ( and gain reciprocal access to the markets of trading partners ) , it could urge u.s. negotiators to liberalize roo , and to examine the costs and benefits of applying a uniform set of preferential roo with respect to future fta negotiations .
u.s. laws and regulations on rules of origin conform to the world trade organization ( wto ) agreement on rules of origin , in which wto members agreed not to use roo to pursue trade policy objectives in a manner that would disrupt trade , and to apply them in a consistent , uniform , impartial , and reasonable manner .
