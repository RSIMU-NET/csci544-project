specifically , i will address ( 1 ) the cost of the army's plans to implement these initiatives , and ( 2 ) the management challenges facing the army and the actions needed to improve its implementation of these initiatives .
key initiatives include plans to restructure the army from divisions to standardized modular brigades as well as expand the force by more than 74,000 soldiers .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss issues related to army equipment in light of the high pace and long duration of operations in iraq and afghanistan as well as the army's plans to modernize and transform its capabilities .
as you requested , my testimony will focus on the equipping implications of restructuring and expanding the army ; efforts to repair , replace , and recapitalize equipment through the army's reset program ; and reconstitution of prepositioned equipment .
concerned about declining military readiness , congress has provided substantial funding in response to department of defense ( dod ) funding requests .
our prior work has found that a lack of clear linkages between overall army equipment requirements and funding needs is an impediment to effective oversight of the army's equipping plans .
