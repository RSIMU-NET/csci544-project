the parts were destroyed because ( 1 ) the military services improperly coded parts without military technology as having military technology implications and ( 2 ) policies and practices intended to prevent an inadvertent sale of military technology or flight safety items did not adequately exclude parts without military technology or flight safety implications .
this report addresses whether ( 1 ) dod destroyed usable aircraft parts during the disposal process that did not have military technology and flight safety implications and ( 2 ) the military services recalled aircraft parts from the disposal process to preclude unnecessary purchases or repairs .
army aviation and troop command officials who are responsible for reviewing and validating demilitarization codes for cobra helicopter parts told us they were waiting to complete the demilitarization code review until after army headquarters makes a decision on whether or not to sell disarmed , surplus cobra helicopters to the public for use in such purposes as fighting forest fires .
this review shows that dod has not implemented similar procedures .
when the military services no longer need aircraft parts , they turn them over to the defense logistics agency , which manages dod's disposal process .
