in view of the increasing threat of unauthorized intrusions into department of defense computer systems , you asked us to report on the extent to which defense computer systems are being attacked , the actual and potential damage to its information and systems , and the challenges defense is facing in securing sensitive information .
the hundreds of thousands of attacks that defense has already experienced demonstrate that ( 1 ) significant damage can be incurred by attackers and ( 2 ) attacks pose serious risks to national security .
to better focus management attention on the department's increasing computer security threat and to ensure that a higher priority and sufficient resources are devoted to addressing this problem , we recommend that at a minimum the secretary of defense strengthen the department's information systems security program by developing departmentwide policies for preventing , detecting , and responding to attacks on defense information systems , including mandating that ( 1 ) all security incidents be reported within the department , ( 2 ) risk assessments be performed routinely to determine vulnerability to attacks and intrusions , ( 3 ) vulnerabilities and deficiencies be expeditiously corrected as they are identified , and ( 4 ) damage from intrusions be expeditiously assessed to ensure the integrity of data and systems compromised ; requiring the military services and defense agencies to use training and other mechanisms to increase awareness and accountability among installation commanders and all personnel as to the security risks of computer systems connected to the internet and their responsibility for securing their systems ; requiring information system security officers at all installations and setting specific standards for ensuring that these as well as system and network managers are given sufficient time and training to perform their duties appropriately ; continually developing and cost - effectively using departmentwide network monitoring and protection technologies ; and evaluating the incident response capabilities within disa , the military services , and the defense agencies to ensure that they are sufficient to handle the projected threat .
