as congress considers nfip reforms and reauthorization , it should consider ways to better ensure the long - term financial stability of the program , such as 1 ) allowing nfip to charge full - risk premium rates to all property owners and providing assistance to some categories of owners to pay those premiums ; 2 ) authorizing nfip to account for long - term flood erosion in its flood maps ; and 3 ) clarifying and expanding fema's ability to increase premiums or discontinue coverage for owners of repetitive loss properties who do not mitigate their properties or refuse fema's mitigation offers .
specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) analyze the extent to which fema's key management practices — including strategic planning , human capital planning , intra - agency collaboration , records management , financial management , and acquisition management — affect the agency's ability to administer nfip ; ( 2 ) identify lessons to be learned from the cancellation of its most recent attempt to modernize nfip's flood insurance policy and claims processing system , including to what extent key acquisition management processes were followed ; and ( 3 ) describe factors that are relevant to nfip operations and analyze limitations on fema's authority that could affect its financial stability .
