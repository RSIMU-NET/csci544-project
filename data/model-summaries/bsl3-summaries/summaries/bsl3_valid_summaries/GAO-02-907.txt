the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , which administers u.s. patent and trademark laws , had a staff of 6,426 and collected about $1.1 billion in patent and trademark fees in fiscal year 2001 .
furthermore , because maintenance fees are higher , if a small entity maintains the patent through the payment of the three maintenance fees , the total fee increase resulting from the proposed legislation would be nearly $2,700 , or about a 67 percent increase over current fees .
the patent process begins with an applicant filing a patent application with uspto and paying a filing fee .
in this context , you asked for information on ( 1 ) uspto's past and future operations , particularly patent applications filed , patents granted , patent application inventory , patent pendency , patent examiner staffing , and fee collections and funding requirements ( agency appropriations ) ; ( 2 ) some of the differences between uspto's business and strategic plans ; and ( 3 ) changes in the patent fee structure under proposed legislation .
as the u.s. economy depends increasingly on new innovations , the need to patent or trademark quickly the intellectual property resulting from such innovations becomes more important .
