in this report , we ( 1 ) describe the process hrsa uses to oversee grantee compliance with health center program requirements , and ( 2 ) assess the extent to which hrsa's process identifies and addresses noncompliance with these program requirements .
the nationwide network of health centers in the federal health center program is an important component of the health care safety net for vulnerable populations , including medicaid beneficiaries , people who are uninsured , and others who may have difficulty obtaining access to health care .
the remaining 3 requirements we selected for review were those requiring grantees to: provide professional coverage , such as access to a physician , for patients after normal health center hours ( after hours coverage ) ; possess sufficient management expertise to run the health center ( key management staff ) ; and have a policy to prevent conflicts of interest ( conflict of interest ) .
hrsa's process for identifying noncompliance is insufficient as annual compliance reviews do not identify all instances of noncompliance and the extent to which hrsa uses site visits to assess compliance is unclear , but appears to be limited .
our analysis of 48 compliance decisions that project officers made during their fiscal year 2011 annual compliance reviews for our eight selected grantees found that in 43 cases ( 90 percent ) project officers determined grantees were in compliance with requirements.however , in 23 of these 43 cases ( 53 percent ) , we were unable to find sufficient information to support the project officer's compliance decision and the project officers did not indicate that they were unable to clearly determine compliance , which is what hrsa guidance instructs them to do if they are uncertain about whether or not the grantee demonstrated compliance , for example: project officers determined that all eight selected health center grantees were in compliance with the after hours coverage requirement .
