 ( recommendation 1 ) .

fda review time .
to describe the characteristics of drugs seeking orphan designation , we analyzed rates of orphan designations granted and denied from january 1 , 2008 , to december 31 , 2017 , from the agency's internal database on orphan designation applications .
in order to obtain the incentives , drug manufacturers must submit an application to fda for orphan designation â€” a status given to a drug that is intended to treat a rare disease .
according to fda , the growth in orphan designations and marketing approvals is expected to continue , partly due to medical advances that make health care more personalized , genetically targeted , and likely to address rare diseases .
