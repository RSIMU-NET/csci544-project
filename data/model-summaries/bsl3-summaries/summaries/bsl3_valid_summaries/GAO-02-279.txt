in response to your request , we assessed ( 1 ) how states monitor the accuracy of mds data compiled by nursing homes through review programs separate from their standard nursing home survey process , ( 2 ) how states attempt to improve the data's accuracy where there are indications of problems , and ( 3 ) how the federal government ensures the accuracy of mds data .
with the goal of complementing and leveraging the considerable federal and state resources already devoted to nursing home surveys and to separate mds accuracy review programs , we recommend that the administrator of cms review the adequacy of current state efforts to ensure the accuracy of mds data , and provide , where necessary , additional guidance , training , and technical assistance ; monitor the adequacy of state mds accuracy activities on an ongoing basis , such as through the use of the established federal comparative survey process ; and provide guidance to state agencies and nursing homes that sufficient evidentiary documentation to support the full mds assessment be included in residents' medical records .
such a shift in focus should include ( 1 ) taking full advantage of the periodic on - site visits already conducted at every nursing home nationwide through the routine state survey process , ( 2 ) ensuring that the federal mds review process is designed and sufficient to consistently assess the performance of all states' reviews for mds accuracy , and ( 3 ) providing additional guidance , training , and other technical guidance to states as needed to facilitate their efforts .
