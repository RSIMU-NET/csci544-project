this report provides the results of our review of the fine collection activities of the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) , the commodity futures trading commission ( cftc ) , and nine exchanges and industry associations that act as self - regulatory organizations ( sro ) in the securities and futures industries .
as agreed with your staff , this report ( 1 ) compares how the securities and futures regulators' current collection rates have changed since our prior report and assesses the changes they made in their fine imposition practices , ( 2 ) discusses the steps taken by sec and cftc to oversee the sros' fine imposition activities , including the actions they have recently taken to improve this oversight , and ( 3 ) assesses the effectiveness of actions taken by sec and cftc to refer unpaid fines to the department of the treasury's financial management service ( fms ) .
levying fines is an important mechanism that regulators use to sanction those who violate securities and futures industry rules .
nasd's practices changed in october 1999 , with collection rates markedly improving thereafter .
however , for fines to be an effective means of ensuring adherence with the rules , regulators must collect them .
