also , as agreed with you , we categorized the assistance into three types: ( 1 ) direct funding or grants ; ( 2 ) access to support services and systems , such as the federal bureau of investigation's ( fbi ) national crime information center ; and ( 3 ) in - kind ( no cost ) transfers of equipment or other assets .
although states and localities have traditionally held the major responsibility for preventing and controlling crime in the united states , a significant aspect of the federal government's role has been its provision of financial and other assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies .
as table 1 shows , for the three federal agencies we reviewed , single - purpose grants ( $255.1 million ) and multipurpose grants ( $746.3 million ) were the major type of crime technology assistance provided to state and local law enforcement agencies during fiscal years 1996 through 1998 .
the other 12 single - purpose grant programs represented about 42 percent ( $107.9 million ) of the $255.1 million total and included programs such as a dna laboratory improvement program and the national sex offender registry .
