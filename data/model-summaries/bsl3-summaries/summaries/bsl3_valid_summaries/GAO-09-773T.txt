notably , our work on epa's integrated risk information system ( iris ) program and its database — which contains the agency's scientific position on the potential human health effects of exposure to more than 540 chemicals — identified significant concerns about both the lack of transparency in the process epa uses to assess toxic chemicals and the resulting effect on the credibility , or integrity , of these assessments .
demonstrating a strong commitment to the integrity of its peer reviews , epa took a number of actions to implement our report's recommendations , including establishing a standard process for science advisory board panel formation that includes a requirement to document decisions about conflicts of interest and balance of viewpoints and expertise in forming each panel , as well as prospective panelists' responses to several standardized questions aimed at assessing impartiality ; developing a new confidential financial disclosure form designed to capture needed information to evaluate potential conflicts of interest ; allowing the public to review a “short list” of candidates selected for a specific science advisory board panel and to comment on the appropriateness of including any of these candidates on the panel ; and developing cd - based conflict - of - interest training for science advisory board panelists .
