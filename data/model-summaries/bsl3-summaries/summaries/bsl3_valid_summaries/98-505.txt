f ederal law provides a variety of powers for the president to use in response to crisis , exigency , or emergency circumstances threatening the nation .
they are not limited to military or war situations .
the development , exercise , and regulation of emergency powers , from the days of the continental congress to the present , reflect at least one highly discernable trend: those authorities available to the executive in time of national crisis or exigency have , since the time of the lincoln administration , come to be increasingly rooted in statutory law .
in his view , such a "specific grant must be either in the federal constitution or in an act of congress passed in pursuance thereof .
congress may modify , rescind , or render dormant such delegated emergency authority .
others — statutory delegations from congress — exist on a standby basis and remain dormant until the president formally declares a national emergency .
relying upon constitutional authority or congressional delegations made at various times over the past 230 years , the president of the united states may exercise certain powers in the event that the continued existence of the nation is threatened by crisis , exigency , or emergency circumstances .
