in light of these concerns , and in response to your request , we are providing information on ( 1 ) the nature of counterfeiting of u.s. currency abroad , ( 2 ) the extent of that counterfeiting and of concerns about this issue , and ( 3 ) the status of u.s. efforts to deter such counterfeiting of u.s. currency abroad .
the widespread use of u.s. currency abroad , together with the outdated security features of the currency , makes it a particularly vulnerable target for international counterfeiters .
the u.s. currency , reportedly the most widely held in the world , is susceptible to counterfeiting .
these recent efforts include redesigning u.s. currency ; increasing exchanges of information abroad ; augmenting the secret service presence abroad ; and undertaking efforts to stop production and distribution of counterfeit currency , including the superdollar .
widespread counterfeiting of u.s. currency could undermine confidence in the currency and , if done on a large enough scale , could have a negative effect on the u.s. economy .
of the $380 billion of u.s. currency in circulation , the federal reserve estimates that over 60 percent may be held outside the united states .
