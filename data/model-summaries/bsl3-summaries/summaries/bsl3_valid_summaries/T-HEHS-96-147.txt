outcomes .
our april 1996 report shows , in fact , that program design and implementation weaknesses hinder maximizing beneficiary work potential .
indeed , if an additional 1 percent of the 6.3 million working - age ssi and di beneficiaries were to leave ssa's disability rolls by returning to work , lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 billion .
not surprisingly , these weaknesses also yield poor return - to - work outcomes .
other work we are doing for you highlights strategies from the private sector and other countries that ssa could use to develop administrative and legislative solutions to improve return - to - work outcomes .
you asked us to discuss today ways to improve the disability insurance ( di ) and supplemental security income ( ssi ) programs by helping people with disabilities return to work .
to develop this information , we surveyed people in the private sector generally recognized as leaders in developing disability management programs that focus on return - to - work efforts .
moreover , medical advances and new technologies provide more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities to work .
each week the social security administration ( ssa ) pays over $1 billion in cash payments to people with disabilities on di and ssi .
