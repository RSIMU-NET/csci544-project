the appointments clause ( article ii , section 2 ) empowers the president to nominate and , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , to appoint the principal officers of the united states , as well as some subordinate officers .
specifically , the appointments clause provides that [the president] shall nominate , and by and with the advice and consent of the senate , shall appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the united states , whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by law .
the report begins by explaining the three distinct stages that comprise the advice and consent process , which is the means through which most of these positions are filled .
finally , it discusses certain types of statutory provisions that congress has applied selectively to specific advice and consent positions in the executive branch: qualifications for officeholders , fixed terms of office , limitations on presidential removal , appointment and removal of chairs , and holdover provisions .
the remainder of the appointments clause states that "the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers , as they think proper , in the president alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments. .
