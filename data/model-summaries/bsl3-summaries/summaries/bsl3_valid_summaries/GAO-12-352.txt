our objectives for this work were to examine ( 1 ) the number of corps project studies that have undergone independent peer review in response to section 2034 of the water resources and development act ( wrda ) of 2007 , ( 2 ) the cost of these peer reviews , ( 3 ) the extent to which the u.s. army corps of engineers' ( corps ) process for determining if a project study is subject to peer review is consistent with section 2034 , ( 4 ) the process the corps uses to ensure that the contractors it hires and the experts the contractors select to review project studies are independent and free from conflicts of interest , and ( 5 ) the extent to which recommendations from peer reviews have been incorporated into project studies .
to better reflect section 2034 and provide more effective stewardship of public resources and ensure efficient and effective operations , the corps should: revise the criteria in the corps' process for conducting peer review to focus on larger , more complex , and controversial projects ; to encourage peer review to occur earlier in the study process ; and to include exclusions to peer review that align with section 2034 .
