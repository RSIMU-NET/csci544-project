as cms implements and refines its physician feedback and vm programs , the administrator of cms should consider taking the following two actions to help ensure physicians can best use the feedback to improve their performance: develop performance benchmarks that compare physicians' performance against additional benchmarks such as state or regional averages ; and disseminate performance reports more frequently than the current annual distribution — for example , semiannually .
one such approach — known as value - based payment ( vbp ) — links a portion of physician compensation to achieving specified levels of performance .
this report contains information we provided during those briefings , updated with additional information , addressing 1. how and when private entities — such as health insurers — report performance data to physicians , and what information they report ; and 2. how the timing and approach cms uses to report performance data to physicians compare to that of private entities .

without interim performance reports , providers may not be able to make needed changes to their performance in advance of their annual vm payment modifications .
increasingly , health care payers — including medicare — are rethinking the way they reimburse providers in an attempt to shift away from paying solely for the volume of care delivered and toward paying them for the value of their care .
