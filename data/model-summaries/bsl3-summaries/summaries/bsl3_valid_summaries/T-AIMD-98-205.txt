as we have been reporting , given the federal government's poor record of delivering new systems capabilities when promised , and the immutability of the year 2000 deadline , these replacement efforts are at high risk ; it is therefore essential that reliable information that accurately reflects agencies' progress in implementing replacement systems be available .
omb has acted on these recommendations .
also of concern is that omb , the president's council on year 2000 conversion , and the congress lack sufficient information with which to judge the progress of systems to be replaced .
agencies are not required to report on the status of specific mission - critical systems due to be replaced rather than renovated — more than 1,000 ( 23 percent ) of the government's noncompliant mission - critical systems — unless those systems are 2 months or more behind schedule .
the common theme has been that serious vulnerabilities remain in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , and that much more action is needed to ensure that federal agencies satisfactorily mitigate year 2000 risks to avoid debilitating consequences .
unless progress improves dramatically , a substantial number of mission - critical systems will not be year 2000 compliant in time .
