to improve agencies' guidance processes , we recommended that the secretaries of usda , hhs , dol , and education strengthen their components' application of internal controls by adopting , as appropriate , practices developed by other departments and components , such as assessment of risk ; written procedures and tools to promote the consistent implementation and communication of management directives ; and ongoing monitoring efforts to ensure that guidance is being issued appropriately and has the intended effect .
how do agencies use regulatory guidance ? .
how do agencies determine whether to issue guidance or undertake rulemaking ? .
regulatory guidance is an important tool that agencies use to communicate timely information about the implementation of regulatory and grant programs to regulated parties , grantees , and the general public .
the office of management and budget ( omb ) defines the term “guidance document” as an agency statement of general applicability and future effect , other than a regulatory action , that sets forth a policy on a statutory , regulatory , or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue .
the potential effects of these documents — and the risks of legal challenges to agencies — underscore the need for consistent and well - understood processes for the development , review , dissemination , and evaluation of guidance .
