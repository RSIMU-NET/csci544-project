these grants are special education grants to states ( school - age grants ) , special education preschool grants ( preschool grants ) and special education grants for infants and families with disabilities ( infant grants ) .

this potential exists for school - age grants and preschool grants because school - age grants serve children ages 3 through 21 and preschool grants serve children ages 3 through 5 .
 ( 2 ) do states and local agencies receive funding from more than one of these grants and , if so , do they use the funds to provide the same range of services to children in the same age group ? .
