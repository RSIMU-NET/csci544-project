we are pleased to respond to your request that we review economic models of the u.s. department of agriculture and u.s. international trade commission , especially their treatment of competition , marketing practices , and international trade effects on u.s. cattle prices and producers' incomes .
to what extent do these models incorporate structural changes â€” specifically , market concentration in the meatpacking sector and the use of marketing agreements , forward contracts , and imports ? .
what are the most important factors that affect cattle prices and producers' incomes ? .
producers' fortunes also hinge on how weather affects the supply and cost of forage and feed grains .
what are the most significant data and modeling issues to be considered in developing a more comprehensive model , or logical framework , to explain cattle prices and producers' incomes ? .
information technology is being used to conduct live - cattle auctions on the internet .
in this report , we address three research questions .
the livelihood of cattle producers depends fundamentally on the price they receive for their product and their cost to produce it .
the long biological cycle for cattle means that producers have to make supply decisions about herd size long before animals are sold and prices are known .
