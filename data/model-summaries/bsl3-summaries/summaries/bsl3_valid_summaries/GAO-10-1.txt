to ensure that the agencies and congress have reliable information on contracts and contractor personnel in iraq and afghanistan , we recommend that the secretaries of defense and state and the usaid administrator jointly develop and execute a plan with associated time frames for their continued implementation of the ndaa for fy2008 requirements , specifically ensuring that the agencies' criteria for entering contracts and contractor personnel into spot are consistent with the ndaa for fy2008 and with the agencies' respective information needs for overseeing contracts and contractor personnel ; establishing uniform requirements on how contract numbers are to be entered into spot so that contract information can accurately be pulled from fpds - ng as agreed to in the mou ; and revising spot's reporting capabilities to ensure that they fulfill statutory requirements and agency information needs , such as those related to contractor personnel killed or wounded .
