nsps will not only affect the roughly 700,000 dod civilian employees , but it could have far - reaching implications for civil service reform across the federal government .
going forward , gao believes that ( 1 ) the development of the position of deputy secretary of defense for management , who would act as dod's chief management officer , is essential to elevate , integrate , and institutionalize responsibility for the success of dod's overall business transformation efforts , including its new human resources management system ; ( 2 ) dod would benefit if it develops a comprehensive communications strategy that provides for ongoing , meaningful two - way communication that creates shared expectations among employees , employee representatives , and stakeholders ; and ( 3 ) dod must ensure that it has the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of its new authorities before they are operationalized .
human capital reforms to date recognize that the “one - size - fits - all” approach is not appropriate to all agencies' demands , challenges , and missions .
i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide our observations on the department of defense's ( dod ) final national security personnel system ( nsps ) regulations , which the secretary of defense and the director of the office of personnel management ( opm ) published earlier this month .
