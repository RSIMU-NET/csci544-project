in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) the lessons that can be learned from efforts by nonfederal land managers to generate revenue and / or become financially self - sufficient from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands and ( 2 ) legal and other barriers that may preclude the forest service from implementing similar efforts on its lands .
rather than applying a one - size - fits - all approach or technique , the managers have ( 1 ) usually tailored their efforts to meet either a clear mission to make a profit over time or an incentive to generate revenue for other mission - related goals and objectives and ( 2 ) often been delegated the discretion and flexibility to make choices while being held accountable for their expenditures and results .
while not always attaining financial self - sufficiency , these nonfederal land managers are employing a variety of sometimes innovative approaches and techniques to generate revenue or reduce costs from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands .
although most of the nonfederal land managers whose efforts we reviewed are attempting to increase revenue and / or decrease costs from the sale or use of natural resources on their lands , their success in becoming financially self - sufficient has varied and their revenue has not always covered the costs of providing the goods or services .
