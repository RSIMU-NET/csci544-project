presidential succession in the united states is governed by the 25 th amendment to the constitution , which provides that the vice president "shall become president" should the incumbent chief executive die , resign , or be removed from office .
in the event there is neither a president nor a vice president , the presidential succession act provides that the speaker of the house of representatives , the president pro tempore of the senate , and duly - confirmed cabinet officers , in order of the seniority of their departments , would be eligible to act as president .
the new president then nominates a successor vice president , subject to confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of congress .
