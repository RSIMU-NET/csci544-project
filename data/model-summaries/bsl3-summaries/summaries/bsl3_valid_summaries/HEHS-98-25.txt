because of these concerns , you asked us to evaluate the food and drug administration's ( fda ) oversight of transplanted human tissue as well as to evaluate potential safety problems .
specifically , we sought to identify gaps in the current regulation , determining whether and how fda plans to address them in the approach it has proposed for regulating tissue banking .
fda should move ahead with its plan to require tissue facilities , including reproductive and stem cell facilities , to register with fda ; reproductive and stem cell facilities to adhere to all requirements of the current regulation ; facilities that collect and store cord blood to provide accurate oral and written communication to consumers with regard to the state of knowledge of collection , processing , and storage techniques , as well as the likelihood of requiring cord blood transplantation , and to portray the risks and benefits relative to other therapies .
we examined fda's regulation of human tissue intended for transplantation , the agency's december 1995 draft document on the regulation of placental and umbilical cord blood stem cell products intended for transplantation , and the agency's proposed approach for the regulation of cellular and tissue - based products , as well as guidance from fda and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) on screening donors of human tissues .
