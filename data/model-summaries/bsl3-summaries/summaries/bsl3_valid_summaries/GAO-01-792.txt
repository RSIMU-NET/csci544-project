under gpra , annual performance plans are to clearly inform the congress and the public of ( 1 ) the annual performance goals for agencies' major programs and activities , ( 2 ) the measures that will be used to gauge performance , ( 3 ) the strategies and resources required to achieve the performance goals , and ( 4 ) the procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance information .
to make sba's plan and report more useful for decisionmakers and more consistent with gpra , omb circular a - 11 , and related guidance , we recommend that the administrator of sba ensure that the fiscal year 2001 performance report and fiscal year 2003 performance plan ( 1 ) clearly link strategies to outcomes , indicators , and measures ; ( 2 ) present criteria or a performance indicator to explain the accomplishment of the goal when using qualitative measures ; and ( 3 ) provide information about strategies , time frames , and schedules for achieving unmet targets .
as agreed , using the selected key outcomes for sba as a framework , we ( 1 ) assessed the progress sba has made in achieving these outcomes and the strategies the agency has in place to achieve them , and ( 2 ) compared sba's fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the agency's prior year performance report and plan for these outcomes .
