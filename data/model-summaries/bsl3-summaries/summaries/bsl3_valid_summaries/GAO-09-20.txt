the honorable richard c. shelby ranking member committee on banking , housing , and urban affairs united states senate in 2007 , about 1.2 million — or almost one out of four — residential flood insurance policies covered by the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) continued to be sold at highly discounted rates that did not fully reflect the actual risk of flood damage ( known as subsidized rates ) .
while local communities recognize the importance of mitigation , not all communities have the staff or resources to fully carry out current mitigation efforts , meet the cost - sharing requirement ( generally 25 percent of the eligible project costs , which either the community or the property owner could provide ) that four of the five mitigation programs require , and enforce noncompliance requirements .
to address these questions , as agreed with your staff , this study ( 1 ) provides information on nfip's inventory of subsidized properties and their financial impact on the program and ( 2 ) examines nfip's current approach to managing its inventory of subsidized properties and the advantages and disadvantages of options for reducing or eliminating the financial impact of properties insured at subsidized rates .
