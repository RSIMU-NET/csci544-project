the lack of interest in privatization among u.s. airports could be the result of ( 1 ) readily available financing sources for publicly owned airports ; ( 2 ) barriers or lack of incentives to privatize ; ( 3 ) the potential implications for major stakeholders ; and ( 4 ) satisfaction with the status quo .
in 1996 , congress established the airport privatization pilot program ( appp ) to explore the prospect of privatizing publicly owned airports and using private capital to improve and develop them .
almost all commercial service airports in the united states are owned by local and state governments , or by public entities such as airport authorities or multipurpose port authorities .
in the united states , most cases of airport privatization fall into the category of "partial privatization" ; full privatization , either under or outside the appp , has been very rare .
in addition to reducing demand for government funds , privatization has been promoted as a way to make airports more efficient and financially viable .
over its 20-year history , the appp has not been successful in stimulating wide interest in airport privatization .
congress has been interested in airport privatization as a way to save money by making airports less dependent on federal assistance while also , in the long run , increasing the nation's aviation capacity to meet growing demand for air travel .
