our prior work has shown that cbp has made substantial progress in implementing various initiatives and programs that , collectively , have enhanced cargo security , but some challenges remain .
this statement is based on reports and testimonies we issued from april 2008 through january 2015 related to maritime cargo security â€” with selected updates on how dhs and cbp have responded to our prior recommendations .
the security and accountability for every port act ( safe port act ) of 2006 , enacted in october 2006 , established a statutory framework for key programs within cbp's layered security strategy that previously had not specifically been required by law .
we , therefore , recommended that cbp ( 1 ) ensure that future updates to the rules that identify risks are based on results of assessments that demonstrate the effectiveness of such updates ; and ( 2 ) establish targets for cbp's performance measures and use those measures to assess the effectiveness of ats on a regular basis to better determine when updates to the rules that identify risks are needed .
cbp's layered security strategy is based on initiatives and programs that include , among other things , analyzing information to identify shipments that may be at high risk of transporting weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) or other contraband , working with foreign governments to examine u.s. - bound shipments at foreign ports participating in the container security initiative ( csi ) and secure freight initiative ( sfi ) , and providing benefits to companies that comply with cbp's minimum security criteria through the customs - trade partnership against terrorism ( c - tpat ) program .
