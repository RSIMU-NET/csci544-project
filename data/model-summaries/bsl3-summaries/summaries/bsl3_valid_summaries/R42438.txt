depending on the conduct of the election , the official election results , and the treatment of the newly elected members of parliament , u.s. policy toward burma may undergo a major shift , possibly including the waiver or removal of some of the current u.s. sanctions .
the republic of the union of myanmar ( burma ) held parliamentary by - elections on april 1 , 2012 .
other nations and the european union ( eu ) are reportedly also considering removing sanctions or restrictions on burma depending on their assessments of the by - elections .
burma's parliamentary system consists of the bicameral union parliament ( pyidaungsu hluttaw ) plus separate local parliaments for each of the nation's seven states and seven regions .
among the criteria to be considered in determining if the by - elections were sufficiently free and fair are the conduct of the campaign , the voting process , and the official results .
the uec announced the official results on april 2 and 3 , 2012 , and the text of the official announcements were printed in the government - run newspaper , the new light of myanmar , on april 3 and 4 , 2012 .
