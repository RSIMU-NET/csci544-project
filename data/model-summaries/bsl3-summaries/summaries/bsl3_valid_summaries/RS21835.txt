trips by the president , vice president , and first lady are almost always classified as official travel or political travel , or a combination of the two .
official travel may involve , for example , presenting information ; giving direction ; and explaining , and securing public support for , administration policies .
official , or nonpolitical , travel is normally defined as anything having to do with the carrying out of presidential duties and responsibilities .
the terms are rather general , and the white house determines whether a trip is for official or political purposes , or for a combination of the two .
as a result , the white house decides the nature of travel on a case - by - case basis , attempting to determine whether each trip , or part of a trip , is or is not official by considering the nature of the event involved , and the role of the individual involved .
the guidelines , which also cover the first lady and the vice president's spouse , apply only to trips in the united states and its territories , since all foreign travel is considered official .
