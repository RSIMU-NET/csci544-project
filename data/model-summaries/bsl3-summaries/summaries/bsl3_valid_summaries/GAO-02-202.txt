although nearly all mcos renewed at least some of their medicare contracts over this period , many reduced the geographic areas served by one or more of their health plans.as a consequence of both the contract terminations and the service area reductions , approximately 1.6 million beneficiaries have had to switch mcos or return to medicare's traditional fee - for - service ( ffs ) program .
between 1998 and 2001 , the total number of contracts under medicare's managed care program , medicare+choice ( m+c ) , fell from approximately 340 to 180 .
the reduction largely reflected the decisions of some managed care organizations ( mco ) to terminate selected contracts or to discontinue service in certain covered areas .
mcos could ( 1 ) improve their health plans' benefit packages , ( 2 ) set aside money for future years in a benefit stabilization fund , or ( 3 ) stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers .
technical comments were incorporated as appropriate .
to assist in further congressional deliberations on m+c participation and payment issues , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) how mcos used the additional money authorized by bipa in 2001 and ( 2 ) the extent to which the availability of m+c plans changed after bipa .
