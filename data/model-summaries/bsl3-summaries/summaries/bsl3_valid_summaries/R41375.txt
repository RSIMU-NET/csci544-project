on may 23 , 2005 , during the first year of president george w. bush's second term , omb issued a memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies .
finally , appendix c of the report discusses how congress in other contexts has responded legislatively to the prospect of ( 1 ) agencies operating under broad grants of discretion to implement laws , and ( 2 ) the president's involvement in agency decision making through omb .
in one case , some details about omb's process were disclosed publicly in june 2010 , which prompted congressional concerns about agency policy implementation and the role of omb .
as of the time of this report's writing , little more is publicly known about how widely the omb memorandum has been used , whether it has been used consistently across agencies and policy areas , and what its effects have been .
for the most part , mandatory spending programs are provided for in substantive laws under the jurisdiction of house and senate authorizing committees .
joshua b. bolten , director of omb at that time , wrote that "effective immediately," omb would involve itself systematically in some aspects of how agencies execute laws related to mandatory spending .
