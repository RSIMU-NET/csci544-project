as a result of this finding , we recommended that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to assess auction methods based on revenue generation , using available information , and select a method that would maximize revenue for the upcoming helium auction .
as detailed in our april 2015 report , in the summer of 2014 , refiners purchased all the helium offered in blm's first - ever competitive helium auction at higher than expected prices .
we reviewed two sources of updated information from june 2015 that interior provided us: a federal register notice stating blm's proposal for the fiscal year 2016 helium auction and sale , and a letter from interior to us containing the department's response to the recommendations in our april 2015 report .
in our april 2015 report , we found that blm had taken steps to help improve reporting by refiners by clarifying one of the key terms in the tolling provision , but the agency did not have full assurance that refiners were satisfying the provision .
to provide the agency with better information to support its decisions when implementing the act , in our april 2015 report , we recommended that the secretary of the interior direct the director of blm to issue a rule — perhaps an interim final rule if blm finds there is good cause to do so , given the time constraints — to require refiners to report information about ( 1 ) signed agreements to toll less than 15 million cubic feet of helium and ( 2 ) their attempts to negotiate tolling agreements that do not result in signed agreements .
