this report examines: 1. recent estimates of workplace retirement savings program coverage , including eligibility and participation , and characteristics of workers who lack coverage ; 2. strategies used by states and other countries to expand coverage among private sector workers ; and 3. potential challenges states could face given existing federal law and regulations .
to do this , congress could , for example , direct or authorize the secretary of labor , in consultation with the secretary of the treasury , to ( 1 ) promulgate regulations prescribing a limited safe harbor under which state workplace retirement savings programs with sufficient safeguards would not be preempted and would receive tax treatment comparable to that provided to private sector workplace retirement savings programs , or ( 2 ) create a pilot program under which dol could select a limited number of states to establish workplace retirement savings programs subject to dol and treasury oversight .
