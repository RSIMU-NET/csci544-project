this report ( 1 ) describes ways in which taxpayers have abused an entity's tax exempt status through abusive tax schemes ; ( 2 ) examines trends in irs's compliance efforts and characteristics of taxpayers audited for using abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt entities ; and ( 3 ) assesses how well irs identifies emerging abusive tax schemes involving tax - exempt organizations and what improvements it could make , if any , to that process .
 ( recommendation 5 ) .
we then applied the following factors to make the final three choices for the examples: how representative the example was of abusive tax - schemes involving tax - exempt entities ; how well - documented we found the example to be in literature reviews ; how recent the example had been used by abusers ; and how much impact the example had in terms of prevalence and tax revenues .
we narrowed our list of examples of abusive tax schemes by focusing on those professionals and researchers who: had recent professional experience as an attorney , accountant , or other industry professional with a firm specializing in tax - exempt entities or tax shelters ; had recent professional experience in nonprofit management or affiliation with professional associations specializing in nonprofit organization or oversight ; had published books , articles , or other research on tax - exempt entities or tax shelters within the last 10 years ; were recommended to us by a relevant professional organization , such as the american bar association or the american institute of certified public accountants ; work for or previously worked in charity tax enforcement at the state previously worked for the internal revenue service ( irs ) , specifically in the tax exempt and government entities division ( te / ge ) ; or would ( in our professional judgment ) be able to speak on the topics of abusive tax avoidance schemes or irs investigations of tax - exempt entities .
