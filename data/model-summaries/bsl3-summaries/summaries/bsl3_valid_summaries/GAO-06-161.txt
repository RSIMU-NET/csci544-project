according to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , combating terrorism includes efforts to secure the homeland ( that is , homeland security activities to detect , deter , protect against , and , if needed , respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the united states ) and those to combat terrorism overseas ( those activities occurring outside the united states and its territories ) , excluding direct military action .
since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the administration and congress have increased funding in support of combating terrorism both at home and abroad .
dhs officials also reported facing similar challenges .
however , omb is no longer required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding data .
however , omb staff said that they have not yet established a timeline for developing such measures .
between fiscal years 2002 and 2005 , funding attributed to homeland security activities increased 39 percent , from $33 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $46 billion for fiscal year 2005 .
for fiscal year 2006 , the president requested nearly $50 billion for activities associated with homeland security .
