our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the topics the agricultural research agency ( ars ) and the national institute of food and agriculture ( nifa ) focus on and the safeguards they use to prevent duplication of research projects , along with any shortcomings in those safeguards , and ( 2 ) collaborative planning ars and nifa engaged in and how , if at all , such planning could be enhanced .
enhance ars's and nifa's collaborative approach across all topic areas they have in common — including holding jointly sponsored meetings with stakeholders — to help set their research priorities and help them determine their roles and responsibilities for carrying out these priorities .
usda , however , has not implemented these recommendations .
require , as usda identifies promising systems for searching and disseminating research project information , the appropriate entity to ( 1 ) determine whether vivo or other systems are more effective or efficient than cris in identifying potentially duplicative research and ( 2 ) revise guidance to reflect the best system and methods for identifying potentially duplicative research projects .
as a result , usda has not assessed its information systems in a way that would allow it to ( 1 ) maximize the usefulness of information and minimize the burden on the public and ( 2 ) avoid unnecessarily duplicating existing information technology capabilities , as described in the 2000 office of management and budget policy .
