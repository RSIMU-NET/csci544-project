this report will provide a brief history of precursor events and studies that led to a rediscovery of poverty in the united states and the development and adoption of an "official" statistical measure to measure the phenomenon and to weigh progress toward its eradication .
the federal government uses two slightly different but related definitions of poverty .
a second definition of poverty , closely related to the statistical definition and issued as "federal poverty guidelines" by the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , is used for administrative purposes , such as determining income eligibility of individuals , families , and households for federal and state programs .
the proposed measure will supplement , rather than replace , the current poverty measure , which will continue to be deemed the "official" statistical measure of poverty in the united states .
a congressionally commissioned study conducted by the national academy of sciences ( nas ) national research council ( nrc ) panel provided a wide range of specific recommendations to revamp the statistical measure of poverty used in the united states in its 1995 report , measuring poverty: a new approach .
