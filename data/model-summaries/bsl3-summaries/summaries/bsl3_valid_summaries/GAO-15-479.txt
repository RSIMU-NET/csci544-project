this report ( 1 ) examines five usaid missions' implementation , performance monitoring , and evaluation of primary grade reading programs and ( 2 ) assesses usaid's efforts to estimate progress toward the 2011-2015 education strategy's primary grade reading goal .
to improve usaid's ability to measure progress in achieving a quantitative reading goal in any future education strategy , we recommend that the acting administrator ensure that the future strategy includes targets that will allow usaid to monitor interim progress toward its goal in comparison with planned performance .
because it took some missions longer to implement primary grade reading programs than usaid estimated in its implementation guidance to the education strategy , usaid expects only about two - thirds of missions with funding for such programs to provide baseline and midline or endline assessment data in time for the data to be used in estimating as figure 8 the agency's progress toward its primary grade reading goal.shows , 26 missions ( 62 percent ) of the 42 with funding for such programs had implemented them by the end of fiscal year 2012 , the target date established in the education strategy's implementation guidance to allow at least 3 years of implementation .
