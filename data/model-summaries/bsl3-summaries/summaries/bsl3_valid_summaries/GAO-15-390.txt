to identify claims that might have been improperly processed and paid by the medicaid program because the federal government had excluded these providers from providing services to medicaid beneficiaries , we compared the medicaid claims to the exclusion and debarment files from the department of health and human services' ( hhs ) office of inspector general ( oig ) and the general services administration ( gsa ) .
