my remarks today — based primarily on our february and may 2010 reports — will focus on the following three issues: ( 1 ) key changes made to state welfare programs in response to tanf and other legislation and the effect of these changes on caseload trends ; ( 2 ) how single parent families with children are faring , including those who receive tanf cash assistance as well as those who are eligible but do not receive assistance ; and ( 3 ) the implications of recent developments on monitoring state tanf programs .
following dra , the u.s. economy experienced a severe recession and , in response , the congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 ( recovery act ) which included provisions affecting tanf such as the creation of a $5 billion emergency contingency fund for state tanf programs .
i will focus on the role of the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) program in providing assistance to this population .
recent changes in state tanf programs made in response to dra as well as changes in the economy have raised questions about how the program has affected low - income families over time and how best to monitor tanf's progress in meeting two of its key goals — to provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives and to end the dependence of needy families on government benefits by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage .
