our objectives were to determine: 1 ) what professional development dod provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal year 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for this purpose were used , ( 2 ) what identification and instructional services dod provides to students who may have dyslexia , and ( 3 ) how dod assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including dyslexia .
in response to these questions , we examined: ( 1 ) what professional development dod provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal years 2004-to - 2006 funds designated for this purpose were used , ( 2 ) what identification and instructional services dod provides to students who may have dyslexia , and ( 3 ) how dod assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities , including dyslexia .
to improve dod's accountability for the academic achievement of its students with disabilities , including certain students who may have dyslexia , we recommend that the secretary of defense instruct the director of the department of defense education activity to publish separate data on the academic achievement of students with disabilities at the systemwide , area , district , and school levels when there are sufficient numbers of students with disabilities to avoid violating students' privacy .
