you asked us to ( 1 ) determine the nature of problems that may have occurred in reporting currency activity for federal reserve note receipts , payments , and amount on hand and ( 2 ) review and comment on corrective actions planned or taken by the federal reserve to resolve those problems .
the fact that we found problems while only attempting to review the reconciliations for a few days increases our concerns about the bank's accounting practices and internal controls over currency .
require that the san francisco district bank and the other two district banks — philadelphia and atlanta — that use the same systems as the san francisco bank and their branches conduct reviews of their cash inventory systems and reporting practices to determine whether they have problems similar to those identified at the l.a. bank .
because two other district banks and their branches use the same cash inventory system and some of the problems in currency reporting are linked to the limitations in the design of this system , we suggest that problems may also have occurred in the san francisco district bank and its other branches and the other two districts using the system .
