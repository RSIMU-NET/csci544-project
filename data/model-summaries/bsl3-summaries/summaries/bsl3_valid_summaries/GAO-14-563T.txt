today , i will ( 1 ) provide summary cost and schedule information on dod's portfolio of major weapon systems ; ( 2 ) describe the policies and processes in place to guide those acquisitions ; ( 3 ) discuss incentives to deviate from otherwise sound acquisition practices ; and ( 4 ) suggest ways to temper these incentives .
over the past 50 years , congress and dod have explored ways to improve acquisition outcomes , including actions like the weapon systems acquisition reform act of 2009 and the department of defense's ( dod's ) own recent “better buying power” initiatives .
weapon systems acquisition has been on gao's high risk list since 1990 .
pressure to make exceptions for programs that do not measure up are rationalized in a number of ways: an urgent threat needs to be met ; a production capability needs to be preserved ; despite shortfalls , the new system is more capable than the one it is replacing ; and the new system's problems will be fixed in the future .
a potential way to reduce the risks taken in acquisition programs is to address the way in which dod leverages its science and technology enterprise .
