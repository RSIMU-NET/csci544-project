s. 1000 is intended to advance this framework and the implementation of telework programs and to increase the eligibility of federal employees for telework as well as its use .
telework is a human capital strategy which offers flexibilities to both employers and employees .
these actions have included recognizing the need for program leadership within the agencies ; encouraging agencies to think broadly in setting eligibility requirements ; requiring that employees be allowed , if eligible , to participate in telework , and requiring tracking and reporting of program results .
this framework has included provisions directed at increasing employee eligibility for telework , requiring reporting and evaluation of telework implementation , establishing agency telework coordinators to lead the program , setting goals for the application of telework provisions to the federal workforce , and even withholding funds from some agencies that fail to show progress .
through a number of legislative actions , congress has indicated its desire that agencies create telework programs to accomplish a number of positive outcomes .
it is increasingly recognized as an important means to achieving a number of federal efforts , including effective strategic human capital management of the federal workforce , and a greater capability to continue operations during emergency events , as well as affording environmental , energy , and other benefits to society .
