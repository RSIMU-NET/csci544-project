our work has shown that dhs and its component agencies — particularly the coast guard and cbp — have made substantial progress in implementing various programs that , collectively , have improved maritime security .
for example , from fiscal years 2004 through may 2012 , cbp obligated over $390 million for a voluntary program that enables cbp officials to work in partnership with private companies to review and validate companies' practices for securing their international supply chains .
lack of planning: given the urgency to take steps to protect the country against terrorism after the september 11 , 2001 attacks , some of the actions taken by dhs and its component agencies used an “implement and amend” approach , which has negatively affected the management of some programs .
dhs and its component agencies have encountered a number of challenges in implementing programs and activities to enhance maritime security since the enactment of mtsa in 2002 .
lack of adequate internal controls: several maritime security programs implemented by dhs and its component agencies did not have adequate internal controls .
another challenge that dhs and its component agencies have faced in implementing maritime security - related programs has been the lack of adequate performance measures .
