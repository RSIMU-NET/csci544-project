in recent years , legislation has been enacted ( 1 ) establishing , consolidating , and repealing legislative branch revolving funds ; ( 2 ) modifying the use of the funds ; ( 3 ) requiring the deposit of receipts associated with some activities while prohibiting expenses associated with others ; ( 4 ) limiting obligational authority ; ( 5 ) allowing a temporary transfer between accounts ; and , in the case of the government publishing office , ( 6 ) providing an appropriation to the fund .
the revolving funds generally fall into two categories: the first provides a means of accounting for services provided by one agency to other governmental entities , while the other covers services for the public .
they may be established for a number of reasons , including a desire ( 1 ) to provide separate accounting for transactions between agencies or business - type transactions , ( 2 ) to isolate and simplify accounting for a single activity , or ( 3 ) to increase flexibility and efficiency of operations .
over time , congress has revisited their use , structure , and solvency ; conducted oversight through hearings and the review of audits ; and considered legislation amending the revolving funds , either through proposals offered by members or at the request of legislative branch agencies .
