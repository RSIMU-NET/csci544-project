federal executive branch agencies hold an extensive real property portfolio that includes more than 871,000 buildings and structures , and 40 million acres of land worldwide .
the process of determining which federal requirements may apply and how compliance must be demonstrated is sometimes referred to as the environmental review process ( or environmental and historical review ) .
healthcare provided by the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , for example , has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital - based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care , with a resulting change in space needs .
the transfer of surplus federal property may be subject to an array of environmental requirements intended to protect human health and safety , natural resources , and cultural resources .
savings generated by the disposal of unneeded properties might be applied to pressing real property needs , such as improving building security or repairing existing facilities , or towards other pressing policy issues , such as reducing the national debt .
these assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions .
in addition to human health and safety hazards , the potential impacts of a transfer on certain natural or cultural resources ( such as historic buildings ) also must be assessed .
