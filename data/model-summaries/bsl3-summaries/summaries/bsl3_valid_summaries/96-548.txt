the legislative process on the senate floor is governed by a set of standing rules , a body of precedents created by rulings of presiding officers or by votes of the senate , a variety of established and customary practices , and ad hoc arrangements the senate makes to meet specific parliamentary and political circumstances .
additional complications are possible , depending on whether the first degree amendment proposes ( 1 ) to insert additional language in the bill without altering anything already in the bill ; ( 2 ) to strike out language from the bill without inserting anything in its place ; ( 3 ) to strike out language from the bill and insert different language instead ; or ( 4 ) to strike out the entire text of the bill ( everything after the enacting or resolving clause at the very beginning of the measure ) and replace it with a different text .
like any legislative institution , the senate is both a deliberative and a decision - making body ; its procedures must embody some balance between the opportunity to deliberate or debate and the need to decide .
therefore , the senate has developed a variety of practices by which senators set aside some of their prerogatives under the rules to expedite the conduct of its business or to accommodate the needs and interests of its members .
