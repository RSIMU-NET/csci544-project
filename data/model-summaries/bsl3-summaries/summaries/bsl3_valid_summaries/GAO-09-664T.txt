as agreed , today we will discuss ( 1 ) challenges va faces in formulating its health care budget and ( 2 ) some issues surrounding the possibility of providing advance appropriations for va health care .
consideration of any proposal to change the availability of the appropriations va receives for health care should take into account the current structure of the federal budget , the congressional budget process — including budget enforcement — and the nature of the nation's fiscal challenge .
currently the concurrent budget resolution both caps the total amount that can be provided through advance appropriations and identifies the agencies or programs which may be provided such funding .
even if only a portion of va health care funding is to be provided in advance appropriations , congress will need to determine what that share should be and how it should be allocated across va's medical accounts .
in 2006 and 2009 , we issued reports that examined some of the challenges va faces in budget formulation ; these reports pertained to va's overall health care budget as well as portions of its budget that pertain to long - term care .
our 2006 report on va's overall health care budget found that va underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning from military operations in afghanistan and iraq , in part because estimates for fiscal year 2005 were based on data that largely predated the iraq conflict .
