 ( recommendation 1 ) the secretary of the navy should ensure that the commandant of the marine corps designates a single entity responsible for directing , overseeing , and coordinating efforts to achieve the objective of establishing an enterprise - wide performance management process that links resources to readiness .
according to officials in the office of programs and resources , the marine corps is currently conducting a fiscal code alignment effort to address inconsistent use of fiscal codes , but this effort is in its early stages , and the marine corps has not yet developed clear guidance for implementation of the effort .
one of the primary reasons that the marine corps cannot fully track all training funds through the budget cycle is that the office of programs and resources has not established the consistent use of fiscal codes to provide greater detail about the use of funds across the budget cycle phases , and the accuracy of these fiscal codes is sometimes questionable .
we are making the following three recommendations: the secretary of the navy should ensure that the deputy commandant for the office of programs and resources oversee development and implementation of an approach to enable tracking of unit - level training funds through the budget cycle .
