in recent years , the department of defense ( dod ) has become increasingly concerned about its ability to retain enough personnel to fulfill its missions and is particularly concerned about retaining personnel who possess specialized skills .
widespread reports of flagging military morale raise an important question: is dissatisfaction with the military way of life driving highly trained individuals out , or are they being lured away by more favorable civilian opportunities ? .
in response to your request , we analyzed the results of dod's 1999 broad - based survey of active duty personnel to help shed light on why servicemembers in critical occupational areas might be leaving the military .
human capital management is not only a problem for dod , but as we have reported , it is also an area of concern throughout the federal government today .
overall , the military reports that it is meeting its aggregate retention goals , but dod leaders remain concerned that they are significantly challenged in their efforts to compete with the private sector for individuals with specialized skills .
dod officials attribute retention problems in certain occupations to factors such as the growth of civilian job opportunities , the negative impact of increasing military operations , and servicemembers' concerns over benefits and quality - of - life conditions .
