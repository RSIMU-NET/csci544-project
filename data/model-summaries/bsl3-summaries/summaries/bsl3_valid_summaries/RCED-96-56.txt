the department of energy ( doe ) has about 55 million gallons of highly radioactive waste currently stored in 177 underground tanks at its hanford site in washington state .
because of characterization's importance to the cleanup and safe storage of the wastes , our objectives were to ( 1 ) review doe's progress in meeting the deadlines , ( 2 ) identify any impediments to making progress , and ( 3 ) determine what impact continued delays could have .
while many factors have contributed to the slow pace of the characterization effort , the primary reasons for slow progress are that ( 1 ) doe and westinghouse have not yet determined how to successfully draw reliable samples and characterize the waste and ( 2 ) managerial weaknesses with the characterization program and other aspects of the tank farms have exacerbated delays and contributed to operational inefficiencies .
however , their reliability is largely untested .
the review should focus on determining ( 1 ) how much and what kind of information is sufficient to reliably characterize the tank wastes and predict the quantities and conditions of the waste constituents and ( 2 ) the amount and quality of characterization information needed for doe to proceed with the design and construction of waste treatment facilities .
