the bush administration notified congress on february 12 , 2004 , that it intends to begin free trade agreement ( fta ) negotiations with thailand .
this notification , which follows an october 19 , 2003 announcement by president bush and former thai prime minister thaskin of their agreement to launch negotiations , allows for talks to begin within 90 days or by mid - may 2004 , after required consultations with congress .
since the april election , no decision has been made yet to resume the negotiations due to ongoing political turmoil ( the april election was invalidated by the constitutional court and a new general election is to take place this fall ) .
the u.s. - thailand fta negotiations are of interest to congress because ( 1 ) an agreement would require passage of implementing legislation to become operational ; ( 2 ) an agreement could increase u.s. exports of goods , services , and investment ; ( 3 ) an agreement could increase competition for u.s. import - competing industries such as textiles and apparel and pick - up trucks ; and ( 4 ) if an agreement is implemented , thailand would become the second asian fta partner ( the first was singapore ) for the united states .
