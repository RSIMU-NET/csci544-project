this report examines the extent to which tsa has ( 1 ) coordinated with relevant dhs entities to review passenger screening rules and ( 2 ) assessed the effectiveness of its passenger screening rules .
 ( recommendation 3 ) .
the act includes a provision for gao to study whether the rules are effective in mitigating potential threats to aviation security ; and whether , and if so how , tsa coordinates with dhs regarding any proposed change to a rule .
we are making the following three recommendations to tsa: the administrator of tsa should clarify the criteria for exigent circumstances and standard rule review procedures ; ( recommendation 1 ) the administrator of tsa should document which rule review process tsa i&a uses ( exigent or standard ) for each new rule or rule change ; ( recommendation 2 ) the administrator of tsa should explore additional data sources measuring the effectiveness of silent partner and quiet skies rules .
exploring additional data sources — such as checkpoint screening results and federal air marshal service after - action reports — could help tsa refine and supplement their existing efforts to measure program effectiveness .
following the attempted attack , the transportation security administration ( tsa ) sought new ways to identify and designate passengers for enhanced screening like the person responsible for the 2009 attempted attack .
