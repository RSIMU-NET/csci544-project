our objectives were to describe ( 1 ) the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the chemical industry ; ( 2 ) dhs's efforts to identify high - risk chemical facilities , assess their vulnerabilities , ensure that facilities are addressing security , and coordinate with the environmental protection agency ( epa ) in these efforts ; ( 3 ) chemical industry security initiatives and challenges ; and ( 4 ) dhs's existing authorities , and whether additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities take action to address vulnerabilities .
specifically , this report discusses ( 1 ) dhs's actions to develop an overall strategy for protecting the chemical industry ; ( 2 ) dhs's efforts to identify high - risk chemical facilities , assess their vulnerabilities , ensure that facilities are addressing security , and coordinate with epa in these efforts ; ( 3 ) chemical industry security initiatives and challenges ; and ( 4 ) dhs's existing authorities and whether additional legislative authority is needed to ensure that chemical facilities take action to address vulnerabilities .
to enhance dhs's ability to collect comprehensive information on industry preparedness and better ensure the security of the chemical sector , we recommend that the congress consider the following two actions: granting dhs the authority to require high - risk chemical facilities to assess their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and , where necessary , to take corrective action and providing dhs with the enforcement capability to ensure that facilities are following these practices .
