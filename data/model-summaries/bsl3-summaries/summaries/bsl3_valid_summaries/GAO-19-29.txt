 ( recommendation 1 ) the secretary of defense should ensure that the deputy secretary of defense — in coordination with the military departments ; u.s. strategic command ; the assistant secretary of defense for nuclear , chemical , and biological defense programs ; cape ; and other relevant components of dod — establish in the planned charter and dod directive methods for the nderg to communicate and collaborate with other organizations that have oversight responsibilities for portions of the nuclear enterprise .
dod has also made progress in implementing the recommendations from the 2015 nc3 report .
in 2015 , dod conducted a review focused on nuclear command , control , and communications ( nc3 ) systems , which resulted in a report ( hereafter referred to as the 2015 nc3 report ) with recommendations to address diffused responsibility , accountability , and authority for the nc3 enterprise ; ineffective life - cycle management programs ; and a lack of institutional training and personnel management programs .
