because of your interest in ensuring that federal training programs accommodate small employers , you asked that we ( 1 ) provide information on the extent to which small employers participate in employment training programs of different types , ( 2 ) identify barriers that may limit their participation , and ( 3 ) discuss ways to address such barriers .
as reform of the federal employment training system continues to be debated , our work suggests that a greater role for or use of consortia or increased technical assistance provided to employers could make federal training programs more accessible to small employers .
generally , federal employment training programs target specific populations of workers , such as dislocated workers â€” those who have been or will be permanently laid off due to plant closures or corporate downsizing .
both of these state programs aim to meet their objectives by working directly with the employer community ; that is , they work with employers to encourage the training of existing workers and , in some cases , new hires .
typically , federally funded programs target specific populations of unemployed or underemployed workers ; state - and privately funded programs target employers and their existing workforce ( and in some cases , new hires ) .
