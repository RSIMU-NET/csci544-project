the conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $436.6 billion in new appropriations for defense , including $366.6 billion in regular appropriations and $70 billion in additional appropriations as a "bridge fund" for operations abroad and for some other purposes .
in the absence of an agreement , on may 18 , the house also approved a measure "deeming" the provisions of its version of the budget resolution , including a cap of $872.8 billion on total discretionary spending , to be in effect for purposes of subsequent house action .
the senate - passed bill provided $9 billion less than the request , which , in turn , allowed increases above the administration request in non - defense appropriations while remaining within the budget resolution cap on total discretionary spending .
