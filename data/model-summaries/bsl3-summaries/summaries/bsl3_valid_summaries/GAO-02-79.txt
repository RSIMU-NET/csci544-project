specifically , for this review , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine what actions usps has taken to respond to the recommendations in our september 2000 report relating to its e - commerce activities ; ( 2 ) update the status and performance of usps' e - commerce initiatives ; and ( 3 ) compare federal privacy laws , regulations , and policies that apply to usps in the e - commerce area to those that apply to private - sector providers and discuss voluntary privacy protections provided by usps and selected private - sector providers .
in our september 2000 report , we recommended that the postmaster general ( 1 ) take appropriate actions to help ensure that e - commerce and other related initiatives are appropriately identified and maintain accurate and complete information related to the status of these initiatives , ( 2 ) follow processes and controls that have been established for developing and approving e - commerce initiatives , and ( 3 ) provide complete and accurate information on costs and revenues for e - commerce initiatives .
to ensure that usps develops reliable and consistent financial information for all of its new products and services , we recommend that the postmaster general develop a comprehensive set of policies and procedures for capturing , attributing , and reporting revenues and expenses associated with its new products and services and that are consistent with prc's cost attribution policies ; provide an annual report to the senate committee on governmental affairs , house committee on government reform , and prc showing its revenues and expenses for new products and services individually and in aggregate that has been audited by an independent entity for the purpose of determining that the report was prepared in accordance with the service's policies and procedures and generally accepted accounting principles ; and provide the audited report for fiscal year 2001 by may 1 , 2002 , and by may 1 for each subsequent year .
