to assist federal agencies in making the best use of federal export promotion resources and to assist u.s. exporters , we recommend that the chairman of the tpcc ensure that its national export strategies consistently ( 1 ) identify agencies' specific goals within the strategies' broad priorities , ( 2 ) identify how agencies' resources are allocated in support of their specific goals , and ( 3 ) analyze progress made in addressing the recommendations in the committee's prior annual strategies .
specifically , we assessed ( 1 ) whether the committee's strategy has established export priorities , assessed progress made toward achieving the strategy's priorities , and proposed an alignment of federal resources in support of these priorities ; and ( 2 ) whether the committee has made progress in coordinating the various agencies' export promotion programs .
