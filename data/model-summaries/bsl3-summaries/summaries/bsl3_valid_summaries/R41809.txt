issues and questions related to the killing of osama bin laden ( obl ) are multifaceted and may have operational , regional , and policy implications .
the killing of obl nearly 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the united states poses many questions about the continuing destructive capabilities of aq , the effects on regional affiliates , and u.s. policy implications in pakistan and afghanistan .
on may 2 , secretary of state clinton argued that "history will record that bin laden's death came at a time of great movements toward freedom and democracy , at a time when the people across the middle east and north africa are rejecting the extremist narratives and charting a path of peaceful progress based on universal rights and aspirations .
operational policy issues include congressional notification , legal considerations , and current and future military activities .
as intelligence operations in the wake of the recent raid on obl's compound shed light on core aq and its affiliates' activities , policymakers may be presented with new information to help in determining how the u.s. and international counterterrorism communities might initiate changes to transnational security and foreign policy strategies .
