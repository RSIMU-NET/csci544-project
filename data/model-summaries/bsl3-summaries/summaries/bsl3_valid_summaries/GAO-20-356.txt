this report examines ( 1 ) the extent to which the program is meeting cost goals and ( 2 ) performance and schedule challenges that the program has experienced in developmental testing and plans for addressing them .
we are not making any recommendations in this report .
the navy's vh - 92a® program is to replace the aging presidential helicopter fleet , which has been in service for several decades .
our reports highlighted , in part , the extent to which the navy used the lessons learned from the failed vh - 71 program — the need to balance requirements , costs , and schedule and the importance of establishing a knowledge - based program that is aligned with acquisition best practices — in its new effort .
should iot&e demonstrate that efforts to address the mcs performance issues or other previously identified issues are insufficient — or if the testing identifies new issues that result in the program being unable to meet its operational requirements — then the program may need to identify , test and incorporate changes into the vh - 92a's design and into the helicopters already in production , further delaying the program and increasing associated costs .
