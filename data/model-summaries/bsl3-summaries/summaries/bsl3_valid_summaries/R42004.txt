in the information age , data of varying types have become increasingly valuable .
data can be used particularly to better target advertising and other forms of marketing to specific individuals .
for example , courts have struggled with fundamental questions , such as whether the sale and aggregation of data is speech at all , and , as discussed in the cases below , what standard of scrutiny to apply to restrictions on trade in data if it is speech .
this general process is used across a wide array of industries , and it raises a number of first amendment and privacy questions .
the preferences of individuals can be aggregated and analyzed in such a way as to better predict future habits .
three states — maine , new hampshire , and vermont — enacted statutes to restrict the sale and use of prescriber history data for the purposes of marketing ( though not for any other purpose ) without the consent of the doctor .
these questions are particularly salient in the market for health related data .
the court found that the vermont law seemed to be designed to make the message of pharmaceutical marketers less effective in an effort to bring down the costs of prescription drugs , and thereby advantage the communication of state - supported content .
