the exon - florio amendment to the defense production act authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions , mergers , or takeovers of u.s. companies if ( 1 ) there is credible evidence that a foreign controlling interest might threaten national security and ( 2 ) legislation , other than exon - florio and the international emergency economic powers act , does not adequately or appropriately protect national security .
specifically , we ( 1 ) determined the circumstances under which the committee formally investigates acquisitions and ( 2 ) identified weaknesses in the committee's process for implementing exon - florio that limit its effectiveness .
weaknesses in the committee's process for implementing exon - florio may in some cases have resulted in ineffective national security protections because the committee allowed withdrawal of cases in which the acquisition had been completed without establishing interim protections , used nonspecific provisions or language in agreements it had concluded with companies to mitigate national security concerns , and did not identify the agency responsible for overseeing implementation and monitoring compliance with the agreement .
in most instances , the committee concluded its activities under exon - florio within 30 days of receiving notification because ( 1 ) the committee did not identify any issues of national security , ( 2 ) the companies and the government agencies addressed potential national security concerns prior to filing , or ( 3 ) the companies and the government agreed on measures to mitigate national security concerns before the end of the 30-day review .
