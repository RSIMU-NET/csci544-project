this report: reviews allegations of involvement by saudis in terrorist financing together with saudi rebuttals ; discusses the question of saudi support for palestinian organizations and religious charities and schools ( madrasas ) abroad ; analyzes recent steps taken by saudi arabia to counter terrorist financing ( many in conjunction with the united states ) ; and suggests some implications of recent saudi actions for u.s. counterterrorism policy .
support for palestinian causes and the provision of humanitarian aid to palestinians has long been an important component of saudi foreign policy , and many saudis identify strongly with the palestinian people and view support for palestinian causes as a religious , cultural , or , in some cases , political obligation .
since the 1970s , private saudi citizens , saudi government ministries , saudi government charitable committees , and international islamic charity organizations based in saudi arabia have provided financial and relief assistance to muslims around the world .
several committees and members in the 108 th and 109 th congresses expressed interest in these issues and held hearings and introduced legislation relating to u.s. - saudi cooperation in the fight against terrorism and terrorist financing .
this has included the provision of assistance to individuals and groups engaged in or victimized by various nationalist and religious conflicts .
