specifically , we examined how fra ( 1 ) focuses its efforts on the highest priority risks related to train accidents in planning its safety oversight , ( 2 ) identifies safety problems on railroad systems in carrying out its oversight , and ( 3 ) assesses the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
in addition , the action plan announced a new approach for planning inspections that uses data - driven models to focus inspectors' efforts on locations that are likely to have safety problems .
in carrying out its safety oversight , fra identifies safety problems on railroad systems mainly through routine inspections that determine whether operating practices , track , and equipment , such as signals and locomotives , are in compliance with minimum safety standards .
it includes initiatives to address the two main causes of train accidents — human factors and defective track — and fra has pursued some additional initiatives to address these causes since issuing the plan .
however , most of them have not yet been fully implemented , and their overall impact on safety will probably not be apparent for a number of years .
fra uses a broad range of goals and measures to assess the impact of its oversight efforts on safety .
