invasive species — harmful , nonnative plants , animals , and microorganisms — are found throughout the united states , causing billions of dollars of damage annually to crops , rangelands , and waterways .
for example , zebra mussels are a widely known aquatic invasive .
invasive species have also had a devastating effect on natural areas , where they have strangled native flora , taken over wetland habitats , and deprived waterfowl and other species of food sources .
transported into the great lakes in ships' ballast water , zebra mussels have clogged the water pipes of electric companies and other industries ; infestations in the midwest and northeast have cost power plants and industrial facilities almost $70 million between 1989 and 1995 .
in general , the plan's rapid response recommendations call for developing a coordinated rapid response program ; developing draft legislation for rapid response , with the possibility of permanent funding ; and expanding regional networks of invasive species databases .
three of the recommendations specifically address rapid response ; a number of others address related areas including early detection .
our first report — invasive species: federal and selected state funding to address harmful , nonnative species ( gao / rced - 00-219 , aug. 24 , 2000 ) — addressed federal and selected state funding for eight activities relating to invasive species .
