these statutes establish a broad - based set of expectations for improving financial management , such as producing reliable financial reports , generating sound cost and performance information , fixing weaknesses in systems and controls , and building effective financial management organizations .
the federal government can continue to make progress in implementing financial management reforms , but the pace and extent of improvement will depend upon the dedication of agency heads and their senior management teams , especially the chief financial officers , and the ability to deal with a range of financial management systems issues , as well as continuing emphasis by the congress on financial management reform .
this legislative framework includes the 1990 chief financial officers ( cfo ) act , as expanded by the 1994 government management reform act , as well as the 1996 federal financial management improvement act ( ffmia ) .
considerable effort is underway across government to make needed improvements and progress is being made , but a great deal of perseverance will be required to fully attain the legislative goals set by federal financial management statutes .
this discipline is needed to correct long - standing serious weaknesses in federal financial management systems , controls , and reporting practices .
