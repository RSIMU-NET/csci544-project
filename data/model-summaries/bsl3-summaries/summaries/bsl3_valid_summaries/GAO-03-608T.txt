according to the internal revenue service ( irs ) , an increasing number of charities are turning to vehicle donations as an effective way to raise money .
because charities have increasingly turned to vehicle donation programs to raise funds , interest has been raised regarding how these programs operate .
in order to make informed decisions about these donations , however , taxpayers should be aware of how vehicle donation programs operate , the role of charities and third - party fund - raisers in the vehicle donation process , and irs rules and regulations regarding allowable tax deductions .
we plan to conduct a nation - wide survey of charities to determine their use of vehicle donation programs , and the importance of the programs to their operations .
today , i will discuss ( 1 ) the vehicle donation process , ( 2 ) the amount of proceeds received by selected charities and commercial fund - raisers , ( 3 ) donor tax deductions , and ( 4 ) taxpayer guidance and cautions .
one charity reported that starting a vehicle donation program helped it avoid a potential deficit after it had to cancel a major fund - raising event due to the events of september 11 , 2001 .
