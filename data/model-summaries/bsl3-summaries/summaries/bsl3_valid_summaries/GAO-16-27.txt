this report addresses the extent to which the test program ( 1 ) reduces administrative costs , and ( 2 ) enhances subcontracting opportunities for small businesses .
given these findings , and that dod had not acted on the 2007 review recommendation to work with congress to make the program permanent , we included a recommendation in the draft report for dod to draft a legislative proposal to make the program permanent or otherwise work with congress to determine the status of the test program .
section 821 ( e ) of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2015 included a provision for us to report on the results of the department of defense's test program for negotiation of comprehensive small business subcontracting plans ( test program ) .
despite the 25- year tenure of the test program , little is publicly known about its results , as the department of defense ( dod ) has not published any reports on its performance .
in 1989 , congress authorized the test program for negotiation of comprehensive small business subcontracting plans ( test program ) , which permits participating contractors to submit a single subcontracting plan covering all of their contracts rather than a separate plan for each contract .
