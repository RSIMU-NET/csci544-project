a land exchange , po pularly viewed as a swap or a trade , is a real estate transaction where the disposal ( sale ) and acquisition ( purchase ) of land are combined .
the bureau of land management ( blm ) , in the department of the interior ( doi ) , is authorized to exchange land or interests in land under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 ( flpma ) , as amended by the federal land exchange facilitation act of 1988 ( flefa ) , as well as under other authorities .
administrative exchanges under flpma often are referred to as discretionary exchanges , because flpma does not require the agency and nonfederal parties to exchange lands .
a key issue for congress is the extent to which the reorganization of the appraisal function and the implementation of other appraisal and exchange reforms addressed perceived problems and improved land transactions .
blm implementing regulations are contained in 43 c.f.r .
additional information is contained in blm's land exchange handbook and various agency instruction memoranda .
