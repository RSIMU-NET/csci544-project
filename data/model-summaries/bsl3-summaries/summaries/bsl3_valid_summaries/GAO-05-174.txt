this report discusses ( 1 ) the extent to which federal housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households and what is known about the effectiveness of these programs in assisting the elderly , ( 2 ) the types of supportive services that these programs provide for the elderly , and ( 3 ) how hud and usda avoid overlap and duplication in programs that offer similar types of housing assistance to the elderly .
to determine the extent to which federal housing assistance programs provide benefits to elderly households , we first identified the relevant programs through a literature search , review of the catalog of federal domestic assistance , and consultation with department of housing and urban development ( hud ) and department of agriculture ( usda ) officials .
finally , we did not evaluate the extent to which the programs we reviewed addressed the needs of eligible elderly households because ( 1 ) complete data on the number of elderly households occupying units provided by federal housing programs were not available , and ( 2 ) eligibility criteria for each program varied , making it difficult to establish the number of eligible elderly households .
we included housing assistance programs that ( 1 ) subsidize mortgage interest rates , rent , or housing repair or rehabilitation ; ( 2 ) provide mortgage insurance , loan guarantees , or direct loans for single - family or multifamily housing ; or ( 3 ) support the construction , rehabilitation , or purchase of multifamily housing or assisted living facilities .
