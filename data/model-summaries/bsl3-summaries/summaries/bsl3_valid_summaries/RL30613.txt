ever since the bush administration's october 2008 removal of north korea from the u.s. state sponsors of terrorism list , a series of actions by north korea have led to calls for the obama administration to return pyongyang to the list .
the non - north korea five parties to the talks ( the united states , south korea , china , japan , and russia ) also had not completed the delivery of 1 million tons of heavy oil that they had promised in the february 2007 agreement .
in addition to data on terrorist trends , groups , and activities worldwide , country reports provide a description as to why countries are on the u.s. list of state sponsors of terrorism that are subject to u.s. sanctions .
given north korea's long track record of seeking financial subsidies from other governments in nuclear and other negotiations , one of pyongyang's phase three demands could be for the united states to follow the removal of north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism with an "affirmative" act of proposing that the international monetary fund and the world bank extend financial aid to north korea .
