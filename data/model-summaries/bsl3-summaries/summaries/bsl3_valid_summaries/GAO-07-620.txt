the special operations command ( socom ) was established in 1987 to oversee the training , doctrine , and equipping of all u.s. special operations forces ( sof ) .
the other 35 ( 40 percent ) of socom's 86 programs have experienced or are likely to experience modest to , in a number of cases , significant cost increases and schedule delays due to a range of technical , programmatic , or funding issues .
to assess and determine the management and workforce challenges facing socom , we ( 1 ) reviewed and analyzed the current impact that unfunded near - term requirements had on the regular approved acquisition programs ; ( 2 ) we reviewed and analyzed the command's key acquisition program management tool — the special operations acquisition and logistics information system — for managing its acquisition programs ; and ( 3 ) to assess the workforce challenges that socom faces , we interviewed key socom acquisition officials from socom's special operations acquisition and logistics center and key civilian and military personnel management officials at tampa , florida .
socom has encountered difficulties over the past several years with two of its flagship acquisition programs — the advanced seal delivery system ( asds ) and the cv - 22 advanced vertical lift aircraft .
