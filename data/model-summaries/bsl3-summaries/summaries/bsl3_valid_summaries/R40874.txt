policymakers are dedicating considerable attention to greenhouse gas emission reduction , primarily discussing options for carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) emission reduction .
less frequently addressed in proposed legislation is emission reduction for non - co 2 greenhouse gases , such as nitrous oxide ( n 2 o ) .
the outcomes of the montreal protocol , put into action in the late 1980s , may prove useful to congress in understanding the long - term implications of certain climate change policy options , specifically cap - and - trade .
congress has begun to investigate the reduction of non - co 2 greenhouse gas emissions , including n 2 o emissions , as one strategy to mitigate climate change .
with or without odp substance listing , congress may find it useful to incorporate the ozone depletion impacts of n 2 o into its climate change policy proposals both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to further ozone recovery achievements .
the five non - co 2 greenhouse gases regularly monitored but not entirely regulated by epa ( methane , nitrous oxide , hydroflourocarbons , perflourocarbons , and sulfur hexaflouride ) accounted for approximately 17% of u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions in 2009 , as measured by total tons of co 2 equivalent .
