on june 30 , 2007 , the united states and south korea signed the u.s. - south korea free trade agreement ( korus fta ) .
if approved by congress , it would be the second - largest u.s. free - trade agreement in terms of the value of trade affected , next to the north american free trade agreement , nafta .
on december 3 , 2010 , the united states and south korea reached a further agreement that modified the auto sector provisions .
the provisions concerning automobiles and auto parts are among the most controversial elements of the korus fta .
one prominent issue in that discussion is the agreement's specific rules of origin ( roo ) for automobiles and auto parts .
nonetheless , these provisions have continued to generate considerable debate in congress .
these rules will be used to determine if automotive goods imported from south korea are eligible to receive duty - free or reduced tariff benefits under the korus fta , and whether automotive goods from the united states are eligible for corresponding benefits upon export to south korea .
an rvc test requires that a certain percentage of the value of a manufactured product ( as determined by the cost of inputs , labor , and other direct costs of processing operations ) originate in the fta region .
