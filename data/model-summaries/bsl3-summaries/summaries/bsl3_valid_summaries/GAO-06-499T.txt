to address your request , we assessed ( 1 ) the interim results of irs's 2006 filing season performance compared to prior years ; ( 2 ) irs's budget request compared to prior years ; and ( 3 ) how the budget helps irs achieve its long - term goals aimed at reducing the tax gap .
since the passage of the internal revenue service ( irs ) restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( rra 98 ) , irs has made noticeable improvements to taxpayer services such as telephone assistance and delivered some modernized information systems that , among other benefits , speed up refunds to taxpayers .
irs has also increased revenue collected through its enforcement programs ; however , tax law enforcement continues to be included on our list of high - risk federal programs .
irs's budget request sets two long - term goals: increasing the rate of voluntary compliance from 83 percent to 85 percent by 2009 and reducing the percentage of taxpayers who think it is acceptable to cheat on their taxes from 10 percent to 9 percent in 2008 .
increased funding financed some of the improvements , but a significant portion has been financed internally through efficiencies from increased electronic filing of tax returns and other operational improvements .
