because of your particular interest in the use of impact evaluations as a way of determining program effectiveness , our objectives were to ( 1 ) describe the value of conducting impact evaluations , ( 2 ) describe their current use in evaluating selected early childhood education and care programs , and ( 3 ) discuss the value of other types of early childhood education and care studies the departments of health and human services ( hhs ) and education currently promote and sponsor .
these funds provided a variety of services and support to children and their families to meet a range of goals , from increasing low - income families' access to affordable child care to ensuring that children's educational , health , and social needs are met .
in 1999 , at least $9 billion in federal funds supported early education and care services for children younger than 5 .
given the large federal investment and the current attention on the importance of early childhood experiences , policymakers are interested in the effectiveness of federally funded early childhood education and care efforts and the types of research designs available for determining whether these programs are meeting their objectives for children .
