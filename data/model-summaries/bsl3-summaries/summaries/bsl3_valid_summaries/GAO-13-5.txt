to ensure that servicemembers have equitable access to the military services' wounded warrior programs , including the rcp , and to establish central accountability for these programs , we recommend that the secretary of defense establish or designate an office to centrally oversee and monitor the activities of the military services' wounded warrior programs to include the following: develop consistent eligibility criteria to ensure that similarly situated recovering servicemembers from different military services have uniform access to these programs .
this should include holding the joint executive council accountable for ensuring that key issues affecting recovering servicemembers and veterans get sufficient consideration , including recommendations made by the warrior care and coordination task force and the recovering warrior task force ; developing mechanisms for making joint policy decisions ; involving the appropriate decision - makers for timely implementation of policy ; and establishing mechanisms to systematically oversee joint initiatives and ensure that outcomes and goals are identified and achieved .
a series of media reports in early 2007 disclosed troublesome deficiencies in the provision of outpatient services at walter reed army medical center in washington , d.c .
however , wwctp's ability to oversee the rcp , including its ability to monitor program performance and ensure compliance with dod policy , is limited by its lack of operational authority , such as budget and tasking authority , over the military services that implement the program .
