as congress monitors the progress of federal departments and agencies in implementing cloud computing , its options for ongoing oversight include holding hearings ; requesting review of an agency's status by either the agency itself or the gao ; and assessing the agency's progress and projected goals against the stated goals of the cloud smart strategy .
since 2009 , the federal government has been shifting its data storage needs to cloud - based services and away from agency - owned , in - house data centers .
this shift is intended to achieve two goals: reduce the total investment by the federal government in information technology ( it ) , which currently stands at about $90 billion each year , and realize other stated advantages of cloud adoption , including efficiency , accessibility , collaboration , reliability , and security .
15 of the 16 agencies identified nine cloud investments that enhanced the availability of weather - related information ; facilitated collaboration and information sharing among federal , state , and local agencies related to homeland security ; and provided benefits information to veterans .
according to a survey conducted in september 2018 , federal it managers continue to express long - held concerns about security in certain cloud environments , the complexity of migrating existing ( "legacy" ) applications to the cloud , a lack of skilled staff to manage certain cloud environments , and uncertain funding .
