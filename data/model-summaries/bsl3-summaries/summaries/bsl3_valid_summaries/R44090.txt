recent expansion in natural gas production — primarily the result of new or improved technologies ( e.g. , hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling ) used on unconventional resources ( e.g. , shale , tight sands , and coal - bed methane ) — has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the u.s. energy market .
many in both the public and the private sectors have advocated for the increased production and use of natural gas because the resource is domestically available , economically recoverable , and a potential "cost - effective bridge" to a less polluting and lower greenhouse - gas - intensive economy .
debate continues as to whether the increased production and use of natural gas brings net benefits to the general economy , including jobs , investments , infrastructure , national security , human health , safety , and the environment .
natural gas is cleaner - burning ; it emits less carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) than oil or coal when used to generate electricity in a typical power plant .
on the one hand , a shift to natural gas is promoted as climate change mitigation because it has a lower co 2 emissions intensity than either oil or coal ( i.e. , it is commonly stated that natural gas has half the co 2 emissions intensity of coal ) .
