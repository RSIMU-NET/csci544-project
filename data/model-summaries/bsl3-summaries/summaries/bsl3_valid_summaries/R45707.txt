the original tria legislation's stated goals were to ( 1 ) create a temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured terrorism losses to allow the private market to stabilize ; ( 2 ) protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks ; and ( 3 ) preserve state regulation of insurance .
in november 2002 , congress responded to the fears of economic damage due to the absence of commercially available coverage for terrorism with passage of the terrorism risk insurance act ( tria ) .
prior to the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states , insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for coverage of terrorism risk .
bills to expand tria were resisted by then - president george w. bush's administration , and previous presidential budgets under then - president obama called for changes in the program that would have had the effect of scaling back the tria coverage .
for example , although the april 2013 bombing in boston was termed an "act of terror," by the president , the insured losses in tria - eligible insurance from that bombing did not cross the $5 million statutory threshold to be certified under tria .
