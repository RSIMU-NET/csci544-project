in order to ensure the long - term effectiveness of institutional controls , we recommend that the administrator , epa: clarify agency guidance on institutional controls to help epa site managers and other decision makers understand in what cases institutional controls are or are not necessary at sites where contamination remains in place after cleanup ; ensure that , in selecting institutional controls , adequate consideration is given to their objectives ; the specific control mechanisms to be used ; the timing of implementation and duration ; and the parties responsible for implementing , monitoring , and enforcing them ; ensure that the frequency and scope of monitoring at deleted superfund sites and closed rcra facilities where contamination has been left in place are sufficient to maintain the protectiveness of any institutional controls at these sites ; and ensure that the information on institutional controls reported in the superfund and rcra corrective action tracking systems accurately reflects actual conditions and not just what is called for in site decision documents .
