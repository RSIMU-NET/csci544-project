as reported to the office of management and budget ( omb ) , federal agencies plan to spend at least $82 billion on it in fiscal year 2014 .
omb generally agreed with this recommendation .
omb neither agreed nor disagreed with these recommendations .
however , despite spending hundreds of billions on it since 2000 , the federal government has experienced failed it projects and has achieved little of the productivity improvements that private industry has realized from it .
this initiative's four high - level goals are to promote the use of “green it” by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers ; reduce the cost of data center hardware , software , and operations ; increase the overall it security posture of the government ; and shift it investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies .
in combating this problem , proper oversight is critical .
given the scale of such planned outlays and the criticality of many of these systems to the health , economy , and security of the nation , it is important that omb and federal agencies provide appropriate oversight and transparency into these programs and avoid duplicative investments , whenever possible , to ensure the most efficient use of resources .
