my testimony today will focus on four key issues as they relate to the implementation of the chafee program: 1. how states' funding allocations for independent living programs compare when considering the number of youth eligible for services , 2. the extent to which states have expanded independent living services and age groups for youth in foster care after the passage of fcia and what challenges remain , 3. the extent to which states have used other federal and state programs to coordinate the delivery of independent living services to foster care youth , and 4. how the states and the department of health and human services ( hhs ) have fulfilled the program accountability provisions of the law and assessed the effectiveness of independent living services .
hhs did not comment on this recommendation .
these recommendations have not been implemented .
at the time of our review in 2004 , all states had developed their initial multiyear plans for their programs and submitted annual reports to the administration for children and families ( acf ) , but using these plans and the reports to assess state performance was hindered by inconsistencies between the plans and reports , an absence of goals and baseline information to use in measuring progress , and incomplete information on outcomes for all youth who received services .
