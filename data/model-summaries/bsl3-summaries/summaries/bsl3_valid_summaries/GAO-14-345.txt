the objectives of our review were to: ( 1 ) determine the extent to which the mine safety and health administration ( msha ) used recent coal workers' pneumoconiosis ( cwp ) trend data as a basis for its proposed exposure limit on coal mine dust , and ( 2 ) obtain experts' views on ways to lower the level of dust in coal mines , including their associated advantages , disadvantages , and cost .
in may 2013 , you requested that we conduct an additional analysis of the data msha used to support its proposal and provide information on existing technologies that could be used to reduce dust levels in coal mines .
coal mine dust is one of the most serious occupational hazards in the coal mining industry , and overexposure can cause coal workers' pneumoconiosis ( cwp ) and a number of other lung diseases collectively referred to as black lung disease .
in the preamble to its proposed rule , msha cited an increase in the prevalence of cwp among underground coal miners based on niosh surveillance data , which may have led many to believe that these data were part of the basis for msha's proposed change in the exposure limit .
