my testimony today , which is based on our june 2005 report , chemical regulation: options exist to improve epa's ability to assess health risks and manage its chemical review program , describes epa's efforts to ( 1 ) assess existing chemicals used in commerce , ( 2 ) control the risks of new chemicals not yet in commerce , and ( 3 ) publicly disclose information provided by chemical companies under tsca .
while the hpv challenge program is a laudable effort to develop data on these chemicals , several problems remain , including that the chemical industry has not agreed to provide testing for over 200 chemicals originally identified in the hpv challenge program and that even with the test data provided under the program , epa would need to demonstrate that the chemicals pose unreasonable risks in order to control their production or use under tsca .
epa's reviews of new chemicals can provide only limited assurance that health and environmental risks are identified before the chemicals enter commerce because tsca does not require chemical companies to test new chemicals before notifying epa of their intent to manufacture a chemical .
although these chemicals are an integral component in the production of important goods and services , some may be toxic and may adversely affect human health and / or the environment .
