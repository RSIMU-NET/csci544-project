the critics take exception to at&t's characterization of t - mobile as stuck somewhere between the high - end providers ( at&t , verizon wireless , and sprint ) and the value - driven providers ( metropcs , leap ) and unable to carve out its own niche .
in fact , t - mobile is a national provider that offers high - end service , as demonstrated by its television commercials comparing the speed of its network to those of at&t and verizon wireless .
unfortunately , most of the data that at&t uses to support its arguments are redacted from the documentation that is publicly available or available to crs and therefore , to a great extent , it is not possible for crs to verify that the empirical evidence provided in fact supports the claims .
competitors and other critics of the proposed at&t / t - mobile merger have filed with the fcc petitions to deny the license transfers .
in this section , at&t's arguments in support of the proposed merger are presented without discussion .
its high - end service at comparatively low prices constrains the ability of at&t and verizon wireless to raise prices to their relatively price inelastic customers .
