110-325 , was enacted in 2008 to amend the americans with disabilities act ( ada ) .
the ada amendment act ( adaaa ) , p.l .
two of the major changes made by the ada amendments act are to expand the current interpretation of when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity ( rejecting the supreme court's interpretation in toyota ) , and to require that the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity must be made without regard to the use of mitigating measures ( rejecting the supreme court's decisions in sutton , murphy , and kirkingburg ) .
several of the major regulatory interpretations are as follows: including the operation of major bodily functions in the definition of major life activities ; adding rules of construction for when an impairment substantially limits a major life activity , and providing examples of impairments that will most often be found to substantially limit a major life activity ; interpreting the coverage of transitory impairments ; interpreting the use of mitigating measures ; and interpreting the "regarded as" prong of the definition .
