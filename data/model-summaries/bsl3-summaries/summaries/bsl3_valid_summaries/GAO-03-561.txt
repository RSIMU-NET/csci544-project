federal comparative surveys .
to evaluate the extent of the progress made in improving the quality of nursing home care since we last addressed this issue in september 2000 , you asked us to assess: trends in measured nursing home quality ; state responses to previously identified weaknesses in their survey , complaint , and enforcement activities ; and the status of key federal efforts to oversee state survey agency performance and improve quality .
several areas that require cms's ongoing attention include ( 1 ) the newly established standard performance reviews to ensure that critical elements of the review , such as assessing states' ability to properly document deficiencies , are successfully implemented , ( 2 ) the successful modernization of cms's data system by 2005 to support the survey process and provide key information for monitoring state survey activities , ( 3 ) the planned expansion of comparative surveys to improve federal oversight of the state survey process , ( 4 ) the survey methodology redesign intended to make the survey process more systematic , ( 5 ) the development of more structured guidance for surveyors to address inconsistencies in how the scope and severity of deficiencies are cited across states , and ( 6 ) the provision of detailed guidance to states to ensure thorough and consistent complaint investigations .
