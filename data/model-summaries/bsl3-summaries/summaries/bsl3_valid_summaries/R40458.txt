on january 13 , 2009 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) issued a notice in the federal register regarding the availability of its guidance for industry on the distribution of medical journal articles and scientific publications regarding unapproved new uses ( also known as off - label uses ) of approved drugs .
first , this report outlines the relevant provisions of the federal food , drug , and cosmetic act ( ffdca ) and related regulations that have been used to address misbranding violations of the act that relate to pharmaceutical manufacturers' promotion of off - label use .
the fda's guidance contains provisions similar to , and potentially more expansive than , the provisions on dissemination of information on off - label uses in ยง 401 of the fda modernization act of 1997 ( fdama ) , which expired in 2006 .
no similar provision was included in the most recent piece of major fda legislation , the fda amendments act of 2007 ( fdaaa ) .
the guidance seemingly creates a safe harbor for dissemination of information on off - label uses of fda - approved drugs .
in order to determine whether the fda's policies were a constitutionally permissible restriction on commercial speech , the court proceeded to the next three steps of the constitutional analysis: ( 1 ) whether the government has a substantial interest in imposing the restriction on speech ; ( 2 ) whether the restriction at issue directly advances that interest ; and ( 3 ) whether the restriction at issue is not more extensive than necessary to achieve that interest .
