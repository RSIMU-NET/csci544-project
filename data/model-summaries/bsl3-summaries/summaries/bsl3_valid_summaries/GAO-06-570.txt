although wildland fires triggered by lightning are a natural , inevitable , and necessary ecological process , past federal fire suppression policies have led to an accumulation of fuels and contributed to larger and more severe wildland fires .
both agencies generally concurred with our findings and recommendations .
consequently , for eight fires we reviewed in four states , we found varied cost - sharing methods used and an inconsistent application of these methods within and among states , although the fires had similar characteristics .
to strengthen the framework for sharing wildland fire suppression costs , we recommend that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior , working in conjunction with relevant state entities , take the following two actions: provide more specific guidance as to when particular cost - sharing methods should be used and clarify the financial responsibilities for suppressing fires that burn , or threaten to burn , across multiple jurisdictions .
wildland fires burn millions of acres of land each year .
first , some federal officials said that because master agreements and other policies do not provide clear guidance about which cost - sharing methods to use , it has sometimes been difficult to obtain a cost - sharing agreement that they believe shares suppression costs equitably .
