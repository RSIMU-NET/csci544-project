in fewer than 5 years , the federal deposit insurance corporation ( fdic ) was called upon twice to resolve the financial difficulties of the federally insured banks of the first city bancorporation of texas , inc. ( first city ) .
in fdic's view , the settlement is based on the following two principles: ( 1 ) the 1992 resolution of the first city banks would be at no cost to bif , and ( 2 ) fdic would not receive any money in excess of its actual costs incurred in connection with the resolution of the first city banks .
four years later , in october 1992 , the office of the comptroller of the currency ( occ ) and the texas banking commissioner determined that the two largest first city banks were insolvent and imminently insolvent , respectively .
at that time , fdic estimated the second resolution would cost the bank insurance fund ( bif ) about $500 million .
in april 1988 , fdic provided about $970 million of assistance in an attempt to restore first city's financial health .
generally , the processes used in providing financial assistance , closing banks , and resolving troubled banks should always include adequate safeguards for bif .
