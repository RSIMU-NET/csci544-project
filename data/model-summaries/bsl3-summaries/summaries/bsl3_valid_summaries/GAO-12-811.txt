bus rapid transit ( brt ) has generated interest around the world for its potential to alleviate the adverse effects of traffic congestion and support economic growth , while generally having lower capital costs than rail transit .
you asked us to examine the features of brt projects recommended for funding by the federal transit administration ( fta ) , as well as assess how these projects compare to rail transit .
dot did not comment on the draft report .
u.s .
to examine the features , costs , and community benefits of bus rapid transit ( brt ) projects recommended for funding by the federal transit administration ( fta ) , we addressed the following four questions: 1 .
the sponsors of two of these projects told us that while very small starts projects can create incentives for communities to pursue brt by offering streamlined requirements and grants for up to 80 percent of a project's total capital cost , the program's $50-million limit on projects' total capital costs provides an incentive to keep costs low .
in general , though , it appears that brt project sponsors are using the small and very small starts programs to design and implement projects that address their communities' current transit needs and align with the projects sponsors' overall objectives .
