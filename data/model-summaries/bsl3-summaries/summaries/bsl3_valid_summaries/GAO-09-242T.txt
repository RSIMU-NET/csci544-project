these principles are ( 1 ) identifying and defining the problem , ( 2 ) determining the national interests and setting clear goals and objectives that address the problem , and ( 3 ) protecting the government's interests .
determine national interests and set clear goals and objectives that address the problem: after defining the problem , congress must determine whether a legislative solution best serves the national interest .
in deciding whether to provide financial assistance , congress must consider and balance the perceived need for expedience with the need to put a structure in place to ensure that the interests of taxpayers are safeguarded and the specific problems that have put the industry in its current financial crisis are addressed .
the tightening of the credit markets has also affected the big 3 and their suppliers , which together employ about 730,000 people .
congress has asked us to review these plans .
a statement of the objectives and goals of the program would help congress and program administrators determine which financial tools are needed and most appropriate for the industry and for company - specific circumstances ; provide criteria for program decisions ; and serve as a basis for monitoring progress .
