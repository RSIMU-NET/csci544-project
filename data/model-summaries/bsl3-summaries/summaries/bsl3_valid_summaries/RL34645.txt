the goals of the apollo program were to land americans on the moon and return them safely to earth ; to establish the technology to meet other national interests in space ; to achieve preeminence in space for the united states ; to carry out a program of scientific exploration of the moon ; and to develop man's capability to work in the lunar environment .
some policymakers have concluded that the energy challenges facing the united states are so critical that a concentrated investment in energy research and development ( r&d ) should be undertaken .
