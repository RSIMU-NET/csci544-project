it requires each federal agency to develop a multiyear strategic plan that ( 1 ) states the agency's mission ; ( 2 ) identifies long - term strategic goals for each major function or operation ; ( 3 ) describes how the agency intends to achieve those goals ; ( 4 ) shows how annual performance goals relate to strategic goals ; ( 5 ) identifies key factors beyond the agency's control that could affect achievement of strategic goals ; and ( 6 ) describes how program evaluations informed the plan and provides a schedule of future program evaluations .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) examine the design characteristics of these programs that have implications for flexibility , accountability , and programs' ability to collect information about performance as envisioned in the results act ; ( 2 ) identify the kinds and sources of performance information that programs with various characteristics have utilized and the strengths and weaknesses of this information ; and ( 3 ) provide guidance to legislators and agency officials concerning the information collection options available for programs with various designs .
our study was prompted by interest in determining how existing flexible programs obtain information about performance as envisioned under the results act and what guidance we might offer with respect to ( 1 ) the treatment of such programs under the results act and ( 2 ) the design of future flexible programs — or redesign of existing programs — to help ensure that adequate information about performance is available .
