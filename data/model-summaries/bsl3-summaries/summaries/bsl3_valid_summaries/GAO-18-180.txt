 ( recommendation 4 ) .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) how transportation security administration ( tsa ) surface inspectors implement the agency's surface transportation security mission , and ( 2 ) the extent to which tsa has used a risk - based approach to prioritize and implement surface inspector activities .
this report examines ( 1 ) how tsa surface inspectors implement the agency's surface transportation security mission and ( 2 ) the extent to which tsa has used a risk - based approach to prioritize and implement surface inspector activities .
since 2006 , tsa has made adjustments to the base program to expand its use to more surface modes and address implementation challenges .
furthermore , by identifying and prioritizing highest risk entities and locations for its new rmast program , surface inspectors would have information that would enable them to implement risk mitigation activities in more of a risk - based way .
while tsa has implemented a risk - informed process to allocate surface inspectors to its field offices , it has not taken steps to ensure that surface inspector activities align more closely to the risks tsa has identified in its risk assessments .
