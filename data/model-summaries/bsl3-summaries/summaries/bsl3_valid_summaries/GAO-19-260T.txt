dod largely relies on internationally - trading u.s. - flag vessels ( vessels registered in the united states that must be mainly crewed by u.s. citizens ) for sealift — the process of transporting government equipment and supplies by sea for military purposes .
my statement today provides information on ( 1 ) the status of the mandated national strategies and ( 2 ) challenges that stakeholders identified related to sustaining the u.s. - flag fleet for defense needs and options dot has considered for addressing them .
to help ensure an adequately - sized u.s. - flag fleet for defense needs , the government supports internationally - trading u.s. - flag vessels in the following ways: ( 1 ) through the maritime security program ( msp ) , which provides the operators of selected u.s. - flag vessels a stipend in exchange for their agreeing to provide sealift support in times of war or crisis , and ( 2 ) through “cargo preference” requirements that specify that federal agencies must transport certain percentages of international government cargo on u.s. - flag vessels .
in the john s. mccain national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 , the statutory deadline for the national maritime strategy was extended from february 2015 to february 2020 .
