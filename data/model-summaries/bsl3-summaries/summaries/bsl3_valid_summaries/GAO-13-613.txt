in this report , we discuss ( 1 ) cms's implementation of the mmr process for outpatient therapy services conducted from october 1 , 2012 , through december 31 , 2012 , and ( 2 ) the number of individuals and claims subject to mmrs during the 3-month process and the outcomes of these reviews .
in 2011 , medicare , the federal health program insuring 48 million people who are age 65 and older or disabled , paid about $5.7 billion to provide three outpatient therapy services — physical therapy ( pt ) , occupational therapy ( ot ) , and speech - language pathology ( slp ) — for 4.9 million beneficiaries .
the appeals process — which may involve five levels of review — could take more than 2 years to reach a conclusion , and any reversals of prior therapy coverage denials will affect the final outcomes of the 2012 mmr process .
the three macs interviewed accounted for nearly 50 percent of the mmr workload and processed claims for states previously determined by the hhs oig to be at a higher risk for outpatient therapy improper payments and fraud .
in particular , the act required cms to conduct manual medical reviews ( mmr ) of requests for exceptions for therapy claims over an annual threshold of $3,700 for ot and $3,700 for a combination of pt / slp for services provided on or after october 1 , 2012 .
