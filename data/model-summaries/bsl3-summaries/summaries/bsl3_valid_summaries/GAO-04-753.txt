to improve the comprehensiveness of strategic workforce planning for the dod civilian workforce , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the office of the secretary of defense , the military service headquarters , and the defense logistics agency to build upon their strategic workforce planning efforts through the following three actions: analyze and document the gaps between current critical skills and competencies and those needed for the future workforce .
the achievement of the department of defense's ( dod ) mission is dependent in large part on the skills and expertise of its civilian workforce .
strategic workforce planning is an iterative , systematic process that addresses two critical needs: ( 1 ) aligning an organization's human capital program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals and ( 2 ) developing long - term strategies for acquiring , developing , and retaining an organization's workforce to achieve programmatic goals .
the strategic workforce planning process includes five elements used by leading public - and private - sector organizations: ( 1 ) involvement of management , employees , and stakeholders in developing , communicating , and implementing strategic workforce plans ; ( 2 ) performing analyses to identify critical skill and competency gaps between current and future workforce needs ; ( 3 ) developing strategies to fill these skill and competency gaps ; ( 4 ) building the capability necessary to address administrative , educational , or other requirements to support workforce strategies ; and ( 5 ) monitoring and evaluating progress and the contribution of strategic workforce planning efforts in achieving program goals .
