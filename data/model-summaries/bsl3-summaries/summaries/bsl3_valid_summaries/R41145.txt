on the other hand , it can be argued that trade policy remains a significant aspect of economic and foreign policy that can hinder or promote national interests and has a high - level of relevance as reflected in the rapid growth of trade ( u.s. trade in goods and services totaled $3.5 trillion in 2009 ) , and the increase in bilateral and regional trade agreements throughout the world .

it then analyzes the debate that is taking place among policy experts and stakeholders over the future form and role of trade policy and concludes with an examination of some of the options available to congress and the pros and cons of each .

they will likely also face fundamental questions , such as the future of the multilateral trade system ; the role of trade policy , if any , in addressing non - trade issues , such as climate change ; and the impact of globalization on the effectiveness of trade policy .
