to examine the effects of continuous health insurance coverage before medicare ( our independent variable of interest ) on beneficiaries' health status , spending , and use of services ( our dependent variables of interest ) , we used data from the health and retirement study ( hrs ) and medicare claims .
this report compares ( 1 ) the health status of medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment and ( 2 ) the spending and use of services by medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before enrollment .
this approach enabled us to maximize the number of beneficiaries in our study groups and to measure the effects of prior continuous insurance on health status , spending , and use of services at several points in time after medicare enrollment .
nearly 7 million individuals aged 55 to 64 , the pre - medicare population , lacked health insurance coverage in the first half of 2012 , accounting for more than 18 percent of this population .
like researchers who did not find significant differences in medicare spending between beneficiaries with and without prior insurance coverage , we excluded individuals who were enrolled in government health programs prior to age 65 from our analysis because of the possibility that they lost insurance coverage because of poor health , which could have resulted in an overestimate of the effect of having prior insurance on medicare spending after age 65 .
