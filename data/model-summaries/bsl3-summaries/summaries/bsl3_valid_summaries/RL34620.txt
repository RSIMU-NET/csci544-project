while the challenge of china's soft power does not alter vital u.s. interests , it affects the ways and means the united states uses to protect its interests and attain its strategic goals .
in the past decade , china's "soft power" — global influence attained through diplomatic , economic , cultural , and other non - coercive means — has grown along with its international standing .
the united states exceeds the people's republic of china ( prc ) in global trade , and far surpasses china in gdp and foreign direct investment .
despite this development , the united states remains the preeminent global force in many areas of soft power .
some experts argue that china's rise poses serious challenges to u.s. interests , while others believe that its implications are limited and that u.s. strengths remain formidable .

it maintains robust , formal alliances in europe and asia , and far outweighs china in military spending and capabilities .
