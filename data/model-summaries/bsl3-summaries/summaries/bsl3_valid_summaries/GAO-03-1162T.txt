the eac recognizes and appreciates the efforts the comptroller general has made to address employees' concerns regarding provisions affecting pay by ( 1 ) providing assurances that the new system will sustain employees' purchasing power and provide parity with prevailing locality pay , ( 2 ) proposing short - and longer - term modifications to gao's performance management system , and ( 3 ) incorporating a 2-year transition period for implementation of the new system .
for example , most employees expressed support for the provision to make gao's authority to offer voluntary early provisions to enhance vacation time for upper - level hires and relocation expenses deemed necessary by the comptroller general to recruit and retain top employees , and the provision to establish an exchange program with the private sector .
as established in our charter , the employee advisory council serves as an advisory body to the comptroller general and other senior executives by: seeking and conveying the views and concerns of the individual employee groups it represents while being sensitive to the mutual interests of all employees , regardless of their grade , band , or classification group ; proposing solutions to concerns raised by employees , as appropriate ; providing input by assessing and commenting on gao policies , procedures , plans , and practices ; and , communicating issues and concerns of the comptroller general and other senior managers to employees .
