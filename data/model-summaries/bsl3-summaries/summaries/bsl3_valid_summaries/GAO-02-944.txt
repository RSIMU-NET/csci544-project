the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) food and nutrition service ( fns ) , state agencies ( usually departments of education ) , and school food authorities all play a role in administering these school meal programs .
the federal government reimburses the states , which in turn reimburse school food authorities ( offices responsible for the administration of the school meals program in one or more schools ) for each meal served .
to obtain data on the costs related to applying for free and reduced - price school meals , verifying approved applications , and counting meals and claiming reimbursements , we visited selected locations , including 5 state agencies , 10 school food authorities in public school districts , and 2 schools at each district .
to varying degrees , each of these entities performs tasks associated with three of the administrative processes essential to the current operation of the school meal programs: ( 1 ) processing applications , ( 2 ) verifying income eligibility , and ( 3 ) counting the total number of meals served and claiming reimbursement .
the state agencies' cost estimates ranged from $51,000 to $1 million , with the size of their programs ranging from $122 million to $1.1 billion .
