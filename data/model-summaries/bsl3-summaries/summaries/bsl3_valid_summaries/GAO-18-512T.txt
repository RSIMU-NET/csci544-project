i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing to provide an update on the efforts of the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) — a component of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) — to manage preparedness grants and measure and assess national preparedness capabilities .
following the federal response to hurricane katrina in 2005 , congress enacted the post - katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 ( post - katrina act ) .
this statement specifically addresses fema's efforts to manage preparedness grants and our prior recommendations .
specifically , we found in february 2012 that multiple factors contribute to the risk of duplication among four fema preparedness grant programs — the state homeland security program , urban areas security initiative , port security grant program , and transit security grant program — as these programs share similar goals , fund similar projects , and provide funds in the same geographic regions .
fema has not yet taken action to fully address our concerns .
fema has been delayed in addressing the need for improved coordination among grant programs identified in our prior work .
according to fema , the new methodology will measure changes in state and urban area preparedness through the use of standardized capability targets and key indicators that will show how fema preparedness grants are being used to address gaps in capability targets .
