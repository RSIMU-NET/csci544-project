over the past 40 years , many countries have replaced lower - denomination notes with coins as a means to provide a financial benefit to their governments .
most recently , in march 2011 , we reported that such a replacement would result in a net benefit of about $5.5 billion over 30 years , or an average of about $184 million per year .
to determine the estimated net benefit , we developed a model based on a set of assumptions and noted that changing these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated net benefit .
we have reported five times over the past 22 years that replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a net benefit to the federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
the federal reserve noted that it believes our 30-year estimate may overstate the net financial benefit to the government because it ( 1 ) does not adequately address the costs to the private sector , state and local government , and the federal reserve and ( 2 ) does not consider potential increases in the cost of raw material for coins or possible future changes in discount rates .
