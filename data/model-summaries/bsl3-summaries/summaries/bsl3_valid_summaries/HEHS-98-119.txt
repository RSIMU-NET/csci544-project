therefore , you asked us to examine ( 1 ) what elements are considered important to a system for processing hmo member complaints and appeals ; ( 2 ) the extent to which hmos' complaint and appeal systems contain these elements ; ( 3 ) what concerns consumers have regarding hmo complaint and appeal systems ; ( 4 ) what information is available on the number and types of complaints and appeals hmos receive from their members ; and ( 5 ) how , if at all , hmos use their complaint and appeal data .
elements of effective communication identified as important included the provision of written information about the appeal process in an understandable manner ; acceptance of oral complaints and appeals ; the inclusion of appeal rights when notifying enrollees of a denial of care or payment of service ; and written notice of appeal denials , including appeal rights .
however , two recommended elements — appeal decisions made by individuals not involved in previous decisions and acceptance of oral appeals — were not commonly present in the complaint and appeal systems of the hmos in our study .
to help ensure that member complaints and appeals are resolved in an appropriately timely fashion , several groups identified two elements as being important: explicit time periods and expedited review .
