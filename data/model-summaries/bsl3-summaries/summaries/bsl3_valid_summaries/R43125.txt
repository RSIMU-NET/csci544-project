in september 1998 , the united states and russia each agreed to convert 34 metric tons of surplus weapons - grade plutonium to a form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons under the plutonium management and disposition agreement ( pmda ) .
the plutonium disposition program , including u.s. assistance for the russian program , is administered by the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , a semiautonomous agency of the department of energy ( doe ) .
because of sharply rising cost estimates for plutonium disposition facilities under construction in south carolina , the obama administration proposed in its fy2017 budget request to end construction and pursue a "dilute and dispose" ( d&d ) option .
particular u.s. concern focused on plutonium from soviet nuclear warheads , which it was feared posed a major nuclear weap ons proliferation risk .
with the end of the cold war and breakup of the soviet union in the early 1990s , control of surplus nuclear weapons material became an urgent u.s. foreign policy goal .
according to the agreement , the parties could use two methods for disposing of the plutonium â€” they could either convert it to mixed oxide ( mox ) fuel for nuclear power reactors or immobilize it and dispose of it in a way that would preclude its use in nuclear weapons .
