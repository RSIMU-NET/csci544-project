specifically , we examined ( 1 ) expanded state use of the waiver program , ( 2 ) the growth in long - term care costs for individuals with developmental disabilities , ( 3 ) how costs are controlled , and ( 4 ) strengths and limitations in states' approaches to assuring quality in community settings .
because the regular medicaid program operates as an entitlement — that is , all eligible individuals in a state are entitled to receive all services offered by the state — states have less control over utilization and the cost of services than in waiver programs .
however , until states more comprehensively develop and test these approaches , some recipients may face health and safety risks and others may not have access to the range of choices state programs seek to provide .
national experts interviewed included officials at hcfa ; the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation ( aspe ) in the department of health and human services ; the administration on developmental disabilities ; the president's committee on mental retardation ; the national association of developmental disabilities councils ; the administration on aging ; the national association of state directors of developmental disabilities services , inc. ( nasddds ) ; and the arc , formerly known as the association for retarded citizens .
