to help ensure that omb , in consultation with federal financial regulators , consistently classifies dodd - frank rules as major under cra , we recommend that the director of omb , through the administrator of the office of information and regulatory affairs , issue additional guidance to help standardize processes for identifying major rules under cra , including on ( 1 ) the extent to which agencies should submit rules to omb for review , such as whether agencies should submit only those rules their analyses indicate are major or all rules , and ( 2 ) how agencies should apply cra's major rule criteria in their analyses , such as whether agencies should include indirect benefits or costs , combine benefits or costs of separate but related rules , or aggregate benefits or costs for jointly issued rules .
more specifically , we examined ( 1 ) the regulatory analysis conducted by federal agencies in their dodd - frank rulemakings , including their assessments of which rules they considered to be major rules under the congressional review act ( cra ) ; ( 2 ) interagency coordination by the agencies in their dodd - frank rulemakings and by the consumer financial protection bureau ( cfpb ) with other agencies in connection to its supervision of large banks and certain nonbank financial service providers ; and ( 3 ) possible impact of selected dodd - frank provisions and their implementing regulations and agency plans to assess such regulations retrospectively .
