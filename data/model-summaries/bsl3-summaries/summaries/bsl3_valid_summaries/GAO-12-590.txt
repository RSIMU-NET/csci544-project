to help improve epa's implementation of nsr , we recommend that the epa administrator direct the entities responsible for implementing and enforcing nsr — specifically , the office of enforcement and compliance assurance , office of air quality planning and standards , and epa regions — to take the following two actions: working with epa regions and state and local permitting agencies , consider ways to develop a centralized source of information on nsr permits issued to fossil fuel electricity generating units , and using appropriate methods , such as sampling or periodic assessments , develop a process for evaluating the effects of its comments on draft nsr permits .
we selected a nonprobability sample of nine states on the basis of ( 1 ) the number of older electricity generating units in the state ; ( 2 ) the quantity of electricity generated by such units in those states ; ( 3 ) the volume of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and carbon dioxide emitted by units in those states ; and ( 4 ) the region in which the generating unit was located .
regionally maintained databases .
specifically , our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) what information epa maintains on nsr permits issued to fossil fuel electricity generating units ; ( 2 ) challenges , if any , that epa , state , and local agencies face in ensuring compliance with requirements to obtain nsr permits ; and ( 3 ) what available data show about compliance with requirements to obtain nsr permits .
