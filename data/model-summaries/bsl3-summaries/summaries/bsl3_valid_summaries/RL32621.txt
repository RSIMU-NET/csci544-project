some have long been concerned that terrorists would seek asylum in the united states , hoping to remain hidden among the hundreds of thousands of pending asylum cases .
others point out that asylum seekers are subject to multiple national security screenings and that — if an asylum seeker is a suspected or known terrorist — the law already bars alien terrorists .
