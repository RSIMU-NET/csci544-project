it has been fielded .
in order to compare and contrast the f - 22a modernization program with those of the f - 15 , f - 16 , and f / a - 18 , we examined key program requirements and acquisition documents and prior gao work .
selected acquisition reports are key recurring summary status reports to the congress on the cost , schedule , and performance of dod's major defense acquisition programs .
as a result , the cost , schedule , and performance projections for the f - 22a modernization program were not well founded and , over time , costs have doubled and the delivery of the full required capability has been delayed by more than 7 years .
the timelines depict the length of the original development program and illustrate the amount of time between the start of development — represented by year 0 — and other key program events , including initial operating capability ( ioc ) , the beginning of modernization , and the delivery of new upgraded capabilities .
