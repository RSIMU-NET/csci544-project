the successful operation of the national airspace system — the network supporting u.s. aviation operations that includes navigation facilities , airports , equipment , services , and information and rules — is dependent , in part , on the equipment , including computers , that airports use to carry out their operations .
specifically , we agreed to address the following: ( 1 ) what is the status of airports' efforts to help ensure that their computers and electronic equipment will function properly on and after january 1 , 2000 ? .
 ( 2 ) how will the safety , the security , and the efficiency of the national airspace system be affected if airports' year 2000 preparations are not completed in time ? .
the associate administrator for airports has also set criteria for verifying the year 2000 readiness of airports' equipment that is used to meet faa's safety and security requirements and has established a national team to monitor the airports' progress in preparing this equipment for the date change .
and ( 3 ) what factors affect the progress of airports' preparations for the year 2000 ? .
we surveyed by mail the 413 airports in the united states and territories that faa considers primary commercial service airports , that is , those with annual enplanements ( the number of passengers boarding commercial aircraft ) totalling 10,000 or more .
