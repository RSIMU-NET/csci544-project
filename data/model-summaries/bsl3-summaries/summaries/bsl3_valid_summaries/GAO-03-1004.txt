our objectives were to evaluate ( 1 ) information on income change reported by reservists when activated for a military operation to determine the need for compensation programs ; ( 2 ) reserve families' readiness for call - ups and their awareness and use of family support programs , specifically focusing on personal financial management ; and ( 3 ) a legislative proposal for the department of defense ( dod ) to offer tricare , the military's health care program , to reservists and their families when members are not on active duty .
dod lacks sufficient information from the survey data to determine the magnitude of income loss or gain experienced by reservists , the causes for this change , and the effects of income loss on reserve retention .
dod self - reported survey data from past and current military operations indicate that reservists have experienced widely varying degrees of income change when they are activated .
however , dod has not developed plans to address these needs .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to determine the need for compensation programs aimed at addressing reservists' income loss during periods of active duty by obtaining more complete information on the magnitude of income change , the causes of income change , and the effects of income change on reserve retention .
