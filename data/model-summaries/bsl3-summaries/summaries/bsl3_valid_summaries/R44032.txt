the 112 th congress made significant changes to the patent system through the leahy - smith america invents act ( aia ) .
both patents and regulatory exclusivities have been the subject of congressional interest in recent years .
the 113 th congress considered additional patent system reforms , including the innovation act .
patents , which are administered by the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , allow for a uniform 20-year term of protection for a variety of inventions .
for these regulatory exclusivities — notably the five - year new chemical entity exclusivity — the effective term of the exclusivity consists of the sum of ( 1 ) the specified statutory period during which generic firms may not file applications for marketing approval ; and ( 2 ) the period of time the fda requires to determine whether the application complies with regulatory requirement .
for example , the regulatory exclusivities could be divided into categories based upon the extent of protection , including ( 1 ) denial of approval of any competing product for the same indication , as provided under the orphan drug act , ( 2 ) denial of access to the sponsor's data package , as is the case for the new chemical entity exclusivity , and ( 3 ) protection limited to a specific use , formulation , or route of administration of an approved drug , the scope of rights provided by the new clinical study exclusivity .
