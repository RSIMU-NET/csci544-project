we are pleased to be here today to testify on the results of our review of the centers for medicare & medicaid services' ( cms ) audit activities related to medicare advantage ( ma ) organizations that was mandated by the balanced budget act ( bba ) of 1997 .
specifically , we will tell you about: the adjusted community rate proposal ( acrp ) and bid process and the related audit requirement for organizations that participate in the medicare advantage program , cms' efforts to comply with the audit requirement for organizations' acrp and bid submissions , and factors that cause cms' audit process to be of limited value .
bba requires cms to annually audit the financial records ( including data relating to medicare utilization and costs ) of at least one - third of the organizations participating in the medicare advantage program .
according to our assessment of the statutes , cms has the authority to pursue financial recoveries , but its rights under contracts for 2001 through 2005 are limited because its implementing regulations did not require that each contract include provisions to inform organizations about the audits and about the steps that cms would take to address identified deficiencies , including pursuit of financial recoveries .
