the federal government is extremely vulnerable to the year 2000 issue due to its widespread dependence on computer systems to process financial transactions , deliver vital public services , and carry out its operations .
this challenge is made more difficult by the age and poor documentation of the government's existing systems and its lackluster track record in modernizing systems to deliver expected improvements and meet promised deadlines .
as a result , the upcoming change of century is a sweeping and urgent challenge for public and private - sector organizations .
unless this issue is successfully addressed , serious consequences could ensue .
while some progress has been made in addressing the federal government's year 2000 readiness , serious vulnerabilities remain .
the public faces a risk that critical services could be severely disrupted by the year 2000 computing crisis .
financial transactions could be delayed , airline flights grounded , and national defense affected .
as the world's most advanced and most dependent user of information technology , the united states possesses close to half of all computer capacity and 60 percent of internet assets .
while managers in the government and the private sector are taking many actions to mitigate these risks , a significant amount of work remains , and time frames are unrelenting .
