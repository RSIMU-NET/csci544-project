this report provides our assessment of whether the ( 1 ) procedures used to conduct the c - 5 competition provided substantially equal opportunity for the public and private offerors to compete for the workload without regard to work performance location , ( 2 ) procedures complied with the requirements of all applicable provisions of law and the federal acquisition regulation ( far ) , and ( 3 ) c - 5 award results in the lowest total cost to the department of defense ( dod ) for performance of the workload .
2469a provide that to the maximum extent practicable , the cost standards used to determine depreciation of facilities and equipment should provide for identical treatment to public and private offerors .
as a result of a 1995 base realignment and closure ( brac ) act decision , the san antonio and sacramento air logistics centers , including their maintenance depots , are to close by the year 2001 .
these savings were primarily due to the more efficient use of the existing workforce and facilities , which before the addition of the c - 5 workload had been underused .
for example , the air force plans to involve the defense contract audit agency and defense contract management command in ensuring the cost performance of the c - 5 depot maintenance workload and to develop special tracking procedures to monitor and report cost , schedule , and performance data .
