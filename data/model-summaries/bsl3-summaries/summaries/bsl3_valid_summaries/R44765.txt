as india's economy continues to grow , its energy needs , including for natural gas , will likely grow as well .
the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) believes india will remain the fastest - growing g20 economy in 2017-2018 , with an annual projected growth rate of 7.5% .
those issues include the following: prospects for u.s. natural gas exports ; prospects for u.s. energy companies' investments in india ; indian investment in the u.s. energy sector ; india's ability to meet its global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change ; india's ability to reduce its chronic air pollution problems , especially in new delhi , where recently smog has reached 16 times levels deemed safe ; and india's political and economic relationships with regions such as the middle east , a major supplier of lng , and central asia , a potential supplier of natural gas via pipelines .
the government of india ( goi ) has indicated it will change this in the short term , but the goi's commitment and resources necessary for these changes are uncertain .
