accordingly,the department of defense ( dod ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) , whichis the department of energy ( doe ) agency in charge of the u.s. nuclear weapons program,requested funds to study the robust nuclear earth penetrator ( rnep ) .
the senate tabled an amendment by senator dorgan and another by senatorfeinstein to bar funds for rnep , and adopted an amendment by senator nelson ( fl ) , and a similaramendment by senator reed , to require congressional authorization to start development engineering ( discussed below ) or later phases of rnep .
supporters argue that it is needed to attack hard and deeply buried targets ( such as leadershipbunkers or wmd production facilities ) in countries of concern , thereby deterring or defeatingchallenges from such nations ; critics assert that rnep would lower the threshold for use of nuclearweapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter u.s. attack .
the air force has been leading the study , which startedin may 2003 , with nnsa in charge of studying modifications of specific warheads .
rnep has been the most controversial nuclear weapon program in congress for the past fewyears .
