t his report provides an overview of statutory inspectors general ( igs ) in the federal government , including their structure , functions , and related issues for congress .
statutory inspectors general ( igs ) are intended to be independent , nonpartisan officials who prevent and detect waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement within federal departments and agencies .
some observers have discussed options to improve audit follow - up and oversight of ig recommendations , such as standardized and enhanced audit follow - up procedures , including defined roles and responsibilities for igs and their affiliated agencies ; uniform terminology for the status of ig recommendations , including a standard definition for what constitutes an "open" recommendation ; systematic tracking of and reporting on the total number and status of ig recommendations ; prioritization of ig recommendations ; and a centralized , public database of all open recommendations .
consequently , igs may face increasing demand to complete statutorily mandated reviews of programs and operations that require ( 1 ) a broader focus on program performance and effectiveness in addition to waste , fraud , and abuse ; ( 2 ) analysis of specialty or technical programs , possibly in emerging policy areas ; and ( 3 ) use of more complex analytical methods and tools .
