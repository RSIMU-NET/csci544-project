if the balance tips the other way — either in the eyes of developers or the federal government — congress may need to reconsider its position on key energy and related initiatives to meet the united states' long - term policy objectives .
canada is the single largest foreign supplier of petroleum products , natural gas , and electric power to the united states — and the united states is the dominant consumer of canada's energy exports .
congress has been facing important policy questions in the u.s. - canada energy context on several fronts , including the siting of major cross - border pipelines , increasing petroleum supplies from canadian oil sands , increasing natural gas production from north american shales , and the construction of new facilities for liquefied natural gas ( lng ) exports .
the value of the energy trade between the two countries totaled nearly $100 billion in 2010 , helping to promote general economic growth and directly support thousands of energy industry and related jobs on both sides of the border .
the u.s. - canada energy relationship is increasingly complex , however , and is undergoing fundamental change , particularly in the petroleum and natural gas sectors .
