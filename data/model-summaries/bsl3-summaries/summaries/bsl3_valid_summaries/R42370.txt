since the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act ( aca ) in 2010 , religious institutions have raised concerns regarding the applicability of certain statutory provisions that would require the coverage of health services to which religious organizations may object .
departments of health and human services ( hhs ) , labor , and treasury issued interim final regulations that required coverage for a range of preventive services .
specifically , health plans offered by employers and health insurers must cover certain recommended preventive health services without cost sharing ( e.g. , charging a co - payment or deductible ) to patients for such services .
following enactment of aca , the u.s .
section 2713 ( a ) ( 4 ) indicates that such services will include "with respect to women , such additional preventive care and screenings ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the health resources and services administration...." following the enactment of aca , hhs commissioned the institute of medicine ( iom ) to recommend preventive services that should be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines .
however , lower courts have considered several factors when deciding whether an organization qualifies for the exemption: ( 1 ) the purpose or mission of the organization ; ( 2 ) the ownership , affiliation , or source of financial support of the organization ; ( 3 ) requirements placed upon staff and members of the organization ( faculty and students if the organization is a school ) ; and ( 4 ) the extent of religious practices in or the religious nature of products and services offered by the organization .
