although the last government , led by the democratic left alliance ( sld ) , steered the nation into the eu and nurtured a strong , export - based economy , its reputation was seriously damaged by a series of high - profile scandals .
poland has had an eventful political evolution in recent years .
although polls during the campaign suggested that the centrist , pro - market civic platform ( po ) would take the most votes , the nationalist conservative law and justice party ( pis ) wound up winning a plurality seats in the lower house of parliament , the sejm .
leszek balcerowicz , the respected former governor of the bank , criticized the desire of some in government to push for a reduction in interest rates ; under his leadership , the bank geared its policies toward meeting the criteria for joining the euro , whereas pis and its allies reportedly wished to stimulate demand and growth through rate cuts .
in the area of monetary policy , some analysts are concerned over pis's apparent willingness to reduce the independence of the country's central bank .
in poland's last parliamentary elections , held in september 2005 , voters registered their disappointment and the sld suffered defeat â€” maintaining poland's post - 1989 track record of turning out the ruling party .
