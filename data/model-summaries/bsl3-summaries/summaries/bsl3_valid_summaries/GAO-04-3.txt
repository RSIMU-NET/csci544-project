to more fully examine the issues raised by the allegations about unlawful tying and underpricing of corporate credit , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates engage in unlawful tying ; ( 2 ) what steps the federal banking regulators have taken to examine for unlawful tying and the results of these efforts ; ( 3 ) what evidence , if any , suggests that commercial banks with investment affiliates unlawfully discount the price of corporate credit to obtain underwriting business for their investment affiliates ; and ( 4 ) what , if any , competitive advantages accounting rules , capital standards , and access to the federal safety net create for commercial banks over investment banks .
in this proposed interpretation , the federal reserve also noted what it considers to be the two key elements of a violation of section 106: ( 1 ) the arrangement must involve two or more separate products: the customer's desired product ( s ) and one or more separate tied products ; and ( 2 ) the bank must force the customer to obtain ( or provide ) the tied product ( s ) from ( or to ) the bank or an affiliate in order to obtain the customerâ€˜s desired product ( s ) from the bank .
