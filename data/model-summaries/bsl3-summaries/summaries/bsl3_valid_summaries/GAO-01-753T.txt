expanding the use of performance - based contracting approaches and emphasizing strategic human capital planning are welcomed and positive steps , but sustained leadership and commitment will be required to ensure that these efforts mitigate the risks the government currently faces when contracting for services .
consequently , a key question we face in the government is whether we have today , or will have tomorrow , the ability to acquire and manage the procurement of increasingly sophisticated services the government needs .
in particular , agencies are not clearly defining their requirements , fully considering alternative solutions , performing vigorous price analyses , and adequately overseeing contractor performance .
federal agencies spend billions of tax dollars each year to buy services ranging from clerical support and consulting services , to information technology services such as network support , to the management and operation of government facilities , such as national laboratories .
our work continues to show that some service procurements are not being done efficiently , putting taxpayer dollars at risk .
the amount being spent on services is growing substantially .
last year alone , the federal government acquired more than $87 billion in services â€” a 24- percent increase in real terms from fiscal year 1990 .
