further , congress could consider amending the act to require justice to reflect in its litigation and compliance reports , changes in the award of attorneys' fees and costs resulting from the appeals process and settlement agreements between agencies and plaintiffs , if deemed to be cost - effective .
in addition , the act states that the court may assess against the government reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation costs incurred in a foia lawsuit if the requester has obtained relief through either a judicial order , or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree ; or a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency , if the plaintiff's claim is not insubstantial .
the freedom of information act ( foia ) requires federal agencies to provide the public with access to government information on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability in government .
to test the accuracy and completeness of data provided to us by agencies we performed the following procedures: compared cost data against available court records ; interviewed foia staff and legal counsels in the departments of agriculture , defense , housing and urban development , and state , and the environmental protection agency and the office of management and budget to determine what cost data are collected and reported ; and determined agencies' processes in reporting estimated hours spent on litigating foia - related lawsuits .
