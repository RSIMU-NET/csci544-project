my testimony today addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which states have implemented hsip requirements set forth in safetea - lu , including key elements of strategic highway safety plans and crash data analysis systems , ( 2 ) the types of guidance and assistance fhwa provided to the states to support them in planning and carrying out hsip , and ( 3 ) the results to date of states' efforts in carrying out hsip , including the results of the set - aside programs for rail - highway crossings and for high - risk rural roads .
many states are still in the early stages of implementing the set - aside program for high - risk rural roads and have yet to obligate significant funds for projects , and data limitations may be hindering their ability to target program funds to eligible projects .
additionally , the 25 state strategic highway safety plans we reviewed generally contained the key elements specified in safetea - lu , such as consideration of all three approaches to improving highway safety , including infrastructure improvement , behavioral approaches ( education and enforcement ) , and emergency medical service improvements , and evidence of involvement by a broad set of stakeholders .
