this report ( 1 ) describes interactions between cms and ihs , ( 2 ) examines mechanisms cms uses to interact and consult with indian tribes , ( 3 ) examines mechanisms that selected states' medicaid programs use to interact and consult with indian tribes , and ( 4 ) identifies barriers to enrollment in medicare and medicaid and efforts to help eligible american indians and alaska natives apply for and enroll in these programs .
the states had two types of policies governing interactions with indian tribes: ( 1 ) governor's orders , which specify that all state agencies should interact with indian tribes on a government - to - government basis and provide for consultation between the state and indian tribes , and ( 2 ) tribal consultation policies , which establish guidelines that state agencies , including medicaid agencies , should use to consult with indian tribes .
in recognition of the unique government - to - government relationship between the federal government and indian tribes , federal agencies are required by executive order to consult with indian tribes on “policies that have tribal implications.” the order states that “ach agency shall have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal implications.” the order defines policies that have tribal implications as regulations , legislative comments or proposed legislation , and other policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on one or more indian tribes , on the relationship between the federal government and indian tribes , or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and indian tribes .
