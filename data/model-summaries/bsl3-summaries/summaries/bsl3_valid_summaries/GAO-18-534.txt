medicare , a federal health insurance program administered by the centers for medicare & medicaid services ( cms ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , spent about $6.4 billion in 2016 on fee - for - service ( ffs ) payments for durable medical equipment ( dme ) .
to examine available evidence regarding the extent to which adjusted rates for dme items potentially affected medicare beneficiaries' access to those items in non - bid areas , we reviewed: ( 1 ) data from cms's 1-800- medicare beneficiary help line ; ( 2 ) cms data on dme suppliers' rates of assignment for rate - adjusted items — i.e. , whether suppliers accepted the medicare - approved amount in full or charged beneficiaries an additional amount — because cms reported that a high rate of assignment indicates that adjusted rates are sufficient ; and ( 3 ) results from cms's health status monitoring tool that tracks real - time health outcomes for beneficiaries residing in both cbp areas and non - bid areas .
hhs provided technical comments , which were incorporated as appropriate .
according to the 2018 medicare trustees report , in 2017 , 33.6 million , or about 63 percent of the total 53.4 million medicare enrollees , were enrolled in the medicare ffs part b program that helps pay for dme items , such as oxygen , wheelchairs , hospital beds , and walkers , if they are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician .
