this market exclusivity is known as pediatric exclusivity .
in this report , we ( 1 ) assessed the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted for on - patent drugs under the best pharmaceuticals for children act ( bpca ) , including when drug sponsors declined to conduct the studies ; ( 2 ) evaluated the impact of bpca on labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling was changed ; and ( 3 ) illustrated the range of diseases treated by the drugs studied under bpca .
although children suffer from many of the same diseases as adults and are often treated with the same drugs , only about one - third of the drugs that are prescribed for children have been studied and labeled for pediatric use .
this has placed children taking drugs for which there have not been adequate pediatric drug studies at risk of being exposed to ineffective treatment or receiving incorrect dosing .
drug sponsors ( typically drug manufacturers ) may obtain 6 months of additional market exclusivity for drugs on which they have conducted pediatric studies in accordance with pertinent law and regulations .
