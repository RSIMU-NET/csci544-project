for our analyses of governmentwide career and dhs career demographic data , we extracted data from the office of personnel management's ( opm ) central personnel data file ( cpdf ) and analyzed these data to identify the extent of changes in the representation of women and minorities in dhs's workforce between september 2003 and september 2007 .
because these challenges could have serious consequences for the security of our country , we designated the department's implementation and transformation a high - risk area in 2003 and reiterated our concerns in january 2005 and again in january 2007 .
while we did not analyze factors that contributed to changes in dhs workforce from september 2003 through september 2007 , opm and the equal employment opportunity commission ( eeoc ) in their oversight roles require federal agencies , including dhs , to analyze their workforces .
since its inception in march 2003 , dhs has faced enormous challenges related to protecting the nation from terrorism while organizing its predecessor agencies — several with existing program and management challenges — into a coherent and integrated department .
one key challenge dhs has faced is effectively and strategically managing its sizable workforce of nearly 167,000 employees in order to respond to current and emerging 21st century challenges .
