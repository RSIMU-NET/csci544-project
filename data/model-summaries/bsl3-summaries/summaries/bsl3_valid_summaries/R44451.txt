u.s. greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emission levels , particularly from carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) , remain a topic of interest among policymakers and stakeholders .
during the obama administration , the environmental protection agency ( epa ) promulgated standards for co 2 emissions from existing fossil - fuel - fired electric power plants .
a question for policymakers is whether u.s. ghg emissions will remain at current levels , decrease to meet the 2020 and 2025 goals , or increase toward former ( or even higher ) levels .
recent international negotiations and domestic policy developments have generated attention to current and projected u.s. ghg emission levels .
whether the united states ultimately achieves the 2020 and 2025 targets will likely depend , to some degree , on ghg emission levels , particularly co 2 emissions , from electric power plants — one of the largest sources of u.s. emissions .
the rule would establish uniform national co 2 emission performance rates — measured in pounds of co 2 per megawatt - hour of electricity generation — and state - specific co 2 emission rate and emission targets .
pursuant to that agreement , the united states pledged ( in 2015 ) to reduce ghg emissions by 26% - 28% by 2025 compared to 2005 levels .
