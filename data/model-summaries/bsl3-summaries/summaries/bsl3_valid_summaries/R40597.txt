the draft legislation , titled the american clean energy and security act of 2009 , proposes a "cap and trade" system to control carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have been associated with global climate change .
the proposed cap - and - trade system would cover electric utilities and other entities that together are responsible for 85% of u.s. greenhouse gas emissions .
a discussion draft of broad legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was released march 31 , 2009 , by representative waxman , chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce , and representative markey , chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee .
covered entities would need permits ( called allowances ) to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , and unused allowances could be banked for future use or sold .
several major issues are not addressed by the draft bill and are still under discussion , such as how to allocate emission allowances and how to assist workers and consumers affected by the cap - and - trade system .
substantial controversy is also continuing over the draft bill's renewable energy mandate on electricity suppliers .
to address concerns that greenhouse gas controls could place u.s. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage , the draft bill authorizes compensation to certain industrial sectors .
