my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) the challenges in ensuring adequate supply to meet demand for vaccine and ( 2 ) the mechanisms in place to target high - risk populations when , as happened this year , a vaccine shortage occurs .
we obtained information on ( 1 ) the available doses and demand for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 flu seasons , ( 2 ) the status of this year's flu vaccine , and ( 3 ) cdc activities , including actions taken following the announcement that one major manufacturer could not supply any vaccine for the u.s. market this year .
only three manufacturers produce flu vaccine for the u.s. market , and the potential for future manufacturing problems such as those experienced both this year and to a lesser degree in previous years is still present .
the current situation also reflects another concern: the nation lacks a systematic approach for ensuring that seniors and others at high risk for flu - related complications receive flu vaccine when it is in short supply .
under this system , health providers and vaccine distributors generally order a particular manufacturer's vaccine and have limited recourse , even for meeting the needs of high - risk persons , if that manufacturer's production is adversely affected .
