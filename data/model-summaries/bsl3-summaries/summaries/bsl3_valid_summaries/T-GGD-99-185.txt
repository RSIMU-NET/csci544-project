in light of these findings , we were asked to determine ( 1 ) what efforts lsc and its grantees have made to correct case reporting problems , and ( 2 ) whether these efforts are likely to resolve the case reporting problems that occurred in 1997 .
problems existed with lsc's self - inspection , which sought to verify the accuracy of 1998 case service reporting ( csr ) data .
although most grantees indicated that lsc's revised case reporting guidance has clarified reporting requirements for grantees , many grantees remained unclear about certain aspects of lsc's reporting requirements .
in a report issued earlier this month we found the following: lsc revised its written case reporting guidance and issued a new handbook to its grantees to clarify case reporting requirements .
grantees reported changing their policies and procedures to comply with lsc's new reporting requirements .
in a june 1999 report , we estimated that nearly 75,000 of the approximately 221,000 cases reported to lsc by 5 of its largest grantees were questionable .
develop a standard protocol for future self - inspections to ensure that grantees systematically and consistently report their results for open and closed cases ; direct grantees to select samples for future self - inspections that are sufficient to draw reliable conclusions about magnitude of case data errors ; and finally , ensure that procedures are in place to validate the results of lsc's 1998 self - inspection , as well as of any future self - inspections .
