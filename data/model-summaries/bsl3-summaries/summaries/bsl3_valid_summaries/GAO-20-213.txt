 ( recommendation 10 ) .
dhs concurred with the recommendations but has not yet implemented them .
however , dhs has not fully implemented these plans and has experienced challenges in measuring progress against its intended goals .
dhs has demonstrated significant progress in implementing leading agile practices .
our objective was to assess the extent to which the department of homeland security ( dhs ) addressed selected leading practices for its transition to the use of agile software development .
dhs has partially adopted practices at all three organizational levels .
in addition , the department stated that it had addressed our recommendation to define a process and controls to ensure that agile programs and projects are reporting a set of core required performance metrics for monitoring and measuring agile adoption .
dhs has taken many positive steps in its transition to agile software development .
finally , because dhs has not set expectations for performance metrics for monitoring and tracking the use of automated testing and code quality , dhs is at a greater risk for programs breaching their cost and schedule expectations .
however , because dhs did not assess the skills and resources needed to complete deferred activities , it risks continued delays in completing these .
