in light of the potential for significant change and your interest in determining what medicaid - related actions states have taken in the first year of welfare reform , you asked us to briefly describe the medicaid - related options the welfare reform law gave states and discuss the approaches states have chosen ; identify the implications of these state choices for medicaid eligibles and for the states' administrative processes ; and identify steps states have taken or plan to take to educate and enroll medicaid eligibles , in view of their changing eligibility for cash assistance programs .
to collect consistent information on ( 1 ) states' medicaid - related choices , ( 2 ) implications of those choices on medicaid eligibles and state administrative procedures , and ( 3 ) steps states have taken or plan to take to educate and enroll medicaid eligibles , we developed a standardized protocol .
to promote work rather than welfare dependence and to provide states more flexibility in designing their welfare programs , the new welfare reform law made a number of changes to the nation's cash assistance programs , including aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) and the supplemental security income ( ssi ) program .
