to accumulate information on the seven initiatives , we reviewed dod documents that ( 1 ) identified how the planned initiatives would streamline and improve dod's payment processes and ( 2 ) discussed the status and interrelationship of the initiatives .
dod has long recognized weaknesses in its contract payment process and has hundreds of efforts under way to improve its contract payment and other disbursement processes .
as discussed in the report , regarding the capability of the short - term initiatives to achieve the secretary's broader goal of having all aspects of the contracting process for major weapons systems paper free , edm is only accessible to dfas - columbus ; eda does not capture all documents , such as the invoice ; and the edi schedule is only for implementation at dfas centers and accounting offices .
as you requested , the objective of this report is to provide a general description of three short - term dod technology initiatives , which affect the current payment process , and four long - term initiatives , which are expected to change the way dod currently does business .
however , as we have previously reported , dod has not performed the in - depth analysis necessary to fully determine the underlying causes of its disbursement and accounting problems and therefore identify the most effective solutions and rank specific reforms .
