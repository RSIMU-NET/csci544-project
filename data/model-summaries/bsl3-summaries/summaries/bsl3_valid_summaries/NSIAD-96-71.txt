the army and the air force are jointly developing the joint surveillance target attack radar system ( joint stars ) .
the army's commitment to its currently planned second year lrip buy of 16 cgs systems prior to the completion of the cgs ot&e would raise not only the program's risk but also its cost .
if the army buys one system in fiscal year 1997 and 37 systems in the third and fourth years of the contract , it could save over $5 million while obtaining the same 4-year buy of 56 systems currently anticipated given its fiscal year 1997 budget request and approved acquisition strategy .
because of the cost and importance of the joint stars effort and concerns about the gsms' performance in prior tests , we reviewed the army's test and acquisition plans for the common ground station ( cgs ) , the next gsm version .
while there is an operational need for joint stars , and despite the desire of operational commanders to have more capable systems as soon as possible , the fact remains that the army has not adequately justified the urgency or benefits to be derived from accelerated fielding of the cgs in 1998 versus the originally planned fielding in fiscal year 2002 .
