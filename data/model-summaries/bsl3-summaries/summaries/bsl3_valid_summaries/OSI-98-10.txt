this letter responds to your request of january 6 , 1998 , and in subsequent discussions , that we assist the subcommittee by ( 1 ) determining which entities or companies engage in telephone slamming violations â€” the unauthorized switching of a customer from one long - distance provider to another ; ( 2 ) determining the process by which the providers defraud consumers ; and ( 3 ) reviewing what the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , state regulatory entities , and the telecommunications industry have done to curtail slamming .
it distorts telecommunications markets by enabling companies engaged in misleading practices to increase their customer bases , revenues , and profitability through illegal means .
facility - based carriers have an economic incentive to slam because they have high fixed costs for network equipment and low costs for providing service to additional consumers .
telephone customers who are victims of intentional slamming can be harmed in a number of ways ranging from having to pay higher , sometimes exorbitant , long - distance rates to being unable to use the calling cards of their provider of choice .
for example , in 1992 as a result of an increase in telemarketing , the fcc required long - distance providers to obtain one of four forms of verification concerning change - orders generated by telemarketing .
