the department of the navy's inability to accurately account for its disbursements and collections is a serious , long - standing financial management problem .
as we have previously reported , the department of defense's ( dod ) continuing problems with its complex and inefficient payment processes generally do not permit a transaction to be properly recorded when it occurs , including the matching of a transaction with the related obligation â€” a critical funds control measure .
our previous reports on dod's problem disbursements , listed at the end of this report , detailed long - standing concerns in this area , such as the failure to identify the root causes of dod's disbursing problems and therefore determine which of its numerous initiatives will improve the problem areas .
corrective actions are important because problem disbursements can increase the risks of ( 1 ) fraudulent or erroneous payments being made without detection , ( 2 ) cumulative amounts of disbursements exceeding appropriated amounts and other legal spending limits , and ( 3 ) inaccurate and unreliable financial reporting .
problem disbursements result from the difficulties in properly recording transactions , including matching disbursements with related obligations , well after the transactions have occurred .
