in response to your request , this report discusses ( 1 ) the department of defense's ( dod ) and the national aeronautics and space administration's ( nasa ) requirements for surveillance of space objects and ( 2 ) dod's space surveillance capabilities to support these requirements .
we evaluated ( 1 ) how well dod's existing space surveillance capabilities support dod's and nasa's current and future surveillance requirements and ( 2 ) the extent to which potential space surveillance capabilities and technologies are coordinated to provide opportunities for improvements .
unless dod and nasa can establish a consolidated set of national security and civil space surveillance requirements , an opportunity may be missed to ( 1 ) better ensure the safety of the planned multibillion dollar space station and ( 2 ) help satisfy national security needs , including u.s. forces' future needs for space asset information .
the civil and national security ( defense and intelligence ) space sectors have a common interest in space surveillance , and there may be an increasing interest by the commercial space sector .
third , the dod space architect organization's study of space surveillance , which included both the defense and intelligence space sectors , noted that detecting and tracking space debris down to 1 centimeter ( nasa's requirement ) could be important to the safety of manned space systems , but that the requirement is not a high priority for dod .
