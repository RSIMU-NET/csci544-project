as a result of the proposed settlement , you asked us to ( 1 ) identify tobacco - related industries and summarize existing studies that assess the national and regional economic impacts of the tobacco industry , ( 2 ) examine smoking trends for u.s. and canadian youths , ( 3 ) estimate the potential effect of a settlement on state revenues from cigarette excise taxes , and ( 4 ) investigate the extent of interstate and international cigarette smuggling affecting the united states .
in addition , the settlement clarifies fda's authority to regulate tobacco products — including regulating the level of nicotine in cigarettes — under the food , drug , and cosmetic act and requires the tobacco industry to pay for fda's oversight of the industry ; bans all outdoor tobacco advertising and the use of cartoon characters and human figures , such as the marlboro man , in tobacco advertising ; requires manufacturers to disclose internal research relating to the health effects of their products ; establishes a minimum federal standard to restrict smoking in public places , with enforcement funding coming from the industry's payments ; settles all punitive damages claims against the tobacco industry and places limits on future class - action suits against the industry ; provides for the annual payments to be reflected in the prices that manufacturers charge for tobacco products ; and treats all payments as ordinary and necessary business expenses , which makes them tax - deductible .
