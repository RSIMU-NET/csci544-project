dhs agreed with these recommendations .
the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , significantly altered the nation's views on how to secure and protect the people , borders , and assets of the united states , and dramatically highlighted the need to take immediate actions to reduce the likelihood of future attacks of this magnitude taking place on u.s. soil .
with the benefit of hindsight , it is apparent that on 9 / 11 , several areas in particular — the u.s. commercial aviation system , the federal government's approach to compiling and managing terrorist watch lists , the nonimmigrant visa process , and mechanisms for screening and recording foreign travelers entering and exiting the united states — were all shown to be vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists intent on gaining entry to the country and wreaking havoc .
tsa and other agencies have taken steps to strengthen the various layers of commercial aviation defense — including passenger prescreening ( conducted after a reservation is made ) , passenger checkpoint screening ( conducted once passengers are at the airport and proceeding to the gate with any carry - on bags ) , and in - flight security — that were exploited by the hijackers on 9 / 11 .
