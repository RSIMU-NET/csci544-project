this report examines ( 1 ) the types of supervised independent living arrangements available to youth in extended - care states , ( 2 ) what factors extended - care states reported considering when placing youth in supervised independent living , ( 3 ) what federal and other sources extended - care states use to fund supervised independent living arrangements for youth , and ( 4 ) how selected extended - care states prepare youth to live independently .
we also analyzed states' responses on the number of youth in extended care and the number of youth in care that were eligible for title iv - e reimbursement in state fiscal year 2017 to determine their title iv - e eligibility rate for the fiscal year .
data from the administration for children and families ( acf ) , within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , show that nearly 102,000 of these children were youth nearing adulthood ( ages 14 and up ) .
to ensure the quality and reliability of the survey , we pretested the questionnaire with three extended - care states to check ( 1 ) the clarity and flow of the questions , ( 2 ) the appropriateness of the terminology used , ( 3 ) if the information could be easily obtained and whether there were concerns about the reliability of data that would be collected , and ( 4 ) if the survey was comprehensive and unbiased .
