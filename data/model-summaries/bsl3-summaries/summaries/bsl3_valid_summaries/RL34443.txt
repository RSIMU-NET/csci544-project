the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ( erisa ) protects the interests of participants and beneficiaries in private - sector employee benefit plans .
an employee benefit plan may be either a pension plan ( which provides retirement benefits ) or a welfare benefit plan ( which provides other kinds of employee benefits such as health and disability benefits ) .
erisa sets standards that pension plans must meet in regard to: who must be covered ( participation ) , how long a person has to work to be entitled to a pension ( vesting ) , and how much must be set aside each year to pay future pensions ( funding ) .
most erisa provisions deal with pension plans .
governmental plans and church plans generally are not subject to the law .
erisa supersedes state laws relating to employee benefit plans except for certain matters such as state insurance , banking and securities laws , and divorce property settlement orders by state courts .
responsibility for enforcing erisa is shared by the department of the treasury , the department of labor , and the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) .
erisa also established the pension benefit guaranty corporation ( pbgc ) to insure that plan participants receive promised benefits , up to a statutory limit , should a plan terminate with a lack of sufficient assets to pay promised benefits .
