 ( recommendation 5 ) .
carrier audits .
to help ensure that consumers in rural , insular , and high - cost areas have access to modern communications networks capable of providing broadband service , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) has a program that provides approximately $4.5 billion annually to eligible telecommunications carriers that offer services in these areas .
to evaluate the extent to which fcc has implemented reforms intended to improve the accountability of rate - of - return carriers' funding , we reviewed fcc orders and policies , prior gao and fcc oig reports , and other relevant documents related to high - cost support reforms .
 ( recommendation 1 ) the chairman of fcc should plan regular fraud - risk assessments tailored to the high - cost program and assess these risks to determine the program's fraud risk profile , as provided in gao's fraud risk framework .
fcc also provided technical comments , which we incorporated as appropriate .
this program is referred to as the universal service fund ( usf ) high - cost program , and the program funding that the carriers receive is referred to as “support.” one type of carrier that receives support for providing broadband in high - cost areas is a “rate - of - return carrier” — small , rural carriers that serve 5 percent or less of u.s. households .
