our objectives were to determine ( 1 ) the scope and status of the modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) program ; ( 2 ) whether midas has appropriate program management ; and ( 3 ) whether midas has appropriate executive oversight and governance .
specifically , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the scope and status of midas , ( 2 ) whether midas has appropriate program management , and ( 3 ) whether midas has appropriate executive oversight and governance .
the united states department of agriculture's ( usda ) farm service agency ( fsa ) is responsible for administering billions of dollars annually in program benefits to farmers and ranchers .
since 2004 , fsa has been planning a program called modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) to modernize the information technology ( it ) systems that process these benefits .
however , the implementation cost is uncertain because it has not been updated since 2007 and does not include key cost elements .
to increase the likelihood that the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) will be able to successfully define , develop , and deploy the modernize and innovate the delivery of agricultural systems ( midas ) program , we recommend that the secretary of agriculture direct the chief information officers of usda and the farm service agency ( fsa ) to take the following three actions:  to ensure that the department can effectively oversee midas cost , schedule , and performance commitments , fsa should  develop timely cost estimates for midas's remaining phases , its overall development and deployment , and its life cycle , to incorporate the program changes previously omitted and any others recently identified and  develop complete and detailed schedules for the program's current and remaining phases that take into account the milestone delays from the program's second phase and a requirements baseline .
