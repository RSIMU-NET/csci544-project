in order to help ensure that dhs component officials understand what ocpo expects of them in its procurement oversight , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the chief procurement officer to review and ensure consistency between directive 143-05 and the procurement oversight program guidebook and with the department's current procurement oversight efforts .
the objectives of this review were to ( 1 ) assess the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) efforts to implement procurement oversight , and ( 2 ) identify dhs components' use of strategic sourcing to leverage their buying power .
ocpo has been less consistent in — but continues to hone — its implementation of other aspects of the program , including self assessments and parts of its acquisition planning reviews .
however , at the time of our review , dhs had not issued updated policy or guidance reflecting ocpo's current approach to procurement oversight , which led to a lack of clarity for components regarding what the oversight efforts entail .
to assess dhs's efforts in implementing procurement oversight , we reviewed procurement oversight policies and guidance ; interviewed knowledgeable officials from ocpo and dhs components ; reviewed prior gao reports ; and examined dhs and component documentation of oversight efforts , including ocpo's review schedule , quarterly reports , goal letters , and on - site reviews from 2007 to the present .
