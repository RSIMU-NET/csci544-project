more specifically , the objectives of our review were to ( 1 ) identify the steps used by labor to collect data and determine and report the prevailing wages to be paid on federally funded construction projects , ( 2 ) determine whether specific weaknesses in the process could have resulted in the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data in its prevailing wage determinations , and ( 3 ) assess the extent to which labor is addressing any identified process weaknesses .
in recent years , the act has drawn controversy , with critics charging that it artificially inflates federal construction costs .
given the magnitude of these expenditures , inaccurate wage determinations could lead either to excessive government construction costs or to large numbers of workers receiving wages and fringe benefits that are lower than required by the law .
the davis - bacon act requires employers on federal construction projects to pay workers wages at or above the level determined by the department of labor to be prevailing in a geographic area .
because of your concern about whether labor's procedures under the davis - bacon act allow the use of data that could result in inaccurate wage determinations throughout the nation , you asked us to identify the steps used by labor to collect data and determine and report the prevailing wages to be paid on federally funded construction projects , determine whether specific weaknesses exist in the wage determination process that could have resulted in the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data , and assess the extent to which labor is addressing any identified process weaknesses .
