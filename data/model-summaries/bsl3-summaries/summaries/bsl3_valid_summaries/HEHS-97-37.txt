enrollment nationwide in the medicare managed care program has more than tripled in the last decade — growing from about 1 million enrollees in 1987 to about 3.8 million in 1996 — but differences in enrollment by state and by market area are striking .
to explore this issue further , you asked us to identify patterns in hmo enrollment and medicare payment rates , and examine selected geographical areas — in particular , some with higher enrollment / lower payment rates and some with lower enrollment / higher payment rates — and describe how the presence or absence of certain factors could affect enrollment .
in some metropolitan areas like portland , oregon , and tucson , arizona , the dominant form of medicare managed care — the health maintenance organization ( hmo ) — has enrolled more than 40 percent of the medicare beneficiaries .
to identify where beneficiaries were enrolled in hmos and the rates that medicare paid to hmos , we used data obtained from the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) office of managed care .
for each of 3,141 counties in 1995 , the latest data available at the time of our review , these data showed ( 1 ) the number of eligible medicare beneficiaries , ( 2 ) the number enrolled in managed care plans with medicare risk contracts , and ( 3 ) the per enrollee amount that medicare paid plans ( that is , the adjusted average per capita cost ( aapcc ) rate for the county ) .
