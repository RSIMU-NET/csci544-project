all of these states have a floodplain management program that may ( 1 ) provide technical expertise to localities and individuals on complying with fema's or other federal agencies' requirements , ( 2 ) regulate local land use when localities are unable or unwilling to take needed actions to reduce the risk of flooding , or ( 3 ) coordinate local and regional floodplain management programs .
the task force recommended in a july 1994 report that missouri ( 1 ) adopt a permit program for constructing and modifying levees ; ( 2 ) identify all existing levees for the purpose of developing design criteria and policy guidelines ; ( 3 ) determine the need for setbacks , relocations , and construction standards ; and ( 4 ) enact legislation that would make it easier for levee districts to form and obtain public sponsorship for participation in the corps' levee rehabilitation program .
