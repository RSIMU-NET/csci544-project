my statement , like the report , examines ( 1 ) perspectives of selected tribes and providers on the importance of high - speed internet access for tribes and any barriers to increasing this access on tribal lands ; ( 2 ) the level of interrelation and coordination between federal programs at fcc and usda that promote high - speed internet access on tribal lands ; and ( 3 ) existing data and fcc performance goals and measures related to access to high - speed internet service on tribal lands and for tribal institutions .
finally , to determine what data and fcc performance goals and measures exist related to access to high - speed internet service on tribal lands and to tribal institutions , we analyzed fiscal year 2010 through 2014 data from usf programs providing assistance , reviewed applications and the guidance materials for those programs , and the agencies' performance reports .
high - speed internet service is viewed as a critical component of the nation's physical infrastructure and a driver of economic growth .
health: about half of the tribes said that high - speed internet access to support telemedicine was important to the tribe , particularly in rural or remote areas .
