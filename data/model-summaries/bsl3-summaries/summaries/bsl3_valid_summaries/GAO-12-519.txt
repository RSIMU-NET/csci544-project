this report ( 1 ) describes the office of personnel management's ( opm ) actions to respond to the requirements of the telework enhancement act of 2010 and ( 2 ) assesses how opm is handling and addressing identified data reliability issues in the 2011 telework data call .
to improve opm's annual reporting of telework to congress , we recommend that the opm director take the following two actions: ensure that the reliability limitations related to the 2011 telework data call are clearly reported in its june 2012 report to congress by fully describing how existing measures of telework participation vary widely in validity and reliability and limit the capability of opm to reliably report the actual level and frequency of telework participation .
because of the new telework reporting requirements in the act and the need for reliable data to assess the agencies' progress in implementing their individual telework programs , you asked us to assess opm's: actions to respond to the reporting requirements of the telework enhancement act of 2010 , and handling of identified data reliability issues in the 2011 telework data call .
the office of personnel management ( opm ) has reported telework can enhance the productivity and flexibility of federal employees ; help recruit and retain a qualified workforce ; and reduce real estate , overhead , energy , and environmental costs .
