my testimony today discusses ( 1 ) factors contributing to the tax gap and ( 2 ) strategies for reducing the tax gap .
in april 2016 , irs released its most recent tax gap estimate , stating that taxpayers should have paid an average of about $2.5 trillion dollars per year in federal taxes for tax years 2008 to 2010 .
the most recent data available show that , in 2016 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) estimated an average annual gross tax gap of $458 billion for tax years 2008 to 2010 .
irs estimated that through late payments and enforcement actions , it will collect an additional $52 billion annually for tax years 2008 to 2010 , resulting in an average annual net tax gap of $406 billion .
my comments are based on prior reports on the tax gap and enforcement of tax laws , including those with open recommendations or matters for congressional consideration that could help reduce the tax gap .
developing and documenting plans to assess its nrp employment tax study results would help irs ( 1 ) identify areas of noncompliance , ( 2 ) devise actions to address such noncompliance , and ( 3 ) update its employment tax gap estimate .
