arguably the most significant incentive for ethanol's use is the renewable fuel standard ( rfs ) established in the energy policy act of 2005 and expanded in the energy independence and security act of 2007 .
the rfs mandates the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008 , increasing steadily through 2022 ( figure 1 ) .
however , a group of engine and equipment manufacturers has challenged the partial waiver in court , arguing that epa failed to estimate the likelihood of misfueling ( using e15 equipment denied a waiver ) , and the economic and environmental consequences of that misfueling .
fuel ethanol consumption has grown from roughly 1 billion gallons per year in the early 1990s , largely as a result of federal policies promoting its use , including tax incentives and mandates for the use of renewable fuels .
in 2010 , the united states consumed roughly 13 billion gallons of fuel ethanol , representing about 10% of all u.s. gasoline consumption ( by volume ) .
before epa's decision on the growth energy waiver petition , the amount of ethanol that could be blended in gasoline for all conventional gasoline vehicles and engines was limited to 10% by volume ( e10 ) by guidance developed by the environmental protection agency ( epa ) under the clean air act ( caa ) , as well as by vehicle and engine warranties , and certification procedures for fuel - dispensing equipment .
