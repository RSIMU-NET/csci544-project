my testimony today is the second in a series of interim reports on sbi implementation and focuses on the following issues: the extent to which border patrol agents have been trained and are using sbinet technology ; sbi tactical infrastructure implementation ; and how the sbi program office has defined its human capital goals and the progress it has made to achieve these goals .
however , boeing's inability to integrate these components with the cop software delayed the implementation of project 28 over 5 months after the planned june 13 , 2007 , milestone when border patrol agents were to begin using project 28 technology to support their activities .
one component is the u.s. customs and border protection's ( cbp ) sbi program office which is responsible for developing a comprehensive border protection system using people , technology , known as sbinet , and tactical infrastructure â€” fencing , roads , and lighting .
in november 2005 , dhs announced the launch of sbi , a multiyear , multibillion - dollar program aimed at securing u.s. borders and reducing illegal immigration .
securing the nation's borders from illegal entry of aliens and contraband , including terrorists and weapons of mass destruction , continues to be a major concern .
