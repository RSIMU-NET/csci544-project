t he existence of a sizable population of "dreamers" in the united states has prompted questions about unauthorized aliens' eligibility for admission to public institutions of higher education , in - state tuition , and financial aid .
others , however , emphasize dreamers' presence in the united states in violation of federal immigration law , and seek to ensure that public benefits are made available only to u.s. citizens , lawful permanent residents ( lprs ) , and nonimmigrants with legal status .
however , several states have passed their own dream acts , which permit some dreamers to receive in - state tuition or , less commonly , state financial aid ( but cannot provide a pathway to citizenship because congress has exclusive power over naturalization ) .
no such legislation has been enacted by congress to date .
for example , in every congress from the 109 th to 113 th , members have introduced , either as separate bills or parts of other measures , versions of the development , relief , and education for alien minors ( dream ) act — from which dreamers take their name — that would create a pathway to citizenship for them , as well as remove certain restrictions on states' ability to grant in - state tuition to unauthorized aliens .
