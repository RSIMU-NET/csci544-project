 ( recommendation 1 ) .
this report examines ( 1 ) what has been the focus of federal railroad administration's ( fra ) grade - crossing - safety research , ( 2 ) how states select and implement grade - crossing projects and what railroad - and state - reported data are available from fra to inform states' decisions , and ( 3 ) the challenges states reported in implementing and assessing projects and the extent to which the federal highway administration ( fhwa ) assesses the program's effectiveness .
the continued number of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings with devices intended to warn of a train's presence calls into question whether the section 130 program is structured to help states continue making progress toward the national goal to reduce fatalities and injuries .
given these trends and the challenges discussed earlier related to the requirements of the section 130 program , it is not clear whether the program remains effective in continuing to reduce the risk of crashes and fatalities at grade crossings .
there could be ways to evaluate the program in a more comprehensive way ; many state dot officials we interviewed told us such a comprehensive evaluation could help improve program effectiveness in a number of ways , including by enabling the program to better keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and re - examining eligibility requirements that limit the flexibility of states to consider other types of projects beyond engineering .
