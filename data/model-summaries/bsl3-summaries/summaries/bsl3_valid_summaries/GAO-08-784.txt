we recommend that the secretary of state , in consultation with the director of ondcp , the secretaries of defense and homeland security , and the attorney general , ( 1 ) develop a plan to ensure that partner nations in the transit zone can effectively operate and maintain all counternarcotics assets that the united states has provided , including boats and other vehicles and equipment , for their remaining useful life and report this plan to the congress for the fiscal year 2010 appropriations cycle and ( 2 ) ensure that , before providing a counternarcotics asset to a partner nation , agencies determine the total operations and maintenance cost over its useful life and , with the recipient nation , develop a plan for funding this cost .
measuring the results of a wide variety of assistance programs across many countries over time is difficult as u.s. agencies have compiled limited and inconsistent performance data .
partner nations have limited resources to devote to counternarcotics efforts , and many u.s. - supported counternarcotics initiatives are not self - sustaining but , rather , are dependent on continued u.s. funding .
actionable intelligence is a critical component of interdiction , and the united states often requires access to raw information and sources from partner nations to develop this intelligence .
