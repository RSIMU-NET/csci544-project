the focus of this report is the global commercial space manufacturing sector ( launch vehicles , spacecraft , satellites , and parts and equipment ) .
the major policy issues discussed in this report are limited to those that appear to have large effects on the competitiveness of the u.s. space manufacturing sector: classification of commercial satellites as munitions subject to stringent u.s. export controls laws and regulations ; domestic and international spectrum regulations that may not have kept pace with the emergence of new technologies that appear to require much greater flexibility in terms of spectrum use ; and the dramatically increased use of commercial satellites for department of defense communications needs .
