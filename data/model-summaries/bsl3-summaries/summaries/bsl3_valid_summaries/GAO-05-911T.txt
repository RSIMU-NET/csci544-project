each year , federal agencies spend billions of dollars to buy commercial products and professional services through gsa's multiple award schedules program .
consequently , gsa has less assurance that vendor - supplied pricing information is accurate , complete , and current , and its ability to deter overpricing and recover overcharges has been minimized .
in conclusion , while gsa's schedules program has provided the government with a more flexible and cost - effective approach to buying commercial items , our work has shown that the program has long been fraught with problems of contract overpricing â€” resulting in millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the general services administration's ( gsa ) use of pre - award and postaward audits in pricing its multiple award schedules contracts .
when gsa has used pre - award and postaward audits , it has been able to avoid or recover hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges .
by delaying action to address its contract pricing problems , gsa continues to miss opportunities to minimize prices paid for goods and services and save significant sums of federal dollars .
