for several years , the united states postal service ( usps ) has not generated sufficient revenues to cover its expenses , putting its mission to provide prompt , reliable , and efficient service at risk .
among usps's activities to enhance its revenue are negotiated service agreements ( nsa ) , sales , and promotions designed to increase or sustain mail volume and revenue through temporary discounts on specific mail products .
as a result , usps's revenue has declined substantially .
although much of the focus has been on usps's costs as the way to close the gap between its revenues and expenses , generating additional revenue is also necessary .
we examined ( 1 ) the nsas , sales , and promotions usps has developed and their reported financial results , and ( 2 ) any opportunities to generate additional revenue from nsas , sales , and promotions and any challenges that could hinder their development and implementation .
in 2010 , we reported on various options to generate additional revenue , including the use of nsas , as part of a broader report on options to facilitate usps's progress toward financial sustainability .
