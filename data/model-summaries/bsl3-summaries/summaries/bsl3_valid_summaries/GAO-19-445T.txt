i am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of actions by the departments of the interior ( interior ) and health and human services ( hhs ) to address issues that led to the high - risk designation we made related to the federal management of programs that serve tribes and their members .
my statement today , which is largely based on our march 2019 high - risk series: substantial efforts needed to achieve greater progress on high - risk areas , will address actions taken and progress made by these agencies to address the five criteria we use for determining whether to remove a high - risk designation ( leadership commitment , capacity , action plan , monitoring , and demonstrated progress ) .

capacity .
since 1990 , generally every 2 years at the start of a new congress , we call attention to agencies and program areas that are high risk due to their vulnerability to mismanagement or that are most in need of transformation .

we added this area to our high - risk list in february 2017 because of our concern about the ability of agencies within these departments to manage ( 1 ) education and health care programs that serve tribes and their members and ( 2 ) indian energy resources .
