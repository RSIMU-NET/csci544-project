the department of health and human services ( hhs ) spends about $1 billion a year on programs for improving access to health care for areas with shortages of primary care physicians and health care services .
hhs has two such systems: the health professional shortage area ( hpsa ) system identifies underservice caused by a shortage of health professionals , and the medically underserved area ( mua ) system more broadly identifies areas and populations not receiving adequate health services for any reason , including provider shortages .
our report discusses how the department of health and human services' systems for identifying health care shortage areas are currently used to target resources to the underserved , and department proposals to combine these systems .
this report was prepared at our own initiative in response to the growing number of federal programs using health care shortage areas to determine who can apply for federal assistance .
under these agreements , state representatives are responsible for ( 1 ) participating in the development of statewide efforts to coordinate and implement primary care delivery systems , ( 2 ) identifying special underserved populations and the types of programs appropriate to incorporate these populations into the primary health care system , and ( 3 ) integrating federal assistance and health care delivery programs with existing local and state resources .
