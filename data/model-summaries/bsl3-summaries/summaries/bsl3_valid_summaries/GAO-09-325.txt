we have also tied acquisition problems in space to inadequate contracting strategies ; contract and program management weaknesses ; the loss of technical expertise ; capability gaps in the industrial base ; tensions between labs that develop technologies for the future and current acquisition programs ; divergent needs in users of space systems ; and other issues that have been well documented .
the global positioning system ( gps ) — a space - based satellite system that provides positioning , navigation , and timing data to users worldwide — has become essential to u.s. national security and a key component in economic growth , transportation safety , homeland security , and critical national infrastructure in the united states and abroad .
the modernization effort includes gps iif and iiia , two satellite acquisition programs currently underway that are to provide new space - based capabilities and replenish the satellite constellation ; the ground control segment hardware and software ; and user equipment for processing modernized gps capabilities .
the performance standards for both ( 1 ) the standard positioning service provided to civil and commercial gps users and ( 2 ) the precise positioning service provided to military gps users commit the u.s. government to at least a 95 percent probability of maintaining a constellation of 24 operational gps satellites .
