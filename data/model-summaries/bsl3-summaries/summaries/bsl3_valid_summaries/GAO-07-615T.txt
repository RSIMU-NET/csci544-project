whether under its existing authority or using any additional flexibility that congress may grant , fha's ability to manage risks and program changes will affect the financial performance of the insurance program .
specifically , i will discuss ( 1 ) weaknesses in how fha has managed the risks of loans with down - payment assistance , ( 2 ) practices that could be instructive for fha in managing the risks of new mortgage products , ( 3 ) fha's development and use of a mortgage scorecard , and ( 4 ) fha's estimation of subsidy costs for its single - family insurance program .
according to fha's estimates , the insurance program currently operates with a negative subsidy , meaning that the present value of estimated cash inflows ( such as borrower premiums ) to fha's mutual mortgage insurance fund ( fund ) exceeds the present value of estimated cash outflows ( such as claims ) .
to more reliably estimate program costs , we recommended that fha study and report in the annual actuarial review of the fund the impact of variables not in the agency's loan performance models ( the results of which are used in estimating and reestimating program costs ) that have been found in other studies to influence credit risk .
