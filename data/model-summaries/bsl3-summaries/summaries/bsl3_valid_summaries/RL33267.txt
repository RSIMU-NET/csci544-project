factors that may contribute to delays in a federal project include changes in the planning and design process , changes in funding priorities , construction complexities , local controversy or community opposition to a project , and compliance with myriad local , state , tribal or federal laws .
one law that has been the subject of particular scrutiny has been the national environmental policy act of 1969 ( nepa ; 42 u.s.c .
the perception that compliance with environmental requirements results in extensive delays and additional costs to the successful delivery of federal projects can be magnified when compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations is required ( as would likely be the case with large , complex federal projects ) .
due to the nature of nepa implementation , determining the time it takes to prepare nepa documentation , assessing the nature of delays related to nepa , and finding remedies to those delays may be more appropriately accomplished agency by agency .
as a result of the debate between stakeholders regarding nepa's implementation , numerous administrative and legislative actions have been proposed to expedite compliance with nepa .
with regard to the latter , certain federal actions such as highway construction projects and permitting for mining operations , cattle grazing , forest thinning , and energy development projects may trigger compliance with literally dozens of statutory and regulatory requirements .
