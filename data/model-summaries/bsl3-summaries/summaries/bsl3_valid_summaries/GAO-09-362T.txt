while the combat effectiveness of u.s. forces and weapon systems is unparalleled , dod has not been as effective in managing its ongoing business operations , which have adversely affected mission performance and increased the department's vulnerability to fraud , waste , abuse , and mismanagement .
current operational demands have highlighted the impact of these persistent problems as dod has been forced to work outside of its traditional acquisition process to acquire equipment that meets warfighter needs , as was the case with the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle .
for example , in response to congressional direction and gao recommendations , dod has established a framework for reviewing major services acquisitions ; promulgated regulations to better manage its use of contracting arrangements that can pose additional risks for the government , including time - and - materials contracts and undefinitized contracting actions ; and has efforts under way to identify and improve the skills and capabilities of its workforce .
our work , however , on dod's use of time - and - materials contracts and undefinitized contract actions — two contracting practices that are often used when requirements are uncertain or changing — identified weaknesses in dod's management and oversight , increasing the government's risk .
