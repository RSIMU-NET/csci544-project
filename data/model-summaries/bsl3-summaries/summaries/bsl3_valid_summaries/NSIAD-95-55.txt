as requested , we collected and analyzed information on ( 1 ) the status of the army's planning process for the nonstockpile disposal program , ( 2 ) the army's estimated disposal cost and schedule , and ( 3 ) lessons learned from the army's ongoing stockpile disposal program that may also apply to the proposed nonstockpile program .
the primary objectives of the plan are to ( 1 ) provide for clear and open exchange of information regarding current and planned investigation and cleanup activities , ( 2 ) address local community issues and concerns , ( 3 ) provide government agencies and the public the opportunity to participate in the corps of engineers' planning and decision - making process , and ( 4 ) provide government agencies and the public with a centralized point of contact .
this report responds to your request that we review the department of the army's disposal program for chemical munitions , materiel , and facilities that are not specifically included in the u.s. stockpile of unitary chemical weapons .
in the 1990s , we reported that the army did not adequately anticipate and plan for ( 1 ) the time needed to obtain the necessary environmental approvals and permits for the stockpile disposal program and ( 2 ) the strong public opposition to the chemical weapons incineration process .
