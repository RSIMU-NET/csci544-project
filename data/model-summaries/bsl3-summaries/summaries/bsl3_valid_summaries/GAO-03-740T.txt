since the introduction of the 2001 improvement plan , va has made some progress in resolving operational problems , such as fully implementing electronic billing , mandating the use of electronic medical records , and using preregistration software .
va officials told us that cbo's approach would combine the vha revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 ( 2001 improvement plan ) with additional initiatives , such as the development of an automated financial system that better serves billing needs and additional performance measures and standards for overseeing collection units' activities .
as a result , va lacks a reliable estimate of uncollected dollars and therefore does not have the basis to assess its systemwide operational effectiveness .
although va reported an increase in collections , we found that operational problems , such as missed billing opportunities , continued to limit collections .
for that work , we examined va's collections data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 and available data for 2003 ; reviewed relevant va documents , such as the veterans health administration's ( vha ) revenue cycle improvement plan of september 2001 ; and interviewed officials in va headquarters and in 3 of va's 21 health care networks â€” network 2 ( albany ) , network 9 ( nashville ) , and network 22 ( long beach ) .
