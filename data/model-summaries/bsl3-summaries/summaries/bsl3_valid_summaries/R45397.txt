in 2017 , approximately 39.7 million people , or 12.3% of the population , had incomes below the official definition of poverty in the united states .
among the suggested improvements were to have the poverty thresholds reflect the costs of food , clothing , shelter , utilities , and a little bit extra to allow for miscellaneous needs ; to broaden the definition of "family ; " to include geographic adjustments as part of the measure's computation ; to include the out - of - pocket costs of medical expenses in the measure's computation ; and to subtract work - related expenses from income .
the poverty rate ( the percentage that were in poverty ) , fell from 12.7% in 2016 , while the number of persons in poverty showed no discernible change .
the spm includes the effects of taxes and in - kind benefits ( such as housing , energy , and food assistance ) on poverty , while the official measure does not .
over the past several decades , criticisms of the official poverty measure have led to the development of an alternative research measure called the supplemental poverty measure ( spm ) , which the census bureau also computes and releases .
