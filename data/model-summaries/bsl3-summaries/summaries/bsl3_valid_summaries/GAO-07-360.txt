the joint strike fighter ( jsf ) is the department of defense's ( dod ) most expensive aircraft acquisition program .
specifically , we ( 1 ) determined the jsf program's progress in meeting cost , schedule , and performance goals ; and ( 2 ) identified the challenges and risk the program will face in meeting these goals in the future .
if the program is unable to mitigate risks , its only options will be to reduce program requirements or delay when the program achieves initial operational capability .
since our last report , the program estimated a $19.8 billion net increase in its total program costs .
as a result , purchase quantities have been reduced , total program costs have increased , and delivery of the initial aircraft has been delayed .
the jsf aircraft design includes three variants to be used by the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight cooperative international partners .
we see two ways this risk can be reduced: ( 1 ) reducing the number of aircraft for procurement before testing demonstrates their performance capabilities , thereby reducing the potential for costly changes to the aircraft and manufacturing processes or ( 2 ) reexamining the required capabilities for initial variants with an eye toward bringing them up to higher capability in the future .
