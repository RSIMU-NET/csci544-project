to provide you with an early snapshot of states' interest in establishing sibs , you asked that we ( 1 ) identify the extent of states' interest in the pilot program and how states might use sibs and ( 2 ) identify the benefits and barriers to states' using sibs .
to address these questions , we used a structured questionnaire to interview ( 1 ) transportation officials from 15 states that generally had expressed an interest to dot in innovative financing — 6 of which had been selected to participate in the sib pilot program — and ( 2 ) various financial representatives , such as firms that rate bonds' risk and financial condition .

total public spending on the capital needs for highways and bridges was approximately $40 billion in 1993 , the most recent year for which data are available .
