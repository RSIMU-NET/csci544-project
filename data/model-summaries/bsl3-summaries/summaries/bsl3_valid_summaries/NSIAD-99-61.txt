in february 1998 , we reported that the department of defense ( dod ) did not have receipts for about 60 percent of its 21 million shipments to end users in fiscal year 1997 .
our objectives for this report were to ( 1 ) identify the reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) and ( 2 ) assess the navy's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory .
second , the integrated accounting and logistics systems that tie the navy's accounting systems to its in - transit inventory tracking systems have not been effective .
more specifically , we ( 1 ) identified the reported value and types of inventory in transit within and between storage and repair activities , vendors , and end users that were unaccounted for ( or lost ) and ( 2 ) assessed the navy's adherence to procedures for controlling such in - transit inventory .
the navy's in - transit inventory losses may be greater than the navy recognizes because of uncertainties about the status of shipments to end users that did not have a corresponding notification of receipt .
