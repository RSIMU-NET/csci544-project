to develop the information on the future combat system program's progress toward meeting established goals , the contribution of critical technologies and complementary systems , and the estimates of cost and affordability , we interviewed officials of the office of the under secretary of defense ( acquisition , technology , and logistics ) ; the army g - 8 ; the office of the under secretary of defense ( comptroller ) ; the secretary of defense's cost analysis improvement group ; the director of operational test and evaluation ; the assistant secretary of the army ( acquisition , logistics , and technology ) ; the army's training and doctrine command ; surface deployment and distribution command ; the program manager for the future combat system ( brigade combat team ) ; the future combat system lead systems integrator ; and other contractors .
fcs is in the forefront of efforts to help the army transform itself into a lighter , more agile , and more capable combat force by using a new concept of operations , new technologies , and a new information network linking whole brigades together .
today , i would like to discuss ( 1 ) the scope of the business case that we feel is necessary for the fcs to be successful and ( 2 ) our recent recommendations to dod and matters for congressional consideration regarding the fcs program .
