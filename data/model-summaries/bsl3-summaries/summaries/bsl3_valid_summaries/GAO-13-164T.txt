gao has reported six times over the last 22 years that replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin would result in net financial benefits to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
my statement today addresses ( 1 ) our most recent estimates of the net financial benefit from replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin , ( 2 ) the long - standing public and private sector considerations of such a replacement , and ( 3 ) the experiences of other countries with replacing currency .
this statement is based primarily on our most recent reports issued in march 2011 and february 2012 .
we have previously reported on public opposition to using the $1 coin and the challenges that private businesses such as vending machine owners would face if such a transition were undertaken .
we continue to believe that replacing the note with a coin is likely to provide a financial benefit to the government if the note is eliminated and negative public reaction is effectively managed through stakeholder outreach and public education .
in february 2012 , we reported that the increased seigniorage resulting from replacing $1 notes with $1 coins could potentially offer $4.4 billion in net benefits to the government over 30 years .
