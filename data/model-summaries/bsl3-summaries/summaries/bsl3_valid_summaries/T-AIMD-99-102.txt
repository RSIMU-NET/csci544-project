we have made many recommendations to reduce those risks ; however , blm has been slow to implement some recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others .
we have previously reported on the significant problems and risks that blm has encountered .
in addition , to reduce the risk that future efforts will result in similar failures , blm should assess its information technology investment practices and systems acquisition capabilities .
mr. chairman , blm spent over 15 years and estimates that it invested about $411 million planning and developing the almrs / modernization , only to have the major software component — known as the almrs initial operating capability ( ioc ) — fail .
the bureau now needs to determine whether it can salvage any of the more than $67-million reported investment in almrs ioc software , by analyzing the software to determine if it can be cost - beneficially modified to meet blm's needs .
blm has been slow to implement some of our recommendations and has not yet fully implemented others .
the almrs / modernization was intended to provide modern computer and telecommunications equipment and office automation for over 200 offices nationwide as well as software to more efficiently record , maintain , and retrieve land description , ownership , and use information to support blm , other federal programs , and interested parties .
