my testimony summarizes our report , focusing on ( 1 ) what is known about how climate change might affect the frequency and severity of damaging weather - related events , ( 2 ) the extent of the insured losses incurred by private and federal insurers and reinsurers resulting from weather - related events , and ( 3 ) what major federal agencies and private insurers and reinsurers are doing to prepare for the potential risk of increased losses .
both agencies expressed agreement with this recommendation .
to describe how climate change might affect insured and uninsured losses , we reviewed and summarized key scientific assessments by reputable international and national research organizations , including the ipcc , nas , and the multi - federal agency climate change science program ( ccsp ) .
but in any case , climate change , defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) as any change in the climate over time due to either natural variability or as a result of human activity , may affect social and economic activities in potentially profound ways â€” by raising sea levels , changing precipitation patterns , and altering the frequency or severity of weather - related events .
