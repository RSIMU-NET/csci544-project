the cash management improvement act ( cmia ) of 1990 , as amended ( public law 101-453 ) , focuses on promoting equity in the exchange of funds between the federal government and the states .
while we performed limited testing of the reasonableness of the calculated interest liability and reimbursement of the direct costs for the 12 states visited , our audit scope did not include an assessment of the accuracy and completeness of the $34 million net interest liability ( comprised of $41.6 million of state interest liabilities offset by a $4.7 federal interest liability and $2.5 million in states' claims for direct costs reimbursement ) , nor did we test the accuracy of program disbursements made by the states .
they published final rules and regulations for implementing cmia ; contracted for development of clearance patterns that could be used by states that did not develop their own ; developed and issued an implementation guide , federal and state review guides , and a treasury - state agreement form book ; negotiated first year tsas , within the time period specified in the act , with all but two states and second year agreements with all but one state ; reviewed the documentation for reimbursement of allowable direct costs over $50,000 submitted by the states ; received first - year annual reports from all the states and submitted them to program agencies for review of federal interest liabilities claimed ; issued several policy statements intended to clarify regulations ; submitted to omb suggested language on cmia - related audit objectives and procedures for inclusion in the planned revisions to the compliance supplement for single audit act reviews ; and developed plans to revise the cmia regulations to streamline processes to make them more flexible .
