to help ensure that decision makers and congress have the necessary information to provide effective oversight of dod's civilian workforce and that the strategic workforce plan can be used effectively , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the office of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness align dod's strategic workforce plan with the budget and management workforce initiatives , such as those to address recruiting , retention , and readiness issues associated with declining morale among its civilian workforces .
current budget and long - term fiscal pressures necessitate that federal government agencies , including the department of defense ( dod ) , operate more strategically and efficiently than ever before , and this includes cost - effective management of human - capital policies and practices .
to determine the extent to which the department of defense's ( dod ) fiscal year 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan addressed the statutory requirements of section 115b of title 10 of the united states code , we evaluated dod's 2013-2018 strategic workforce plan and supporting documentation to determine the degree to which the plan addresses , partially addresses , or does not address each of the required elements .
