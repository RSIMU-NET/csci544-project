human rights conditions in the people's republic of china ( prc ) remain a central issue in u.s. - china relations .
for many u.s. policy - makers , progress in this area represents a test of the success of u.s. engagement with china , particularly since permanent normal trade relations ( pntr ) status was established in 2000 .
policy tools include private discussions ; sanctions ; open criticism of prc human rights policies ; coordinating international pressure ; support of and contact with dissidents ; bilateral dialogue ; human rights , democracy , and related programs in the prc ; promoting internet freedom ; public diplomacy efforts ; and monitoring and highlighting human rights abuses .
some analysts contend that the u.s. policy of engagement with china has failed to produce meaningful political reform , and that without fundamental progress in this area , the bilateral relationship will remain unstable .
disagreements over whether progress has been made often stem from differences over which indicators are emphasized , such as central government policies , local government actions , civil society , or short - term versus long - term trends .
others argue that u.s. engagement has helped to accelerate economic and social change and build social and legal foundations for democracy and the advancement of human rights in the prc .
