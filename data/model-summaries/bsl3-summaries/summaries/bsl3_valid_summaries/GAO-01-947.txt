specifically , our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine the factors that influence employee turnover and morale ; ( 2 ) assess the extent of sec's use of human capital policies and practices to recruit , motivate , and retain staff ; and ( 3 ) assess sec's strategic management of its human capital .
however , pay may not be the only factor affecting staff decisions to leave sec ; sec's organizational culture and human capital policies and practices may also have influenced employee retention .
first , it has improved its recruiting efforts .
over 1,000 employees , or about one - third of the staff , left the u.s securities and exchange commission ( sec ) from 1998 to 2000 .
according to the former acting sec chairman , sec has been experiencing a staffing crisis that is adversely affecting its ability to protect investors and promote the integrity and efficiency of u.s. securities markets .
sec officials attributed this staffing crisis largely to sec's compensation levels , which are lower than those in the private sector and at other federal financial regulators .
despite these positive developments , sec has not addressed several important human capital management issues .
