the new york times reported in january 2008 that the bush administration has crafted a draft proposal for a u.s. - iraq security agreement which would , if agreed upon by the parties , provide the united states with broad authority to conduct military operations in iraq , guarantee u.s. military forces and contractors immunity from iraqi law , and provide the united states with the power to detain iraqi prisoners .
on november 26 , 2007 , u.s. president george w. bush and iraqi prime minister nouri kamel al - maliki signed a declaration of principles for a long - term relationship of cooperation and friendship between the republic of iraq and the united states of america .
2642 would condition appropriations from being used to negotiate , enter into , or implement any agreement with iraq containing security assurances for mutual defense ( which is defined to include a binding commitment to defend iraq , or specifications regarding the nature or duration of the u.s. mission in iraq or the number of u.s. troops stationed there ) , unless the agreement takes the form of a treaty or is approved by an act of congress .
it is not clear whether the agreement ( s ) discussed in the declaration will take the form of a treaty or some other type of international compact .
