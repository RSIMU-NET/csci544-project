today , i will discuss ( 1 ) current jsf cost and schedule estimates ; ( 2 ) issues concerning the alternate engine program ; ( 3 ) manufacturing performance ; ( 4 ) contracting issues for procurement of production aircraft ; and ( 5 ) development test plans .
jsf development will cost more and take longer to complete than reported to the congress in april 2008 , primarily because of contract cost overruns and extended time needed to complete flight testing .
total development costs are projected to increase between $2.4 billion and $7.4 billion and the schedule for completing system development to be extended from 1 to 3 years , according to estimates made in late 2008 â€” one by the jsf program office and one by a joint team of office of the secretary of defense ( osd ) , air force , and navy officials .
our most recent report in march of this year discussed increased development costs and schedule , plans to accelerate procurement , manufacturing performance and delays , and the development test strategy .
the jsf is the department of defense's ( dod ) most costly acquisition program , seeking to simultaneously develop , produce , and field three aircraft variants for the air force , navy , marine corps , and eight international partners .
