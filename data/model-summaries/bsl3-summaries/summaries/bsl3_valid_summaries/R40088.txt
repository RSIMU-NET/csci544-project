the budget also affects , and is affected by , the national economy as a whole .
the enactment of financial intervention and fiscal stimulus legislation designed to alleviate a credit crunch and to bolster the economy will push up the deficit , shifting fiscal burdens into the future .
the budget process allows the president and congress to negotiate and refine spending plans for the nation's fiscal priorities .
the federal budget over the next few fiscal years will likely face significant challenges to both revenues and outlays as a result of recent turmoil in the economy and financial markets .

federal budget decisions express congress's priorities among competing aims and reinforce congress's influence on federal policies .
the $787.2 billion package ( according to cbo ) includes extended unemployment benefits , aid to state and local governments in the form of higher infrastructure , medicaid , school spending , health care information technology funding , as well as tax cuts and rebates .
