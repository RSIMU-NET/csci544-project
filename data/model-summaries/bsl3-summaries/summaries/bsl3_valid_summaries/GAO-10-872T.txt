federal agencies are increasingly using recently developed technologies ( commonly referred to as "web 2.0" technologies ) that offer flexible , sophisticated capabilities for interaction with individuals , allowing agencies and the public to publish comments , photos , and videos directly on agency - sponsored web pages .
they examine: ( a ) who created the record and the intent of the record creator ; ( b ) whether the agency intended to relinquish control ; ( c ) the agency's ability to use or dispose of the record ; and ( d ) the extent to which the record is integrated into the agency's files .
to perform our analysis , we reviewed relevant reports produced by the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , general services administration ( gsa ) , and national archives and records administration ( nara ) .
in this statement i will describe the current uses of web 2.0 technologies by federal agencies , key challenges associated with their use of these technologies , and initial steps agencies have taken to address identified issues .
my testimony is based on our analysis of federal government policies , reports , and guidance related to the use of web 2.0 technologies .
