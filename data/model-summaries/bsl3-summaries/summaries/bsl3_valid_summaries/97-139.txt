this is an overview of federal forfeiture law .
it sketches the origins and general attributes of forfeiture , describes the distribution of the hundreds of millions of dollars it generates , and identifies some of the constitutional issues it raises .
congress and state legislatures have authorized the use of forfeiture for over 200 years .
forfeiture law has always been somewhat unique .
its increased use has highlighted its eccentricities and attendant policy concerns .
present forfeiture law has its roots in early english law .
in colonial america , common law forfeitures were rare .
it is reminiscent of three early english procedures: deodands , forfeiture of estate or common law forfeiture , and statutory or commercial forfeiture .
it was used fairly extensively against smuggling and other revenue evasion schemes in the american colonies and has been used ever since .
after the revolution , the constitution restricted the use of common law forfeiture in cases of treason , and congress restricted its use , by statute , in the case of other crimes .
at early common law , the object that caused the death of a human being — the ox that gored , the knife that stabbed , or the cart that crushed — was confiscated as a deodand .
