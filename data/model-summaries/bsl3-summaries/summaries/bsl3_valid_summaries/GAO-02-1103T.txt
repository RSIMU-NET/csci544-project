my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the benefits nonprofit research corporations provide to va , ( 2 ) processes to detect individual and institutional conflicts of interest within nonprofit research corporations , and ( 3 ) nonprofit research corporations' financial activities and how they are monitored by va. to conduct our work , we visited 5 of the 88 nonprofit corporations based on their dollar revenues for 2000 .
in summary , we found the following: nonprofit corporations support va's research environment by funding a portion of the department's research needs , such as laboratory equipment and improvements to infrastructure , and by providing flexible personnel and contracting arrangements to respond to investigators' needs .
we also interviewed officials from federal agencies that provide funds to va nonprofit research corporations , including the national institutes of health ( nih ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) within the department of health and human services ( hhs ) , and the department of defense ( dod ) .
for example , the va inspector general's last major review of the program occurred in 1994 , when va was cited for failing to provide adequate policies and guidance relating to budgeting , accounting , and oversight of these corporations .
