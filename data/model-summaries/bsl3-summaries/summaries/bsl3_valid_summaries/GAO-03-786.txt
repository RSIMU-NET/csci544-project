however the report also noted the ( 1 ) lack of supervisory review and approval of cardholder transactions , ( 2 ) delays by cardholders in validating purchase transactions that have been paid , and ( 3 ) inadequate monitoring by agency management .
in response to your request , we initiated a body of work designed to determine whether ( 1 ) existing internal controls at the forest service were designed to provide reasonable assurance that improper purchases would be prevented or detected in the normal course of business , ( 2 ) the forest service's fiscal year 2001 purchase card transactions were made in accordance with established policies and procedures , and ( 3 ) purchases were made for a reasonable cost and reflected a legitimate government need .
since usda's office of procurement and property management is responsible for the oversight of the purchase card program for all of usda's agencies , we used the number of cardholders that they provided for fiscal year 2001 in our report .
the use of purchase cards in the federal government has dramatically increased in past years as agencies have sought to streamline the administrative procedures long associated with making small purchases .
