this testimony addresses ( 1 ) the specific efforts of u.s. agencies to improve intellectual property protection in other nations , ( 2 ) the means used to coordinate these efforts , and ( 3 ) challenges facing the enforcement efforts abroad .
as a result , u.s. goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy in many countries .
the u.s. government provides broad protection for intellectual property through means such as copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
the u.s. government , through numerous agencies , is seeking better intellectual property protection overseas .
however , protection of intellectual property in many parts of the world is inadequate .
u.s. efforts have contributed to strengthened foreign ipr laws , but enforcement overseas remains weak .
to understand more fully how u.s. agencies have performed in this regard , you asked us to identify and review their activities .
in addition , u.s. efforts confront numerous challenges .
as you know , the united states dominates the creation and export of intellectual property â€” creations of the mind .
thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on u.s. efforts to protect u.s. intellectual property rights ( ipr ) overseas and our recent report on this topic .
