in this regard , the center for clean air policy has raised the question of whether participation should include fuel producers or fuel users or both and thought that a credit program should focus on fuel users .
table 1 analyzes each of the four basic issues needing resolution in an early credit program by using three sets of reporting criteria — the current flexible voluntary reporting program and two sets of more restrictive criteria .
 ( 2 ) how might claims for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that are reported to the voluntary reporting program fare under a credit for early action program that has less flexible reporting criteria ? .
the following examples of actual claims of greenhouse gas emissions reductions that companies have reported to the voluntary reporting program serve to ( 1 ) further illustrate the four basic issues that will likely need to be addressed in designing a credit for early action program and ( 2 ) show how such claims may be evaluated if more restrictive reporting criteria were established .
to help address the potential for duplication , the program established the concept of “direct” and “indirect” ownership , which attempts to categorize the claims .
