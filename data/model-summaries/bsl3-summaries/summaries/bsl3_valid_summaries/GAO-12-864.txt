to increase d - snps' accountability and ensure that cms has the information it needs to determine whether d - snps are providing the services needed by dual - eligible beneficiaries , especially those who are most vulnerable , the administrator of cms should take the following four actions: require d - snps to state explicitly in their models of care the extent of services they expect to provide , to increase accountability and to facilitate evaluation ; require d - snps to collect and report to cms standard performance and outcome measures to be outlined in their models of care that are relevant to the population they serve , including measures of beneficiary health risk , beneficiary vulnerability , and plan performance ; systematically analyze these data and make the results routinely available to the public ; and conduct an evaluation of the extent to which d - snps have provided sufficient and appropriate care to the population they serve , and report the results in a timely manner .
in this report , we ( 1 ) describe the characteristics and health status of dual - eligible beneficiaries in d - snps and how they compare to those of dual - eligible beneficiaries in other ma plans and medicare ffs , ( 2 ) determine the extent to which d - snps' specialized services differ from those offered by other ma plans , and ( 3 ) describe how d - snps work with state medicaid agencies to enhance benefit integration and care coordination for dual - eligible beneficiaries .
