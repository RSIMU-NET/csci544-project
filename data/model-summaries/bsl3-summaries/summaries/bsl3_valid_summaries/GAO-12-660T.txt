my testimony today focuses on ( 1 ) how faa uses data to manage safety risks , ( 2 ) how faa ensures it has quality data to manage risk , and ( 3 ) the challenges faa faces in using data to better manage safety risks .
as a result , faa developed a concerted strategy to implement new safety programs required by the airline safety act , including establishing better processes for managing safety risks and advancing safety management systems ( sms ) .
although faa concurred with our recommendations , it has not fully implemented them .
some of these limitations hinder the agency's ability to comprehensively and accurately assess and manage risk , as seen in the following examples: faa's changes to reporting policies impact its ability to accurately determine operational error trends .
in november 2011 , we recommended that faa develop a comprehensive system for measuring its performance in meeting its inspection requirements for pilot schools and examiners.that ( 1 ) it needed to clarify its inspection requirements for pilot schools in the revision of its national oversight policy guidelines , and ( 2 ) its new designee management system , which would include oversight of pilot examiners , will provide more comprehensive data once it is developed .
