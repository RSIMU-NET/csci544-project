challenges developing required training .
va's oversight of vamcs' compliance with selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements has weaknesses , which result in va not being able to systematically identify and address noncompliance .
use the information on noncompliance identified by the visns and information on vamcs' corrective action plans to identify areas of noncompliance across all 153 vamcs , including those that occur frequently , pose high risks to veterans' safety , or have not been addressed , and take action to improve compliance in those areas .
to examine department of veterans affairs ( va ) purchasing , tracking , and reprocessing requirements , we reviewed relevant va policies and from these policies we judgmentally selected two purchasing requirements , two tracking requirements , and two reprocessing requirements that we determined were relevant to veterans' safety issues that were identified at certain va medical centers ( vamc ) in 2008 and 2009 .
