for this report , we evaluated ( 1 ) how state assesses risks to u.s. diplomatic residences overseas ; ( 2 ) the timeliness , clarity , and consistency of state's security standards for these residences ; ( 3 ) how state addresses security vulnerabilities at residences ; and ( 4 ) how state manages risks to other soft targets overseas .
because of limited awareness of the guidance and tools for securing schools and other soft targets , state may not be fully leveraging its existing programs and resources for addressing the security needs of schools and other soft targets .
for example , ds could conduct a comprehensive review of its various standards and security - related guidance for residences and take steps to identify and eliminate gaps and inconsistencies .
