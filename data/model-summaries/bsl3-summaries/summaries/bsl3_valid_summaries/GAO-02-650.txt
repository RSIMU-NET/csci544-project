improvements to industrial base capability assessments could lead to increased readiness and to reduced costs for unneeded wartime spare parts inventories in this report , we address whether ( 1 ) the army has begun to collect and use current industrial base data and ( 2 ) opportunities exist to improve the reliability of the army's industrial base capability assessments .
to determine whether the army is using current industrial base data for assessing wartime spare parts industrial base capability , we interviewed army officials responsible for war reserve spare parts planning , requirements development , and estimation of industrial base capability in the office of the army deputy chief of staff for logistics in washington , district of columbia ; the army materiel command in alexandria , virginia ; the army aviation and missile command at redstone arsenal , alabama ; and the army materiel systems analysis agency at aberdeen proving grounds , maryland .
dod partially concurred with the overall findings and recommendations .
the army's approach for assessing wartime spare parts industrial base capability still does not use current data from industry .
in order to improve the army's readiness for wartime operations , achieve greater economy in purchasing decisions , and provide congress with accurate budget submissions for war reserve spare parts , we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to have the commander of army material command take the following actions to expand or change its current process consistent with the attributes in this report: establish an overarching industrial base capability assessment process that considers the attributes in this report ; develop a method to efficiently collect current industrial base capability data directly from industry itself ; create analytical tools that identify potential production capability problems such as those due to surge in wartime spare parts demand ; and create management strategies for resolving spare parts availability problems , for example , by changing acquisition procedures or by targeting investments in material and technology resources to reduce production lead times .
