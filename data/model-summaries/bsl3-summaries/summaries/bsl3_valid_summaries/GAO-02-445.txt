as you requested , we address in this report the views of pilots and other aircrew members of the air national guard and air force reserve regarding the anthrax vaccine immunization program ( avip ) of the department of defense ( dod ) .
dod temporarily restricted the mandatory anthrax program in 2000 to a very small group ( special mission individuals and researchers ) because of limited vaccine supply resulting from the closing of the vaccine manufacturing plant .
the perpetrator — individual , group , or other entity — responsible for sending the anthrax letters has not yet been identified .
however , since most of the questions were , at the time , related to and report views on contemporaneous events ( for example , information provided in 1999 and 2000 or information about adverse reactions experienced with inoculations given before 2000 ) , we believe the results of the survey are still valid and useful as a measure of the avip program's performance .
this information should be of interest to dod and the congress as they consider future anthrax vaccine programs .
these tragedies were followed in october 2001 by the mailing of anthrax - laced letters that killed five people in the united states .
