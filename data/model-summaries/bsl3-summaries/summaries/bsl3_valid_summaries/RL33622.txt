as a result , in a proclamation signed by fidel , raúl castro became first secretary of the communist party , commander in chief of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) , and president of the council of state and government , top positions that fidel had held .
on july 31 , 2006 , president fidel castro provisionally ceded political power to his brother raúl "for several weeks" in order to recover from intestinal surgery .
in the new context of fidel's provisional transfer of power to his brother raúl , observers have advocated two general policy approaches to contend with cuba's transition process: 1 ) a stay - the - course or status - quo approach that would maintain the u.s. dual - track policy of isolating the cuban government while providing support to the cuban people ; and 2 ) an approach aimed at influencing the cuban government and cuban society through increased contact and engagement .
these fit into three broad categories: the continuation of a communist government ; a military government ; or a democratic transition or fully democratic government .
at this juncture , congress and the administration essentially agree that any change in the u.s. sanctions - based policy toward cuba will only be triggered by substantial movement toward democracy on the island .
