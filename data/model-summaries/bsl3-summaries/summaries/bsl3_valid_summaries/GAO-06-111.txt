this plan should include: the specific equipment requirements , costs , timelines , and funding strategy for converting army national guard units to the modular force and the extent to which guard units will have comparable types of equipment and equipment levels as the active modular units , an analysis of the equipment the army national guard's units will need for their missions in each phase of the rotation cycle , and how the army will manage implementation risks to modular forces if full funding is not provided on the expected timeline .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the secretary of the army to develop and submit to congress a plan and funding strategy that addresses the equipment needs of the army national guard for the global war on terrorism and addresses how the army will transition from short - term equipping measures to long - term equipping solutions .
in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and the subsequent launch of the global war on terrorism , the army national guard has been called upon to play a significant role in supporting active army forces overseas while , at the same time , taking on new homeland defense missions , such as protecting critical infrastructure â€” all of which require that the army national guard have sufficient quantities and types of equipment items .
