to strengthen the ability of cms to identify and report to congress on jcaho's ability to ensure that the hospitals it accredits protect the safety and health of patients through compliance with the medicare cops , we recommend that the administrator of cms take the following three actions: modify the method used to measure the rate of disparity between validation survey findings and accreditation program findings to provide a reasonable assurance that medicare cops are being met and consider whether additional measures are needed to accurately reflect an accreditation program's ability to detect deficiencies in medicare cops ; provide in the annual report to congress an estimate , based on the validation survey sample , of the performance of all jcaho - accredited hospitals , including the limitations and protocols for these estimates based on generally accepted sampling and statistical methodologies ; and develop a written protocol for these calculations ; and annually conduct traditional validation surveys on a sample of jcaho - accredited hospitals that is equal to at least 5 percent of all jcaho - accredited hospitals .
the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , the agency responsible for administering medicare , has established quality and patient safety requirements called conditions of participation ( cop ) that hospitals must meet in order to be eligible for medicare payment .
