we recommend that the secretary of veterans affairs direct the under secretary for benefits to report the accuracy of vba disability compensation and pension claims decisions to the congress and other stakeholders in a manner that allows for valid comparisons of accuracy across fiscal years and better hold regional offices accountable for the accuracy of their claims decisions , by increasing the use of its regional office accuracy data , while at the same time maintaining an appropriate emphasis on production .
in response , we assessed ( 1 ) how accuracy may have changed since vba increased its emphasis on production and ( 2 ) how well vba ensures the accuracy of its decisions .
at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 , over 400,000 claims for disability compensation and pension benefits were waiting for veterans benefits administration ( vba ) decisions .
however , vba's accuracy has declined .
while vba has established accuracy standards for its regional offices , it has not made the best use of its accuracy data on regional offices .
in light of vba's emphasis on completing more claims decisions more quickly , you asked us to assist the committee in its oversight of vba by examining the agency's efforts to ensure the accuracy of decision - making in its disability compensation and pension benefits programs .
