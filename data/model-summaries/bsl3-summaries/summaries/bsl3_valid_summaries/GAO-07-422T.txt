to reduce program vulnerabilities and ensure limited compliance - monitoring resources are used efficiently , gao recommended in its october 2006 trafficking report that fns take additional steps to target and provide early oversight of stores most likely to traffic ; develop a strategy to increase penalties for trafficking , working with the inspector general as needed ; and promote state efforts to pursue recipients suspected of trafficking .
fns has taken advantage of electronic benefit transfer ( ebt ) and other new technology to improve its ability to detect trafficking and disqualify retailers who traffic , while law enforcement agencies have investigated and referred for prosecution a decreasing number of traffickers , instead focusing their efforts on fewer high - impact investigations .
the information i am presenting today is based primarily on findings from our past work on two issues related to ensuring integrity of the program: ( 1 ) improper payments to food stamp participants , and ( 2 ) trafficking in food stamp benefits .
from 2000 to 2005 , the program has grown from $15 billion in benefits provided to 17 million individuals to $29 billion in benefits to nearly 26 million individuals .
