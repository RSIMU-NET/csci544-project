formal international negotiations to address human - driven climate change were launched in december 1990 .
these negotiations yielded the united nations framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) in 1992 .
the unfccc entered into force on march 21 , 1994 .
the unfccc does not set binding targets for greenhouse gas ( "ghg" ) emissions .
the unfccc provides a structure for international consideration of climate change .
in doing so , the parties established two tracks for negotiation: ( 1 ) a track by which kyoto protocol parties would pursue an amendment to the protocol for a "second round" of emission targets for annex i parties , and ( 2 ) a track by which unfccc parties would seek agreement on ghg mitigation targets or actions for all parties .
first , the united states must sign the treaty ; second , the agreement must be submitted by the executive to the u.s. senate for its advice and consent to treaty ratification and two - thirds of the senators present must give their approval ( sometimes inaccurately referred to as "ratification by the senate" ) ; and third , the president must ratify the agreement by following the terms of the agreement for ratification or accession .
