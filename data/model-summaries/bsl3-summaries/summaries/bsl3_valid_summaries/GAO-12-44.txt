however , the plan did not indicate how tsa would target its outreach efforts to those entities not already on tsa's lists .
because tsa has not clearly defined and documented roles and responsibilities for disseminating security - related information and the full range of its information - sharing efforts , tsa may not be consistently providing security - related information products to external stakeholders and divisions within tsa may not be held fully accountable for performing their information - sharing activities .
the implementing recommendations of the 9 / 11 commission act of 2007 ( 9 / 11 commission act ) directed dhs to create a transportation security information sharing plan ( tsisp ) , which was first issued in july 2008 and most recently updated in december 2010 and is designed to establish a foundation for sharing transportation security - related information between public and private entities that have a stake in protecting the nation's transportation system .
tsa - oi stated that it has several planned changes to its information - sharing strategy but has not yet issued them in a documented plan that identifies the specific roles and responsibilities of its internal partners , specific goals for information sharing , and how progress in meeting those goals is measured .
