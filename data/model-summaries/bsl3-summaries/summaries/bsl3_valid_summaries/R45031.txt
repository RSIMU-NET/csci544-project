as its name might suggest , t he s upplemental poverty measure ( spm ) was developed to supplement , but not replace , the official poverty measure by addre ssin g some of its met hodological limitations .
particularly visible and of possible relevance to congress are the effects that taxes and tax credits , noncash transfer programs , and work - related and medical expenses have on poverty .
t he official measure provides a consistent historical view of poverty in the united states , but t he spm may be better suited to help ing c ongress ional policymakers and other experts understand how taxes and government programs affect the poor .
also , it may better illustrate how medical expenses and work - related expenses such as child care can affect a family's economic well - being .
through 2016 , the census bureau has produced estimates of individuals living in poverty as measured by the spm using the annual social and economic supplement ( asec ) to the current population survey ( cps ) as the source of the family relationship and income information used to compute poverty status .
this report will not dis cuss potential consequences of changes to anti - poverty programs , nor will it provide an analys is of poverty trends .
