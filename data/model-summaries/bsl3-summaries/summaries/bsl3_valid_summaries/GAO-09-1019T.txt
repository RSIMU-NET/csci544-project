specifically , we examined the extent to which the six agencies we reviewed have ( 1 ) comparable policies concerning compensation and any issues that may affect the compensation to which deployed civilians are entitled ; ( 2 ) comparable policies and practices concerning medical benefits for deployed civilians and any issues that may affect the medical benefits to which deployed civilians are entitled ; and ( 3 ) policies and procedures to identify and track deployed civilians to address any future medical issues that may emerge as a result of their deployment .
we therefore recommended that ( 1 ) opm oversee an executive agency working group on compensation for deployed civilians to address any differences and if necessary make legislative recommendations ; ( 2 ) the agencies included in our review establish ombudsman programs or , for agencies deploying small numbers of civilians , focal points to help ensure that deployed civilians receive the compensation to which they are entitled ; and ( 3 ) labor set a time frame for issuing implementing guidance for the death gratuity .
to determine the extent to which these agencies have any implementation issues that may affect the compensation and medical benefits to which deployed civilians are entitled , we reviewed pre - deployment information and instructional documents pertaining to the compensation and medical benefits to which deployed civilians are entitled , as well as agency practices for medically screening civilians both before and following their deployments .
