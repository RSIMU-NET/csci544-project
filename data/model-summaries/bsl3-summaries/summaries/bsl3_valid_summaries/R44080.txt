the fcc has adopted numerous proceedings to facilitate access to and the adoption of advanced services including the following: the transition of the universal service fund from a mechanism that supports voice service to one that supports the deployment and adoption of both fixed and mobile broadband ; the modernization of the schools and libraries program to incorporate high speed broadband and wi - fi connections ; and the expansion of the lifeline program to provide support for broadband as well as voice services , to name a few .
the council's objectives were to engage with industry and other stakeholders to understand ways the government can better support the needs of communities seeking to expand broadband access and adoption ; identify regulatory barriers unduly impeding broadband deployment , adoption , or competition ; survey and report back on existing programs that currently support or could be modified to support broadband competition , deployment , or adoption ; and take all necessary actions to remove these barriers and realign existing programs to increase broadband competition , deployment , and adoption .
broadband — also referred to as high - speed internet service — has been deployed in the united states since the late 1990s , primarily by private sector providers .
