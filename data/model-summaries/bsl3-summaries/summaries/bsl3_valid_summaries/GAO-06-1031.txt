to identify individuals with known or potential links to terrorism , since the tragedies of september 11 , 2001 , agencies such as the departments of state , justice , and homeland security have implemented enhanced procedures to screen international travelers , airline passengers , and visa applicants .
one important homeland security tool used by these federal frontline - screening agencies is the terrorist - screening database , otherwise known as the consolidated watch list , containing the names of individuals with known and suspected links to terrorism .
the database , which contains names of foreign and u.s. citizens , is maintained by the terrorist screening center , an entity that has been operational since december 2003 under the administration of the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) .
the screening agencies and airlines generally do not maintain readily available statistics on these resolutions .
specific instances have been widely reported in newspapers and other media , including cases involving members of congress and other high - profile individuals .
based upon agency - specific policies and criteria , relevant portions of the terrorist screening center's consolidated watch list can be used in a wide range of security - related screening procedures .
