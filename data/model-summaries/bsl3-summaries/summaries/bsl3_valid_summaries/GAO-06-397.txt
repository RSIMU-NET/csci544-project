in this report , we ( 1 ) describe dod's extended health care benefit for oef / oif veterans and va's health care services for oef / oif veterans ; ( 2 ) analyze dod data to determine the number of oef / oif servicemembers who may be at risk for developing ptsd and the number of these servicemembers who were referred for further mental health evaluations ; and ( 3 ) examine whether dod can provide reasonable assurance that oef / oif servicemembers who need further mental health evaluations receive referrals for these evaluations .
servicemembers returning from the military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq — operation enduring freedom ( oef ) and operation iraqi freedom ( oif ) , respectively — have engaged in intense and prolonged combat , which research has shown to be strongly associated with the risk for developing ptsd .
we recommend that the secretary of defense direct the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs to identify the factors that dod health care providers use in issuing referrals for further mental health or combat / operational stress reaction evaluations to explain provider variation in issuing referrals .
