within the federal government , the food and drug administration ( fda ) is responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's blood supply .
in recent years , an average of about 8 million volunteers have donated more than 14 million units of blood annually , and approximately 4.5 million patients per year have received life - saving blood transfusions , according to the american association of blood banks ( aabb ) .
about 90 percent of the u.s. blood supply is collected by two blood suppliers , the american national red cross and independent blood banks affiliated with america's blood centers ( abc ) .
the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , reminded the nation of the critical importance of a safe and adequate supply of blood for transfusions .
however , because very few of the units donated immediately after september 11 were needed by the survivors , this experience has also raised concerns among blood suppliers and within the government about how best to manage and prepare the blood supply for emergencies .
a task force including members from federal agencies and blood suppliers has been formed to coordinate the response in future emergencies to the need for blood .
