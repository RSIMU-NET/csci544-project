u.s. - ghanaian relations are warm , as signaled by president barack obama's travel in 2009 to ghana , where he laid out his views on democratization and governance in africa in his single major africa - focused policy address .
it also participates in three presidential development initiatives , the global climate change ( gcc ) initiative , feed the future ( ftf ) , and the global health initiative ( ghi ) , and hosts u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) and u.s. drug enforcement agency ( dea ) regional offices and the usaid - administered west africa trade hub .
ghana , which last held national elections in early december 2012 ( see below ) , is considered a model for many of the outcomes that congressional and executive branch policy - makers have long sought to achieve in the region under diverse programs that have drawn substantial congressional engagement .
ghana is the only sub - saharan african country to which mr. obama has thus far traveled while serving as president .
then - president george w. bush also traveled there , in 2008 , and members of congress regularly visit ghana , which is widely seen as a key u.s. partner in west africa and as an african success story .
