our objectives in this study were to: ( 1 ) describe experts' views about the potential effects of services offshoring on the u.s. economy , workforce , national security , and consumer privacy ; ( 2 ) describe the types of policies that have been proposed in response to offshoring ; and ( 3 ) discuss areas where further research could advance the debate on offshoring .
we have identified four areas of concern about the potential impacts of offshoring: potential impacts on the average u.s. standard of living , including average wages ; employment and job displacement among american workers ; the distribution of income ; and national security and consumer privacy .
although “offshoring” has existed for decades in the manufacturing sector , recently concerns have been raised about the emergence of services offshoring .
offshoring generally refers to the practice , by either u.s. companies or government entities , of replacing goods or services previously produced domestically with goods and services produced abroad .
these areas include impacts of offshoring on various sectors of the u.s. economy , and especially the sectors that are emerging as new sources of comparative advantage ; impacts of offshoring on the workforce , such as numbers of workers displaced and their reemployment experiences ; impacts of offshoring on the u.s. income distribution , including trends in wage levels of jobs moving offshore ; and any increased security - related risks posed by offshoring and the extent to which these are mitigated by current practices and laws .
