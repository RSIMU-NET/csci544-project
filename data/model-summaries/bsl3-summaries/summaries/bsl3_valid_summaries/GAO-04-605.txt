dod generally concurred with our recommendations .
staffing constraints and security concerns posed further challenges .
our objectives were to ( 1 ) determine whether agencies had complied with applicable laws and regulations governing competition in awarding new contracts and issuing task orders under existing contracts , and ( 2 ) evaluate agencies' initial efforts in carrying out contract administration tasks .
agencies have made progress in addressing these issues , but there remains a backlog of contracts for which final agreement has not yet been reached .
overall , the 25 contracts or task orders consisted of the following: the largest contract awarded and the 4 largest task orders , by dollar value , issued to support cpa operations ; 9 contracts awarded and 1 task order issued by usaid , as well as 1 task order issued under an air force contract to provide logistical support for usaid - managed efforts ; 2 contracts awarded and 4 task orders issued by the army corps of engineers and the army field support command to help restore iraq's oil or electrical infrastructure ; 1 contract awarded and 1 task order issued by the army to train or equip the new iraqi army ; and 1 contract awarded by the department of state to support iraqi law enforcement efforts .
