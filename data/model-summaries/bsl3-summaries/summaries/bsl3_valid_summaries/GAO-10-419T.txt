specifically , my statement addresses ( 1 ) the extent to which epa incorporates information from biomonitoring studies into its assessments of chemicals , ( 2 ) steps that epa has taken to improve the usefulness of biomonitoring data , and ( 3 ) the extent to which epa has the authority under tsca to require chemical companies to develop and submit biomonitoring data to epa .
on the basis of results from recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle effects , the food and drug administration announced in january of this year that it and the national toxicology program at the national institutes of health ( nih ) have some concern about the potential effects of bpa on the brain , behavior , and prostate gland in fetuses , infants , and young children .
to help epa achieve this objective , the toxic substances control act ( tsca ) authorizes it to regulate the manufacture , processing , and distribution of chemicals .
this is a promising development .
biomonitoring , which measures chemicals in people's tissues or body fluids , has shown that the u.s. population is widely exposed to chemicals used in everyday products .
