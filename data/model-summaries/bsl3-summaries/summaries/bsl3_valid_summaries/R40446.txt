in weighing proposals that may emerge on electronic employment eligibility verification , policymakers may want to consider potential impacts on the key issues of unauthorized employment ; verification system accuracy , efficiency , and capacity ; discrimination ; employer compliance ; privacy ; and verification system usability and employer burden .
many years of debate about unauthorized immigration to the united states culminated in the enactment of the immigration reform and control act ( irca ) of 1986 .
to reduce the job magnet , irca amended the immigration and nationality act ( ina ) to add a new section 274a , which makes it unlawful to knowingly hire , recruit , or refer for a fee , or continue to employ , an unauthorized alien , and requires all employers to examine documents presented by new hires to verify identity and work authorization and to complete and retain employment eligibility verification ( i - 9 ) forms .
these latter provisions reflected a belief , widely held then and now , that most unauthorized aliens enter and remain in the united states in order to work .
ten years after the enactment of irca , congress attempted to strengthen the employment verification process as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 ( iirira ) .
