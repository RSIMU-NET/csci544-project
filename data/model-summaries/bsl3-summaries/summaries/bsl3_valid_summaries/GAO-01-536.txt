since its inception in 1978 , the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) science advisory board has reviewed key scientific studies and methodologies used by the agency in formulating rules to protect the environment and public health .
as agreed with your office , we determined whether the policies and procedures of the board are adequate to ensure that ( 1 ) its peer review panelists are independent and the panels are properly balanced and ( 2 ) the public is sufficiently informed about the points of view represented on the panels .
the board comprises more than 100 nongovernment experts and provides technical advice directly to the epa administrator primarily on the basis of its peer reviews â€” that is , critical evaluations by panels of independent experts .
specifically , the staff office's policies and procedures do not provide for determining at the time a panel is being developed and convened what financial conflict - of - interest requirements , if any , the panel is subject to ; routinely ensuring that potential panelists' financial disclosure forms contain sufficient information to evaluate potential conflicts of interest ; systematically requesting other information pertinent to assessing independence and overall balance of the panel , such as previous public positions that panelists have taken on the matter being reviewed , before the panel members are appointed ; and adequately training prospective panel members on the financial conflict - of - interest requirements and other issues that could raise questions about their impartiality .
