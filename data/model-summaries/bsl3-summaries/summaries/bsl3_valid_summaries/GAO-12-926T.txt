to improve coordination among regulators and help congress better assess the effectiveness of the voluntary smart grid standards process , we recommended that the chairman of ferc develop an approach to coordinate with state regulators and with groups that represent utilities subject to less ferc and state regulation to ( 1 ) periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and ( 2 ) develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards that are identified as a result of this evaluation .
ferc agreed with these recommendations .
in my testimony today , i will describe ( 1 ) cyber threats facing cyber - reliant critical infrastructures , which include the electricity grid , and ( 2 ) actions taken and challenges remaining to secure the grid against cyber attacks .
as you know , the electric power industry is increasingly incorporating information technology ( it ) systems and networks into its existing infrastructure ( e.g. , electricity networks including power lines and customer meters ) .
along with these anticipated benefits , however , cybersecurity and industry experts have expressed concern that , if not implemented securely , modernized electricity grid systems will be vulnerable to attacks that could result in widespread loss of electrical services essential to maintaining our national economy and security .
