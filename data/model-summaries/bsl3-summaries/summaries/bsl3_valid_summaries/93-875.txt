in imposing legislative discipline against their members , the senate and the house operate through their rulemaking powers , and the express provision for legislative discipline is specifically set out within the clause of the constitution establishing the rulemaking authority of each house of congress , at article i , section 5 , clause 2: each house may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behaviour , and , with the concurrence of two thirds , expel a member .
each house of the united states congress is expressly authorized within the constitution to "punish" its own members for misconduct , and the senate has exercised this authority in the past by imposing formal "censures," imposing restitution costs , and by expelling senators from the senate .
the underlying justification for legislative discipline has traditionally been to protect the integrity and dignity of the legislative institution and its proceedings , rather than merely to punish an individual ; and such internal legislative process is additional to any potential criminal or civil liability that a member might incur for any particular misconduct .
as part of the authority delegated to it , the senate select committee on ethics may issue , and has in the past issued , "a private or public letter of admonition" on the committee's own accord , without further senate action .
