health savings accounts ( hsas ) are one way people can pay for unreimbursed medical expenses ( deductibles , copayments , and services not covered by insurance ) on a tax - advantaged basis .
for example , whether an expenditure is a qualified medical expense is governed by section 213 ( d ) of the internal revenue code and irs guidance on it ; aside from exceptions pertaining to the purchase of health insurance , section 223 does not change these rules .
hsas can be established and funded by eligible individuals when they have a qualifying high - deductible health plan ( hdhp , i.e. , high - deductible insurance ) with a deductible in 2012 of at least $1,200 for self - only coverage and $2,400 for family coverage .
hsas were first authorized in the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act of 2003 ( mma , p.l .
flexible spending accounts ( fsas ) , which many employees can use , began spreading in the 1980s once the internal revenue service ( irs ) established clear guidelines .
however , other tax - advantaged accounts for health care expenses have existed for some time .
