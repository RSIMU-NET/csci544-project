on march 5 , 2007 , donor nations began to discuss a fifteenth replenishment of funds for the world bank's ( the bank ) concessional lending facility , the international development association ( ida ) .
if other donors are not in broad support of the u.s. aid agenda , the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the u.s. agency for international development ( usaid ) or another u.s. agency .
the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the world's poorest countries , and pledges to double the amount of aid to sub - saharan africa between 2004 and 2010 , primarily in the form of grant - based assistance .
this is the first replenishment since the 2005 g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in scotland , where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative ( mdri ) .
possible questions identified by the world bank that ida - 15 deputies may discuss during the ida - 15 negotiations include ( 1 ) ida's role in the global aid architecture ; ( 2 ) concerns regarding vertical or global aid funds ( aid programs that focus on specific policy issues rather than country - based assistance ) ; ( 3 ) ida's role at the regional level and the best division of labor between ida and the regional development banks ; ( 4 ) implications for ida of the 2005 paris declaration agenda on aid harmonization ; ( 5 ) ida's role be in building country institutional capacity to promote good governance , especially at the local level in countries that have weak or non - participatory central governments ; and ( 6 ) ida efforts to improve global aid harmonization .
