to determine whether the supply — that is , the number — of anesthesia practitioners was related to the differences between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services , we examined the correlation between the payment differences for the set of seven anesthesia services provided in the 41 medicare payment localities and the supply of anesthesia practitioners in the same 41 localities and determined whether they were statistically significant .
in 2005 , medicare — the federal program that helps pay for physician and other health care services furnished to the nation's elderly and disabled — paid over $1.4 billion for anesthesia services , which are services associated with the administration of anesthesia to patients undergoing surgical or other invasive procedures .
we found that average medicare payments for a set of seven anesthesia services provided by anesthesiologists alone were lower than average private payments in 41 medicare payment localities in 2004 , and ranged , on average , from 51 percent lower to 77 percent lower than private payments ( see fig .
in this report , we describe ( 1 ) the extent to which medicare payments for anesthesia services were lower than private payments across medicare payment localities in 2004 , ( 2 ) whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners across medicare payment localities in 2004 was related to the differences between medicare and private payments for anesthesia services or to the concentration of medicare beneficiaries in these localities , and ( 3 ) compensation levels for anesthesia practitioners compared to other health care practitioners in 2005 and trends in the number of anesthesiology residency positions and the number of graduates of nurse anesthesia programs .
