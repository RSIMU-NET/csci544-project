to improve hud's oversight of lenders participating in fha's programs , we recommend that the secretary of hud ( 1 ) determine the department's authority to hold fha - approved lenders accountable for poor - quality fha appraisals performed by the appraisers they select from fha's roster and ( 2 ) issue policy guidance that sets forth the specific circumstances under which and actions by which hud may exercise this authority .
numerous allegations and complaints about the poor quality of appraisals conducted for the purposes of mortgage insurance issued by the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) federal housing administration ( fha ) have raised concerns about the fha appraisal process .
as a result , it has not aggressively enforced this policy .
hud prohibited only 11 of these appraisers from conducting further fha appraisals .
hud has not resolved internal disagreements about its authority and policy to hold lenders accountable for poor - quality appraisals .
contrary to hud's policy , most appraisers within the philadelphia and denver hocs' jurisdictions who received two or more poor ratings in field reviews during the first three quarters of fiscal year 1998 were allowed to continue performing appraisals for fha .
