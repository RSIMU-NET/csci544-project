as you requested , we reviewed the current contract between the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the california institute of technology ( caltech ) for the operation of the jpl and analyzed whether modifications made to it and other management changes adequately address the concerns raised in our previous reports .
jpl is nasa's only federally funded research and development center ( ffrdc ) and is operated under contract by caltech .
over the last year , the nasa management office has increased its role in coordinating audit efforts by sponsoring meetings between the inspector general and dcaa staffs to reduce duplication and request that its needs be incorporated into their audit plans .
this is our third and final report on selected contract provisions and internal controls at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) .
jpl is nasa's field installation for solar system exploration and is a major operating division of caltech .
first , the fixed fee under nasa's previous contract with caltech was replaced with a fee structure that bases two - thirds of the fee award on nasa's assessment of jpl's performance .
also , new reporting and review procedures could provide control over selected costs comparable to that at commercial contractors .
