social security plays an important role in reducing poverty , not only among the aged but among children as well .
this report examines the effects of social security on child poverty .
children may be eligible for social security benefits when a parent who is a covered worker dies , becomes disabled , or retires .
in addition to receiving social security benefits in their own right , children may economically benefit from social security by living with other family members who receive benefits .
in order to address questions relating to the income and poverty status of families in which children live , and the impact of social security benefits on income and poverty status of families with children , other data sources must be used .
for children of disabled or retired workers , the child's benefit is generally equal to 50% of the parent's primary insurance amount ( pia ) before adjustments .
the estimates presented in this report are based on a crs analysis of u.s. census bureau survey of income and program participation ( sipp ) data in april 2013 .
unlike welfare programs , in which eligibility is determined on the basis of limited income , social security is a work - related entitlement , in which benefits are determined on the basis of workers' employment and earnings history , without respect to current income .
