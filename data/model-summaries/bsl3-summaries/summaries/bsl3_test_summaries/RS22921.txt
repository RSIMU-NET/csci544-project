economic conditions in china are of considerable concern to u.s. policymakers , given the potential impact of china's economy on the global and u.s. economy .
the recent large inflow of financial capital into china , commonly referred to as "hot money," has led some economists to warn that such flows may have a destabilizing effect on china's economy .
analysts point to two key factors: ( 1 ) the relative interest rates in china and the united states ; and ( 2 ) expectations of the future appreciation in the value of china's currency , the renminbi ( rmb ) .
in addition , china might reduce its purchases of u.s. treasury securities ( used to help fund the federal deficit ) , which could push up u.s. interest rates .
there is no formal definition of "hot money," but the term is most commonly used in financial markets to refer to the flow of funds ( or capital ) from one country to another in order to earn a short - term profit on interest rate differences and / or anticipated exchange rate shifts .
one common way of approximating the flow of "hot money" is to subtract a nation's trade surplus ( or deficit ) and its net flow of foreign direct investment ( fdi ) from the change in the nation's foreign reserves .
