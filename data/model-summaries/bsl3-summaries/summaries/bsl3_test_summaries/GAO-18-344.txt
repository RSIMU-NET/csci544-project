this report assesses , for selected major acquisition programs , the extent that ( 1 ) dhs's budget management and reporting affects operations and oversight ; and ( 2 ) o&s life - cycle cost estimates ( lcces ) are comprehensive and accurate , as well as regularly updated .
operations and support ( o&s ) costs make up the majority — sometimes over 70 percent — of an acquisition program's total lifetime costs .
 ( recommendation 3 ) .
however , if information on such costs is vague or inconsistent , congress's ability to conduct oversight would be limited , which in turn can affect its funding decisions for major acquisition programs .
we found in april 2015 that dhs's funding plans for major acquisition programs did not reflect all of the estimated costs for certain programs , particularly for o&s , resulting in potential operational shortfalls .
if programs experience o&s funding shortfalls , they may fall short of operational goals or not be able to address maintenance needs .
