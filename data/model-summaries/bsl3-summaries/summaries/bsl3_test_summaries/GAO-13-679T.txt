this testimony provides our preliminary observations from our ongoing work , being performed at the request of this committee and other members of the senate , regarding: ( 1 ) fra's framework for safety oversight , ( 2 ) existing and emerging challenges to rail safety , and ( 3 ) ptc implementation .
we appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing to discuss the federal railroad administration's ( fra ) rail safety oversight activities .
my statement will discuss our ongoing reviews of fra's rail safety oversight and the implementation of positive train control , a communications - based system designed to prevent train accidents caused by human factors .
our preliminary assessments of fra's rail safety framework and the quantitative tools fra uses to implement that framework are based on our reviews of fra documentation and interviews with fra headquarters and regional officials .
the rail network is one of america's safest modes of transportation , although several recent rail accidents , including the metro - north commuter rail accident in bridgeport , connecticut , the collision of bnsf and up trains in chaffee , missouri , and the collision of a csx train and a truck in rosedale , maryland , have reinforced the need for constant effort from both the private and public sectors to ensure that rail transportation remains safe for passengers , the public , and railroad employees .
