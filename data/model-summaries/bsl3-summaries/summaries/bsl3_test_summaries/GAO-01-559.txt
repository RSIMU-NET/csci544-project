section 1051 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 ( public law 106-398 ) requires that we review the working capital fund activities of the department of defense ( dod ) to ( 1 ) identify any potential changes in current management processes or policies that , if made , would result in a more efficient operation and ( 2 ) evaluate various aspects of the dod policy that allow defense working capital fund activities to carry over a 3-month level of work from one fiscal year to the next .
specifically , our objectives were to review ( 1 ) the basis for dod's 3-month carryover policy , ( 2 ) the military services' implementation of this policy , ( 3 ) the military services' budgeted versus reported actual carryover amounts and whether there were any instances when the reported year - end carryover exceeded the 3-month policy , and ( 4 ) the potential financial and operational impact of reducing the amount of permitted carryover .
this report is the first in a series of reports that responds to this requirement and addresses the working capital fund fiscal year - end workload funding issue generally referred to as “carryover.” according to dod's fiscal year 2001 budget estimates , working capital fund industrial activities will have about $7 billion of funded work that will be carried over from fiscal year 2001 into fiscal year 2002 .
