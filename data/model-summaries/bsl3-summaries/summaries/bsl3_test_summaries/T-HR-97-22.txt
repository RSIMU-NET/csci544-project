landmark legislation passed by the congress in the 1990s has established broad management reforms , which , with successful implementation , will help resolve high - risk problems and provide greater accountability in many government programs and operations: the expanded chief financial officers ( cfo ) act of 1990 requires agencies to prepare financial statements that can pass the test of an independent audit and provide decisionmakers reliable financial information .
our high - risk initiative has monitored five areas that affect accountability and cost - effective management of department of defense ( dod ) programs: financial management , contract management , inventory management , weapon systems acquisition , and the corporate information management ( cim ) initiative .
the debt collection improvement act of 1996 strengthens federal agencies' debt collection practices and authorities .
the congress has also acted to address several problems affecting these high - risk areas through oversight hearings and specific legislative initiatives .
such actions have established a solid foundation to help ensure greater progress , but much remains to be done to fully implement the corrective actions needed to remove the high - risk designation from these areas .
continued oversight by the congress , such as this hearing by the subcommittee , will add essential impetus to ensuring progress as well .
