my testimony today is based on work completed to date , and i will identify ( 1 ) key factors and challenges that contributed to brac 2005 implementation and results and ( 2 ) the most - recent estimated costs and savings attributable to brac 2005 .
thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the department of defense's ( dod ) latest round of base realignments and closures ( brac ) , commonly referred to as brac 2005 .
the brac process is designed to overcome obstacles to eliminating unneeded infrastructure and to help dod match needed infrastructure to the force structure and to support military missions .
gao has two long - standing roles in the brac process .
second , once the recommendations became binding , our role has been to review dod's efforts to implement the recommendations , just as we routinely review the efficiency and effectiveness of many other congressionally mandated or authorized programs across the government .
first , as requested by congressional committees for the 1988 brac round and mandated by law since 1990 , we have served as an independent and objective observer of the brac process and have assessed and reported on dod's decision - making processes leading up to proposed realignment and closure recommendations .
