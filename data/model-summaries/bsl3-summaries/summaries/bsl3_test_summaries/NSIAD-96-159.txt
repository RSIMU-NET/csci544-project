to improve the nation's surface transportation system over a 6-year period ending in fiscal year 1997 , the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act ( [istea] , public law 102-240 , dec. 18 , 1991 ) authorized $155 billion .
we reviewed ( 1 ) the department of transportation's ( dot ) efforts to track how states use istea funds for facilitating intermodal transportation and the nature and extent of istea funds used by states for intermodal freight projects , ( 2 ) how some local and regional areas that handle a large volume of freight have considered intermodal freight transportation issues as part of their planning process , and ( 3 ) what kind of impediments some areas face in improving intermodal freight transportation .
although istea primarily authorized highway construction and improvements , it also emphasized how intermodal connections can enhance the nation's transportation infrastructure .
these include operational problems at intermodal facilities ( compatibility among freight tracking systems ) ; regulatory and institutional barriers ( the lack of standardized transportation regulations ) ; and financial constraints ( inadequate funding for intermodal improvements ) .
dot officials gave us the following reasons why they have not developed the data base: ( 1 ) dot has a limited role in managing how funds are allocated because states are given primary responsibility for allocating funds according to broad program categories ; ( 2 ) the term “intermodal” is subject to interpretation , and projects may not be identified consistently among states ; and ( 3 ) intermodal projects may be financed from multiple sources , including federal , state , and local funds , and it may be difficult to identify istea funds used for this purpose .
