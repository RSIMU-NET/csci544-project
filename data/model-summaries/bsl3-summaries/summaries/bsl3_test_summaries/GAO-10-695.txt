our objective was to identify previously reported weaknesses that impair dod's ability to provide reliable cost information for military equipment acquired through mdaps and determine what actions dod has taken to address them .
since 2003 , dod's portfolio of mdaps has increased steadily from 77 to 98 and the cumulative estimated investment in these programs has grown from approximately $1.2 trillion to $1.7 trillion .
our review of prior reports , studies , and analyses to identify weaknesses in dod's operations identified the following seven categories of weaknesses that impaired the department's ability to account for the cost of military equipment: ( 1 ) support for the existence , completeness , and cost of recorded assets is needed ; ( 2 ) more detail is needed in dod contracts to allocate costs to contract deliverables ; ( 3 ) additional guidance is needed to help ensure consistency for asset accounting ; ( 4 ) monitoring is needed to help ensure compliance with department policies ; ( 5 ) departmentwide cost accounting requirements need to be defined ; ( 6 ) departmentwide cost accounting capabilities need to be developed ; and ( 7 ) systems integration is needed .
