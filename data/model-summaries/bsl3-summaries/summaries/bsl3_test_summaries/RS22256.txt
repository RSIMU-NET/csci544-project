the origins of affirmative action law may be traced to the early 1960s as first the warren , and then the burger , court grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nation's public schools .
judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty , cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause , to desegregate formerly dual - school systems and to eliminate the last vestiges of state - enforced segregation .
following the court's lead , congress and the executive approved a panoply of laws and regulations authorizing , either directly or by judicial or administrative interpretation , race - conscious strategies to promote minority opportunity in jobs , education , and governmental contracting .
the basic statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education derives from the civil rights act of 1964 .
these holdings ushered in a two - decade era of massive desegregation — first in the south , and later the urban north — marked by federal desegregation orders frequently requiring drastic reconfiguration of school attendance patterns along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes .
official approval of affirmative action remedies was further codified by federal regulations construing the 1964 act's title vi , which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities , including public or private educational institutions .
