specifically , you wanted us to determine ( 1 ) if fpi has data , either from its management information systems or other sources , to support overall conclusions about how federal customers who buy and use its products and services view their timeliness , price , and quality ; and ( 2 ) whether agencies that are among the largest buyers of fpi products and services monitor fpi's performance the same way they do commercial vendors in terms of timeliness , price , and quality .
this report responds to your july 8 , 1997 , request for information on whether federal prison industries ( fpi ) collects and maintains data that would enable it to make reliable , generalizable statements about the satisfaction of its federal agency customers with respect to the quality , cost , and timely delivery of fpi's products .
to meet these objectives , we interviewed fpi officials and gathered information on their customer satisfaction efforts at fpi in washington , d.c. we also met with officials at fpi's customer service center in lexington , ky and the office of federal procurement policy ( ofpp ) ; and spoke with officials at five of fpi's major customer agencies â€” the defense logistics agency ( dla ) ; the general services administration's ( gsa ) federal supply service ( fss ) in arlington , va , and fort worth , tx ; the department of the army's office of the assistant secretary of the army for research , development , and acquisition in falls church , va ; the social security administration ( ssa ) in baltimore , md ; and the united states postal service ( the postal service ) in washington , d.c .
