my statement focuses on three topics: ( 1 ) the smithsonian's real property management efforts , including the condition of the smithsonian's facilities , costs of facilities' projects , and efforts to improve real property security and portfolio management ; ( 2 ) the extent to which the smithsonian has developed and implemented strategies to fund its revitalization , construction , and maintenance projects as we recommended in 2005 ; and ( 3 ) some preliminary results of our ongoing work on governance changes being made by the smithsonian's board of regents to address recent governance problems .
the smithsonian has been referred to as america's museum , as its museums hold and provide access to irreplaceable national collections in american and natural history , art , and other areas .
in april 2005 , we reported that the smithsonian's current funding would not be sufficient to cover its estimated $2.3 billion in facilities projects through 2013 and recommended that the smithsonian board of regents develop and implement a funding plan to address the smithsonian's facilities projects .
in response to concerns about the smithsonian's governance raised by the former secretary's compensation and expenses , as well as other issues , two studies were conducted , one by the board of regents' governance committee and the other by an independent review committee ( irc ) created at the request of the board of regents .
