medicaid is a means - tested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as long - term services and supports .
each state designs and administers its own version of medicaid under broad federal rules , and medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and the states .
participation in medicaid is voluntary for states , though all states , the district of columbia , and five territories choose to participate .
the federal government's share of a state's expenditures for most medicaid services is called the federal medical assistance percentage ( fmap ) .
states incur medicaid costs by making payments to service providers ( e.g. , for beneficiaries' doctor visits ) and performing administrative activities ( e.g. , making eligibility determinations ) , and the federal government reimburses states for a share of these costs .
the report explains how states use provider taxes to help finance medicaid and provides information regarding the extent to which states currently use such taxes .
states also use provider tax revenue to fund other medicaid or non - medicaid purposes .
in state fiscal year ( sfy ) 2014 , states reported that about 74% of the state share of medicaid costs was financed by state general funds ( most of which are raised from personal income , sales , and corporate income taxes ) .
