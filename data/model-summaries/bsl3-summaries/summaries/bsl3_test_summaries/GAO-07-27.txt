our objectives were to ( 1 ) assess irs's 2006 filing season performance in processing paper and electronically filed tax returns and providing telephone , web site , and face - to - face assistance relative to 2006 goals and prior years' performance ; ( 2 ) identify potential cost savings or other improvements ; and ( 3 ) report on the status of irs's taxpayer assistance blueprint ( tab ) , which is intended to be the long - term strategy for cost effectively delivering services that meet taxpayer needs .
another challenge is continuing progress on the business systems modernization ( bsm ) program , irs's ongoing effort to replace its aged computer systems .
our assessment is based on the reported results and analysis of key irs performance measures , observations of irs's operations , interviews with irs officials , information from representatives of the paid tax preparer community , and analyses by the treasury inspector general for tax administration ( tigta ) .
in fiscal year 2006 , the internal revenue service ( irs ) spent approximately $4.1 billion or 38 percent of its $10.8 billion budget on processing income tax returns and providing taxpayer assistance , with most of this occurring during the annual tax filing season .
