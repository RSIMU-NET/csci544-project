the nation's more than 17,000 school districts are responsible for maintaining the safety and security of approximately 49 million public school students .
events such as the recent shootings by armed intruders in schools across the nation , natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 , the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and potential pandemics have heightened awareness of the need for school districts to be prepared to address a range of emergencies within and outside of school buildings .
my testimony today will focus on ( 1 ) the role of the federal and state governments in establishing requirements and providing resources to school districts for emergency management planning , ( 2 ) what school districts have done to plan and prepare for emergencies , and , briefly , ( 3 ) the challenges school districts have experienced in planning for emergencies and communicating and coordinating with first responders , parents , and students .
when discussing the federal government , i am primarily referring to the three agencies included in our report â€” the departments of homeland security ( dhs ) , education ( education ) , and health and human services ( hhs ) .
