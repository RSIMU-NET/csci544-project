over the past decade , we and others have raised concerns about the adequacy of security at nuclear weapons facilities within the department of energy ( doe ) and the national nuclear security administration ( nnsa ) â€” a separately organized agency within doe .
our followup report will focus on the extent to which physical security has improved ; the effectiveness of the process for establishing safeguards and security requirements following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks ; and the remaining vulnerabilities .
in order to strengthen the safeguards and security program of the nuclear weapons complex , we recommend that the nnsa administrator and secretary of energy formalize the roles and responsibilities of site offices and headquarters for conducting oversight ; ensure that sites are performing oversight using a survey approach that provides an integrated comprehensive view of security conditions and is consistent with doe orders ; ensure that contractors' corrective action plans are prepared and documented consistently and are based on qualitative root - cause , risk - assessment , and cost - benefit analyses , and that appropriate incentives are used to help motivate contractors toward effectively addressing findings ; and develop and implement a plan to ensure that nnsa allocates safeguards and security staff so that it provides effective safeguards and security oversight over the long term .
