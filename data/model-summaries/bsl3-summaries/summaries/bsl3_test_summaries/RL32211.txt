the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , as approved and implemented bycongress , entered into force on january 1 , 1994 .
 ( 78 ) since mexico is not currently a party to the wto agp , its procurement obligations with the unitedstates are governed solely by nafta .
 ( 79 ) in addition to exceptions in individual schedules , nafta procurement obligations , likethose of the agp , are subject to national security and general exceptions .
procurement obligations between the united states andcanada had been , prior to nafta , contained in the u.s. - canada free trade agreement , whose$25,000 threshold for federal goods contracts has been carried forward into the naftaagreement .
in addition to the wto and nafta , many of the other free trade agreements ( ftas ) thatthe united states has in effect contain provisions with respect to government procurement .
 ( 77 ) chapter 10 of nafta contains extensive procurementobligations , which generally follow and build upon provisions contained in the 1979 gattprocurement code .
for example , the u.s. - - israel fta contains provisions for the waiver of any buy national provisionsfor contracts with a value greater than $50,000 .
