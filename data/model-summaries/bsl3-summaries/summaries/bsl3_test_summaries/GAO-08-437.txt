following the signing of the bunning - bereuter - blumenauer flood insurance reform act of 2004 , which reauthorized the national flood insurance program ( nfip ) through september 30 , 2008 , the united states experienced back - to - back catastrophic hurricane seasons and experienced nearly $20 billion in flood - insurance losses .
because nfip premium rates have been set to cover losses in an average year ( that is , based on “average historical losses” ) , the program has been unable to set aside sufficient funds to meet future expected losses .
according to the federal emergency management agency ( fema ) of the department of homeland security ( dhs ) , which administers nfip , claims from hurricane katrina alone have totaled in excess of $16.3 billion , as of october 2007 .
ensure implementation of written guidance for all nfip - related contracts on how to consistently handle the failure of a contractor to meet standards in performance areas and establish written policies and procedures about the coordination between fema officials and offices ( including the cotr , the program management office , and the contracting officer ) when addressing contractor deficiencies , including determining whether and under what circumstances to issue discrepancy reports , and ensuring that financial disincentives are appropriately and consistently applied .
