the number of children coming to the united states who are not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian is raising a host of policy questions .
rather , the first part of this report includes a discussion of three federal elementary and secondary education programs administered by the u.s. department of education ( ed ) : ( 1 ) title i - a grants to local educational agencies ( leas ) authorized by the elementary and secondary education act ( esea ) , ( 2 ) english language acquisition grants ( title iii - a ) authorized by the esea , and ( 3 ) part b grants to states authorized by the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) with an emphasis on how these programs could currently serve unaccompanied alien children or possibly be modified to increase support for these children .
upon arrival in the united states , unaccompanied alien children generally are initially served through programs operated by the department of health and human services' ( hhs's ) office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) .
under federal law , states and leas are required to provide all children with equal access to a public elementary and secondary education , regardless of their immigration status .
