the internal revenue service ( irs ) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with the tax laws governing this voluntary system .
there are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance , which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner ; payment compliance , which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner ; and reporting compliance , which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns .
the six programs and associated agencies were the ( 1 ) health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) medicare program ; ( 2 ) department of agriculture's food stamp program ; ( 3 ) social security administration's ( ssa ) old age , survivors , and disability insurance ( oasdi ) program ; ( 4 ) ssa's supplemental security income ( ssi ) program ; ( 5 ) u.s. customs service's compliance measurement program ( cmp ) ; and ( 6 ) immigration and naturalization service's ( ins ) inspections' traveler examinations ( intex ) pilot program .
in spite of irs' efforts to enforce compliance , each year billions of dollars in taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid , which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs , higher tax rates , or both .
