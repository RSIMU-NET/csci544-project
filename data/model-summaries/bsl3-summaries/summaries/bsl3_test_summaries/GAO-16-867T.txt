i will address 1 ) the organizational structure of va's procurement function , 2 ) va procurement policies , and 3 ) the extent to which opportunities exist to improve va's key procurement functions and to save money .
the department of veterans affairs ( va ) spent about $20 billion on goods and services in fiscal year 2015 .
the wide range of goods and services that va procures — including construction , information technology , medical supplies , and many other categories — is essential to meeting its mission to provide health care , pensions , and other benefits to the nation's military veterans .
in 2015 , gao added va health care to our high risk list because of issues including ambiguous policies , inconsistent processes , and inadequate oversight and accountability .
prior assessments of va management , both internal and external , have found shortcomings in va procurement .
to assess opportunities to improve va's key procurement functions and to save money , we obtained and analyzed information regarding va's medical - surgical prime vendor program and interviewed officials with roles in management , contracting , and operations for the program .
