the increasing popularity of e - mail , instant messaging , and wireless technology , to name a few , poses a long - term threat to the postal service's core business â€” first - class mail ( primarily letters ) and standard mail ( primarily advertising ) .
to assist congressional efforts to enact fundamental postal reform , you asked us to determine ( 1 ) the extent to which the postal service has been successful in implementing and realizing savings from its supply chain management initiatives and ( 2 ) whether these initiatives have had an effect on small businesses .
the united states postal service faces formidable financial , operational , and human capital challenges because of unfunded liabilities , stagnant revenues , inefficient operations , and a business model that is unsustainable .
part of its reform strategy is to find more efficient ways to procure goods and services .
while the postal service achieved notable success in fiscal year 2003 , this respite is likely to be short - lived because first - class mail continues to decline , key costs are rising , and productivity gains are likely to slow .
in the face of these challenges , the postal service has been under pressure to cut costs while improving overall performance .
