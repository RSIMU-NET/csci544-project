in international trade , the expression "most - favored - nation," usually abbreviated "mfn,"status ( or treatment ) has a specific meaning quite different from what it appears to mean .
defined in a more specific detail in article i of thegeneral agreements on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) 1994 , an integral part of the world tradeorganization agreement , the term denotes the reciprocal extension of any concessions , privileges,or immunities granted , or yet to be granted , by a country in a trade agreement ( or in some other way ) to one country which is , or would be , the "most favored" in this respect to all countries to which itaccords mfn treatment .
the mfn term , however , has remained universally in use in international trade relations,including trade agreements to which the united states is party .
the understandable misinterpretation of the most - favored - nation term in its literal meaning,particularly in the context of u.s. trade policy of the mid - 1990s toward china , gave rise tolegislation ( 1 ) to replace theoften misleading term "most - favored - nation" treatment in the seven instances in the existing and inall future u.s. legislation with the term "normal trade relations" ( ntr ) or another appropriateexpression .
