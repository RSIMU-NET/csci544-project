american consumers increasingly rely on credit and debit cards to pay for goods and services .
between 1997 and 2011 , card payments rose from accounting for 23% of payments to 48% .
in 2012 , credit card losses in the united states totaled $5.33 billion , an increase of 14.5% from 2011 .
in 2012 , mastercard and visa — also called "payment brands" — set october 1 , 2015 , as the date by which u.s. card issuers — banks and credit unions — would need to have replaced existing credit and debit magnetic stripe cards with chip cards , and for merchants to begin accepting them .
if the merchant has a chip point - of - sale ( pos ) terminal , but the bank has not issued a chip card to the customer , the bank will be liable .
now that october 1 , 2015 , has passed , exploring and understanding the ramifications of the transition — or the failure to transition — is likely to become increasingly important for congress , especially if additional major breaches occur .
in 2011 , consumers made 49 billion debit transactions totaling $1.8 trillion and 26 billion credit transactions totaling $2.1 trillion .
