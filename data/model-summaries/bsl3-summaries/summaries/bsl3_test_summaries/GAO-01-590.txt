the department of housing and urban development ( hud ) , through its federal housing administration ( fha ) , annually insures billions of dollars in home mortgage loans made by private lenders .
our objectives were to examine ( 1 ) the deployment of staff at the department of housing and urban development's ( hud ) homeownership centers , ( 2 ) the training provided to center staff , and ( 3 ) the centers' monitoring of their contractors .
to carry out its mission , fha relies on private lenders to determine borrowers' creditworthiness and to make and fund loans .
finally , fha relies on contractors to help assess lenders' compliance with its requirements , monitor the performance of appraisers , and manage and sell the properties it acquires through foreclosure .
compared with private mortgage insurers , fha is more likely to insure loans for low - income and minority borrowers .
these problems increased hud's insurance risk and limited its ability to recoup losses upon foreclosure .
although hud has substantially streamlined fha's single - family mortgage insurance programs , human capital issues remain a concern .
in 1997 , hud issued its 2020 management reform plan , which provided for downsizing and reforming the department , including its single - family mortgage insurance program .
