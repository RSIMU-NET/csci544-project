on june 30 , 1999 , u.s. and canadian officials signed a new comprehensive agreement to resolve long - standing disputes and to ensure implementation of the conservation and harvest - sharing principles of the 1985 pacific salmon treaty ( pst ) .
after years of failed negotiations , a combination of resource management studies , joint - fishery restrictions to protect wild salmon stocks , and the involvement of high - level government negotiators helped ease tensions between the united states and canada over the shared harvest of pacific salmon .
the 1999 agreement ( 1 ) established abundance - based fishing regimes for the pacific salmon fisheries under the jurisdiction of the pst ; ( 2 ) created two bilaterally managed regional restoration and enhancement endowment funds to promote cooperation , improve fishery management , and aid stock and habitat enhancement efforts ; and ( 3 ) included provisions to enhance bilateral cooperation , improve the scientific basis for salmon management , and apply institutional changes to the pacific salmon commission ( psc ) .
moreover , the two nations recognized that failure to reach a long - term conservation and harvest - sharing agreement was in no one's best interest .
