the 1990s have been a time of rapid and sweeping change at the small business administration ( sba ) .
in response to the clinton administration's initiative to reinvent the federal government , sba underwent a major reorganization and downsizing .
from august 1993 to march 1997 , sba's workforce was cut by about 15 percent .
sba participates in interagency details of employees but did not have adequate procedures to ( 1 ) accurately identify when it should bill agencies for the reimbursable details of sba employees and ( 2 ) monitor the actual length of details .
these authorizations and vouchers were for fiscal year 1997 and part of fiscal year 1998 .
regional offices were greatly affected by reorganization and downsizing .
on the basis of available evidence , sba appeared to have properly followed federal regulations in hiring all six individuals .
federal regulations govern the salary - setting process for new appointees .
sba has recognized that its hr staff need further guidance on pay setting and recruitment bonuses and has drafted a new set of procedures to provide that guidance .
sba provided us the names of ( 1 ) sba field personnel and the offices to which they were assigned , both before and after sba's reorganization and downsizing ; ( 2 ) district directors who were appointed between january 1 , 1993 , and december 31 , 1998 ; ( 3 ) political and ramspeck act appointees who were appointed between october 1 , 1991 , and september 30 , 1998 ; and ( 4 ) employees detailed from sba to other federal agencies during the period october 1 , 1991 , through september 30 , 1998 .
