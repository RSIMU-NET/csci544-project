in this third report , we ( 1 ) evaluate program progress toward cost , schedule , and performance goals ; ( 2 ) identify program development challenges , if any , and steps to address these challenges ; and ( 3 ) assess progress in manufacturing aircraft .
these activities include ( 1 ) identifying key system characteristics and critical manufacturing processes ; ( 2 ) establishing a reliability growth plan and goals ; ( 3 ) conducting failure modes and effects analysis ; ( 4 ) conducting reliability growth testing ; and ( 5 ) determining whether processes are in control and capable .
specifically , we examined ( 1 ) progress toward cost , schedule , and performance goals ; ( 2 ) development challenges , if any , and steps to address them ; and ( 3 ) progress in manufacturing the aircraft .
to conduct work for our current review , we analyzed financial management documents ; program budgets ; risk assessments ; technical performance indicators ; flight test and manufacturing plans ; and software development plan and metrics .
the kc - 46 tanker modernization program , valued at $51 billion , is the air force's highest acquisition priority .
