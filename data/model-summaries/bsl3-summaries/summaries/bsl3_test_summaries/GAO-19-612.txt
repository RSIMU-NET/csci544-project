the indian health service ( ihs ) is responsible for providing health care for over two million american indians and alaska natives ( ai / an ) who are members or descendants of federally recognized tribes .
in the years since the patient protection and affordable care act ( ppaca ) authorized states to expand access to medicaid and offer health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , the percent of american indian and alaska native ( ai / an ) in the general population with health insurance has increased .
these facilities may also bill public programs such as medicaid ( the federal - state health insurance program for certain low - income individuals ) , medicare ( the federal health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over , and certain others ) , and the department of veterans affairs ( which provides health care services for veterans ) , as well as private insurance , for care provided to patients .
in addition , officials from two ihs area offices noted that prc has been able to pay for services such as patients' long - awaited knee and hip replacements , which have enabled patients to return to normal activities of life and reduce their need for pain management .
