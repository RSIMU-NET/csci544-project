this report ( 1 ) discusses the progress made and some of the problems still facing the department in real property management and ( 2 ) contains recommendations to you to strengthen the department's management .
we based that decision on a number of factors , including the actions taken by the state department and its office of foreign buildings operations ( fbo ) to strengthen real property programs .
management weaknesses also directly contributed to construction delays and cost overruns , oversized and unauthorized housing , poor decisions , and questionable expenditures .
fbo's responsibilities include ( 1 ) overseeing the acquisition , design , construction , sales , operations , and maintenance of properties and ( 2 ) establishing policies and procedures for overseas posts to follow in managing real property programs .
in february 1995 , we removed overseas real property management from our list of federal programs most vulnerable to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
the report is based on our work at fbo headquarters and the embassies in nassau , the bahamas ; london , england ; vienna , austria ; santo domingo , dominican republic ; port moresby , papua new guinea ; kuala lumpur , malaysia ; and singapore , singapore .
