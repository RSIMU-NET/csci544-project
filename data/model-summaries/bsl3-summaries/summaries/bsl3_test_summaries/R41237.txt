the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 ( and subsequent attempts on u.s. soil ) , the significant domestic population of unauthorized aliens , and recent concerns over drug - trafficking - related violence in mexico and the potential for spillover into the united states have all continued to fuel this debate .
securing the borders of the united states has long been a contentious political issue .
in the past decade , with the reorganization of homeland security and the national security focus on terrorism , several congresses , administrations , and the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states ( commonly known as the 9 / 11 commission ) have put forth proposals for how to secure the u.s. border .
although the united states is often described as "a country of immigrants" and a "melting pot," highlighting the relative openness of its borders , the borders have also served as a line of protection against external security threats .
since at least the 1980s , the border has played a central role in the debate over how to provide domestic security in the united states .
market competitiveness and demands for efficiency create a push for more open borders to unencumber the flows of capital and labor .
