a growing backlog of cases and longer processing times have prompted concern on the part of taxpayers , congress , and other stakeholders about the management of the internal revenue service's ( irs ) offer in compromise ( oic ) program .
in recent years , particularly since the enactment of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 ( restructuring act ) , the demand for offers has increased significantly .
specifically , you asked us to ( 1 ) determine why the inventory of cases and case processing times have continued to grow ; ( 2 ) assess whether irs's current initiatives for managing the oic program will reduce inventory and processing times ; and ( 3 ) determine whether irs is fulfilling the requirements of the restructuring act in terms of independently reviewing all proposed rejections of offers , considering the facts and circumstances of each case , and not rejecting offers from low - income taxpayers solely on the basis of the amount offered .
irs now takes about 10 months , on average , to make an offer determination .
an offer in compromise is an agreement between a taxpayer and the irs to settle or “compromise” the taxpayer's tax liability for less than the full amount owed .
