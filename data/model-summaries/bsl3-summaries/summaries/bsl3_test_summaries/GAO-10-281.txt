finally , if these recommendations are to lead to patient safety improvements , providers must recognize their value and take actions to implement them .
because the agency for healthcare research and quality's ( ahrq ) efforts to list patient safety organizations and implement the network of patient safety databases are relatively new but some other patient safety reporting systems are already established , we identified examples of how selected established patient safety reporting systems encourage reporting of patient safety event information by providers and facilitate the development of improvements in patient safety .
in addition , because participation — including submission of data on patient safety events — by psos and providers is voluntary , their actions may also contribute to the law's effectiveness in accomplishing its purpose .
research has shown that serious injuries or deaths resulting from medical care are both common and often preventable .
in this report , we describe the progress ahrq has made in ( 1 ) listing psos , including pso efforts to serve providers , and ( 2 ) implementing the npsd .
furthermore , we did not speak directly with health care providers regarding their use , or potential use , of psos .
