the u.s. constitution establishes a two - step process for the house and senate to remove federal officialsâincluding the president , vice president , judges , and other civil officersâfor "treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors. .
under the constitution , the house alone has the power to formally chargeâthat is , impeachâa federal official .
the senate has voted to remove eight of these officials , and all of them were federal judges .
two - thirds of senators voting must agree to convict and remove an official from office .
the house could also , however , choose to consider the resolution under any of its other regular processes , including suspension of the rules ( requiring a two - thirds vote for passage ) , a rule from the rules committee ( requiring only a majority vote ) , or unanimous consent .
a house majority can accomplish this by adopting articles of impeachment , which are effectively written accusations ( similar to an indictment in ordinary criminal proceedings ) .
the house has used this process mostly to impeach federal judges , although the house has also impeached two presidents and one cabinet official .
