authorization for such activities is typically obtained via a court order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court ( fisc ) , a specialized court created to act as a neutral judicial decisionmaker in the context of fisa .
the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) provides a statutory framework by which government agencies may , when gathering foreign intelligence for an investigation , obtain authorization to conduct electronic surveillance or physical searches , utilize pen registers and trap and trace devices , or access specified business records and other tangible things .
perhaps in response to such concerns , congress established sunset provisions which apply to three of the most controversial amendments to fisa: section 6001 ( a ) of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act ( irtpa ) , also known as the "lone wolf" provision , which simplifies the evidentiary showing needed to obtain a fisa court order to target non - u.s. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor , specifically by authorizing such orders in the absence of a proven link between a targeted individual and a foreign power ; section 206 of the usa patriot act , which permits multipoint , or "roving," wiretaps ( i.e. , wiretaps which may follow a target even when he or she changes phones ) by adding flexibility to the manner in which the subject of a fisa court order is specified ; and section 215 of the usa patriot act , which authorizes orders compelling a person to produce "any tangible thing" that is "relevant" to an authorized foreign intelligence , international terrorism , or counter - espionage investigation .
