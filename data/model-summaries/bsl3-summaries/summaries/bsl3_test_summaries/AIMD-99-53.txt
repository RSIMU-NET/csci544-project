this plan focuses on correcting many of the long - standing problems with indian trust operations , which include inadequate accounting and information management systems ; backlogs in asset appraisals , ownership determination , and record keeping ; and poor internal controls .
this report responds to your request that we evaluate the department of interior's high - level implementation plan ( high level plan ) for improving its management of the indian trust funds and resources under its control .
management of the indian trust funds and assets has long been characterized by inadequate accounting and information systems ; untrained and inexperienced staff ; backlogs in appraisals , ownership determinations , and recordkeeping ; the lack of a master lease file and an accounts receivable system ; inadequate written policies and procedures ; and poor internal controls .
as discussed with your office , we agreed to assess whether interior has reasonable assurance that ( 1 ) the high level plan provides an effective solution for addressing these long - standing problems , and ( 2 ) its acquisition of a new asset and land records management service will cost effectively satisfy trust management needs .
