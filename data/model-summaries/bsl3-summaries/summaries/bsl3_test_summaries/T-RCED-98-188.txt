our report discussed three main issues: ( 1 ) the practice of using individual inspectors in repair station inspections ; ( 2 ) the condition of inspection documentation ; and ( 3 ) current faa actions to improve the inspection process .
we appreciate the opportunity to testify on the federal aviation administration's ( faa ) oversight of repair stations that maintain and repair aircraft and aircraft components .
in recent years , faa's oversight of repair stations has become a matter of concern , in part because the work performed by repair stations has been identified as a factor in several aircraft accidents .
since the may 1996 crash of a valujet dc - 9 in the florida everglades , faa has announced new initiatives to upgrade the oversight of repair stations .
we also found that while faa typically relies on individual inspectors , the use of teams of inspectors , particularly at large or complex repair stations , may be more effective at identifying problems and are more liable to uncover systemic and long - standing deficiencies .
faa is spending more than $30 million to develop a reporting system that , among other things , is designed to enable the agency to apply its inspection resources to address those areas that pose the greatest risk to aviation safety .
