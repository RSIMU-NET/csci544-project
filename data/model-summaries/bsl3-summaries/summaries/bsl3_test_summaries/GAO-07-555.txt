you asked us to review ( 1 ) the progress that ssa has made in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the low - income subsidy ; ( 2 ) the processes that ssa uses to make eligibility determinations , resolve appeals , and conduct redeterminations for the subsidy ; and ( 3 ) the impact that the subsidy had on ssa's workload and other operations .
while the mma assigned the majority of the responsibilities for implementing medicare part d prescription drug program to the department of health and human services and its centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) , it charged the social security administration ( ssa ) with administering the low - income subsidy .
to help the elderly and disabled with these costs , the congress passed the medicare prescription drug , improvement , and modernization act ( mma ) of 2003 , which created a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit ( medicare part d ) .
this effort could also aid in developing more precise estimates of the eligible population and help to better inform the congress on legislative proposals to allow irs to share tax data with ssa to assist the agency with its outreach efforts .
