one question raised by this idea is whether the exclusion of aliens could be done by amending the federal census statutes ( title 13 of the u.s. code ) , or whether such action would require an amendment to the constitution .
in the 2010 census , as in prior decennial censuses , the total population of the united states was counted , including u.s. citizens , lawfully present aliens , and unauthorized aliens .
it appears one concern is that these individuals are included in the data used to apportion house seats among the states and determine voting districts within them , which some perceive as unfair to states or districts with small alien populations .
some have asked whether aliens , particularly those in the country unlawfully , should be excluded from the census count .
house proponents of this proposal failed in their attempt to have the house instruct its conferees for the cjs appropriations bill to retain the senate provision in their negotiations ; there had been no such provision in the house - passed version .
however , in the event that the ongoing issue of the presence of unauthorized aliens in the united states remains unresolved by congressional legislation or executive agency action , the issue of whether to exclude unauthorized aliens from census data for apportionment may arise with regard to guidelines for future decennial censuses and apportionments .
