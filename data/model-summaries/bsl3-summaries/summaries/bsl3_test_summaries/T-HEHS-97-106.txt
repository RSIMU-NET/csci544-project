the information presented today is based on our previous work and the most recent data on the benefits available from the health care financing administration ( hcfa ) , which manages medicare .
we are pleased to be here today to discuss medicare's skilled nursing facility ( snf ) , home health care , and inpatient rehabilitation benefits and the administration's forthcoming legislative proposals related to them .
snf payments rose from $2.8 billion in 1989 to $11.3 billion in 1996 , while home health care costs grew from $2.4 billion to $17.7 billion over the same period .
rehabilitation facility payments increased from $1.4 billion in 1989 to $3.9 billion in 1994 .
the administration's major proposals for both snfs and home health care are designed to give the providers of these services increased incentives to operate efficiently by moving them from a cost reimbursement to a prospective payment system .
earlier discharges from hospitals led to the substitution of days spent in snfs for what in the past would have been the last few days of hospital care ; use of ancillary services , such as physical therapy , in snfs has increased , and specific controls for these services have not been implemented ; rapid growth in the number of inpatient rehabilitation beds available and use of these beds by beneficiaries , as well as the likelihood of some substitution of rehabilitation days for general hospital days , led to higher expenditures for inpatient rehabilitation ; and a diminution of administrative controls over the benefits , resulting at least in part from fewer resources being available for such controls , reduced the likelihood of inappropriately submitted claims being denied .
