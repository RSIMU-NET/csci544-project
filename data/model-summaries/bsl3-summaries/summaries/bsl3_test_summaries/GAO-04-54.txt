interest in cabin air quality heightened in 2003 , with reports that a small number of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) infections may have occurred on board aircraft serving areas with sars outbreaks .
in 2001 , the national research council issued a report that assessed airborne contaminants in commercial aircraft , including an evaluation of their toxicity and associated health effects ; addressed cabin pressure ( oxygen supply ) and ventilation ; and recommended approaches to improving data on cabin air quality .
specifically , you asked us to address the following questions: ( 1 ) what is known about the major potential health effects of air quality in commercial airliner cabins on passengers and flight attendants ? .
 ( 3 ) what technologies are available today to improve the air quality in commercial airliner cabins , and which , if any , should be required ? .
specifically , our research focused on the following questions: ( 1 ) what is known about the major potential health effects of air quality in commercial airliner cabins on passengers and flight attendants ? .
the council report's 10 recommendations focused on five aspects of cabin air quality and its environment: ( 1 ) the establishment of cabin air quality surveillance and research programs , ( 2 ) faa's oversight of the operation of aircraft ventilation systems , ( 3 ) exposures on aircraft due to the transport of small animals in aircraft cabins , ( 4 ) distribution of health related information , and ( 5 ) recommended procedures as a result of a ventilation system shutdown .
