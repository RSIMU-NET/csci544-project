 ( 2 ) what have been the states' experiences in obtaining and using ccp grants to respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters ? .
the primary long - standing federal postdisaster grant program for helping states respond to short - term crisis counseling needs following disasters is the crisis counseling assistance and training program ( ccp ) , which is administered by dhs's federal emergency management agency ( fema ) and its federal partner , samhsa .
to address gaps identified by federal and state officials in the federal government's ability to help states respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters , we recommend that the secretary of homeland security direct the administrator of fema , in consultation with the administrator of samhsa , to expeditiously take the following two actions: determine what types of expanded crisis counseling services should be formally incorporated into ccp and make any necessary revisions to program policy , and revise ccp policy to allow states and service providers that receive ccp funds to use them for indirect costs .
although state practices may contribute to delays , extended federal reviews also may contribute to delays in states' ability to implement their ccps .
