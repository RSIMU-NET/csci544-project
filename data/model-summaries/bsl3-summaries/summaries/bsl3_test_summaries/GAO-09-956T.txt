as you know , to be competitive in the global economy , the united states relies heavily on innovation through research and development ( r&d ) .
the act established the sbir program to stimulate technological innovation , use small businesses to meet federal r&d needs , foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation , and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal r&d .
the act provided for a three - phased program: phase i to determine the feasibility and scientific and technical merit of a proposed research idea ; phase ii to further develop the idea ; and phase iii to commercialize the resulting product or process with no further sbir funding .
in 2005 awards from three agencies — the department of defense ( dod ) , national institutes of health ( nih ) , and national aeronautics and space agency ( nasa ) — accounted for the majority of sbir funds .
the sbir program is currently being considered by the congress for reauthorization , and both the house and senate have recently passed bills to reauthorize the program .
recognizing the potential of small businesses to be a source of significant innovation , the congress passed the small business innovation development act of 1982 .
