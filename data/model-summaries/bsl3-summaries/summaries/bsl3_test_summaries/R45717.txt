to do this , the report first examines historical trends in federal spending and revenue policy to illustrate both the challenges and trade - offs inherent to making choices between ( 1 ) limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods , ( 2 ) reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income , ( 3 ) reducing support for state and local governments , and ( 4 ) raising taxes .
the growth of the national debt , which is considered unsustainable under current policies , continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policymaking .
this report examines alternative approaches to reducing annual budget deficits and decisions about how to bring the national debt under control over the long term .
therefore , to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run , it is likely that ( 1 ) transfer payments , such as social security , medicare , and medicaid , to or on behalf of individuals ( which already account for half of federal spending and are growing ) must be reduced ; ( 2 ) transfers to state and local governments must be reduced ( which would shift the budget decisions to a different level of government ) ; ( 3 ) taxes must be raised ; or some combination of the three .
