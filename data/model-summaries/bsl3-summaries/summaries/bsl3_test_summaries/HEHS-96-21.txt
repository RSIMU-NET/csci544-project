specifically , we discuss ( 1 ) current trends in medicare beneficiary enrollment in hmos , ( 2 ) flaws in medicare's rate - setting method preventing medicare from realizing potential savings from hmos , ( 3 ) strategies to enable medicare to realize hmo savings , and ( 4 ) the health care financing administration's ( hcfa ) efforts to test hmo payment reforms .
in fact , medicare has paid health maintenance organizations ( hmo ) more for serving medicare beneficiaries than it would have spent , on average , had those same beneficiaries received care in the fee - for - service sector .
medicare has not yet harnessed the cost - saving potential of its managed care option .
proposals to reduce or even reverse these medicare losses have been discussed for roughly a decade .
lately , these proposals have received even more interest because of recent deficit reduction proposals aimed at slowing medicare spending growth by moving more beneficiaries into managed care .
the law sets hmo payments for comprehensive care at 95 percent of the estimated average cost ( to medicare ) of treating the patient in the fee - for - service sector .
