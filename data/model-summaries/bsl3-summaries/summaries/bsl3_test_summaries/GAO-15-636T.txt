i am pleased to be here today to provide some preliminary observations from our ongoing review of the environmental protection agency's ( epa ) science advisory board ( sab ) and the clean air scientific advisory committee ( casac ) .
as federal advisory committees , the sab and casac must comply with the federal advisory committee act ( faca ) and its implementing regulations .
we are carrying out this work for the senate committee on environment and public works and the house committee on science , space , and technology .
epa's written procedures for processing congressional committee requests to the sab are found in the sab charter and in the following two documents that establish general policies for how epa's federal advisory committees are to interact with outside parties: epa policy regarding communication between members of federal advisory committee act committees and parties outside of the epa ( the april 2014 policy ) , and clarifying epa policy regarding communications between members of scientific and technical federal advisory committees and outside parties ( the november 2014 policy clarification ) .
this testimony reflects our preliminary observations from our ongoing review that examines ( 1 ) the extent to which epa procedures for processing congressional committees' requests for scientific advice from the sab ensure compliance with erddaa and ( 2 ) the extent to which casac has provided advice related to naaqs .
