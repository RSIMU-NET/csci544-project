specifically , you asked us to assess the adequacy of internal controls over ( 1 ) grant and loan disbursements , ( 2 ) third party drafts , and ( 3 ) government purchase cards , and to determine if any fraudulent or otherwise improper payments were made in these areas .
the department of education has a history of financial management problems , including serious internal control weaknesses , which have affected education's ability to provide reliable financial information to decisionmakers both inside and outside the agency and to maintain the financial integrity of its operations .
because of this , we have designated education's student financial assistance programs as a high - risk area for waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
given the billions of dollars in payments made by education each year to recipients nationwide and abroad , these known deficiencies raise the risk that fraudulent or erroneous payments could make their way undetected through education's processes .
however , because the department has not effectively implemented its new policies , vulnerabilities remain .
you requested that we cover the period may 1998 through september 2000 during which time education disbursed $181.5 billion through these processes â€” $181.4 billion in grants and loans , $55 million in third party drafts , and $22 million in purchase card transactions .
