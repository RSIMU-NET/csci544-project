to be sure , ideas and recommendations for legislation come from a wide variety of sources , such as individual senators ; committees and other senate working groups ; legislative staff ; party and chamber leaders ; executive branch agencies and the white house ; states and localities ; members of the media ; citizens ; and interest groups .
to become law , a bill or joint resolution must pass both houses of congress in identical form ( including the same text and bill number ) and be signed by the president .
any or all of these individuals or entities may participate in drafting legislation , but only a senator may formally introduce legislation in the senate .
some common considerations taken into account when drafting a bill include the following: what problem does the bill seek to address ? .
support for a measure may also hinge on how its costs are paid for .
an abundance of information is available to senators in the form of reports , studies , and presentations offered by a wide range of individuals , groups , and organizations , including crs .
a measure with many cosponsors , especially if they include committee and party leaders , could encourage the relevant committee chair to take some action on the legislation , such as hold hearings on it .
