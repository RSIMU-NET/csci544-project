as agreed with the subcommittee , i will discuss the preparations under way at the government accountability office ( gao ) to meet our responsibilities under the presidential transition act to assist the incoming administration as well as the 111th congress .
the next congress and new administration will confront a set of pressing issues that will demand urgent attention and continuing oversight to ensure the nation's security and well - being .
in addition , this will be the first post - 9 / 11 transition , with a relatively new department of homeland security ( dhs ) grappling with the threats we face here at home while experiencing its first change in administration .
for example , we update our high - risk list with the start of each new congress to focus attention on areas in need of broad - based transformation or susceptible to waste , fraud , abuse , and mismanagement .
the 2009 presidential transition will be a unique and critical period for the united states .
the act specifically identifies gao as a source of briefings and other materials to help inform presidential appointees of the major management issues , risks , and challenges they will face .
