presidential signing statements are official pronouncements issued by the president contemporaneously to the signing of a bill into law that , in addition to commenting on the law generally , have been used to forward the president's interpretation of the statutory language ; to assert constitutional objections to the provisions contained therein ; and , concordantly , to announce that the provisions of the law will be administered in a manner that comports with the administration's conception of the president's constitutional prerogatives .
the number and scope of such assertions in the george w. bush administration in particular gave rise to extensive debate over the issuance of signing statements , with the american bar association ( aba ) publishing a report declaring that these instruments are "contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers" when they "claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of congress. .
however , in analyzing the constitutional basis for , and legal effect of , presidential signing statements , it becomes apparent that no constitutional or legal deficiencies adhere to the issuance of such statements in and of themselves .
