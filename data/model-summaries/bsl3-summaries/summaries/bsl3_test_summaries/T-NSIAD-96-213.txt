i am pleased to be here today to testify before this subcommittee on our work regarding efforts by the department of commerce , the u.s. export - import bank ( eximbank ) , and the small business administration ( sba ) to create a nationwide network of “one - stop shops,” called u.s .
export assistance centers ( useac ) .
this legislation also directed the u.s. & foreign commercial service — the commerce department agency responsible for managing its domestic field network — to utilize its district offices as “one - stop - shops.” these shops would be able to ( 1 ) provide exporters with information on all u.s. government export promotion and export finance services , ( 2 ) assist exporters in identifying which federal programs may be of greatest assistance , and ( 3 ) help exporters make contact with those federal programs .
partially in response to our work , congress enacted the export enhancement act of 1992 ( public law 102-429 , oct. 21 , 1992 ) , which created in statute the interagency trade promotion coordinating committee ( tpcc ) and tasked it with developing a strategic plan for strengthening federal export promotion services .
