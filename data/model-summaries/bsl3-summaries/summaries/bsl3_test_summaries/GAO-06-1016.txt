based on the congressional request letter of may 2005 and subsequent discussions with your staffs , we agreed to determine ( 1 ) what agencies have done to coordinate the implementation of the federal lands recreation enhancement act ( rea ) , including preparing for the new interagency federal lands pass ; ( 2 ) what agencies have done to implement the rea fee and amenity requirements and sufficiency of guidance for rea implementation ; ( 3 ) the extent to which the agencies have control and accounting procedures for collected recreation fee revenues ; ( 4 ) how participating agencies prioritize and approve activities and projects funded with fee revenues ; and ( 5 ) the extent to which units have unobligated fund balances and if recreational fees are being used to fund projects formerly funded with other appropriations .
over the past several years , congress has expressed concern about the operation and maintenance of federal recreation sites and the ability of federal land management agencies to continue providing visitors high - quality recreational opportunities , while at the same time protecting natural and other resources .
to help address these concerns , congress passed legislation in 1996 authorizing an experimental initiative called the recreational fee demonstration program ( fee demo ) , under which participating agencies were authorized to establish and collect recreation fees at a number of sites and to use the revenues to enhance visitor services , manage and protect resources , and reduce maintenance backlogs , among other uses .
