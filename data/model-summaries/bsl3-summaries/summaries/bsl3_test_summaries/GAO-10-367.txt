to strengthen gsa mas program pricing and management , we recommend that the administrator of the general services administration take the following eight actions: in coordination with the gsa inspector general , target the use of pre - award audits to cover more contracts that meet the audit threshold ; fully implement the process that has been initiated to ensure that vendors that meet the pre - negotiation clearance panel threshold receive a panel review ; when considering the mas advisory panel recommendations to clarify the price objective and eliminate the price reduction clause , ensure that any alternative means to negotiate and determine best prices are validated and in place before eliminating these pricing provisions , collect transactional data on mas orders and prices paid , possibly through the expanded use of existing electronic tools or through a pilot data collection initiative for selected mas schedules and make the information available to mas contract negotiators and customer agencies , establish more consistent performance measures across the mas program , including measures for pricing ; take steps to increase the mas customer survey response rate by using a methodologically sound means to identify bona fide program users and employing survey techniques that produce meaningful and actionable information that can lead to program improvements ; clarify and strengthen the mas program office's charter and authority so that it has clear roles and responsibilities to consistently implement guidance , policies , and best practices across gsa's acquisition centers including policies and practices related to the above recommendations ; and report gsa's plans to address these recommendations to the administrator of the office of federal procurement policy .
