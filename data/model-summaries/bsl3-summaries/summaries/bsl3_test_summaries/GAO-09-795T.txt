as agreed , the report ( 1 ) identified how many minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have applied for and received allocations and how much they have applied for and received from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 2 ) explained the nmtc application process and summarized nmtc application scores for minority and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes by cde type from 2005 through 2008 ; ( 3 ) described the challenges minority - owned or controlled and non - minority - owned or controlled cdes have faced in applying for and receiving nmtc allocations ; and ( 4 ) identified efforts the cdfi fund and others are taking to assist minority - owned or controlled cdes in applying for nmtc allocations .
congress created the nmtc through the community renewal tax relief act of 2000 to encourage investors to make investments in low - income communities that traditionally lack access to capital .
our prior mandated work on the nmtc has focused on the implementation of the program , the effect of the credit on the behavior of individual and corporate investors , and efforts by the cdfi fund and internal revenue service ( irs ) to ensure that cdes and investors are in compliance with nmtc program requirements .
