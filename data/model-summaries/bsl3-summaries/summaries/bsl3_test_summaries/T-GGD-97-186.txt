taxpayers and congress have expressed concerns with how the internal revenue service ( irs ) treats taxpayers in audits and whether audits are too burdensome .
based on its ongoing and previous work , gao makes the following points on these issues: irs has limited data on both the treatment of taxpayers and the burdens imposed on them during audits .
similarly , irs has no comprehensive definition of , and little data on , the burden its audits impose on taxpayers .
one measure of audit performance is how much additional tax is recommended .
irs has recently developed a survey that will ask individual taxpayers about their satisfaction with various parts of the audit process but results will not be available until 1998 .
gao also found that irs' use of financial status techniques has not increased in recent years .
irs has various indicators and standards on audit performance .
to ensure adherence to the standards , irs relies on oversight by the auditors' managers .
the standards focus on the efficient use of auditors' time and not on when they should use particular audit techniques .
irs recently created a system to track taxpayers' complaints about improper treatment but irs does not solicit input on all improper treatment .
