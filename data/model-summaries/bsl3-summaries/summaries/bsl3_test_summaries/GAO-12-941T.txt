this testimony discusses: ( 1 ) dhs's efforts to complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the united states at ports of entry , ( 2 ) observations from our past work that may help dhs as it considers options for deploying new technologies to refurbish or replace existing portal monitors when they reach the end of their expected service lives , and ( 3 ) our assessment of the extent to which dhs has addressed our prior recommendations .
however , it did not ( 1 ) identify funding necessary to achieve plan objectives or ( 2 ) establish monitoring mechanisms to determine progress and identify needed improvements .
i am pleased to be here today to discuss the efforts of the department of homeland security's ( dhs ) domestic nuclear detection office ( dndo ) to develop and deploy a global nuclear detection architecture ( gnda ) — an integrated system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities to combat nuclear smuggling in foreign countries , at the u.s. border , and inside the united states — and to provide an update on the deployment of radiation detection equipment at u.s. borders .
