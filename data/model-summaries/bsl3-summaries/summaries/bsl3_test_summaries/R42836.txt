various water supply shortages and greater demand for water supply related to energy development projects have brought increased attention to disputes over the control of water resources across the country .
for example , new applications of energy extraction technologies have increased oil and gas production from shale formations in various regions of the united states .
in particular , the demand for water supply to develop energy in the northern plains states has raised controversy over water use in the missouri river basin .
it examines the relevant constitutional and statutory authority of the corps to operate federal water projects , including the water supply act of 1958 ( wsa ) and the flood control act of 1944 ( 1944 fca ) .
access to water for energy development purposes has created tension between federal and state interests when stakeholders seek access to freshwater from federal water projects .
this dual exercise of authority over water resources has led to questions over the corps' proposed actions at its missouri river reservoirs .
in recent years , the u.s. army corps of engineers ( corps ) , which controls lake sakakawea and five other mainstem missouri river reservoirs , has identified surplus water in these reservoirs and considered how it would contract with industrial and municipal users interested in the temporary use of this water .
