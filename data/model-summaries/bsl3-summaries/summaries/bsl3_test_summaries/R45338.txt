from the ear liest days of commercial radio , the federal communications commission ( fcc ) and its predecessor , the federal radio commission , have encouraged diversity in broadcasting .
the fcc's policies seek to encourage four distinct types of diversity in local broadcast media: diversity of viewpoints , as reflected in the availability of media content reflecting a variety of perspectives ; diversity of programming , as indicated by a variety of formats and content , including programming aimed at various minority and ethnic groups ; outlet diversity , to ensure the presence of multiple independently owned media outlets within a geographic market ; and minority and female ownership of broadcast media outlets .
in addition to promoting diversity , the fcc aims , with its broadcast media ownership rules , to promote localism and competition by restricting the number of media outlets that a single entity may own or control within a geographic market and , in the case of broadcast television stations , nationwide .
in 2016 , the fcc adopted a new order ( 2016 diversity order ) containing rules designed to increase broadcast ownership diversity .
localism addresses whether broadcast stations are responsive to the needs and interests of their communities .
