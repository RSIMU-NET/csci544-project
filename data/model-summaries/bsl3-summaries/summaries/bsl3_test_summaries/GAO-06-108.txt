as agreed with your offices , we are providing information on: ( 1 ) examples of strategies being used to help tanf recipients increase their incomes through employment ; ( 2 ) the key factors related to implementing and operating such strategies ; and ( 3 ) the actions hhs has taken to facilitate the use of these strategies .
the centerpiece of this legislation is the temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant , under which states receive federal funds to design and operate their own welfare programs within federal guidelines .
since states have implemented welfare reforms , they have spent almost $200 billion in federal and state tanf funds to meet the broad goals of the law , including ending the dependence of low - income parents on government benefits through job preparation , work , and marriage .
generally , tanf agencies administer core tanf program activities , such as determining eligibility for and providing income support ; assessing client needs and employability ; referring clients to services ; and monitoring client activities ; in some cases the tanf agency also directly provides employment - related services .
to address the first two questions , we identified through research and referrals officials with expertise in welfare - to - work strategies and who represented diverse perspectives .
