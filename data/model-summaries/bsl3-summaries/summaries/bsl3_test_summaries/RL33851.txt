the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) has helped over 3.69 million afghan refugees return to afghanistan since march of 2002 , marking the largest assisted return operation in unhcr's history .
issues of particular concern to the 110 th congress are 1 ) continuing and sustaining refugee returns as part of afghanistan's overall reconstruction ; 2 ) developing funding strategies for the next phase of afghanistan's remaining refugees ; and 3 ) examining the refugee situation in light of border security issues , particularly with regard to pakistan's recently announced plan to lay land mines and build a fence along its border with afghanistan .
in addition , more than a million refugees have returned to afghanistan without availing themselves of unhcr's assistance ( also known as "spontaneous returns" ) bringing the total number of returnees to 4.8 million or more .
almost all of these afghans have returned from neighboring iran and pakistan , where the vast majority of afghan refugees have lived for well over two decades ( see table 1 ) .
the success of the repatriation program thus depends on the success of the overall reconstruction effort in afghanistan , including the extent to which returned refugees ( and idps ) are integrated into reconstruction efforts .
