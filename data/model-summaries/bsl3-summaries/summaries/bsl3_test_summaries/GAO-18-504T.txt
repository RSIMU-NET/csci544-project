today i will provide information from our ongoing and prior work , focusing on ( 1 ) snap e&t programs , including program participants , design , and fns oversight , and ( 2 ) fns's efforts to address program integrity , including improper payments and snap recipient and retailer fraud .
jointly administered by usda's food and nutrition service ( fns ) and the states , snap helps low - income households obtain a better diet by providing them with benefits to purchase food from authorized retailers .
thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our work on the u.s. department of agriculture's ( usda ) supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ) â€” the largest federally - funded nutrition assistance program .
fns is responsible for authorizing and monitoring retailers from which recipients may purchase food , and states are responsible for determining applicant eligibility and investigating possible program violations by recipients .
in fiscal year 2017 , snap provided approximately $63 billion in benefits to about 42 million individuals in over 20 million households .
we also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations ; reviewed guidance and research from fns ; interviewed fns officials , as well as select state and local snap e&t staff from five states ; and reviewed our prior work on snap e&t programs .
